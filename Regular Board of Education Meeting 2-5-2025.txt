buyers I'm sorry Tera buyers followed by RaeLynn Dooley you'll have to you have one minute to be here with you all tonight and I'm going to be talking about teaching up and what that means at our campus so our principal attended a PLC about this concept we were looking at our data and our data hadn't been improving and so teachers were sort of on board when we realized what we've been doing hadn't been working and so we talked about this idea of teaching up we discussed the idea that if we always remediate students are never going to have the chance to catch up and so we decided that what we would do is go back kind of to standards base learning making sure that we were doing development around this and helping teachers with this and recognizing that we

[00:06:00]
making sure that we're only remediating and doing that very in a targeted way during our intervention block the rest of the time should be dedicated to grade level standards for all students so we're teaching up I appreciate your time thank you very much thank you ma'am our next speaker is RaeLynn Dooley followed by Julie true when you begin speaking you'll have one minute good evening my name is RaeLynn Julian and I'm the proud principal of Barcelona Elementary in South Valley I'm excited to share the great work we've been doing as part of an elementary principal PLC spearheaded by Miss Sharon Elgin last year I collaborated with Miss Julie Trujillo one of our exceptional kindergarten teachers to try something new teaching to the Top This approach focuses on providing all students with rigorous grade level instruction while offering targeted and interventions the elementary principal PLC has been invaluable and supporting this shift allowing me to connect with other principals and share best practices we're already seeing impressive

[00:07:00]
72% proficient in reading and 91% in math at mom this momentum is continued into first grade they focusing on strong first teach practices and Scaffolding up we've helped our students build resilience and confidence engagement and motivation and our classrooms are higher than ever which is in correlation with goals 1 and 4 I'm excited for what's ahead and can't wait for you to hear more from Mr Hill and Miss Erin my ass about this journey thank you our next speaker is Julie true followed by Aaron maestas Julie you have one minute once you begin speaking I'm missing you miss Julie just spoke about my classroom initially I was concentrating on our lowest performing students after collaborating with Miss Julie we realized that our school already had strong interventions in place for them the challenge was to focus on the green students and those performing at above or grade level is changing my mind set to POS

[00:08:00]
results rather than repeating lessons or simplifying lessons to accommodate the lowest performing students I align my teaching to consistently teach grade level standards using District approved high-quality instructions I created environment that pushed my students to excel which also provided scaffolding for those needing additional support I didn't hold the class back but instead scaffold up ensuring that every student who are struggling received the help they needed while our high performers were challenged to go further data-driven decisions were key to the success I implemented small group centers that allow me to reteach Concepts and differentiate instructions I use pre and post assessments with us and I ready to better Target our instruction and track progress efforts resulted in an amazing data thank you thank you ma'am for next speaker is Aaron my last test followed by Daniel Toya good evening my name is Aaron my Estes and I have been with I am currently on to be the transformational elementary we have the privilege of supporting

[00:09:00]
this shift was initially driven by an extensive data analysis of a school-wide data through which principle dually the instructional Council and I created a strategic rollout plan aligned with our 9010 a key element of this rollout was weekly collaboration with grade level teams and myself focusing on teaching to the top using our district approved high-quality instructional materials in the past our collaboration time as primarily addressing the needs of struggling students the focus was based on moving the low-achieving students forward but in doing so we saw the rest of our students begin to regress this year we shifted our mindset to prepare my mind set to prioritize best practices for all students which spark Richard conversations about scaffolding instruction upward rather than downward teachers have embraced the idea of allowing students to experience the necessary struggle for growth which has been incredibly empowering the overall alignment of supports at the district created a cohesive meaningful experience for school community and I'm proud to be part of it thank you thank you

[00:10:00]
our next speaker is Daniel Tafoya followed up by Angelica Portofino no Portillo I am tired of APs ignoring on special ed incidents that are happening in sex classes on September 4th I reported it principal dragging a student out of the school this kid is still being registered at that school 5 minutes is not doing nothing about it and no proper investigation was done by APA police two weeks ago I reported and EA falling asleep with a medication bottle by her death pictures have been taking nothing done I reported a teacher throwing a chair pulling it from a kid throwing it across the room again nothing done I am tired of reporting cases happening in special ed classes in APS 3 nothing about it and APS police retelling against whistleblowers this is out of hand and he needs to stop

[00:11:00]
you have one minute once you begin speaking my name is Angie Portillo and I'm the principal about elementary I told me how we are committed to providing an inclusive and rigorous learning environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed one of the key strategies we are implementing the second part of the years teaching to the Top This approach is proactive research base is specifically designed to close learning apps want to maintaining high expectations for all students regardless of their background or individuals by teaching to the top we said hi academic standards for all of our students including IEP students English Learners and our population this strategy allows us to provide differentiated support that ensures that all students are challenged and engaged in meaningful learning scaffolding and resources needed

[00:12:00]
whether students are learning English have individuals learning plans from diverse backgrounds teaching to the top supports their growth by meeting where they are and encouraging them to rise to their fullest potential we believe that by focusing on high expectations and providing the right support we can close the achievement gaps and every student to reach success I have to stop you there please finish up in one very quick sentence thank everyone I look forward to hearing my teachers explain a little bit more and what they're doing thank you thank you man our next speaker is Yvonne Salazar and that will be on zoo yes I'm here okay you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening Gordon membership

play to continue this work in alignment with aps's vision thank you ma'am or next speaker is Isaac Ibotta you have limited when she began speaking hello my name is Isaac Ibarra I am the fifth grade language teacher at Armijo Elementary and since we've been teaching up we've been using a lot of different scaffolding strategies to help all students achieve a grade level work we do things like input words have been doing a lot of cross collaboration between grade levels so the 5th graders will partner up with first graders and with them once a month just to get them just enjoy reading we do a lot of with grade level collaboration and then vertical alignment as well we tend to the we believe that scaffolding for all students just gives everybody access much like if you build a wheelchair ramp anybody can walk up that

[00:20:00]
so pretty much the biggest compliment I get for my students is that they want to come to school and I think we see that they want to thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Dr Christine mirror followed by Ron Muir talked to Mary have one minute once you begin speaking good evening I just recently retired from APS as the executive director for student family community supports Division I was also a middle school and high school health education teacher in Albuquerque Public Schools and I worked for the public education department and develop the standards and benchmarks and performance standards as well as advocated for the graduation requirement for health education I'm here to request that you reconsider the decision made by you all on January 15th to move health education graduation requirement to 8th grade their major differences in the health

[00:21:00]
Asian standards and benchmarks for example inappropriate touch and Middle School versus date rape in high school there's also a major developmental differences between them and there's risk behavior differences for example in the Middle School survey for APS active sexually active they're 5.7 percent Middle School Kids versus 20 over 20% of our high school kids so please reconsider moving health education to 8th grade and keep it in 9th grade thank you thank you again sir good evening board I'm here to ask you to seriously consider back to the 9th grade education teacher an APS for 34 years and I can tell you

[00:22:00]
without a doubt that the 9th grade health education curriculum and performance standards are not for 8th graders 8th graders lack of maturity skills and understanding for the serious content required in 9th grade teaching about suicide prevention drugs anorexia bulimia so forth it was very frustrating to listen to the aps administrators at the January 15th board meeting misinformed the board about the vast difference between 8 and 9/8 education standards why wasn't it health educator on that panel I'm concerned that the guard rails which you have printed over here were violated number one and four decision to move health education graduation requirement to 8th grade health education is a class for students learn about the literacy and understand wrap around supports so please please take the time and reconsider your vote from moving 8th grade

[00:23:00]
play back to 8th grade health education thank you thank you sir our next speaker is on Zoom Miss Patsy Nelson patio are you there yes I'm here thank you again period and health education Review Committee and had no idea that this recommendation was being considered in high school health education includes health literacy and APS has a goal focus on

[00:24:00]
leaving the skills habits and mindsets necessary for Success strong health literacy skills which are included in health Ed habits and mindset should be part of the entire K through 12 health education program for youth who began a career explanation and Readiness in high school health education often serves as a critical launched into Medical Careers and a bridge to the importance of other courses I again respectfully request that you reconsider your decision thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on zoo Nancy Rodriguez and so are you there I'm here thank you you have one minute good evening board members and superintendent Blakey my name is Nancy Rodriguez I'm the executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for school base Healthcare and I'm here like the previous speakers to speak about the health education requirement our organizations mission is to

[00:25:00]
is that the school-based health centers across the state of New Mexico as well as collaborate with other partners to promote facilitate an advocate for comprehensive integrated and culturally appropriate Health Care as well as health education in schools all school board members should have received a letter from us yesterday urging you to reconsider your vote to move the required health education class from 9 to 8 grade we strongly believe that health education is a critical part of the high school education and we hear regularly from the 17 plus School base health centers in the district as well as many School nurses in the district about the ways in which health literacy is important to students Health outcomes and academic outcomes We Stand ready to support you with any feedback from the community that you meet may need if you opt to reconsider this decision and we urge you to do so thank you for your time and attention thank you ma'am our next speaker is Margie Weinberg Wine Bar

[00:26:00]
and she'll be on Zoom Margie are you there hello thank you period

[00:27:00]
kids even 8:00 to 9th grade and so I again encourage you to look at the health education standards and think about having health education remain within the high school curriculum the students are very different in the very different things and so thank you for your time and attention thank you ma'am our next speaker is Taylor Petersen Taylor are you there yeah I'm here okay Taylor you have one minute my name is 15 years old I can't help but notice something is unfair in our education system Public Schools receive funding for every student does not follow the students at the school that means family is like to homeschool

[00:28:00]
receive nothing despite paying taxes just like everyone else but this isn't just about homeschooling if I ever decide to return to public school I believe that I should have the right to attend whatever APS school I choose no matter where I live maybe I have a friend there or maybe that school offers a better curriculum that fits my learning style why should my ZIP code determine my education right now public schools tell students they can only choose their extracurricular sports clubs and bands for why can't we have a choice instead education isn't a one size fits all and all the students should be able to attend the best school for them not just the one they're assigned to thank you very much time thank you ma'am our next speaker is Michaela Peterson she is also on them Michaela maybe saying that wrong and

[00:29:00]
I apologize you have one minute once again speaking okay thank you good evening I am a parent in the district I would like to ask you to audit current materials that are harming kids in our district there's over 3,000 books in APS schools that contain sexually explicit content that violates existing APS policies and FCC guidelines so research shows that early exposure to sexually explicit materials leads to an increased risk of mental health issues unhealthy bodily just actions on relationships and there's a higher susceptibility to risky behaviors so this isn't just a policy issue it's a child safety issue here are apses currently out of compliance in its own policies you have the employee technology acceptable use policy APS staff are banned from storing or sharing explicit content so why should students be supplied and have access to any explicit content on public school property

[00:30:00]
any form when teachers aren't allowed to appropriately even your student dress code students can't wear clothing with profanity or sexual images among other restrictions but they can't check out books with explicit content the sex ed materials must be medically accurate and age appropriate and many of these books do not meet that standard and lastly Title Nine compliance so schools must provide a safe learning environment and exposure to Violent explicit materials creates a hostile environment an increase of psychological 15 seconds to just conduct a full transparent review of all sexually themed materials and maybe create a policy that defines what's appropriate for kids in our schools it's about protecting our kids thank you our next speaker is Casey Peterson yes ok Google

[00:31:00]
okay so there's about $130 million books that have been put into print and published throughout all history obviously all those books are created equally obviously if there's only you know a few thousand in APS we should be very selective and this has been brought up so many times some of these books are so egregious and it's something that's absurd we all know what's wrong people on the board I know that there's people there that could head this head this up and push for putting some sort of standards in place and the books are so egregious that I feel like we should just come each and every time there's a meeting and read excerpts from them but it feels disgusting doing so because there are kids tuned into this but it's kind of like what else do you do it's one of those things that so common sense that we should put some standards in place some broadcasting standards adopting those in classrooms you can make small exemptions for sex education and small things like that but we are way past that is books and

[00:32:00]
look back at this point in history and it's just going to be so shameful when you realize how obvious it is that we should have some type of standards in place thank you thank you for members I actually skip someone earlier so I'm going to call on Maria I believe how to release and you'll have one minute once you begin speaking now I am a resource teacher at a meho Elementary's to proactively close learning high expectations for every focus on shifting from remediation time support insurance without being held back by past learning apps rather than teaching skills and isolation we provide targeted interventions that integrate heels integrate level

[00:33:00]
construction will also supporting the implementation of inclusive practices for us to levels in a research setting this looks like preaching key Concepts on vocabulary aligned with our 90-day plan this strategy reinforces cable vocabulary across all grade levels in both English and Spanish strategic scaffolding strategies initial symptoms and to enhance comprehension for all Learners so by implementing to the top and we are in students to assess challenging content build Independence and driving their educational students thank you for being so patient our next speaker is Ben Luna followed by Mary Mary Donald Trump signed an executive order

[00:34:00]
ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schools on January 29th 2025 which seeks to stop Federal funding for schools that enforce transgender policy or anti-American ideologies including education based on gender ideology I will be interviewing counselors teachers and staff this week don't feel comfortable don't feel like they could come in the open about not agreeing with these four gender ideologies in public schools in some staff experience trauma in schools through for compliance by other adults about alternative names and pronouns which don't align with the students birth certificate or enrollment forms this is a cool religion meaning force in public schools which are state funded if it's a state-funded cold religion then we have a state endorsed Church operating in public schools which is unconstitutional I hope change in school policy can be seen by the school board thank you sir our next

[00:35:00]

need to cry listening to the teachers talk about what they have done and the just amazing success that has been demonstrated through this report so well done to you guys and well done to the staff and the teachers and everybody out in the schools for for what you're doing and my question is is that we we often hear about strategies that are very very high level right and I think that this might actually tie into some of the things that are teachers were saying earlier but very specifically I would like to know what is the strategy you guys are using to improve teacher practice around reading instruction in first and second grade thank you

[00:53:00]
president Danielle Gonzales in superintendent Blakey thank you for that question that's something that actually is near and dear to my heart in terms of this kind of work and I see and I appreciate you recognizing the teachers that spoke this evening because they are doing this work and they're doing it quite well on the way that we're supporting professional development and learning for our teachers is that first and foremost we started a year introducing a new curriculum and we provided opportunities for our teachers to engage in an understanding about the implementation and use of that curriculum they've done a remarkable job giving that they've only had two days for professional development over the course of the year because we have two days for professional development

[00:54:00]
the principals at their schools are leading that in the initiatives in order to continue to use high-quality instructional materials but they're also really focusing on accelerated learning which simply means that they're Teaching grade-level Standards and their combining professional development both in their schools in the professional development that the we are providing through teaching and learning both around learning curriculum and the units of study and the implementation of the units of study those are the other thing that we are doing Beyond just the classroom teacher all roll groups that support literacy instructions in our schools receive the same training that our teachers receive we want to do that because we want to ensure that we have

[00:55:00]
Karen's across instructional practices and so they received the same types of the same training they attended all of the Sabbath trainings those the other thing that those individuals outside of the classroom they have access to all of the curricular resources that are teachers have so again the goal is that everyone is using the same materials in order to support our students with regard to support for our teachers in special education settings all of the those teachers receive Aspire and Wilson training in order to support the students when they are receiving in the classroom the the resource teachers at in our special education department beyond the professional development

[00:56:00]
they also provide observation feedback and they work with the teachers to ensure that their ongoing monitoring of student performance is is being looked at and they're using that data analysis to inform their instructions so we have the resource teachers in our special education department that provide that continued support back to the high quality curriculum service this year the other thing that we are doing we have learning Labs at and the learning labs are not a location but rather than they're a classroom within a school we have 30 teams that participated in this additional professional development learning so that they would build their expertise and they would serve as

[00:57:00]
two other teachers at this point the expectation or the goal is that the learning lab teachers are resources for the teachers in their building and what we have encouraged is that teachers from other schools could come and observe one of these expert teachers the really see what the implementation of the service curriculum looks like because we know curriculums only work when they are implemented the way they're supposed to be implemented the other thing that I want to highlight that is important is that we also have an articulation from pre-k all the way through fifth grade so our Pre-K students are also using a Savage curriculum it's called

[00:58:00]
kindergarten program and it's it's the beginning of promoting early literacy skills a lot of that is done through play and also for the use of really engaging children's literature and finally at the kindergarten level we use Waterford that's an intervention also aligned with the standards and with the Sabbath program so our efforts are intended to begin with our earliest Learners in public schools through the the I work with them at the elementary level there are a couple of other things that I want to highlight in terms of helping Builders knowledge one is that the units of study we had a group of teachers last summer develop our units of studying to the

[00:59:00]
priority standards those units of study are designed to work in concert with the service curriculum and we know that they're not directly aligned because they're they are aligned let me restate that there but they're not sequential in the same way and that's because we know that the standards are are the way that we provide instructions that's what we're wanting acquired the understanding of the standards and when we adopt a new curriculum the long-term goal is that all of our teachers are going to be experts in understanding standards so when we adopt a new curriculum they're going to be prepared to take that with our units of study and then lastly something that I

[01:00:00]
I'm really excited about we have our unified support team with under Ms jet the she had a request when we when I started that we bring coherence to the word and we had incredible resource teachers that are developing professional development but what I didn't see was the connection amongst them and so we developed the unified support team those resource teachers represent all of the resource teachers in all of our departments and teaching and learning from special ed lce Indian education technology and the teaching and learning the teachers from teaching and learning they work in groups if you will and they provide support right now to our priority schools they have gone to the schools Dot

[01:01:00]
empathy interviews with the principles that it's really an needs assessment they also survey the teachers and based on all of that information in and the data about the school and what they know about the 90-day plan the unified resource teachers are developing a plan of support for our priority schools that plan includes a small group whole group PLC or grade level professional development and what we're seeing an increase in a request from modeling in their classroom Partnerships and trusting relationships fantastic I don't think anybody else needs to ask questions thank you I really I mean I can tell that you're very

[01:02:00]
passionate about what you're doing and I really really appreciate it and so thank you for like like you you answered my question very robustly I appreciate it and for anybody who's watching at home I like the number are mid-year for first grade is 24% the goal is 23 so I'm really hoping that this portends a shift in the slope of the curve and that will really taking off from here so well done thank you for answering my question and keep up the good work yes thank you for your service for first graders my question period so could you give me some examples on how we're creating comprehension

[01:03:00]
in the first grade readers and working on those steps thank you board member comma retail board member president Gonzalez and Dr Blakey you know the one of the things that we have been talking about with our teachers and with our resource teachers and with our principals is about comprehension we need to provide opportunities for students to engage with text and when students are engaging with text the expectation is the teachers are developing questions and using questioning strategies in order to engage the kids in an understanding of what they are reading we want them to also engage students so that

[01:04:00]
that connection between writing and reading and spelling and the development of vocabulary all of those foundational skills that a student needs to develop help them understand what they're reading and so as we focus on the the data that we have with regard to the the need for developing foundational skills were also emphasizing the importance of spending time actually engaging students in the reading process aside from the development of the skills we have to engage them in those moments when they're reading the books and join the books and then making connections with the books when we bring in culturally responsive resources that represent the students in our classrooms

[01:05:00]
students are more likely to be engaged with the text if they see themselves it represented in the text so it's a combination of bringing resources into the classroom that students have access to engaging them in the right reading of the text themselves or as in I was the first grade teacher so you begin with reading the books to them and over a period of the year the students develop the skill set in order to read for themselves by themselves but throughout that entire process the students have to be engaged to questioning through activities to see the connections and then develop the skills in order to talk about the connections that are made when we do that we will see that gap between the

[01:06:00]
development and the application through incomprehension increase can you also let me just give me another example when you have a child first language other than English how are you incorporating that you know my I have siblings that their first language was Spanish and so the having a resources in both languages is important I'm having someone in the school setting it doesn't necessarily have to be the teacher but someone in the school setting who speaks the language of the child so that as students are being a cultivated in to a system where English is the primary language they also have Role Models where they

[01:07:00]
have someone that can read with them read to them and apply those same strategies that I mentioned that are necessary for developing comprehension skills so we have to have that but then we have resources for example of a new resource in APS it's called Surah their books that families can access online the books the cool thing about Sora is that you can click on a on a magic link and a suddenly the book is in the language that for that child so we're doing everything that we can to make the materials that are available to our children available in multiple languages of the

[01:08:00]
students we have to know the students first we have to humanize the student first once we do that we're able to really attend to their academic identity but we have to start with who they who they are and bring those resources in and the people just thank you thank you thank you and I'd like to do the appreciation for my fellow board members for the quality of the work for the quality of your presentation and response but also for the quality and depths of response to the questions that were submitted in advance just so folks know the report that we got back with q and A's was over 25 pages so I know that was not a lights left so just thank you for that work it was so comprehensive but I think remember Jackson's Point there's not many questions to ask but will ask mine to give an opportunity for

[01:09:00]
you need to add anything on top so according to the progress monitoring report and in particular the section on evidence and planned actions there were indicated several strategies including just write reader and Amira to meet the goal but what I did not see in the report was what you were doing with core instruction in particular with using the new high quality instructional materials so you spoke specifically to those materials when you answered remember Jackson's questions so thank you for that so I heard in particular professional learning to the curriculum curriculum specific coaching walkthroughs plec's teacher enroll groups getting the same training learning Labs Pre-K also getting kindergarten and then connection amongst the resource teachers is there anything else specifically related to core instruction that you what strategies is the district using related for instruction that

[01:10:00]
you can attribute these improvements to and how are you working to spread and deepen those strategies well I think I would Echo what the teachers were talking about they're using the curriculums they're learning how to use the service resources but the other thing that we're recognizing is the importance of using interventions that are available and when the interventions are being used we look at the court is at their first teach when the teachers are using the interventions that supplemental work when the interview because the interventions are directly aligned with the Core Curriculum then our students are getting have two opportunities won the face-to-face work with the teacher and the other is through the

[01:11:00]
the intervention supports whatever those are and we have we have quite a number that can that students can access a mirror is one that I mentioned it's those it's that combination of the two when we do that consistently and make those an important for students have access to that I I honestly believe that what I've seen in this song from beginning of the year to the middle of the year and the work that I have actually witnessed through the PLC we can leverage that across all of our schools and in fact are PLC principals are going to help do that by teaching what they have learned to our other principles so back to the support specifically to anything else with Papa's

[01:12:00]
are any of our curriculums for that matter whether it's Ela and that's what we focus on for Bowl one but it's all of our curriculums we have to ensure that our teachers understand them and so we have to provide the support in order to help them understand how to best use the curriculums and then rely on their expertise and their knowledge about the art of teaching to bring those pieces together while they really understand their students everything I would say in terms of the improvements that I believe we are seeing the connection that we have with both for we talk about we have both are students really understand who they are and develop themselves as an individual but if we don't also

[01:13:00]
intentionally and purposefully focus on the teaching the instruction I'm feeling good is only going to last for a while and so we're we're that relationship between goal one and goal for the understanding of the resources and then the other supplemental resources that are available to teachers to take advantage of those supplemental resources because it's through the the combination of all of that that the students become more excited about learning thank you for that and in particular or what you're doing on the court instruction I continue to hear a lot around tier 2 and supplemental and interventions so it's helpful just to understand it specifically on tier one first teach instructions obviously we are seeing or not

[01:14:00]
we are seeing improvements in Reading in early literacy we don't know if it's causal yet Perhaps but I'm curious what do we know around the extent to which teachers are now using grade level instructional materials I know when we started this process with adopting the Strategic plan there is that prior diagnostic it was like 30% classrooms were so can you share a little bit more around what data you have around how that stands now thank you for that question good evening board members good evening Dr Blakey we are referring to guardrail 3.1 and so you know looking at some of the work that associate superintendent will gain is reference particularly around accelerated learning and making sure we are teaching to the standards we are working on helping the people who are in the classrooms recognize what that looks

[01:15:00]
like and we are in the process of that I don't have an updated data set for you regarding the growth around that particular guard rail however the impact of accelerated learning I liked how it was referred to this evening as teaching to the top we've been talking about teaching up this is a really critical component of what we believe is going to make growth not only in gold one but across our goals and making sure that our students are having daily regular access to grade level materials with the just in time supports that are going to help them understand what is happening if they do have gas and so we do look forward to exploring that more and also a really appreciate what associate superintendent old game is doing around sharing these best practices across the schools via the principals but then also I heard

[01:16:00]
play teachers beginning to talk about it too and be really excited so I am looking forward to bringing that guard rail forward and seeing an increase in the use of our high quality instructional materials do you have any questions I'd like to say I love that we are marrying a gold one with gold four I think you're right that you have to have a sense of belonging to be open to the academic aspect but the academics also feed into that sense of belonging and that sense of accomplishment when you're able to master something and so and I want to give a shout out to Mr Mark Garcia

[01:17:00]
first introduced that marriage when we were looking at I think it was post-secondary Readiness last year sometime and so I'm glad that it's been applied in other goals my question has to do with something that and I have to recognize Dr Harold Bailey who passed away recently and he was here on October 2nd during public forum he is concerned that was about the over-representation of black specials but in general our African-American students academic while being so my question is this what specific data-driven

[01:18:00]
insights on African-American and Martinez Yazzie targeted students and what route analysis inform current adult inputs that you have laid out for us tonight thank you board member Dominguez for your question board members you know the the thing that we are doing is taking advantage of the and access access access the visualizations in our sapper site first and foremost we're using that to disaggregate the data to understand where are the students are needing the greatest amount of support and with our African-American students one of the

[01:19:00]
bands that was identified that had to do with text fluency and vocabulary development those are skills that we can if we look back and try and do some analysis about that it's related to the foundational skills like phonemic awareness phonological awareness alphabetic recognition sound at the understanding the alphabetic sounds so we we know where the what the date is telling us about where the our African-American students are struggling I would say to you that the same data set is very similar to what I'm saying with regard to our other students who are at risk for not receiving instructions at grade level so the strategy

[01:20:00]
first and foremost is that we have to expose all of our students to grade level instruction when they don't have access to a grade level instruction will continue unfortunately to see the same level of progress and that's not acceptable for me so we have to look at the the it's it goes back to the culturally responsive strategies ensuring that the students see themselves that we're providing explicit intentional instruction for all students that we're ensuring that the students have the opportunity to actually engage in the learning process they have to be active participants in the learning process and so it's those types of

[01:21:00]
things that we have to work on I also recognize and understand that sometimes implicit biases affect what's happening in and so we see not purposefully but a belief that the students can't we have to change that belief and I think you heard today from the teachers that are working in the PLC in particular one of the teachers who when she spoke at I was at her school and she said I was reluctant to change anything I thought my practices were working and she realized that when she became part of a collective effort at the school where they changed their mind set to

[01:22:00]
that it changed her teaching practices so when we even that simple thing a belief that everyone can change his teaching practices and so we begin their to ensure that all of our students receive the kinds of instruction and opportunities that we we know our teachers are capable of doing and providing thank you but I have a follow-up so you mentioned disaggregated data where is it and when will we the board see that again the intersectionality data with some of our students in terms of

[01:23:00]
where are students are falling into potentially multiple buckets and how we're using that data to drive our strategy in conversations this morning we have prepared or rather we are preparing an additional table based on looking at some of the technical and tactical questions we recognize that this may be something that would come up tonight in terms of additional need to go deeper so that should be coming as early as not this Friday but next Friday is at a glance in regards to this work so that we can provide a deeper dive into the data that is important to recognize that this continuous progress monitoring Journey has driven us to be much much more specific to look at the data in different ways but not just the student demographic data but also the skill data and I think that's been alluded to

[01:24:00]
play I'm associate superintendent Oaks this evening in regards to different gaps that we see by grade level correlated to student demographic data and what is being done specifically to drive our strategy along those lines one of the things that we recognized to your board member Dominguez is the need to drive the specificity from The Boardroom to the classroom and really looking to see how we are taking the visualizations that yes are available but taking them to the individual classroom level so as we progress monitor as we unfold this information is really taking it from the macro what we're talking about here for providing get at the micro with what's happening in a tool of this progress monitoring sample for our teachers so we're really

[01:25:00]
conceptualizing what that may look like in terms of the disaggregation of data the intersectionality of data but I'm packing that more Beyond student demographic data to student demographic data with a correlation to the skill gaps that exists they're in so I think that's where we're at we ourselves rather robustly to inform our strategy because we recognize that yeah there is some things to celebrate in terms of being at and maybe surpassing the target a little bit but we can't rest on our Laurels because even by meeting the target we recognize that they're still several students a large percentage that is not proficient so I hope that is a little bit in response to your question and we will have more information coming along those lines in an upcoming

[01:26:00]
thank you yes that is more to the point of my question and while I absolutely want to celebrate the accomplishments right we are at the moment I mean the really the challenge will be when we sustain this friend but and as the reports both noted 1.1 and 1.2 are African-American population is it did not have growth and that does not that that tempers myself because if we don't get it right with those who are behind then the sustainability

[01:27:00]
of that trend is at risk and so yes I'm I'm the one I provided lots of questions because I was trying to prompt thinking around that would get us to Route analysis so I look forward to a segregated date of this is and I just want to point out this is not the first time that we have asked for that certainly not the first time I have asked for it and I've been patiently waiting and I've always said we're in transition this is been the theme so but I appreciate I'm looking forward to February 14th it'll be a wonderful Valentine's Day gift thank you

[01:28:00]
and just for clarification those data it's not the team's lack of providing it it's that they have to actually go in and redo subsets of thousands and thousands of data sets to be able to desegregate it so is I just want to on behalf of the team it's not their lack of not responding it's that it's taking this much time for them to be able to create the data sense that sets that will pull the information that's being asked and are you referring to like the intersectionality okay that's a job yes I'll graduate and remember Dominguez I would just add that your question is will take and it's pushing us into a deeper reflection of the data which is which bar exceeds the intent of the gold or the actual data point in terms of the line graph it's well taken but it's really driving us down to

[01:29:00]
look at what were called to in the annual targets and even the goal Target itself and Beyond much deeper I take your point and I also would say that it's that intersectionality is that deep dive that is going to give you great results for sustainability right so that it's not a one-time so thank you for the work I know it's a lot thank you period fantastic Just the Way You Are

[01:30:00]
thorough in your responses were had to come up with other questions because you answered my questions in other responses but great job I also will point out to this is how we know somg is working like everything that we heard today and even seeing the responses shows us that we are on the right track and making this shift has proven this process to be even more valuable than I think the what we realized it was initially so anyways question mark the unified support team empathy interviews the unified resource teachers as well but I also noticed two in the report where it says the key takeaway is that successful schools consistently use the approved curriculum are you or as

[01:31:00]
what does a district are we still seeing some push back or some challenges with with teachers or with certain schools that they're not completely on board with where we're headed or what do you feel that are some of the objections to using the approved curriculum sorry I think that one of the things that was alluded to earlier I believe is associated with mentioned is the amount of time teachers had with the material before the school year started so as time moves and teachers are able to dig into it more but they had two days before the school year started so that did kind of lend itself to not having enough time for I think the biggest barrier is a time barrier and we've heard teachers especially elementary teachers say that so to read

[01:32:00]
up their lesson plans and to really get comfortable with the curriculum they haven't had enough time so as the year progresses and they get more time I think they become more comfortable with it we they have the materials by the first day of school like all of those things really matter to them being able to jump in so I think the other part of it that is really important and I heard the teachers today talking about and the principals is that they sometimes in any element of change people just need to see like who's going to go first and when they see that there's success then you have like the early adopters you have like the doctors that are doing it because they're supposed to do and then you have kind of people watching and they're like wait now and I think one of the teachers alluded to that idea of well then I saw that it was working so I kept you so I think that that's kind of where we are now is really honing in on

[01:33:00]
priority and emerging schools particularly and that's part of the guardrail that Miss jet spoke about is making sure that they have the time the resources and then what barriers are they because once people see success with using it then that really moves up so I think there were some bumps along the way in the year just starting the first day of school with it but I think that we should have definitely seen it and increase in the amount of use in materials and these lap classes and the way that we did adoption to have teachers adopt kind of first and then talk about why it was good and they can kind of Coach the other teachers that has been you just as well know that's awesome that's good so and follow up with that because I like how we talked about how teachers come to observe is it a two-part where the other teachers also able to be observed by the teacher

[01:34:00]
play that successful within their or is it just the teacher that struggle and observing the the successful teacher thank you for the question board member tell me about Romero right now the way the learning labs are working its voluntary and so our job is to promote these expert teachers and then encouraged principals in their schools to encourage the teacher to go in and observe the classroom through the unified support team resource teachers that's a different kind of support they're the resource teachers can serve as a model with the teacher and that and we're hearing and this is qualitative you know information at this point but we are hearing that that's on the rise because as I mentioned earlier like anything you have to develop Trust

[01:35:00]
in the process and recognize that we're not here to criticize we're simply here to support and so is that happens the resource teachers the UST resource teachers they can provide that kind of support then we have to Leverage The Learning labs and as I said those teachers they were volunteers they volunteered to increase their own understanding and then make their classrooms available we have to we really have to promote their classrooms and so that's the place we are right now we aren't at the point necessarily where for example the the teacher in the learning lab teacher could go in and provide feedback I don't know that that will take some time together of course and you just kind of wish you could just bottle up some of the responses and comments tonight and just like

[01:36:00]
but great job superintendent fabulous job on this report and what your team is doing thank you so much I want to thank all of you Gonzalez Chief academic officer Jet and Associate superintendent for being here this evening and for presenting such a great rapport with fantastic results we are really excited about that board member Jackson and I did a community engagement event last week and one of the high school and one of the things that we heard over and over was what we do in say here and the information that you're giving us isn't always getting down to the people who need to hear it may be our principles are teachers our families our students and so that being said if there are any first and second graders out there listening which I know they are congratulations

[01:37:00]
so my question is related to information on page 9 of the Board of Education questions and answers I like to orient people to where we are and it's related to equity and inclusion and culturally responsive practices and so what are the questions was what factors are contributing to the slower progress among African-American students convert other groups and part of the answer is unrecognized implicit bias and teaching practices and curriculum design can influence expectations and interacts with African-American students including but not limited to lower expectations which can result in less challenging instruction limited feedback which can hinder student growth and you touched upon this associate superintendent earlier when you said the belief that the student can't and so my question is what specific strategies

[01:38:00]
I've been explored and can be implemented immediately to address implicit bias and teaching practices other than utilizing culturally sensitive instructional materials so that we can ensure Equitable expectations and interactions with their African-American students thank you for the question board member benefits and board members I would go back to last summer when the principals will start with the principals and then work our way down to the classroom we had we had a conference for our principals it was Dr Mohamed Khalifa came to APS on YouTube and we were actually looking at these questions because he recognizes his work recognizes that across the country are marginalized students

[01:39:00]
having the opportunities that they need in order to succeed academically so he engaged us in a variety of activities that had the principles and the leaders at the conference look at our first our own beliefs and he began the work with something that I go back to consistently we all have a pistol ology he said we all have our own belief systems however when we're working with students in our classrooms we have to put those aside and we have to use the resources and continue to apply the knowledge that we have about working with students who are not successful in the academic setting so we started there with the principals the principal's feedback was that this is what they needed to really understand

[01:40:00]
and how to bring this this information back to their teachers since then we have worked with the indigenous Montessori Institute we have we had two professional development sessions with our principles and in those two sessions in particular there were strategies for the Primary students at the elementary level and it was the presenters talked about the importance of something that you've heard me say you have to the the teachers and the adults in the environment have to know who the students are and one of the things we talked about with a small group of principals in some of our schools for example we don't have a high number of African-American students or Native American students the

[01:41:00]
I meant that day with those groups and many in that room that day was hey I have a dozen kids that fall in this category my my responsibility and what I'm going to do is make sure that I know every one of those kids by name so it begins with those kinds of things and so we have we also continue to provide professional development through our cultural culture and Equity Department with Dr Holly and he stresses those same beliefs and then provides teachers with very explicit strategies for overcoming to see that every student can so those are things that were doing now and we just have to continue on this pathway because if these are things that we have to work on daily

[01:42:00]
and every time we have a new students new teachers new staff members we have to bring them in to this belief system that all kids can and that we have to recognize the the students that often times are marginalized they're the students we have to know deeply and well so I'm putting you on the spot so if you don't have an answer that's okay but I'm particularly intrigued by Dr Holly and who provides teachers with explicit strategies and so off the top of your head can you give an example of a strategy they've provided you have one immediately thank you for that question board member benavidez not sure I can you know sitting here in the moment draw up and explicit strategy

[01:43:00]
one thing I really admire particularly about Dr Holly's work is talking about youth culture which is very important when we think about like we are the grown-ups interacting with students you know a younger generation and it has been throughout time immemorial that the grown-ups don't necessarily always understand the kids and you know so even just you know definitely looking at our implicit biases doing that daily work of making sure we are looking at the students and knowing them deeply but also recognizing I don't know exactly how to say except the kids aren't bad they bring a lot of value and dignity to the space that we want to make sure we're honoring and sometimes even when we just look at youth culture we forget that I know as a teacher as a parent I've been guilty of kids these days right and so you know that

[01:44:00]
is been really a Hallmark of a lot of the conversation in terms of you have to separate your own maybe what you would expect a child to do from the child themselves and be supportive and really make sure you approach them with that dignity some specific example on the comes to mind in regards to Dr Holly's work is the affirmation of the home language and teaching practitioners teachers how to affirm a student in their home language whatever that may be and then translate that to academically that is quite the task that is very there's a lot to unpack there but we look at Hallmark programs within Albuquerque Public Schools like our dual language program and we look at things like

[01:45:00]
04 in the sense of belonging and I think it really drawing on the work of Dr Holly to affirm our students in a very fundamental way and strategies and even role-playing with our practitioners to see how they can do that how they can see our students before they pull out the standards before they start their lesson is really looking to see who they are and what their identity is and very few things come closer to a student's identity then the way they communicate so that is an example that does come to mind and I think it's a good example because it really hits on this literacy goal because there's other strategies that we can use with our practitioners in terms of language standards so as we look at

[01:46:00]
standards we also recognize that we're working with students whose home language is not English there's also an additional set of Standards known as the language standards that facilitate strategies for our teachers to be able to affirm our students and to teach to the top while recognizing that there may need to be specific strategies in doing just that so a lot there I appreciate the question I think it's really important that he talks about is the importance of a name so working with the students like just from the beginning of talking about why is why is your name Gabriella what were you named after why is it spelled that way and acknowledging that when you call a student by name that the teacher always pronounces it correctly spells it correctly and how important that is to set up I mean it's really talking

[01:47:00]
tell me about how important are Gulf War is connected to all of the goals because if you don't create that space in a lot of strategies that he gives is making sure that students feel connected to the classroom and that they feel valued and so the name strategy and it's a whole lesson that goes with the name and really starting that as the beginning of class is really important for students especially I mean if you have any I was always like my name is always mispronounced and if you have a name that's always pronounced that having somebody acknowledge like how do you like your name to be said just short you know people would always just shorten my name without asking you know and so how that becomes a part of somebody's identity and and that was one of those strategies that he shares I think is really important and I like to share one other and this one gets right down to the work in the classroom and I appreciate that of

[01:48:00]
affirming but he also talks about the validation of the student which is what Dr Blakey just talked about but in terms of literacy development he talks about music and literacy development and it really kind of connected to the video that the fine arts department developed for us so that we can see that kids learn songs quickly and so using songs to engage them in the reading process is a strategy that he talks about that gets right to regardless of whether you're a five year old or a you know a 17 year old thank you that conversation was beautiful and it made me really happy because some of those strategies are a lot of what we use in community work or facilitating meetings and what we want to see in the classrooms so that was really

[01:49:00]
I can share my screen with you because it was like copy paste my question what I was going to notice no no it was it was great conversation thank you so I'm going to ask a question that I was going to do as a follow-up to email but I'm just going to say it now so I can have a question so based on some of the bilingual programs that we offer are we seeing a lower literacy rate for students who are learning both English and Spanish at the same time and if so what are we doing for that I'm go ahead you do I can start it we do sometimes see discrepancy and I know that it's not connected to the student

[01:50:00]
understanding it's part of the language development and so we also know that the longer the students are in the Dual language program the stronger they get in both languages so sometimes in the early grades we do see lower proficiency rates but they're not accounted for really the students not understanding how to read and long-term especially when they get to 5th grade and certainly 8th grade we see huge jumps and how the students are learning both languages so yes we do see lower proficiency rates but we also see huge gains in the Upper Grade because that's what I experienced going through which program is my first language was like English but when I started learning Spanish reading I completely

[01:51:00]
you're really good at it and I think it's an important thing to know for a lot of parents out there who may see that struggle with their Elementary School students so thank you so much okay that was a really great productive conversation thank you so much team so now before I go there is there any last minute questions so now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with their vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions one does the reality of this report me or vision of the goal to is there a growth toward the vision and three is there a strategy and plans sufficient to cause

[01:52:00]
confident that the data is accurate and the superintendent is performing how do we do you feel yes to all three and thank you to the team for your presentation at this point I'll entertain a motion to accept monitoring report I move we accept the progress monitoring report for interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 early literacy this is board member Jackson Jackson

[01:53:00]
Danielle Gonzales yes thank you the next item on our agenda is to consider approval of the consent agenda I have a motion and a second please for items at 6. 1 6 6

[02:04:00]
what president Gonzalez we are live we are streaming thank you we are now on agenda item 7.1 which is to consider approval of amendments to the aps Board of Education governance manual are presenters for this are ad hoc committee members Janelle astorga and Courtney Jackson can we have a motion and second please to consider this agenda item I move that we consider approval of the Amendments of the aps Board of Education governance manual this is board member benavidez and this is board member Top Gear Romero second thank you we have a motion and a second so just in terms of the process that will be using according to Robert's Rules of Order when reviewing and voting on a complex multi-part policy with numerous proposed changes it must proceed systematically so his chair my role is to ensure Clarity organization and fairness in considering all amendments so here's how we will proceed with this evening's review of the aps Board of Education governance manual

[02:05:00]
motion on the table now we will then review each section focusing on the proposed changes from the ad hoc governance manual committee board members May propose additional amendments to ad hoc committees proposed changes in each section if no amendments are offered we will vote to approve that section and move on once all sections have been reviewed and approved members will have a final opportunity to propose ending additional amendments before the full document is adopted that's returning to the main motion so given that we will go ahead and move to discussion of the governance manual review section by section focusing on the proposed changes from ad hoc committee to our presenters again secretary historica and the chair of the board governance manual committee and vice president Jackson you have the floor thank you so I suggest that we adopt the revised governance manual with the focus on the 14th sections that have

[02:06:00]
changes and that goes back to the rubric table that we were going to look at the policy committee and those include sections of the background 1A 4A 4C 4D 4D or h3k and 4pq all other sections have no changes or a simple phrase Replacements and I also just wanted to add that 180 there was a proposed change for the board goals which I wanted to just clarify that those cannot be changed without going back to the community and see if they agree to those changes but I know that the board member will share the reasoning for that for those specific amendments that are being suggested and another background is that 4C are the board of guardrails so we also cannot change those unless we have like a workshop Retreat style to go over those in full with the entire board so

[02:07:00]
it's the last paragraph that was added so the proposed Edition is additional policies within the aps District may be developed by the board or the superintendent based on their expertise and to find rules to ensure the policies are effective and relevant the board as elected representatives of the community may create policies that reflect communities and values the superintendent as an expert in education and District Operations May develop policies and administrative procedures that Implement policies related to the academic and operational management of the district so our suggestions was keeping this language because it was supposed to originally summarize the rest of that background information

[02:08:00]
the difference between board and administration policy making rules for the ease of the public and Community to understand and we also are suggesting removing the term educational and just to keep the summary abroad as intended thank you so can we have a motion and a second to consider this amendment I moved to accept the Amendments as proposed a second thank you we have a motion and a second from member astorga we will now move on to discussion so does anyone have any additional comments to make or questions regarding this first proposed amendments in my location

[02:09:00]
bear with me I'm trying to identify which draft this is in my comments or to the first published draft after the December 20th meeting I asked does the superintendent the superintendent's policies administration's policies no so

[02:10:00]
Governor's manual is for board members to be able to guide themselves on how we want to hold ourselves accountable and the way that we govern so superintendent or District staff would not have that controller that say okay and somehow that was related to the addition I guess or maybe to clarify are there any additional questions or debate on the First Amendment if not we have emotion from member of store good to accept the edits to page 3 of the government spaniel in the background section can we have a vote please turn back to that hot us to the next

[02:11:00]
10 for amendment I believe it's my turn so moving to the next section that requires Amendment it would be section 1A and this should be pretty quick because the committee rejects suggestions to rewrite the goals to do this would require the full board to re-engage the community the original edit to the goals was simply to add in the established metrics that previously were listed as X and Y in the document changing the goals even slightly would have substantial consequences to the district stability would require the full board to re-engage the community would require the board to allow for updated and interpretations of the goals of the interim goals and practically would require a reprint of all district materials so the committee recommends that the

[02:12:00]
only at it be to the insertion of the numeric goals that were just previously not inserted thank you can we have a motion then to add the numerical goals in place of X and Y in policy 1A are we discussing this at all we do the motion of the numeric amendments to section 1A this is board member Romero I second thank you we have a motion and a second so we will move to discussion any questions or discussion yes so my suggestions had to do with making the statement actually or semantically correct

[02:13:00]
the percentage of 3rd grade students identified in the Martinez or in the Ozzie Martinez decision there were no third grade students identified in the Yas Martinez and borrowing the language here and so I worked with them so that it would be factually correct and I think what we what I have written here is the percentage of third grade students from the targeted population identified in the markets

[02:14:00]
when I finally found the docket it was Martinez and Yazzie so again just trying to be precise about how this reads I understand that adding Hispanic students might change could potentially change things but we do talk about the goals in the guard rails and they do represent 66% of the majority majority of the district and so if we've included African-Americans I suggested that we should also named Hispanics because they are not named in

[02:15:00]
the decisions but let's leave that aside first just semantically and factually I'm proposing that we Wordsmith is so that it reads correctly thank you for your comment is there any additional questions or

[02:16:00]
edit the goals or the guard rails and so are there any additional comments or questions if not we'll move to a roll call we have a motion for member astorga and a second from Member top your Romero so Doctor Albright can we have a roll call vote please now only yes yes we are ready to move on to the next thank you the next one is on Section 48 governance commitment so the proposed change was the boards official and only connection to school district's operations performance and conduct is through the superintendent no one board member can direct

[02:17:00]
dictate the superintendent's administrative decision the committee suggests striking both sections because they are redundant to language stated elsewhere in 4D section 7 and 4D section 4 and if the board strongly feels like the language needs to be kept we are okay with keeping one of these sentences thank you we have the proposed amendment from the ad hoc committee can we have a motion and a second please I moved to prove the proposed amendments thank you we have emotion and a second is there any discussion all right so we have emotion on the table to strike the two highlighted sentences starting with the boards official and ending with administrative decisions so we will and we have a motion in a second emotion from Member Jackson second from remember a story called the police Courtney Johnson

[02:18:00]
both of them okay if that's okay so the first is the ad hoc committee recommends adding the sentence at the beginning of the as an introduction to the guard rails for the bored section that says each board member will hold themselves accountable to the following agreed upon guardrails to address a question that was presented in the survey there was a question as to why agreed

[02:19:00]
when was was entered as the language and that was the highlight the fact that the board guard rails are a collaborative agreement between board members to a year adhere to certain behaviors it came from the survey where board members felt there was a lack of follow through on board guard rails so it was meant as a reminder that the board members agreed to these guardrails so it was it was meant to just kind of highlight that so that is the first proposal do you want to do it as a whole Force okay so the the next proposal is to the committee suggest striking the suggested changes the reason being that changes to Beauregard rails need to come from the whole board and not from committee those need to be discussed and agreed upon collectively at a later date great thank you so can we have a motion

[02:20:00]
seconds please to accept the promoter proposed amendments of ad hoc committee which is to insert the intro sentence under 4C and then to I don't think we need an amendment to reject changes we only need amendments to add or change what's currently in the document okay so the proposal sentence that we see on the screen kind of emotion in a second please I moved to approve the amendment and that first part of section 440 I will remember you have a motion and a second is there any additional discussion all right can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes

[02:21:00]
yes we are ready to move on to the next proposed amendment thank you the next proposed amendment is in section 41 Board of responsibilities and authority and I believe we might need legal for this since there was a legal review on this part but it was to add executive order 13175 regarding tribal consultation and to also add the federal Indian Education Act reference the ad hoc committee suggests that they will be moved to the addendum of the governance manual with the other statues and regulations and we were all so wanting a legal review to be conducted to ascertain the board or superintendent responsibilities around this issue all right so we have a proposal from the ad hoc committee to add see exactly 131758600b

[02:22:00]
one to move those from 41 to the addendum move those to the addendum all of them the two the two highlighted in blue so where it says see so to keep where it says the 22 Dash 5 Dash 4 and see New Mexico Administrative Code but to move see executive order and see Federal Indian Education Act to move those out of that section and move them to the addendum can I have a motion to 41 to move the bullets on Executive Order 13175 and federal Indian Education Act to the amendment of the government's Amendment section of the government's manual I moved to move executive order 13175 regarding tribal consultation and federal Indian Education Act to the board governance manual a second

[02:23:00]
play motion and a second is there any discussion yes remember to marry you I just want to reiterate why it would be better for them to sit in that place is because based on a resolution that was created in December November of 2023 the appropriate measures were not followed when it came to staff comment was followed but the parent advisory committee didn't see or approve of the resolution tribal consultation was not done also for the specific resolution and also the community and that specific resolution was not given in languages where tribes were able to consider it and we also going to do federal guidelines and looking this up federally we have to not only consider the Indian Education Act we have to consider the Indian self-determination and

[02:24:00]
education assistance act because these are goals the goals that provide and these particular federal laws create an insurer meaningful tribal consultation parent and Community involvement and accountability and I feel that because of that resolution passing this and it's appropriate place would help guide us as a board that we follow those guidelines because we didn't when that first resolution was passed I know I wasn't on the board but I did watch when that was passed and I did have issues with it and that was one thing I questioned when I first came on board why those prices were not followed so I would think as a board we would want to follow those and they should be right in this space so we acknowledge that we represent tribes and their voice and we are going to follow those federal laws that's my discussion

[02:25:00]
thank you thank you remember don't worry I appreciate that and the importance of following all federal laws which is indeed the point here so the board will comply with all federal statutes and regulations and also comply with the New Mexico Constitution New Mexico statutes in New Mexico Administrative Code so I think the reason these not every single federal law policy executive orders listed here is because it would be a really long page would be listing every child succeeds every student succeeds act idea every single federal policy so we can certainly add these to the governor's manual addendum as motioned is there any other discussion or question on the proposed amendment yes so equating these federal laws in reference to tribes to other federal laws I think is

[02:26:00]
problematic for me because tribes are sovereign governments and so I think that's I don't think that's an equal I think it's appropriate to privilege tribes in this section because they are sovereign government and we should be honoring to Sovereign Nation process recognizing it up front is there any additional discussion or questions I have a question if you don't mind I'm not sure of the exact time originally created or initially created but obviously it was the work of the former board and so I'm curious if anybody could provide some contacts any of the four board members here

[02:27:00]
how is the list determined and you know how did you decide what was going to be included in what was going to be put in the addendum I mean aside from the fact that you did state that it would be very long yeah that would have been that ad hoc committee which was member Jackson and member Dominguez so I'll let you to respond to that so I'm happy to respond to that so the reason that the the first two bullet points that you see there were included is because those two bullet points are very specific to what the board responsibilities are in statute and administrative code also pulling from previous policies that we had within you know as we were as we were taking previous policies and incorporating them into one governance manual those were the only two that were listed so it was more like a precedent to take those specifically as it relates to this question I do think that that precedence stands

[02:28:00]
because these these top two are bored are School Board specific statutes so they should stay because it's in regards to what our personal responsibilities are the as far as the second to bullet points I think that there's maybe some uncertainty as to whether or not those two specific items are bored responsibilities in particular I think that we absolutely do need to follow the federal and the state you know as already has already noted the federal statutes the regulations and all of that but tribal consultation is not necessarily a word responsibility that is something that has been delegated by the board to the superintendent because it is the superintendent and her Administration that more has the expertise when it comes to tribal consultation so

[02:29:00]
I think it was sheer ignorance about the topic because once I attended the national Indian Education Association conferences what became very clear to me is that tribes don't see it the way we might have board member Jackson when we were putting this together they most certainly see a role for school boards to engage very directly with their tribal leaders or the or the

[02:30:00]
any of the tribal leader especially when policies are being drawn up and they cite the history the very tragic history between public schools in the mainstream and Indian nations and to so they are asserting themselves which is why the first time I attended the night here in Albuquerque I had a leader come to me and say you have do you understand that you have a responsibility as a school board member to honor your board needs to talk to Sovereign Nation relations with with the tribes I had no idea what he was talking about so

[02:31:00]
made it my commitment to inform myself and so this is why I'm speaking up I think I think there is still a level of ignorance and which is why I voted in favor of the resolution on November 2023 had I known then what I know now I would have asked the question when did we consult tribal leaders in an effort to unify the I mean I think the resolution is a good one but who the the very important people missing are we're not uniting the tribal Leaders with Urban indigenous leaders which is what I saw in a presentation at night in October

[02:32:00]
in South Dakota they have a a unified front and so I think the fact that we left out tribal leaders from that resolution is the example as to why we need to have these two the executive order and the federal Indian Education Act listed here we need to be reminded thank you guys are there any additional questions or comments yes one more for myself oh you can never as well because I see the importance of leaving the executive order 13175 in this location and one of the reasons that I was waiting was because we were seeking legal review because of the reasons that remember Jackson had said before so I just want to let folks know that I will give you my emotions so that we so that I

[02:33:00]
feel good about making sure that people know that I want the tribal consultation to be in this place especially coming from a district that I represent part of this letter Pueblo so making sure that that's their I do feel that the federal Indian Education Act can be moved to the addendum based on again the sources that board member Jackson said so just wanted to say that thank you and I'll get to you in a moment number to morito Mr Melendez if you could come to the microphone please since we have a request for some legal opinion which correct me if I stayed this wrong number or the question is to whether these should be here in the document that's the legal review that you all were wanting not in the document but what responsibilities do the board does our board have regarding these two bullets do we do have I just want to acknowledge a separate policy on 29 specifically related to tribal cons

[02:34:00]
there's a lot of detail in those two policies and procedural directives and so the question is should though should the executive order and the Indian tribal education Federal Indian Education Act be included here and what are the responsibilities of the Board of Education specifically not the district as it relates to tribal consultations and included someplace to say is what is critical so if it's here or if it's there

[02:35:00]
is perhaps in the eye of the beholder if it were not included I think that would be inappropriate so from my point of view it's your choice but I am satisfied if it's in the addendum and it's written it's okay if you choose to put it here that's okay you may next find someone else saying I want I want to be heard and I want this here so that's where I'm at on placement if you will with regard to the Indian or the responsibility of the board toward the tribes I view the responsibility as well in that there is a lot of responsibility plays through the procedures that we have and the Indian education committee everybody

[02:36:00]
in terms of hearing working together and cooperating I see that as primarily the responsibility of the administration working with the Indian education committee and I know they have periodic meetings now I believe that upon a request from a tribe tribal leader or more than one tribal leader just like if there would be a request from the legislative I remember when there was a question about the bus route

[02:37:00]
whether people would be students would be picked up on the reservation land or off just off the reservation land I I specifically recall there was consultation including board members so that's that's where I'm at I think the key here is having it written and you have and you have it also written in your procedure and so I hope that helps I don't mean to be a weasel about this and say Yes No Maybe put it that way is there any follow-up questions what will happen

[02:38:00]
play with Navajo Nation they do have their own appointed school board and they want to meet with us so those kind of things you know that they are sort of on the side but if a school board from those specific nations want to meet with us and it may not be considered tribal consultation it may be considered bored to board consultation I don't know how you think about that but there are those specifics that are moving forward and what would that look like under your way now if the board of

[02:39:00]
or wherever they are wanted a meeting with the board a formal request to the board president and maybe you should be made and I would expect I would expect it would be honored and there would be time set aside for a joint if you will board meeting and it is not intended to put anyone higher or lower it would be a joint meeting to listen and interact I feel that there is that equal participation and that nations are also considered in that place because I don't want if this board is no longer here for it to go away because those Tendencies seem to happen especially when we're dealing with 23 tribes in New Mexico and when we have so many children especially

[02:40:00]
Navajo that attend the school district and so my concern is being one of the you know as being Native American and for how long that took for that to occur but many times just as I was looking at that resolution and found those particular areas not met and people didn't really listen to me until it was going to a few board members were then they realize this is wrong but it it took a while before somebody really heard me out that we can't do it this way yes I remember him know I don't have any more thank you were there any other follow-up questions so with regard to upon a request you know what you made the comment that if there is a request

[02:41:00]
tribal leaders but then they have to initiate so let's take that scenario right about if I if I could just briefly it could be a request from a tribal leader it could also be a request from the board it's it's a two-way street if I may just clarify so we're focused on 41 which is Bored responsibilities and Authority so the question the main item in this policy is that the board will comply with all federal statutes and state law yes yes we will so that the item that we're debating right now is whether we add the two bullets that are suggested here or to the addendum so certainly we can consider potential changes to p l 29 on tribal consultation and the procedural directive and so just want to make sure that the proposals that

[02:42:00]
testing are related specifically to this bullet yes here or responsibilities versus how tribal consultation happens which is a different policy that's not on the postage agenda correct correct if so here's my question or scenario based in reality we passed a resolution how how could tribal leaders know where they ever part of the conversation with regard to the resolution that we passed November of 2023 and they were not and so how we didn't ask them for their participation but they how could they know that we were designing a policy of resolution that was going to exclude them

[02:43:00]
thank you for that scenario so I'll turn it to Mr Melendez but to summarize what he said in terms of responsibilities for tribal consultation for the executive order the it is responsibility of the board placed through the parent committee and the procedural directive in the superintendent so we have responsibility and we've delegated it to the superintendent that is currently how the policy reads if we would like to amend that policy we could do that separately but again this is just about board responsibilities is that drive with what you said in response to the prior question okay so well okay so that resolution came to the board it was born initiated correct and so it gets to the issue of governance we are a governing body we need to be mindful and we need to be reminded in this section that we need to honor the executive order

[02:44:00]
that compels us to reach out to tribal leaders when we stayed at the point so I think there are some perspectives on the table that it's important to be reminded of the executive order in this section on board responsibilities so we've heard the arguments I just want to clarify are there any additional questions since we do have a motion in a second on the table I am okay remember a story I was just going to move to amend my motion to include the original motion was my mama Jackson was the second so I think member Jackson would have to make the amendment to amend the original amendment to leave executive order 13175 regarding tribal consultation in 41 and keep the Hawks recommendation to move Federal and Education Act to the addendum thank you member tomori Joe I just had one

[02:45:00]
addition you know after Administration codes up on top can we add resolutions and policies we would have to consider that as an additional amendment I would like to consider that okay so I'm going to put it in resolutions and you know up on top you see where it says organizational performance by assuming federal laws administrative codes resolutions and policies to ensure appropriate so we will consider that proposed amendment next and capturing it here so we don't lose it and I'll turn back to member Jackson who also had her hand up with the reminder that we do have the original motion on the table Yeah so the original motion is on the table

[02:46:00]
play I'm not going to amend my original motion because I feel confident that the way from the original motion I am confident that the way it is stated with those two bullet points it captures what the board responsibilities and authorities are knowing that we have a pretty significant Indian policies and procedures act that establishes all of these other issues that have been discussed so I will just say that I will not admit my mission and original thank you so we have a motion on the table from Member Jackson the second from member of Oregon the motion will stand as originally proposed so it was placing the two suggested bullets in 41 around executive order 1375 and federal Indian Education Act in the addendum to the government's manual so in terms of Robert's

[02:47:00]
Google vote on this amendment if it fails the member Astoria can propose a new motion to edit it as you had proposed all right so Dr Albright can we have a roll call please think we need to make sure we have still have a second phone number store to member Jackson's original motion no okay do we have a new second to the original motion this is remember Romero second thank you we have a second from Member Romero can we have a roll call vote please Brittany Jackson yes no no no no no no yes yes so I didn't count right now so I will entertain a new motion

[02:48:00]
so I moved to keep executive order 13175 regarding tribal consultation in section 41 and move the federal Indian Education Act to the addendum portion of the governance manual thank you is there a second second this is thank you we have emotion and a second is there any additional discussion all right can we have a roll call vote please no so the motion does carry we have also on the table a proposal would you like to make a motion to amendments to the intro paragraph

[02:49:00]
I would like to propose a resolution that on 4D boards and responsibilities and authorities it's emotional I moved I moved to make a motion to include resolution in 4D board responsibilities after Administration codes to be included within 40 thank you is there a second to amend 4 to add the word resolutions after administrative codes and before policies can we have a roll call vote please Brittany Jackson sorry but I needed a little bit of discussion

[02:50:00]
we can call for a discussion do you have a I just have a question as to how how adding resolutions will I why would you like to add resolutions because of the prior resolution that was made and then these specific areas should be looked into before we vote or we take on a resolution that those that that particular wording would be included to at least draw attention to if we do propose a resolution in the future we can make sure that these are being followed that's all so just if I can clarify this language is saying that we will follow all applicable law statutes codes resolutions and policies not that we will apply process to resolutions pass by the board

[02:51:00]
I just still feel it's a federal Administration codes and policies the board wants appropriate performance by assuming the direct responsibility and authority pursuant to applicable federal and state laws administrative codes and policies let's see where do I see the New Mexico I just want it noted what are the implications and Authority that it is especially when we're assuming direct responsibility and Authority Solutions

[02:52:00]
we have a responsibility to follow resolutions to the process of resolutions I was like okay just resolutions when we okay are there additional questions to that sentence minimal or not it is therefore the responsibility of the board when they pass a resolution to read it and make sure it complies with law and policy so

[02:53:00]
the board has the responsibility so it would be just an additional reminder and I don't think there's a downside to it thank you any additional questions or discussions and the second on the table so the motion please Courtney Jackson

[02:54:00]
section 44 I'm continuing on underboard responsibilities and Authority okay the committee requests that the full edition be presented to the board so looking at that are you up there for yes yes so the the committee requests that the full edition be presented to the board the reasons being that there was a question about the level of specificity that was added to the section it was done in response to a need to clarify board member interaction with the public after a board's decision is made the specific coaching

[02:55:00]
best practice is that the board chair serves as the official spokesperson on behalf of the board it's inappropriate for any board member to issue statements on behalf of the board and they should be very careful about creating the appearance of doing so even if it's not their intention the test most frequently offered on this matter is with the media or external parties be asking for a comment on the subject matter if you were not a member of the board if the answer is no then it is unlikely that the board members comments will be perceived as anything other than an official board position so the ad hoc committee recommends the full language remaining can I have a motion then 44044 by the ad hoc committee which is adding board members interaction with the public media through personal position

[02:56:00]
board members interaction with the public media or other entities must recognize this limitation board members are not to speak for the superintendent in order to speak for the board except to repeat explicitly stated board decisions board members will support the legitimacy and Authority in the final determination of the board on any matter regardless of the members personal position on the issue is there any discussion or questions I want to be clear that when we write that the final determination of the board on any matter regardless regardless of the members

[02:57:00]
position on the issue members have the legitimate right to to speak about the vote they have provided and still say you know the will of I stand behind the will of the board I disagreed and present or reiterate the reasons that the person or discussion can you restate the question on the board still have a right to

[02:58:00]
to the media the reasons for their descent on any matter so I think the answer is no that's not the intent of this section so we can have a discussion as to whether you think it makes sense to amend the motion to add the members have a right to speak to the media the intent is this to to include explicitly that board members are not to speak for the board and with the guidance from the great City schools that anytime a member of the board speaks to the media it would be interpreted as speaking on behalf of the board even if you stay it's your personal position even if we say this is our personal position that's what the guidance was from the council yes so is there any additional discussion or questions all right we have emotion on the table remember Jackson and a second from member of store go to men's section 44 to add that sentence as

[02:59:00]
can we have a roll call though please hey Jackson yes no still questioning it but no no yes yes I've been a Dominguez no crystals yes yes with the exception of the board president will not make requests legal advice from lawyers or law firms weather in house or outside of APs on issues not authorized via board approval the committee request a section remain as is well legal review training and guidance also supports this original language so we understand that every board member has a right to legal counsel but we must it must be accessed through the process outlined in the documents which

[03:00:00]
this wording is accurate with so we suggest keeping it thank you can we have a motion to that effect I moved to keep the ad-hoc suggestions for this amendment and can you just stay for us just because we have different colors in the text can you just proposed yes okay so its board members with the exception of the board president will not make requests of Norse seek legal advice from lawyers or law firms weather in house or outside of APs on issues not authorized via board approval so it's the original language that was in the government thank you so we have the motion for member of Oregon is there a second call second can we have emotion and a second is there any question or discussions

[03:01:00]
it stands right now is that if board members would like to see legal advice on board issue it has to go through the board president okay and then the board president the board president is the one who has to reach out to our legal team so it's not that it's not that we don't have access to legal advice it's just that it has to go through the word president

[03:02:00]
to get to did you have a second question mark it's so this is clarifying for individual board

[03:03:00]
legal advice from lawyers or law firms except the board president has that privilege to not inform the rest of the board correct and going back to board member benavidez question about process what is the process how is the process transparent so typically if there is a request made of legal then the answer comes back through the out of glass so whether it's a memo or an email or a direct email from legal to the board the answer is there are certain instances in which information is not shared with the full board those have really only been in my experience when it's related to the superintendent and when it's related to individual board member conflict of interest

[03:04:00]
so transparency applies not just to board members but also to the public and so how I mean we get at a glance but the public doesn't so how do we make so we have attorney client privilege where in opinions shared by our attorney with us are privileged so would not be shared with the public are there any this is good to know all opinions that are published in at a glance are privileged they are not to be shared with the public all opinions coming from legal are privileged between attorney and client if there is something that was a legal Mrs you can speak to this is that there was something that was

[03:05:00]
play legal opinion and it was to be public or something that's something that we would determine and we would bring to the board yes which could waive the privilege this is just a reminder that we're not sharing any information that we receive from our attorneys so okay and so but there's a process for waving if we feel it necessary to make it there's a way to wave that is that what I just heard Mr Melendez and that would be through the board saying we don't want to consider this privilege anymore we want to make it even though the lawyer's

[03:06:00]
thank you are there any additional questions or discussion on this one how do we put all that information in here because I mean it's standard process for attorney client relationships and I would imagine it's probably in our contract with our attorneys I think that's all part of we follow all state and federal law correct sorry additional questions all right we have emotion from Member Jackson to Amanda 4D 53 board members with the exception of the board president will not make requests of North seek legal advice from lawyers or law firms weather in house or outside of APs on issues not authorized by a board approval after Albright can we have a roll call vote please

[03:07:00]
so yes this is the original language some edits that came in were board members may have Equitable access to legal counsel and after making about yours may have that Equitable access to Legal

[03:08:00]
cancel and then I think it was a period so I think that was the the words it's the green I think the question is if we look back at the governance manual from November 2023 how did this section read and what exactly are we amending what were voting on right now is how it read originally so we don't need to vote this is the original language so I so I think that clarification is it we changed it as an ad hoc committee so we were moving that remain as it was before without the additions I don't know if that so did we originally change know so then we leave it don't need so this is what was originally and the governor's manual so we don't need to amend anything thank you member of this yeah thank you and can we just reflect that in a minute please thank you we will move on to the next proposed amendment from the ad hoc City okay

[03:09:00]
48 and so down where it says board members will refrain okay yeah it's it's like it says 7 but it's originally 8 so the ad hoc committee has the following amendment to this language board members will refrain from publicly expressing individual judgments of the superintendent or employees of APs thank you can we have a motion to that effect please I moved to accept the proposed amendment to 248 thank you we have a motion in a second from Member storage will refrain from publicly expressing IND

[03:10:00]
little judgments of performance of the superintendent or employees of APs is there any question or discussion may I make a statement there was a question that came in through the surveys to Define publicly and in this case publicly means like outside of the boardroom or executive session just to clarify thank you for that clarification any additional question or discussion all right we have the motion in the second on the table as stated can we have a roll call vote please Brittany yes yes and yes period this next one is section 4D 11:00 I'm going to wait until I see how it looks like

[03:11:00]
okay so the media requests that the language in pink remain and the rest we would like a discussion because based on previous discussions around legal counsel there is a cost that comes with including things like mediation services so we would feel more comfortable having the full board approval for any potential use of public funds and that is at the bottom where it says in blue legal counsel or mediation services of their choice to resolve challenging circumstances with board members and then to clarify this whole section 11 is this being added to 40 because of the board member performance concerns is a different section of the government's annual correct this is an

[03:12:00]
in that came in through suggestions from the first go-round and so what is the recommendation of the ad hoc committee to keep everything that's in the red or pink okay so can we have a motion then and the motion would be to keep the section that's highlighted on our screen right now but I can read it when we if needed I moved to include the proposed language from the ad hoc committee thank you come here for a second thank you we have a motion from Member Jackson and a second from member of store section 4D 11:00 to read if a board member become aware of credible information suggesting a violation of board policy by the board a board member or the superintendent they have an obligation to report the concern to the board president if

[03:13:00]
is the subject of the violation of the concern should be reported to the board vice president all right is there any discussion or questions yes thank you I think we need a different avenue possibility to address the difficulties with or violation that needs to be reported by board member excuse me if we see a violation by the board board members superintendent I think it's important that we recognize the limits of our experience

[03:14:00]
to resolve big challenges and that's based on history so I'm suggesting that we keep the the blue text and somebody mentioned cost to the taxpayer well that puts that argument puts the the burden on the person who has come forth and I think we need to remind everybody that there are two sides to this there's a person committing the violation and these sorts of protections absolutely require a cost thank you are there any additional questions or discussion

[03:15:00]
I agree I agree also with board member Dominguez we have to remember that in order to have our these particular areas and concerns address especially if we're looking at an area called bullying and if the power is one only to the whole year and not to the victim and then it's also just fair that we also support and do what's needed to keep that board member for not realizing that they're at full if it's the victim and I think the support of the funds is important and I don't want that blue and strike down because we did all notice back on January 8th March my announcement to the board and I found it at that moment there was no where to go and I think that needs to stay in the

[03:16:00]
performance and concerns under 4G and I think it's important that we do not confuse our personal opinions versus what is what do we have to uphold regarding the governance the government because I think many times and I'm I feel like I've held quiet on that but I feel like even that bully word is super strong and I've said it numerous times it is okay for us to disagree it is that's the reason we're here to be critical thinkers to be able to bring opinions from all avenues and I really believe our government's manual the way it is written allows us to go through the training command to be able to

[03:17:00]
here it's never to the point to silence an individual or allow people's not opinions not to be heard but to be using phrases that were bullying on our diets here I'm finding it offensive and I think it's important that we hold each other to a high standard but I won't be cold that I'm exhibiting behavior that just disagrees with somebody else's opinion thank you remember top your marrow and for calling out that we do have a whole section on board member performance the significant edits to it as well and 4G so we will be getting to that which is certainly a place to additional language if determined by the board member of start you had a comment yes I had a common just to say that I am fine with adding this language when it comes to mediation services especially since in our district we are pushing restorative justice practices and if we did want to change it

[03:18:00]
behaviors were saying we have to be those examples so I'm fine with adding mediation services that is a form of restorative justice that we can have within our board thank you any additional question or discussion all right so we do have a motion on the table to amend 4D 11 the original motion picture soundtrack

[03:19:00]
Daniel Gonzalez yes so the motion fails is there an alternate motion to address for d11 I moved to include the entire paragraph starting with if a board member becomes aware all the way to check engine circumstances with other board members to section 4D 11 thank you is there a second to say we have a motion in a second is there any additional discussion so to include all of that language which includes legal counsel would actually now be in violation of the amendment that we just passed that says that legal council must go through the board president so

[03:20:00]
so it would not be appropriate to include the the opportunity for board members to go out and get their own legal counsel on quite frankly on the dime of the taxpayer because there are internal conflicts that are occurring that again I will insert my personal opinion on this we are adults we should be able to have disagreements we should be able to resolve those disagreements without having to call in legal counsel or mediation services so my point is is that that that that proposal is in violation of what we just thank you any other comments or discussion I don't disagree with

[03:21:00]
what you said board member Jackson I just want to be clear about the fact that we did not admit that we didn't do anything with that so okay I'm lost in amendments over here so to clarify we review that says that access to legal counsel goes through the board president what number Jackson is saying if we add language here that says the board member that's in conflict with the section on how we access legal counsel so if I guess I will amend my motion and I would like to add to section 411 the paragraphs starting where if a board member becomes aware all the way

[03:22:00]
the bottom but change the board member may choose mediation mediation services of their choice and leave out legal counsel all right we have an amended amendment to 4011 so for the 11:00 would read if a board member becomes aware of credible information suggesting a violation of board policy by the board a board member or the superintendent they have an obligation to report the concern to the board president if the board president is the subject of the violation the concern should be reported to the board vice president if word vice president is not available the secretary will follow the executive committee of leadership the board member made shoes mediation services or their choice to of their choice excuse me to resolve challenging circumstances with other board members are you okay with that amendments any additional discussion or questions number Jackson thank you I think my next question then

[03:23:00]
so if we are going to insert mediation services into the board governance manual who pays for that does the board pay for that I mean our legal services are paid through an RFP so do we now need to go out and secure an RFP for mediation services for the board like unintended consequences of all of these additions for responsibilities that again quite frankly adults should have to be able to have conversations to disagree on issues and handle it so that again our focus of this of this entire governance manual is to make sure that we are being effective as a board and focusing on student outcomes it's not to continue to belabor

[03:24:00]
to continue to belabor issues that we disagree on and carrying them out so that our Focus continuously gets diverted over here instead of right there so I think we need to look at what the unintended consequences are of adding language that is meant to satisfy adults grievances or adult behaviors that are diverting our attention from what it is we're supposed to be doing which is again the whole point of this governance manual how do we better govern the district thank you very much so certainly there is the opportunity to amend the amendment to clarify who is responsible so could read the board member may choose legal counsel or mediation services at their own expense or at The District's expense so we can consider that if member of store go would like to Amendment member benefits you were trying to get it I just want to say that I agree with board member Jackson

[03:25:00]
we are here to focus on student outcomes and while I understand that there have been complex or at least that's what this conversation implies we should not make changes or suggest changes that we can then use to weaponize and and settle disputes that you know maybe have not been settled but I also want to play Devil's Advocate and say if any of us up here who are against mediation or against the proposed amendment find ourselves on the opposite end of a situation and then want it in realize that maybe it would have been a good option you know just maybe think I might not be in that position now but what if I am in the future and so and I'm not saying one is better than the other I'm just saying maybe for a second let's put ourselves in the shoes of the other person or somebody who might feel like they've experienced something and you know just consider that for a second but with the ultimate goal of we have

[03:26:00]
focusing on students going through this with a fine-toothed comb and you know arguing about it to death is not going to help our cause so I'm done thank you remember Benavides and so to clarify the section that we are currently editing is called board member responsibility or d11 indicates that a board member has the responsibility to report a violation if they become aware of it that's what we're trying to say with 4011 what is suggested to follow is additional process which is included already in for G her member PopularMMOs acknowledgment statement so we will be getting to board member performance or board member grievances or board member performance concerns any of those things I just want to acknowledge that again so the motion on the table made by member of store and seconded by member Dominguez is as is up on the screen so it would amend the last sentence to read it

[03:27:00]
mediation services of their choice and we do not indicate who would be responsible for that cost so with that is there any additional discussion or questions or we can move to I think we need to yes I want to verify that this is a cost to board services and I understand that we are adults and we should not have to bring in legal counsel but in fact that did happen in my case a year ago so I get it I was shocked that legal counsel had been brought in so back to the point of restorative practices

[03:28:00]
the district has to be responsible for that are you proposing an amendment to the amendment the board member may choose mediation services at the expense of the district yes covered by the district are you okay with that proposed amendment members Morgan know I would like to leave it broad okay all right are there any additional questions or comments before we move to the boat I have one common fractions or the incidents happened on April grounds within the board that the board and the board Services it's the responsibility lies on where those infractions or those occurrences take place there's a responsibility for that wherever those occurrences take place thank you thank you so we have the motion from Astoria the second from member

[03:29:00]
Dominguez to edit 4D 11 so the final sentence do I need to read the full thing are we good with just work on all right so Dr all right can we have a roll call please what president Gonzalez I just like to add probably it's legal counsel or on your screen to delete the war may choose mediation services of their choice thank you thank you yes yes yes yes and we will now turn to the next proposed amendment from the government

[03:30:00]
hopefully it's an easy one section 4 D12 the ad hoc committee suggests board members will review the governance manual regularly and the intent of this statement is to promote routine review by individual board members of the governance manual regularly is undefined on purpose as it is up to the individual board member to decide how often he or she needs to how often he or she needs to review in order to have a full understanding of the document thank you could we have a motion to that effect please I move we accept the proposed language of board members will review the governance manual regularly second this is Boards of emotion and a second to amend for 12 to read board members will review the governance manual

[03:31:00]
is there any additional questions or sorry are there any any questions or discussion all right Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please 6:40 membership requirements Edition on this one's manual annually in a workshop style questions and revisions behaviors and sign

[03:32:00]
recommendation is that we remove the word psychologically because that could have different consequences and it was intended to have and also there was a suggestion to strike signing a statement of testing to such can we have a motion to that effects to section 4 East 6th thank you and is there a second thank you we have emotions

[03:33:00]
follows along with what I previously said I think I I I I I would prefer and I know there's a motion on the table but I think that it's it's satisfactory to have it just a board members will review the governance manual annually in a workshop style period again thank you so there is a friendly Amendment on the table for you like to amend your Amendment all right so we will go ahead and are there any other questions or discussion okay so we will proceed with the roll call vote for the proposed amendment from a member of Oregon Jackson no yes vanilla Starbucks so before that so the motion carries

[03:34:00]
before we move on I just want to acknowledge that there's a chunk of red here in 44 is this language I'm sorry for is this language that is proposed amendment to this thing the same way why is this looking like yeah so I'm not a president that is it we left it out of discussion because it simply just an update to and the new nmsba rules so it doesn't really mean it is come back to the when we come back to the overall review will be able to approve this as part of the Amendments correct yeah it's part of thank you can we then turn to the next proposed amendment from the government so we are moving to 4G now so 422

[03:35:00]
okay sorry let me just read my notes together where are we going to do do do do do it looks like after the concern board member has privately discussed the alleged violation with the other board member the concerned board member was there a proposal on the language to be used here I think what was added was similar to what we just discussed the board member she was legal counsel or mediation services yeah I was just trying to clarify the words please field so the original language is there was a recommendation to

[03:36:00]
change it to believes okay is everyone okay with that word change and that that's the legal that was Artie just wanted to clarify that and so what the ad hoc committee is proposed edit to 4G to is the text in Blue on the screen I think okay so we actually I think that's where I'm getting caught up we didn't actually have a proposal for this section because we thought that this section needed to actually be discussed based on the conversation that we just so so two sections I don't know if you're looking at the table of our suggestions but there's 6442 about the mediation services and then again if you scroll down there's also another part of 4G to says the chain of executive committee leadership president vice president secretary

[03:37:00]
so the first then so in that case the first proposal is starting after believes the alleged violation has not been appropriated board member May submit in writing the allegation to the board president who will serve as Arbiter period I think that language got inserted I think that language is is in is in the wrong place right now okay and so I'm just trying to get to what is the proposed yeah so the proposed is if the board president is involved in the allegation the concerned board member May instead the allegation in writing to the board vice president

[03:38:00]
copied out right now so originally this is where bored performance lived so we did just add redundant language up above but because this is board performance so what we have to for E2 we have if after the concern board member has privately discussed the alleged violation with the other board member the concern board member believes the alleged violation has not been appropriately addressed the concerned memories submit in writing the allegation to the board president who will serve as Arbiter that's what the governance manual currently reads continuing currently reads if the board president is involved in the allegation the concerned board member means the allegation in writing to the board vice president or the next most senior board member not involved in the allegation who will serve as Arbiter instead instead is just a minor word at a proposed by Council that's what currently reads

[03:39:00]
the proposed amendment language then would be the board member may choose legal counsel or mediation services of their choice paid for by the board to serve as the Arbiter to resolve challenging circumstances with other board members so given that we just vote on this it seems that it should just mirror the prior language yes so I I move that we insert the language from for the 11 into section 4G to is there a second I will second okay we have emotion and a second to rather than make the all of the tweaking and editing that we've just been discussing to just copy and paste from 4011 here is there additional discussion questions yes so remember to make us are we I thought we agreed to get rid of legal

[03:40:00]
okay and so once again paid for by the board sentence is going away on the screen and so we're leaving who get who pays for what there's no mention of any pay other questions or discussion okay so we have a motion to amend for E2 to just copy and paste the previous from 4D 11 we have a second I'm sorry remember Jackson motion and member

[03:41:00]
Brittany Jackson yes no excuse me Ronaldo score at this point we will go ahead and take another quick recess for the board and we'll come back in 5 or so minutes with four Jeep 4366

[03:50:00]
dream started and let us know in the morning in Arizona so you are alive thank you we are ready to reconvene we were we are still on agenda item 7.1 we have proceeded to you and we are at the section 4G board member performance concerns I will turn it back to the ad hoc governance committee to present your next recommendations are coming in from number 6 to number 10

[03:51:00]
there was a suggestion to strike this language but we as a committee are suggesting to keep not only the 6 to 10 but the entire process that was originally added on the first meeting I guess I would say so that would be just like 1 to 10:15 the reason that we would like to keep this language is because there was an asked in the survey and also during the individual reviews for more process and explanation of what happens if there is a violation we suggest keeping one through 10 on Section 4G thank you and if I make clarify it looks like some of the numbering got messed up on the document so we have like if you go down where it starts in Red so that's

[03:52:00]
five and then where it says in order that would be 6:00 then the next in order would be 7:00 then where it says the next right there at 7:00 then go to a motion right there that's 8:00 and then go to the number you just got okay so there are also edits within the they're also strikeouts within the section and so what I'm hearing is the proposal is that what is currently labeled 4 through 10 without the strikeouts which is what you are

[03:53:00]
correct okay so do we have a motion to that effect okay so I I moved to accept items for through 10 in section 4G thank you is there a second all right we have emotion and a second motion new language for through 4 G 10 is there any discussion or questions sake of course and a previous section I think it was 4G

[03:54:00]
we were equating violations of state or federal and state laws with violations of the governance manual is that correct because they are again responsibility to report any sort of violation State Federal Way of the board member responsibility to report violations I'm looking for the where is the section where so this one so what we're considering here in 4G is if a board member believes that another board member has violated

[03:55:00]
code of conduct policy or state or federal law or Provisions within the governance manual correct or Provisions so that's what I mean we're equating federal law state law and governance manual violations they're all on equal footing is that correct no not at all it's not a violation of federal law with a violation of the government's manual it's merely saying that if a member believes that another member has violated any of these things this is the process well correct and so whether it's so much after our conversation because we talked about this section and I sent you a suggested edit

[03:56:00]
which would read edits for 4G it would break things down so into egregious and or willful violations of state and federal laws these could include a violations would be addressed yeah if you want to read the suggestion that you gave me for that specific piece we can you can suggest it ok Google on the table to accept the governance manual this section to add four through 10 so if you'd like to make an amendment to that you can and we will see if member Jackson wants to accept that we can proceed with discussions what is 4G the motion that we have right now is only specific to four through 10

[03:57:00]
so if you wanted to do something on 4G one which is what you're talking about at the top where it says Provisions within the governance manual in the in the red there that would be a different motion once I just to clarify on the motion member Jackson is your motion to only accept the editions of four through 10 or to also accept the Minor error Provisions within the government's manual we all have a minor legal edit on the beliefs my my original motion was to accept the Amendments for 4:30 we are not yet considering 4G one because that's a minor edit that can be like those are just accepted later yeah okay any questions about 4G 4 through 10 I think that's exactly what I'm addressing is I'm sure and

[03:58:00]
that's what my language is about so that is in this section is that correct yes the which part of 4G for 3:10 would you like to propose an amendment to the amendment we are in discussion mode is that correct we are in discussion now so you can State your comment and then if you think you would like to propose an amendment to the amendment you can do that so my comment is I think we should distinguish between egregious willful violations of state and federal law these violations can be addressed through a process that may include admonition Anderson and then the second tiered violation would be repeated and egregious and willful violations of the governance manual these will follow a two-step process first

[03:59:00]
in line with continuous Improvement the concern board member and the board member who is performances in question will have a restorative or a mediation conversation open dialogue with mediator second should mediation fail the mediator will decide to step forward so just to clarify so there is the motion on the table so if you want to completely change it you could vote against that motion and propose something new if you'd like to make minor amendments to that proposed amendment to sound like something pretty significant so I just want my fellow board members to know that I'm proposing a three-step process at that separates federal law state law violations deserving of admonition and sunshine are there any additional questions or discussion on the

[04:00:00]
amendment to add for through 10 to 4:00 all right talk please okay so the section of 4-H says

[04:01:00]
okay so the committee recommends where is it okay so there was a question about where it says in Board election years you've got to go down there's like red and blue see where it says all candidates so the okay so the committee recommends in Board election years all candidates shall be notified what in the world so the only recommendation that we're saying is the bottom blue IMM

[04:02:00]
the following School Board elections prior to School Board elections so where it's not School Board elections so immediately following okay so this is what I mean November regular election yes so the intent with this is making sure all bored candidates in the November election are notified of the organizational meeting process including board officer elections prior to the school board election the political election and the reason we're doing this is because there was an asked for board member candidates to be more prepared about the process about voting in officers if you are elected so having candidates understand that process before the election the political election okay so just according to Secretary of State they called the RLC regular like local elections so just

[04:03:00]
play try to State this whole thing cuz there's a lot of edits in here so to start with a the executive committee will include the president vice president and secretary and participate in and coordinate the preparation of the monthly agenda for all regular board meeting in Board election years old process including board officer elections prior to the regular local election yes yes okay can we have a motion to that effect you could just say I'm over here we have emotion from Member Jackson and a second from member of store is there any additional question or discussion are you using the rla yes prior to the regular local elections right now any additional questions

[04:04:00]
materials will be posted publicly all members are invited to submit questions prior to this is a part that we are highlighted for removal all meetings are open to the public and all meeting materials will be posted publicly 72 hours before the meeting all members are required to submit questions prior to the meeting due dates

[04:05:00]
included in the boards Weekly Newsletter and listed on the timeline for board meeting agendas we as ad hoc would like to remove this section because it is redundant to 4m and does not pertain to committee meetings that's one the next one is on G so during its second business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs the committee suggests that this remain as is because there was a call for it from board members that they wanted more time to discuss if they were open to being on committees or be committee chairs and this is allowed by nmsba so we can yeah so sorry real quick so go up Daniel sorry so where it says all meetings are open to the public that should be asked no stop

[04:06:00]
go down bcde okay so e is committees are open for membership to all board members okay see where it says all meetings are open to the public that's us but that was not in the original governance manual so we're not the governor's manual that was a proposed change this was a change coming from the Paul this is language added from the policy committee I didn't pass so it's so the original governance manual reads eat committees are open for membership to all board members and then ask Community chairs will discuss agendas with the superintendent and doesn't mean that turns into h word e so this this language where it says all meetings are open to the public was policy committee language that was added so you're proposing to add this in this meeting because the policy committee didn't vote anything through

[04:07:00]
currently reads committees are open for membership to all board members that's eat right and so is there a proposed amendment to add an F section or just clarify yeah so we received this document with all of the policy committees editions that were supposed to be on the consent agenda that we removed from consent agenda so that they were reviewed just so we're all on the same page so through this process that Hawk believe that that was redundant to 4 a.m. and does not pertain to committees I don't know if there is a right so that we don't need to make emotion there and so then I got confused on the next part that you were reading so you can just go back to that one sorry committee chairs which is this is fuck I'm sorry this is so it's still on the same one okay so delete the sea

[04:08:00]
so you're going to have to go up because the next one that I was proposing is on that same little paragraph right there the last song Yes okay gotcha which we would which we suggested to keep but that was also policy language to the end of Einstein's is there a second I'm sorry we would like it to remain

[04:09:00]
play chairs will discuss the agendas with the superintendent or does it need the chair may have an additional Committee Member present should have been right under that I don't see where I can reject that where this is good so I just would like for the minutes to reflect that we will have to edit this cuz I can't figure it out right now so we are working for membership and then this part that I accidentally struck and I can't find how to reject that change during a second business meeting of the year of the board will like standing committee chairs that's supposed to say okay I will keep working on that I'll come back to that well you go on to the next episode

[04:10:00]
I moved to add a second business meeting of the year the board will accept any committee chairs and committee chairs will discuss agendas with the superintendent

[04:11:00]
or does it mean the chair may have an additional Committee Member present and that's two section 4i don't have your document I guess which is why we're just playing it so we have emotion do we have a secondary I have a question in relation to the second business meeting of the year will Alex Dunn and committee chairs I'm concerned on the timeline with that because I just think specific like Finance if we're waiting till the second that doesn't give us enough time to meet with the finance team to discuss agenda before Finance meeting to have it posted there should be the first business yeah

[04:12:00]
remember the store that you made the original amendment is that okay so then I would we just remove that and not included at all because it's already considered the first business meeting that was just an addition so I amend my motion to only reading committee chairs will discuss agendas with the superintendent or does it need the chair may have an additional Committee Member president to section 4 I okay thank you for that number is there any additional discussion on this one I have all right so are we talking all of like all meetings are open to the public and all meeting materials

[04:13:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[04:14:00]
I forgot to ask about something so I'll have to vote no because I forgot to ask about it so I'm still talking over tomorrow yes so that motion carries and we will move on to the next proposed amendment from the governance at hoc committee okay so the next proposed agenda from the ad hoc committee is in relation to for I too but I'd like to make a note to go back in my document and I believe the documents that we had it's not scratched on there but we'll need to go back board members may serve on the following committees it is X Out on my documents so but it's not part of what are here so just don't know that we'll need to go back and address that this was suggested to not be included in

[04:15:00]
482 which starts with the board president It should read the board president or a majority of the board May appoint additional committees outside the purview of committee chairs including go to a ad hoc committee made up of board members to perform a specific task or solve a problem with the expectation that the group will just be on when the objective has been completed or the deadline has been reached so it's blue right now yeah task forces made up of board members and or community members brought together to accomplish a specific objective with

[04:16:00]
the expectation that the group will disband when the objective has been completed or the deadline has been reached and then just for numeracy stake C should say each 80 or task force committee or task force will have a chair who is responsible for providing regular updates on progress and then D that makes that D committees that fail to provide their deliverable back to the full board by the due date will be disbanded and the board president May create a new committee to accomplish the deliverable the new committee may include the previous chair as the Committee Member the

[04:17:00]
this was added at the suggestion of our coaches to add a level of accountability to committee chairs it allows for the board president to change the chair in order for the committee work to be concluded it is not meant to be punitive it is meant to keep the work of the board moving forward for number for letter B the committee suggest leaving this language because it has reflecting task force deadlines and not many deadline's the committee suggests to as I stated can we have a motion to that effect to add under Section to the language for

[04:18:00]
a adding at the end or the deadline has been reached be task force is made up of board members and or community members brought together to accomplish a specific objective with the expectation that the group will disband when the objective has been completed or the deadline has been reached and see each committee or task force will have a chair who's responsible for providing regular updates on progress and decommitted that fail to provide their deliverable back to the full board by the due date will be disbanded and the board president May create a new committee to accomplish the deliverable the new committee may include the previous chair as a Committee Member and move to add the additions as stated thank you we have the motion is there a second is there any questions or discussions

[04:19:00]
so we will proceed to the next proposed amendment okay the next one is section 4J board policy scope and development under the introduction this says the board recognizes the governance manual requires continuous review and revision to accommodate the board's needs and the implementation of student outcomes Focus governance we suggest this be removed because we have stated it in another place and it reads board members will review the governance manual and annually and workshop style that promotes a safe space to discuss questions so the one that we just approved so we are rejecting these proposed editions but we're not making any actual amendments to the government's manual will move on to the next proposed amendment okay so that's 482 there is a proposal language mm

[04:20:00]
so number one says the board limits its adoption of board policies blah blah blah the proposed amendment is number two that says the board should adopt and maintain a manageable number of policies so that the full board can review each policy at least once during every 4-year board term this is language that we suggest you added as a lines with evidence-based best practices so I will move to make that addition to 422 thank you we have a motion to amend 422 to add the board should adopt and maintain a manageable number of policies so that the full board can review each policy at least once during every four year board member term is there a second thank you we have a second from member of store any questions or discussion all right Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please let me Jackson yes yes

[04:21:00]
Pasadena Dominguez yes we're still talking Romero yes ever been to be there yes and your Gonzalez yes just as a point of privilege remember Jackson do you need water or tea or a coffee shop or something period thank you we will continue with the proposed want me to be on verbal restroom thank you the next amendment is section 4K 1B board agendas and this read the section that we're going to be focusing on is the board president will facilitate discussion that committee is rejecting this amendment because it is executive committee's to prove agenda items so this was it was just an addition to clarify the board president's role but

[04:22:00]
meeting agenda items include only issues that part stays that that yes that's okay all right the next amendments is redundant to for him 7 so that so that suggestion suggested Edition we reject because we already have that in for him 7:00 okay but this is also an addition so we're not voting on a change right next to me section 47 Community engagement so 7:00 to design a community

[04:23:00]
engagement Outreach plan to reach the parents of the target population of the Martinez and yassi decision for Meaningful participation and dialogue around the golden rules and how they are being understood and received by the targeted groups the committee suggests this language be removed as this work is already been accomplished as noted in the monitoring calendar and add hoc Community engagement goals it's also noted in implementation calendar for Community workshops and engagement opportunities it is all so noted that our goals are specifically tied to this community this section was also meant to address General Community engagement and their and there is a concern about beginning specifically nation of groups thank you so the next proposed amendments were at 4:23 okay so we have to go back to school so we have voted and accepted proposed amendments to the governance manual the next step is to return to any resolved issues so having

[04:24:00]
play the Amendments is presented by the committee are there any additional specific sections for clarification or further Amendment we have to discuss for acute oh it's through for you sorry OK Google then we moved on so if you would like to bring that discussion back we can do that after we finish the entire able to go through four queue I'm sorry there was an addition that says harmful to students physical emotional and academic world being and the districts or boards reputation

[04:25:00]
this language be given a legal review because of students physical emotional academic well-being this can be hard to our language with notation that state and federal state and federal employment law so I think I'm going to turn it over to my brother Jackson so this was already reviewed the document and so Mr Melendez in what you reviewed was the actions harmful to students physical emotional and academic well-being acceptable to you or do we need to have a discussion around whether that ought to have further review because of questions regarding employment law that's a suggestion yes that they're they're used to be a further review on that okay so we can then not make any amendments here since

[04:26:00]
at another time following additional review yes okay thank you thank you and that was it for four cute okay all right so having the Amendments as presented by the committee are there any additional specific sections for clarification or further amendments and I'm just going to reiterate that it feels a little bit yes we have focused our first two goals on Martinez and Yazzie population

[04:27:00]
and it seems to me that we are struggling to to reach that particular population in our community engagement and Outreach I just feel strongly that we need language this is not going to happen overnight it takes a lot of work to engage these populations and so I think it's important to have a long-term commitment written into our manual would you like to propose an amendment yes I'd like to amendment to design a community engagement and Outreach plan to reach the parents of the targeted population of the Martinez and Ozzy decision or meaningful participation and dialogue around the goals and guard rails we could end it there okay so just as a friendly amendment to your amendments

[04:28:00]
sing a section 7 to 4:00 p.m. to read the board will commit to design etcetera correct okay is there a second a second thank you any discussion or questions the the belief that this work is already being accomplished and is is noted in several areas of the work that the board does including the monitoring calendar the ad hoc Community engagement goals and the ad hoc Community engagement committee the implementation calendar Community workshops engagement opportunities we are already doing this work and so I don't think that there needs to be a very specific policy

[04:29:00]
if my fellow board member would like to mention that this should be done through the community ad hoc committee as the chair I'm happy to have a further discussion about what that looks like but I think that again this board governance manual is meant to be efficient and we are already have ways that this is stated thank you remember Jackie So when you say this work is already being done I want to clarify that there are already existing policies because the governance calendar we voted on an accepted so that is treated as a policy and the goals presented by the ad hoc committee with targets for reaching communities represented by the Aussie Martinez decision we also voted on and so that is treated as policy as well so we do have two policies at least already in place in addition to an ad hoc committee and the other work that you described

[04:30:00]
so is there any additional question or discussion around this proposed amendment section 4 p.m. by member Dominguez the original motion made by member Dominguez the second can we have a roll call Pleas Court hotel by the committee are there any additional specific sections for clarification oh yes origin

[04:31:00]
what section is that 4K or m board agendas or not for kids no it's 4:10

[04:32:00]
it is for keyboard agendas I thought you were going to go back to the one that we moved to because it was in 4M my bad so it was suggested language from a board member that we had a section 5 board members will have up to four business days it was the recommendation of the ad hoc committee to not accept that recommendation because that language is listed elsewhere in the governance manual inception for Emma request for agenda items will be announced in schedule during the report on the dots is what I'd like to propose just a way to bring transparency to request for agenda items can you share where you'd like to make this I don't know what document I'm looking at so it's hard to know where I'm going to put that in I I suggested

[04:33:00]
what is horses contagious I thought it was for keyboard agendas okay number one the board president the superintendent or designate regular and special agendas part A and A board member May request to add an agenda item through committee meetings or by contacting the president it sounds like it would be a good place to put request for agenda items will be announced in scheduled during the president's report on the Giants in I have one A and B word president will ensure that meeting agenda items include only issues that according to the board policy within the authority is that in there

[04:34:00]
accordingly and the wording again is request for agenda items will be announced and scheduled during the president's report on the diesel add to section 4K Portage a new

[04:35:00]
we could make it so easier and I'll put it where you want it okay so my motion is to add the following language request for agenda items will be announced and schedule during the president's report on the Dyess wherever it makes sense to do that I need a specific amount

[04:36:00]
policy committee for the RFI I don't remember so we had said that if there was an information was that we put this language here

[04:37:00]
the question is whether or not this amendment is being made to help us to be more focused on students or to help us alleviate adult concerns thank you I remember to get well I think there have been lots of amendments that helped us focus on and don't concerns throughout this process right I mean waking up at 2:00 in the morning worried about language that we are and why this is it well yeah it's in line with adult behaviors creating agenda items yes just want to restate that we just need to stay focused on our goals thank you any additional questions or discussion Madame I'm just confused

[04:38:00]
we're we're adding additional steps was there I feel like am I missing out on contacts that I don't know about like are we not are we not following these procedures now the way they're written I just don't I don't understand why we're adding more yes I I think so I requested that Charter Schools Charter School a discussion and apparently I sent out a memo to everybody so we just need a more open or transparent way of doing that and I know I wasn't the only one who

[04:39:00]
desired that conversation there's a majority of us and it didn't happen so apparently there was an instance in the past where a board member felt like their agenda item didn't make it onto the agenda so the proposal then is to add this section c so we can continue to debate the y or we could just move ahead to roll call are there any other questions or discussion items on I'm just going to put this out there like I'm tired of like the the nitpicky and the there's obviously personality conflicts that we're not going to fix a fix like throw the elephant out there guys like enough's enough we're being so darn nitpicky about nonsense and we need to grow the hell up and say enough's enough and remember why we're here like I'm tired of this like trying to pick on each other and just say we don't like things because we didn't get our way

[04:40:00]
I'm sorry I don't speak so eloquently like many of you but come on like remember why we're here what the goal is what we're supposed to be focusing on and leave our own personal opinions to the side like this is crap already sorry I'm just putting it out there no one wants to say it no one wants to say like there's an issue with personalities here we're not all going to get along we're not all going to like each other but we are here for kids so stop with like the nitpicking it's getting frustrating and it's wasting our time thank you remember top your Romero I'm going to go ahead and call the question so we do have a motion on the table from Member Domingos and a second from member benefits to Amanda section 4K to add a party items will be announced during the president's report on the day can we have a roll call vote please Whitney

[04:41:00]
unresolved issues is there any additional amendments to be presented to the governance manuals on adopting the entire policy as amended we have a motion on the table from Member Jackson and seconded by member astorga any additional discussion on that mean Amendment before I'm sorry man motion before we move to a final vote so I the main motion is on the table but I will need to amend my emotions so I would like I would like to amend my my

[04:42:00]
main motion two states I move that we accept all proposed amendments all legal edits not formally discussed and all simple language changes not formally discussed thank you for the clarification and amending your initial motion member store are you okay with that Amendment yes thank you so we do have a motion from Member Jackson and a second from member of storegga to consider approval of the Amendments the aps Board of Education governance manual including all of the Amendments as discussed and voted on and the legal edits and other minor changes as were originally inserted but not discussed Dr Albright can we have a roll call please Courtney Johnson

[04:43:00]
so the motion carries and we will move on to agenda item number 8 which is committee chair reports we're just going to go in alphabetical order that would be audit Community engagement Finance policy and then student voice since this is one of our initial meetings of the year we are doing this opportunity for committee chairs to provide updates going forward we will go back to the expectation that shares are providing written updates of anything that the full Board needs to know in the weekly email so that I will turn to First the chair of the audit committee and just asked each chair to try to keep your report to one to two minutes okay so for the audit committee we started off with a the start off the year with a full presentation of the fiscal year 2024 financial statements those are listed on the aps Board of Education website I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Joyce Ramirez and her team for the very solid procedures they have regarding

[04:44:00]
any student funding and the solid work that they do to protect our student funding and just a reminder the reason that they're doing that is because when and if there ever is a breach that directly affects kids and it affects their ability to have the clubs or the activities that they want to do and so I'm really appreciative of Joy's Ramirez and her team for making sure that those procedures are followed so stringently so that's it thank you very much on to the community engagement committee turning to that chairman so we are in the process of conducting Our Town Halls we had some very good it has some very good Town Halls so far just to kind of give a brief overview let me get to my message so far we've had four Town Halls

[04:45:00]
we've had approximately well at 1 we had between 50 and 60 half of which were students many of whom helped the staff we had another event where there were approximately 15 people who attended we had a third event where approximately 80 people attended and then we had one where nearly 50 who were all students so I think we are in the process of reaching the community like we had stated we wanted to there are still three that will be are being scheduled right now so I look forward to those just a reminder to all of the board members please make sure that after you have completed your town hall that you put together a little synopsis of what you heard because the whole point of this is to report back to Buffalo airport members what we heard as well as the superintendent so please put together a brief synopsis included in the

[04:46:00]
Lance and then the community engagement committee will work on how we're going to combine all of the feedback that we received so please be sure that you're taking notes the other thing that I want to alert two more things I want to alert the board members to our two year calendar is coming to an end in May of 2025 so the community engagement committee will be working on a new two-year calendar if there are any events or ideas that you have for that please make sure you send them to me before our next meeting which is in a couple of weeks so please make sure you send me any of your ideas before we start working on that new calendar and then just the last thing I wanted to say thank you to is we have also started a focus on really bringing in like outside Community funding to help us to make sure that all of these wonderful

[04:47:00]
documents that we have when we go out to talk to the community are paid for not using funds that should go to students they are being used we are being supported by the community to work with the community and so I'm excited about the work that we've been doing there and I think we're going to have some really really exciting Community Partnerships moving forward so once those are solidified and we discuss them in the community engagement committee I will bring those forward as well but believe that that's all I have for you thank you and thank you for leaving that work we will move on to the committee report from the finance committee chair so what I've been really enjoyed about finances that we have moved in the direction of providing some summer reports of each item it will continue to simplify each topic and make it easy for everyone to understand how to dive into several hundred pages of

[04:48:00]
intentional about making it simple not only for us to read but also our constituents and when they look up things online it is easy to understand she is also been really intentional too about aligning now each item with our goals and how our funding is actually tied to the goals as a district so we will continue to do that and will continue to move forward as what we've been doing with our meetings I feel like we've been very efficient and those who are on the committee thank you for doing everything beforehand so our meeting runs efficiently thank you chair top your marrow we will now move on to the policy committee chairman goes we met on the most recent meeting allowed us to complete the work or accept the work of the policy diet at

[04:49:00]
committee they are I think we are finally through the entire policy diet and that will be coming we are recommending that it moved forward for full board approval in April we're not meeting in March due to the legislative session policy committee approved the final sections requiring archival we amended to accommodate special education parents rights or to clarify it make it more accessible more recommending you language or we will be in line with statute on tobacco use and am I missing something better I think a good clarifying conversation about the process

[04:50:00]
process in the governance manual review and yeah we won't have another policy committee meeting until Monday April 7th and the new time is 5:15 and I think that's I think that's it thank you and has giving us some feedback so I'm just going to read that the student gave us real quick this says my recommendation on my research is that the aps District first create a student advisory Council and then after holding the council for a year 112 students who have voting power on the school board I believe that having that advisory Council first will allow schools to build their network of a presenters and familiarize themselves with

[04:51:00]
District policy before an election the following year I also noted that in some districts are specialized advisory councils on specific issues such as mental health school safety etcetera this could be helpful for the district and could help support the needs of individuals in the community so our next steps with all the research that the internet has done is to serve a superset and then bringing the recommendations to the board to see what we decide as next steps I also want to just give a huge thank you to president Gonzalez for being the main contact of that intern and just for all the help that she has been on that so thank you thank you chair Astoria and so as a reminder if there are updates from committees to please submit those to myself and Dr Albright by Thursday the 12th Thursday at 12 p.m. so they make it into the out of glass if not they'll make it into the following week this is again because not all members on every single committee and so this is so we can ensure that everyone is aware of what's happening within all of those committees by keeping it in the other plans so with that will

[04:52:00]
move on to agenda item 9 which is the president's report so we'll start with public forum although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that you were heard and that we're working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that we heard tonight were regarding goal one accelerated learning progress teaching to the top the health education graduation requirements Public Funding following students reading and classroom material standards returning to education fundamentals science of reading studies Children Health and Wellness and student safety for upcoming meetings that are February 19th board meeting them we will have a conversation about goal to math proficiency right now we have number to Home Depot to facilitate that February 26th is our next finance committee meeting in March will hold the board meeting on March 5th and during this meeting will receive a presentation on goal 3 as well as a budget Pres

[04:54:00]
