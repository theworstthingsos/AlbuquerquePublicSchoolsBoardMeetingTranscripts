and so it's really important in the negotiations to listen to what are the conditions that are hindering the ability for teachers to do their job and our jobs as the district leaders is to remove those barriers to let teachers do their job and I think that listening at the table we get pretty far from being able to address a lot of concerns

[00:13:00]
what is happening on the other people's shoes and being able to remove some of those barriers to move forward in the best interest of our students thank you so I think that what that kind of goes to the other questions are these are some of what is overwhelming teachers are prohibiting their work with students things at the district is putting in place that we could take care of for teachers is it a federal requirement

personal attention that they need to be able to succeed in the class but

[00:21:00]
moving down the road I would like to see smaller class sizes to be able to address some of the needs of students I'd also like to increase the use of Wellness rooms in our schools and increase school-based health centers to give students the mental health support and the physical health support that they need in order to be successful there's a lot of things that are impacting our students in our community that can help us in working with our students and providing them the stability and the supports to be successful in the classroom and I think that means reaching our hand out a bit more and building those relationships and opening up our doors to our partners who can help us in addressing some of the social and physical well-being of our students in order to provide

what you're supposed to do and so I firmly believe that we need to provide schools the opportunity to solve issues for that particular schools of support for the schools based on how the schools are doing with their outcomes so I hope you really liked my graph that I showed you support

I remember a few years ago maybe 6 or 7 years ago we had a group of students begging the district to help them because they had had so many suicides at their school and it was really hard to see students literally begging for help from the adults in solving this crisis and being able to get help I think we have to listen to what our students are saying and what they need and we need to break down the barriers to provide that for them that being said I also think we need to increase access for our students and our schools to have mental health services at schools increasing School base Health Centers and increasing a partnership with outside providers to be able to help our students because they are here they come to us

[00:33:00]
to be able to open up access to provide Mental Health Services for our students doctor's appointment

what's keeping people from going into the profession that we're not going to increase the number of people going to profession I have a nephew who just in August stepped into his first classroom teaching special education and he probably gets really tired of talking to me but I'm actually trying to listen to him to hear from the ground like of the brand new teacher what is encouraging him to keep going and what's preventing him to keep going and I think that that is really important so that we can address the need to increase our special education teachers in the classroom and decisions are made in a way that everyone involved has input on the best implementation of those decisions

[00:40:00]
so I firmly believe that we need to listen to schools and that we need to give them more autonomy and decision-making and make sure that the district is serving as a resource in eliminating

play of collaborating and then we checked with building level staff by doing really short so it wasn't apartments on a consistent regular basis so that we had data sets to help evaluate

we need to work together to be able to support our students and to be able to have the opportunity for all of them to achieve their dreams and to be able to get to the highest level in their life that they strive to do and I know that we all are committed to being able to do that and that we can work together around our kids and so I think you for your time and we'll see you all at 6:00 thank you
