[00:01:00]
the first item for consideration and action is and this is a long one adoption of the December 19th 2022 special Board of Education meeting agenda and approval of the May 18th June 1st July 20th 2220 September 21st October 5th October 9th 19th November 2nd November 16th and December 7th 2022 Board of Education meeting minutes and the July 6th 2022 July 27th August 24th September 28th and October 26th of 2224 of Education meeting minutes they have a motion I would like to before we do I would like to remove Adam for oh I see because we're doing the meeting agenda you're right okay so item which one or B

[00:02:00]
10 + 4 B 13 so Wednesday equipment taken out of service the other one is not online tutoring and running for approval with those coming off concerned so anyone else have any other items to remove from consent this is Barbara I don't have anything to remove from consent however it would be approval of the minutes of the spelling of my name could be fixed in a couple of places so next time we removed

[00:03:00]
let's go ahead let's do the first ones will do consideration for approval of the December 12th 2022 Capital outlay Property and Technology matters that's items one through a one through six may I have a motion for approval for those this is Crystal some of the second this is supposed to yes yes yes yes the next item that will hear this is Adam B7 consideration for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service for August 1st August 1st to 31st of 2022 discussion action I know I got an answer to my to my question

[00:04:00]
and I had been told this is more about the Promethean boards that were taken out of service and I think most of them were from Highland High School but they've been taken out of other high schools including some on in my district and so I was told that they were being replaced but then I found out that they weren't being replaced unless they have the funds to purchase new ones and they are costly so my question is probably to Scott or maybe to miss Apodaca is if the schools don't have the funds to purchase new ones and from what I've been told teachers like having their smart boards and so if the school doesn't have the money and they're told they don't have the money what are the records do they have so board member Mueller Aragon it's funny you should ask that question because we had a big discussion just this afternoon about that

[00:05:00]
you're a topic so there are a number of funds that the technology department can access to purchase this equipment including the bond issue where we did put quite a bit of money in but one of the things I think you may remember that we talked about last year was that when we were forced into the one-to-one we discovered that between the amount of devices that we would need and the amount of help desk support we would need we were underfunding technology to stay at 1:21 so we are going to have to look at Future Bond issues and maybe having to shift some money that way so that we can handle handle that in the interim the technology department does have a request for funding which is a perfectly appropriate use and so we are looking at that as a way to shore up this immediate need and we have told the schools as of today to hold off on trying to purchase on their own now we do know there was about 39 schools that last year

[00:06:00]
Richard money from legislative request so those will go ahead as as as as as as as as as planned and I know that shell Marie Harris is here from informational technology and shall I don't know if you wanted to add anything to my 10,000 ft overview or or not a president and members of the board we educational technology are evaluating all the classrooms currently to see which class have new boards we do know that 39 schools are receiving some of the panels but they're not outfitting their entire schools so we were going to go go back through look to see an exact number of panels that are needed for all classrooms and then we can put it to budgeting okay can you just can you give us some ideas

[00:07:00]
what's the cost for purchase and where we you know where we see that going and how quickly it'll happen I would appreciate it thank you actually I can give you a little bit of an update so there is some money out of the Chris of funds that we have that has to be expended by the end of the year and we're looking at how we can transfer that to make that quickly spent and so we can get it done in time so that's about 20 million dollars right there I think the overall request if I remember right it's close to 40 million dollars because we're talking about because those boards are getting old and if you remember when those boards get old the screen start to fade and they're almost invisible so it's very very difficult to see unique opportunity with the federal funds Isley to make a major investment in some of the infrastructure now these new active views are a lot better than that they don't fade like the old ones do so it'll be a significant

[00:08:00]
any other questions all right we'll go out to item 14 considered disbursements for November 2022 and this is a discussion action and board member it was 13 was it 13 oh I'm sorry I marked the wrong one so let's go to 13 consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditures that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars online tutoring Services right and so I know I got some of the answers to my questions but I was talking to some teachers as a matter of fact today and there was a little bit of a concern because from the answer to my question is that the online tutoring will occur during the school day that's correct and

[00:09:00]
so the teachers are going to be teaching during that time when the kids are getting tutoring so it very much to me looks like what they told me is what it was similar to what hybrid learning was which was asking a whole lot from our teachers is trying to and I understand that the teachers are going to be teaching their children and the online person is going to be working with those students are the students not going to be in the classroom when the tutoring is going on if so I mean I mean I'm just asking for them because they were just worried that this was going to be that they were going to be asked questions and they're trying to teach their class well these children are getting online tutoring board member instructional people who are here to answer his question but I will tell you yes it will

[00:10:00]
and if you walk in these days you'll see the kids often times that your headphones on so what you could do is you could have a group of students who are struggling with arithmetic or subtraction or whatever the scale is and you can set up an online tutoring for them and actually the online teacher then we'll take the responsibility so it's not hybrid It's actually an improved method and there's we're really kind of excited about it because I think it'll provide support for our teachers and a tool that they'll be able to have an actual person to work with them and said just have to set it up themselves they still have to group the students appropriately they have to make sure that the and it's small enough that the online tutor can help and it's no different than having a station there's still going to have to monitor behaviors right but it would take it will not be hybrid instruction in that regard and I think what it was difficult for our staff was the planning and Preston when you had both groups this

[00:11:00]
play they'll be able to really focus still on the internal the students are working with while keeping an eye on the the kids at the station but I don't know if I don't know who's here to help with this this answer the door we do have Joyce Gormley or Dr Shanelle Segura here to answer for

[00:12:00]
are getting closed much more quickly than not and that they found that actually the high dosage tutoring that takes place in the classroom is more effective than outside of the classroom just like superintendent Elder stated this is a tool to help teachers when they are breaking up into small groups a teacher needs to give more focused attention to a group of students he or she can sit with that group of students if you have students who are more accelerated they can continue on and have a study group together if there's a higher order question that they're struggling with they can get on with a tutor at that time and that tutor uses an increased method to be able to support the learning and the critical thinking of the students during that time so again it's not

[00:13:00]
it's not taking away from the instructional time we encourage direct instruction but we also encouraged guided practice and independent practice and when students are engaging in that guided practice or independent practice they then have the opportunity to get some more focused attention if they need that one-on-one attention to break down a specific problem or concept and so this what we have learned is that this has provided teachers with the opportunity to be able to group students in a way where they can be more effective in the classroom after they've done the direct instruction and I know we have Amanda holdsclaw with paper and the senior partner director and I don't know if she has anything else to contribute thank you can you hear me okay

[00:14:00]
yes thank you madam president and members of the board superintendent Elder I just want to thank you all for your dedication and service to your community and I'm delighted to answer that question it's it's one of my favorites quite frankly is really how we work and partner with our our teachers and our classrooms and the dedication that paper has two leveraging and augmenting your initiatives we work alongside with an entire enablement team that's dedicated on how to help work with your teachers in whatever capacity they need that would best bring the paper education to help reinforce what they're teaching in the classroom so one example that you heard was small group instruction I'll give you an example of mathematics so I have an 8th grader and every day she's supposed to come in with her math and whatever

[00:15:00]
what we're seeing in our best use case scenarios are where the teachers may have rotating group so one group might be working on say math manipulatives another group is working on their homework and working with a tutor to answer some of the questions they might have had the reinforcements we get from teachers that once they start utilizing the application with their students they feel like they have just another qualified teaching assistant right there with them which they say actually freeze them up to really work in rotate and work with that individualized instruction moreover additionally what we also provide is writing reviews and so what many of my teachers are using this with their students are for intentional note-taking and so the students will do their intentional note-taking and they will submit it up to

[00:16:00]
paper tutor to review a Content specialist and they can review and say Hey you might have missed an area of these notes or some incomplete thoughts and really kind of work with with all of that we have an entire enablement team that will work alongside the curriculum folks to make sure that this is something that the teachers feel fully supported and one of my superintendents from a different District he called it the plate complaint he doesn't want to put more on the plate too much on the plate right so this is something really intended to help the students but also be a really great resource for the teachers as well thank you for the opportunity to answer any questions absolutely I mean that's just my concern and I don't want to put more on teachers plates and so you a short meeting someone that that's not going to chase the and you also said that direct instruction is not going to be effective so that's another important thing to to teachers as well

[00:17:00]
so is this is a question that wasn't exactly answered I asked what kind of and you Amanda would be able to speak to this is what kind of learning games what do their learning games really look like in other districts that have been using this program that is a great question and one that makes a lot of sense to ask what kind of response or return on this investment can you can you find one of the things that we just received from a third-party researcher is from the learn platform I'm not sure if you're familiar with them but they actually just completed their Essa levels of support and we just received level three four evidential support that this tool is in fact making gains and helping students rise in

[00:18:00]
is there whether you call it accelerated learning what what your choice is and helping them recoup some of those gains that we would like for them to see and and then I have case studies of of various school districts Valverde and California I believe one student he had a GPA of like 1.8 and over the course of a semester doing high dosage tutoring he was able it may have been throughout the that finishing of the year but he brought his GPS to a 3.4 and so I've got a district in Mesquite Texas that they've been using the solution for just at 4 months and they have had north of just about 375,000 minutes of time that their two their students have

[00:19:00]
add with a tutor almost half of that was in essay writing and review which saved teachers approximately 3,000 hours of initial review it gave them the opportunity that when they did review the writing that they were able to really put a lot more focus in on the content and so what we're seeing is just the quality of the work that the students are able to put forth is improving as well if you could possibly just get some of that data to us I would I would appreciate it all so you mentioned in passing about acceleration so those children that may not be behind you also will provide like acceleration for those children so they can even get further ahead absolutely great questions so when we're looking at individualized personalized instruction we certainly have students who are needing to close and achievement Gap

[00:20:00]
but we also have students that are really wanting to live up to their potential and as a result of of covid so much attention has had to be put towards closing that achievement Gap and accelerated learning and with the paper education we cover 250 different subjects all the way through calculus and the AP subjects and so your AP students they can reach and have individualized personalized instruction as well and our system uses something called a smart matching which basically means we're automatically integrated into your rostering and so our system knows if we're dealing with a AP student that is needing to be matched with an AP tutor versus if we're dealing with a student say in fourth grade that you need to have something that is age appropriate for that for that level so we match with their rostering so instantly their Dash

[00:21:00]
it's going to be a linking them to their classes and the tutors will be matched accordingly to those classes and levels is that helpful I'm very glad that that is going to to occur as well so then this is a question I'm sure you for sure know the answer to Amanda is when it comes to we know that many children struggled with online learning learning just didn't happen for many of them so this is also going to be online yes I know it's somewhat you know someone different than having one teacher with a whole you know group of children and it's a smaller smaller group but those children that struggle with online learning is your data showing that your program your tutoring is working for those students as well cuz those are the kids I obviously were very concerned about absolutely so some of the things that are very different from the online environment besides

[00:22:00]
what's the shock of it taking place taking students many students who also struggle with attention challenges to sit for a whole day in a virtual environment that was a bit much our data shows that the average session of a live session is around 23 minutes is the average session time and so that's a very different experience than having a complete online virtual environment when we work with districts that are focusing with a classroom integration where it is in teacher driven instruction but we're there to support that instruction it becomes like any other resource it becomes part of the integrated framework of that curriculum and so being able to come in for whether it's five minutes or whether it's 20 minutes or whether it's two hours that puts

[00:23:00]
student in complete control of whatever their need is for that so if a student just has a quick question and they want to get in and just validate that they were on the right track they can have a 5-minute experience and then they can move on if you have a student who really needs a lot more coaching and guided instruction to support them then they're going to have that tutor who will not terminate the the session until the the student does and and the and the and the tutor will always be reinforcing what has been taught in the classroom what's going on sharing the notes what is your teacher notes what is your notes say for this type of problem so it really does reinforce what the teachers doing live in the classroom doesn't take away face to face that is always preferred but it certainly gives that reinforcement yeah I just I mean I was a kindergarten teacher so having kindergarteners online those were the early childhood years were the ones that really just

[00:24:00]
for sure at the high school level but those younger kids just suffered so tremendously and I was talking today to a fourth grade teacher and if you can assure me and then I can assure her her students are the majority of them like probably over 70 some percent of them are at least at least 3 years behind three years behind yeah so and we've been looking at those Trends and how do we help those I kind of look at them as soon as they're kind of at that frustration brick wall right there so far behind they don't exactly know how to where to even start and so some of it is just taking away the anxiety related to The Experience so one of the things that we've Incorporated is trying to put some gamification into the platform

[00:25:00]
we're calling paper math and we have paper missions and it is a game of fight visualization of math and what we started doing is creating these challenges for students that they just get in Daily and they do one of these Math Missions and it's really fun and it's it's age appropriate for them and we have it for all levels of grades as well but we are seeing that that is one thing that's getting them into the platform taking away some of those reluctance and and putting some fun back into it we've also added live streaming of some paper live programs to help with some of those younger ages and then we've also just been launching voice notes for voice to text and reading as well for those young girls who who may be aren't where they need to be from like so they're sight words and we're from

[00:26:00]
on that standpoint and then adding voice notes which is also great for your bilingual students as well and you didn't speak about that but any of the bilingual program to be able to speak and be connected with a native speaker of that language and to hear it as well so if they are needing that audio support that's going to be available for them as well good thank you Amanda and this is probably going to go to doctor or to to Scott so those those students that have been identified I think you had said there was 6,000 or 7,000 that are over two years behind and you know who they you know you know who they are are they are those students that were really going to to focus on like truly focus on Scott or Dr Segura and then the other question I have when we look at how this is working how much time are we giving it to see if it really is working

[00:27:00]
for children so we have a 20 month contract with paper to be able to see for the spring semester we're going to have a campaign kickoff where we're going to inform staff trained staff as well as students and families on what this initiative entails and how it can be used to support a student learning and then there's a dashboard that we will be monitoring as far as usage at specific grade levels we have identified groups of students and teachers and schools are also able to drill down to those students who are that far behind this isn't going to be the only thing that's going to help those children it's going to be that more focused but absolutely this is going to help support some of those in-depth critical

[00:28:00]
kiddos and and just looking over in this 20 month period to see what do our games look like when we're looking at our interim assessments and then our summative assessments attendance all the things that this I feel can very positively impact by giving students an opportunity to ask those questions if they're struggling or embarrassed to ask him in class they can ask a tutor and get that one to one breakdown individually so I think that this will be really positive and then one more thing I want to say about it is the writing component in the listening session and listening to some of the groups we heard that you know our kids need to learn how to communicate and write better and as a former English teacher I think to myself if I was able to tell my students to have their essay or their lab

[00:29:00]
or whatever it would be cross curricular their extended writing pieces reviewed I mean given some feedback before they submit them to me that would have been really helpful and the reason I feel many teachers don't give extended writing pieces is because it takes so long to grade that this can really help with that time to be able to enhance and encourage and push our kids to write more extended pieces and be able to turn that around with some more feedback besides just the teachers which could take some time up to a month to get feedback which is a little too late okay so we'll have about 20 months and so we can put it if we think it isn't it isn't working for our students and we don't see the games that we want I hope and I don't know Dr Segura or Scott in your heads that you have an idea of what kind of games you want that would make it worthwhile I want to do every anything that's going to

[00:30:00]
how far are children ketchup help him help him get ahead anything that's going to work as a kindergarten teacher I'm not exactly fond of online anything but if it's going to to help I mean I'm willing to you know put my support behind it I just want to make sure that you all know what you think is going to be good gains for our kids and that if it's not happening that we can look at something else that might bring the goals next month and we start talking about interim progress that'll be certainly component of that conversation right thank you all right thank you any other discussion at the beginning of the presentation and I am now because when you first started talking it sounded like

[00:31:00]
a teacher could design a small group for intervention that would meet and would it be on a regular basis during you know the small group differentiated learning time so that a group would consistently be with the same tutor every day that time how do you have the capacity to have that kind of consistency and what's the structure for communication between the teacher and the tutor great question is that the question for me to answer so what I heard you say was that as the presentation went on it it prompted more questions for you in terms of

[00:32:00]
of how this would be implemented particularly if it's being used as an intervention approach from that standpoint and I will say that we one of the things that you will have with paper is we will be hiring locally what we call a customer success manager and this person typically usually has prior educator experience as well but this is your person that will be dedicated to meeting on a regular basis looking at all of your data not just paper data but all of your data and looking at your needs some districts do incorporate paper as part of their mtss program or structures so some of our districts will utilize paper as a tier one or a tier 2 level support if they choose and we absolutely can support that business decision if that's one of the ways that you want to incorporate it it's really hard I'm sure for you to understand all of the different applic

[00:33:00]
Nations because we we are there to support you in what other kind of framework that you want to use so if one teacher really likes those small group instructions and those rotations of groups doesn't actually have to be for a remediation or for an intervention it could just be the way he or she likes to conduct a classroom then it certainly can support that environment if it's going to be used as an MTS we can certainly structure it around mtss we have Avid support so if you've got Avid programs we can support from an avid perspective so there is not a one size fits all in terms of capacity of tutors we have capacity to serve 5 million students we currently have 3 million students on our platform and we are 24/7 365 Round the Clock tutors that also have supervisors that are on each of those shifts and so it will be

[00:34:00]
play led by the teacher as to whether or not some of our teachers will as part of that intervention say you need to 3 days a week have a 20 minute session with tutor and here's what we want you to work on with your tutor if that is the choice for an mtss in terms of the same tutor we actually for promotion of safety liability we take students safety as a number one Paramount priority for us some of the things that changes we made is kind of talking about early covid we remove video from that students don't like to be on video anyway so we had that that chat base but we also make sure that the likelihood of them having we have thousands of tutors so the likelihood of them having the same tutor on an online environment is is very unlikely because of the road of the rotation and so that is the one thing I do I do want to be your transparent about they won't have these same tutor in that

[00:35:00]
will have full access to the transcripts and the history as will the teacher the teacher will always be able to see every keystroke that is taking place in interactions with those tutors is that is that helpful yes it is somewhat concerning to me just because it seems like the children who struggled the most also need the most stable relationship with the person who is doing the tutoring University that was in their high dosage tutoring of the of the 10 different areas for high doses tutoring that is that is one that that personal relationship and so I don't disagree a face-to-face is is ideal in the environment of scalability and when we are really looking to in high doses tutoring really accommodating

[00:36:00]
list of 50 hours in a semester to help the students that are really trying to regain those grounds then then that is an area that consistency being the platform the format we all follow the Socratic method of education and teaching and his doctor said this is not the only solution that they're looking at helping those students that are those two years or so behind so I think one of the things that someone was why I ended up more confused at the end of the beginning is the sorry I have in my mind that it's basically teacher in the sense that if you put a group together as a teacher if you're putting together a group of students for targeted instruction on a particular learning point then that's really teacher directed in the sense of the

[00:37:00]
he went on that it could be more student directed the students working on something they need some support while the teacher is busy with another group and it sounded like some of the support could be much more student-directed for what that student needed help with at the moment am I miss reading this some districts will implement this as an after-school program that the students are basically looking to use on their own and that is that's not the kind of relationship that we have talked over the past six months and really looking at the needs of the district we really felt like bringing it in the classroom partnering with the teachers and helping them have this teacher driven environment and approach to it was what was going to be the most impactful for the students so it's really how we are looking to support

[00:38:00]
do your business decisions and bring you this in that classroom environment Dr Sakura is there anything you wanted to add to that yes and so I do also and correct me if I'm wrong Amanda but if a student you know has a tutor that really explains things really helpful for them the sessions are recorded and the student can save that session so that they can refer back to it over time is that correct absolutely so they're always able to go back to their history and they can look for that they could ask if that tutor was on shift at that particular time and and it's just a smart matching algorithm may not initially pair them with that but they could always ask if that person is on shift okay thank you any other questions

[00:39:00]
I was just going to say it so it is far less than ideal but I think we're learning that we just don't have the capacity to have all of the people in the building that we need to have in the building so this definitely sounds like a better alternative than another software program so I do appreciate that but I'll be interested in seeing what the outcomes are absolutely yes face-to-face is always preferred but the scale ability and still having lives so this is not artificial intelligence still having a live person working is is where we would like to be able to help thank you for your questions and comments thank you board member Jackson thank you so I have three questions and thank you Amanda for answering all of all of these questions that really does sound like it's a great program my questions are for the

[00:40:00]
Representatives so I don't know if that's Dr Segura and maybe superintendent Elder so my first question is and I'm just going to ask all three cuz they might all go together the first question is will the first statement is that I see that we have a scope of service but I don't see a contract in here and I think maybe my questions can be answered had I seen a contract but so the first is what guardrails do we have in place as far as the contract is concerned to ensure that the student outcomes the needs are being addressed the second question kind of related does the vendor have any sort of initiatives or goals that they need to meet during the course of this next two years to make sure that our student outcomes are being addressed and then the third question is what guardrails does the

[00:41:00]
go back to going to use or do you guys already have in place or have you been thinking about to make sure that this tutoring is maximized to the greatest extent and what made me think of that question Dr Segura is when you mentioned that it would have been really nice to be able to have your kids maybe have a have a second party review the document for they turned it in but besides having a kickoff what how are we going to ensure that this 2 million dollar program is being maximized to the greatest extent possible thank you so with the you can help me find Miss speaking here the signed I think it's a district support specialist I'm not sure

[00:42:00]
will be working with us with that kickoff but also with a a training plan to make sure that we provide our teachers with the training that they need to be able to implement it however they choose to within the classroom focusing on those high impact strategies such as you know having the students work in small groups with a tutor or individually or having their writing assessed and given feedback as far as you know we we really are trying to support our teachers to not give them more to do but to help support what they do in the classroom every day by bringing it all together and making it meaningful and so as we as we roll this out we are looking at what is that what does that look like we are still reviewing

[00:43:00]
the agreement so when you asked for the agreement we're reviewing it still because there were some things that were still working out with paper with our legal counsel and their their legal counsel and so we're working through all of that but ultimately I mean we're hoping that with what paper is saying that they can do to implement strongly within our district that we as the teaching and learning Department can see that through and support teachers and students working closely with this as a specialist to pull data regularly so that we can see which schools are using at the most teachers you know and really highlighting some of these best practices because sometimes teachers come up with the best practices and something that works for them so we want to be able to highlight that but overall just another layer of support so that teachers

[00:44:00]
comment for board secretary Jackson We Believe very much in our our platform and our tutors and our support so much that the guardrail that you asked about and mentioned we call that a performance-based agreement and so in our agreement that we're reviewing we are offering a performance-based clause where we agree upon a joint metrics and and Joint responsibilities if we do not hit a certain level of activities student engagement and activities that we agree upon there is a monetary rebate back to the district for that that is how strongly we feel committed to making sure this partnership is more than just a one-time contract signature and a one-time training the training for the teachers is virtually Unlimited

[00:45:00]
should and configurable and that that dedicated person will be a point of contact for facilitating your teachers with our enabling specialist and really personalizing for each there is not a one-size-fits-all and so working with your teachers personally any building Tech coaches anything like that that we would want to work and create Target approaches so just the longevity of our relationship is is committed by that performance agreement that we're offering it's just something you want to say I did but I kind of gave it up so okay well and thank you thank you Amanda for giving it up because that's what I was looking for was something that you weren't going to drop you know in January and then we wouldn't see you again for two years I would also strongly ask the administration to set some very specific

[00:46:00]
I'm going to assume or at least hope that this data will be included as we move to a dashboard that this data is going to be included maybe on a quarterly basis and but I that's that's what I was looking for and that's what I was hoping for that you said a performance there's a performance-based clause and so so that sold thank you any other comments or questions I would just follow up on that reminder that we have just be entered into a contract to begin training on outcomes based Contracting and so this next semester will be working with an agency on outcomes base Contracting just like this and we have an opportunity to write an RFP all by yourself next semester with guidance to begin that process we have a team of five that will be participating in that training over the next few months
