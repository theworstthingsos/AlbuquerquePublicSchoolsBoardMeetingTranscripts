do your commitment to transparency for your decisions in the processes and making those decisions that being said I would ask that you walk that talk in reference to the upcoming Board election and the change in voting districts in December 2022 the current APS Board of Education approved a change in board members districts which could affect the selection in truth even as a member of the redistricting committee I was because the aps website shows my district is 3 even though it will change I emailed the board of education office and was told that the secretary of state had already changed to the new District but the aps would have the current District's posted until January 2024 when the new board will take off office in my new District my purpose in coming to you is to urge you as a board committed to transparency to update your bored

[00:08:00]
website to address this issue and remind people to check their District through the Secretary of State's website the maps on the aps site can be extremely confusing I urgently request that the district website have this information on their homepage I highly request that the district reach out to all media Outlets to alert voters that they check if their district has changed and that they can indeed vote in this election as voters it is imperative that we take the right and responsibility to vote seriously but we cannot do this without accurate information the district responsibility your responsibility to transparent communication is Paramount thank you thank you is Jennifer Perez I don't know if China is here so we'll move forward

[00:11:00]
Minister I would like to like my comments recorded for public record please my speech is about protecting Children's Health and well-being not about being anti-gay or anti-trans gender transition and suicide it's hard to get solid data because this is so new studies are looking at all the generations there are online the transition groups with 25,000 Plus members many effects of the transition are permanent and cannot be reversed misdirected puberty and development voice changes must talk to me gentle surgery suicide a big lie that parents are being deceived that gender transition will reduce the risk of their suicide seriously according to CDC 85% of these are caused by emotions period

[00:12:00]
suicide rate Rose to 20 times that appears and I can quote imagine that transgender people happen to be one of your students or loved ones now Merit and transgender treatment for children that should be no medical or medical gender treatment for children under 18 years of age there should be extensive counseling therapy at time required before medical agenda transition is undertaken now without said how would you as a school board members help save our students from this transgender issue are you willing to protect our children health and wellbeing boat like your kids like to dance on it because it does not have a book period MD I think everyone that we're going to right now it's not good it's not accurate thank you thank you sir our next speaker

[00:13:00]
is Juniper dry if 2 minutes period I am grateful for the opportunity to speak here on behalf of the trans and queer Community it is always the most important for students to feel welcome and accepted and whatever environment they are placed in especially one where they are learning about the world around them from my own experience I can tell you that it is only when people are around you are not just mental about who you are that you can really flourish it is very sad to see children hide who they are and then attempt to protect themselves from being bullied or threatened both from other children but also from adults who have passed legislation that threatens their very existence data proofs time and again that gender a former care even as simple as using preferred names and pronouns is critical to clear Suicide Prevention public schools are places where children should feel comfortable to be themselves and

[00:14:00]
I have to feel discriminated against by peers or rules put in place against them no matter which source you choose to look at they all say the same thing Americans overwhelmingly support the trans community and opposed discriminatory bills and laws targeting trans people and trans children this number is only larger if you ask about the lgbtq community at large and not just the trans Community New Mexico has become a safe haven for Trans people and queer people and we expect this to continue into the future we hope that we can continue to rely on the board support of trans and queer people and we hope that the board will continue to oppose discriminatory action from the very vocal and small minority of people who would attack us to end I would like to address the queer community and the children You are not alone and they'll let me see him at times like the world is against you just remember that there are more people who are with you than against you we will not be bullied or coerced into silence thank you and translate always our next speaker is emery Schmidt

[00:15:00]
you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you good afternoon or evening it seemed bored thank you for inviting us to speak into space and lending us all your ears my name is Emory Schmidt and I am a resident of Albuquerque I am here today to share that this morning I had a lovely walk with my dog and this week I have interacted with store clerks bank teller is my therapist clients for work and my landlord's office and lots of other Albuquerque residents my life does not exist within a bubble of society where the only people who interact with me are the ones who have been taught trans people exist and so each of these activities has the potential to carry the pain of Erasure for me likewise discussions about racism are important and should be happening in schools if school is where we go to become productive members of society how do we expect our young people to do that if we challenged books and information that offer a full rounded picture of human life everyone benefits from perspectives that show racism in the United

[00:16:00]
what state is just as ubiquitous and relevant to understanding what it means to be American as the concept of freedom is I didn't begin to have access to the ideas that helped me understand the intersection of my identities as a white transgender man until I was 30 years old I am living proof that growing up being taught only one world view does not change who a person is at the core if I had access to this information in school I would have been able to live my life more early knowing myself much earlier and then at meetings like this a lot sooner and by the way I am less scared and more productive now than I was during the first 30 years of my life if limiting young people's access to information in schools is protecting them then what do you think I have been doing the last three years thank you thank you for next speaker is Nancy Sutton

[00:17:00]
do you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking members of the school board and audience Buenas Tardes as a retired teacher I believe students need to learn truth it's difficult to discern it these days books can educate students in learning different points of view from many cultural Vantage points and Lifestyles and point the way to truth students need to participate in an atmosphere that encourages free expression of ideas they need to listen to others and express their own ideas then students need to know history and how events impacted all people throughout its course books can provide this kind of knowledge

[00:18:00]
and wisdom students need to explore many points of view I believe this is one of the main purposes of Education to open students Minds to the world let them explore and see the world through books we need to for our children save our books teach our kids our next speaker is on zoo I am I'm sorry I apologize

[00:19:00]
what about APS a strategic goal one which looks at increasing grade level proficiency on Ela assessments from May of 2023 to May of 2028 as I understand it using Ela proficiency scores based on iStation assessment from the beginning of the year through the end of the year the final attachment to tonight's agenda has tables I guess prepared by Albuquerque schools which reflect scores for the various subgroups in the Yazzie Martinez lawsuit and my comment is focused on information provided for one subgroup that students with disabilities and there's two things I want to point out so if you look at students with disabilities in kindergarten first and second grade if you look at those scores that are provided in this table from Albuquerque Public Schools you'll see the percentage of students who are proficient falls from the beginning of the year to the

[00:20:00]
end of the year fairly consistently for students with disabilities so what I mean by that is last year when second graders started in APS 7.3% of second graders with disabilities were considered proficient at grade level or above in English language arts by the end of the year that had dropped to 5.4% so this is consistent for every year kids with disabilities start out better in terms of performance than they are by the end of the year when looking at assessments with regard to my second point it's important to realize that the percentage of students who demonstrate proficiency Public Schools so right now 16 for fall of 2023 16.2 per cent of kindergarteners are identified as proficient but only 10.7% of first graders are considered proficient

[00:21:00]
turn on the 9.2 percent of second graders are proficient so looking at the subgroup one has to ask how is it that students with disabilities receiving special education are becoming less proficient the longer there in Albuquerque Public Schools when compared to the standards and I would I realized that the board sets goals and the administration in the school district delivers but people have got to be asking what is the reading instruction that's being provided to students with disabilities because their English language arts performance drops the longer their Albuquerque Public Schools students and I would have to stop asking what is the specialized reading instruction with what frequency are next speaker is Colleen Gorman

[00:22:00]
Colleen Gorman of the microphone man you have 2 minutes and I just want to let you know that the change in the school hours for high school students has affected many families high school students are let out later than Elementary School students and the impact that has been on at least four schools that I know of but according to the City of Albuquerque family and Community Services Department by September they normally employee 150 high school students for after school programs however this year only 50 were employed so 50 so that means a lot of kids couldn't go to the programs and

[00:23:00]
after school programs and daycare is expensive for myself I've had to resort to donating plasma to pay for childcare and eating the lunches that the kids don't want at the end of the school day so that's that's my strategy as a teacher and an employer an employee here but I also want it as Dana to invite you to the November 9th pow wow that are high school students are putting together at the Albuquerque High School and that'll be in the afternoon starting at 4:30 and it'll go to 6 p.m. and Grand entry to close until 10:00 so November 9th they're also having a Halloween bash on the 26th of October which is next Thursday at 6:00 p.m. and that's free to the community to attend that and that Star constellation that I put together I brought in the Navajo Nation medicine Association president to do a lect

[00:24:00]
weather for APS Native Studies and well actually all staff and students that we can fit into the CEC planetarium that's going to be at 10:00 a.m. for the first group 215 for the second group that's for APS staff and students and then 6:00 p.m. for the community there are only $66 in there and it's outdated 70s technology but we managed to work with that so it's going to be a beautiful presentation bilingual in Navajo so that's all I want to say and way to go for the transfers I believe that the counselors at the upcoming professional development they should have a space for them to make their voices heard to to support them as well as native people's that's it thank you thank you our next speaker is Ashton Hill

[00:25:00]
you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you good evening my name is Ashton I am a transgender man I graduated high school in 2010 I started socially transitioning in 2012 and after 2 years of therapy and doctor's visits every 3 to 6 months finally hormonally in 2014 as a child I knew I was different I couldn't put my finger on it but it was made very apparent to me by most of my family members especially within my own home the place I was supposed to feel safe and secure made me feel like a captive privacy was non-existent there was not a single thing or place I had that was not gone through regularly for Imaginary drugs imaginary other things or anything that was considered contraband that day I woke up every morning counting down the minutes for when it was time to leave for the bus the bus was my transition time from home to school having to feel from having to feel scared and restricted and watched

[00:26:00]
constantly to just being a teenager trying to pass math class I don't know whether it was a blessing or a curse not knowing that transgender folk existed in that I am one of them I believe that had I known had I had that language as a child as a teenager it would have helped me so much with my devastating mental health self-harm would have been done less and most definitely not because I thought there was something wrong with me a study on the study on the Pew research Center's website shows that America America that in America 37th of the population have negative view of lgbtqia folks with 19% believing it is actively harmful to society this is an obvious consequence of trying to erase the queer Community as a whole queer folk have existed since recorded time and most likely further back our history is Rich and vibrant full of trans men and women who have changed

[00:27:00]
Sylvia Riviera Frida Kahlo Bayard Rustin and if Nassim just to name a few of many Banning books will not only increase this lack of knowledge about a group of folks who have been very persistently present in history it will other lgbtqia and especially transgender students it will lead to bullying bullying as many of us know can and often does lead to self-harming behaviors deteriorating deteriorating mental health and isolation as someone who was aggressively isolated from the world and its history isolation is more damaging than any book could ever be to a child please we have always been here we will always be here and we will not be silenced thank you

[00:28:00]
and that concludes public forum thank you I just want to thank you and your willingness to come and speak forward it's always great that we can share differences of opinion and that we can also have the decorum that we had tonight so I appreciate everyone being here tonight listen to you and we always have to move on from public forum it's not a time for us to have any solutions or a conversation with you but thank you so much so we're going to move on to our next item and this is going to be a focus on our student outcomes Focus governance and tonight we're going to be considering the acceptance of a progress monitoring reports for goal number one in Chrome goals 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 that's focused on early literacy and our presenter tonight our superintendent Elder doctoral Chief academic officer Dr chanela our chief of schools and

[00:29:00]
Chris Chris West from our information team so I guess before we get started on that usually what we do is I know I'm trying to think of like my standard protocol I mean we've all received our the reports we received the the information so the first thing that we need to do is like did those reports that you know show what's being monitored we've got goals or interpretations of that do they have data for the three previous reporting periods and you know does it clearly show the targets reporting the periods and so does any do any of the board members have any evidence that it didn't include that because that would help us in terms of before we go into our discussion are we ready for discussion presentation

[00:30:00]
you think it's good yeah yes ok Google that was like trying to think of always the standard of the show for our audience members and for the the community is that the first is we've received some progress monitoring reports we do post them for transparency which I think is really great so that we can engage Community it was great to have a public forum guest tonight who obviously is read the report and so it was nice to have that we know that that's being read so with that what we'll do is we'll go ahead and go through each of the reports and going one by one that's go through the whole entire report so what we have and then we'll engage in some questions I know that there was a lot of questions that were asked and we had an opportunity to do that before which were all supposed to but we'll go ahead and yield the floor to superintendent Elder and your team Madam president of the board thank you for allowing us to beer tonight

[00:31:00]
before I begin sort of going through the porch with you I wanted to talk about something that is come clear and I want one of you asked a question I believe it was and we wanted to sort of clarify something there's a weird thing going on with the free reduced lunch population and we want to make sure people understand that and it's something we've talked about with the public education department and they're working on it so when you talk about free reduced lunch population we usually use that group and the date is collected for different entities so one we collect it as accountability okay so the accountability department has a definition Title One all the federal programs collected for funding and they have a definition and when you are looking at welfare and then the ability to have the support that you need for your family turns out that the definitions of little different in each of those areas and how they

[00:32:00]
find produce lunch is different for the purposes of accountability the definition is a student should is able to go into their school cafeteria and have a free meal well as you may know the state this year has gone to Universal meals which means that on the definition of free reduced lunch population for accountability 100% of our students are eligible so that number looks a little strange in terms of what our data looks and you look at the charts you always going to find this one dot and that one is the produced lunch population but that's all everybody so just so you know that's in there like I said we'll see what happens with the state and how they Define it and when you look at the different definitions it has impacts because it changes the group from last year prior years and so it does have impacts on how the test scores look and

[00:33:00]
that's the concern is how do we have something constant measurable moving forward and that will have to be defined at the state level so just so you have that in your head so goal number one is you know is the percentage of third grade students identified in the Aussie Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above on the state English language arts summative assessment and it will increase from next to why and that's what I have in front of me I think we have a number oh that's right it's still sorry one looks at kindergarten students all right so looking at iStation we're looking at an increase in 22.6 percent in May of 2023 to 28.6% in May of 2026 and again you've got three years of data there in front of you can see the red is the overall growth beginning middle end Yazoo Martinez and African-American students are the blue line

[00:34:00]
turn all others are the The Gray Line and so you can see progression mostly through there just on the overall the Ozzie Martinez group and the other students moving on to what is going well we know that all schools are working together to ensure alignment with their 90-day plan and go one I think that's one of the biggest shifts that we're going to have in terms of the fact that you guys sent these goals allows the schools to have a very clear alignment we're getting a lot of very positive feedback from the schools is saying okay we know exactly where to focus now districtwide adoption of Court Ela and phonics for all kindergarten classrooms is occurred District white adoption of phonemic awareness curriculum for all kindergarten classroom we are looking at District white adoption of iStation personalized reading intervention for kindergarten teachers to use up to 8045 has been established to monitor

[00:35:00]
support the use of District to prove highly qualified instructional materials in grade level standards in kindergarten classrooms principles now have access to a New Mexico public education department structured literacy walkthrough tool elementary schools are posting scoreboards detailing the progress of the school-wide wig or wildly important goal kindergarten teachers are in the process of completing their letters training which is a state requirement as well as Elementary principles are still in the are all in the process of completing letters training which is a state requirement of course letters language Essentials for teachers of reading and spelling at this point all well elementary schools have at least a 90-minute literacy block and 32 identified elementary schools are participating in year three for intensive preparation and special education

[00:36:00]
clean up in 32 of our schools the weeda screeners being administered to schedule on schedule to ensure students who may need English language services are properly placed in classes and the beginning of the year iStation reading scores for all Yazzie Martinez subgroups as well as African-American students were higher than the previous year what is not going well obviously we need to increase the use support and follow up for the use of District supported and adopted curriculum based on the recent adoption of iStation reading intervention there is a need to provide training for all kindergarten teachers that's a recent adoption we need to make sure the training is appropriate and effective and helpful and then currently where is we're in the process of white walk through tool is not been developed not all elementary schools have posted a scoreboard detailing progress of the school wide Wiggly important goal and there is a disconnect communication between state required training to all

[00:37:00]
what's the painting Eclipse schools and that's been something of an ongoing discussion between APS and the state looking forward the district will provide adequate professional development for implementation of new and established core instructional materials and intervention programs the district wide walkthrough tool is in the process of being developed to be able to collect data to inform progress for guardrail 3 high quality instruction kills grade level standards and Innovation all schools will have a posted scoreboard by January of 2024 we are going to work collaboratively with Ted to address timely communication concerns regarding the eclipse training and work with principles to ensure to monitor Synergy reports to ensure that 100% of students are appropriately scheduled to now looking at first grade students it's the same goal but the percentages are different so we're showing that students will demonstrate grade

[00:38:00]
Marvel proficiency above is predicted by iStation will increase from 17% in May of 2023 to 23% in May of 2026 again you look across your sheet there you see the the odd dot with the all other students but you can see the the growth and where they've where are the issues are and and where we need to improve so I don't really see it's really pretty much the same in all three as far as what's going well and What needs to improve because it's similar in in many ways again the walk through tool the need to provide the the Intensive training and make sure the Intervention Program is being utilized properly continue to work with Pat around Eclipse those areas of growth and first grade as well and then finally the third grade students the same

[00:39:00]
demonstrate grade level proficiency or above as predicted by I station will increase from 18.3 percent in May of 2023 to 24.3 per cent in May of 2026 you can charge the progress there there's a little flatter progress I believe in this great special last year we have the access I was interested in looking at 2018 you see this sort of big pop then it goes very flat and 201920 and then it has a pop again in 2122 and then it kind of goes flat again in 2220 so at this point we stand open for questions thank you I just want to thank you it was nice to have them at

[00:40:00]
Simon having the opportunity to to get to our questions so I really appreciate all the effort that's going into I think we're kind of starting to get into a rhythm here around progress monitoring and the importance on that so I'm going to do now is just you know open it up for some questions sort of thinking about you know where we are on the kinds of questions that we can ask I may have give a little Grace for us that there's a couple of technical questions that need to be asked tonight but I think for the most part if we've got some you know if you all are thinking strategically and you've got some strategic questions around what we were learning from this report or your thoughts on that and I'll start with board member controls thank you for the data and for the ease of use really appreciate that my question is around targeting resources so throughout

[00:41:00]
weather report I see a lot of district-wide all schools all teachers all district and I'm curious how might we target our resources to the kids who are most in need so there was a point where I asked is it possible to find out how many kids in the district or a year to a year and a half behind in reading and the answer was yes and you gave us the number if we know who those students are how do we target resources to them so the question is what strategies are we using to Target resources to the students who need the most I think I can answer that but I'm going to let doctor Gonzales because I believe it started around the walk through that we began the last couple years and the way we broke down the date with the schools when we met with them as individuals so I'll let you answered thank you come to mind the first thing that I would say is the recent Ernest work that we've done has really prompted conversations around

[00:42:00]
that very Topic in very intentional ways and perhaps ways that we've not thought about in the past so I do want to just that was the first thing that came to mind when I heard your question the second thing that I would say to superintendents Elders point and I do want to point out that it is a next step in the 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 he is the common District wide walkthrough tool that we are working to complete in support of guardrail 3 which directly impacts go one and two specifically so this walk through tool is being billed as we speak in fact we had a meeting today to put the beginning of the finishing touches on it because we are going to be accountable to you as a board I believe in August to report on guard rail 3 Again part of that tool part of that exercise is aimed at

[00:43:00]
play looking at these measures and what is working what's not working and will inform directly resource allocation in regards to what we're seeing or not I'm a little I want to add to that because I'm not quite sure you got what I was hoping to get to that's okay I didn't give you much of a lead up last year when we went out to the schools you asked me to do instructional walkthroughs I did a series and I continue to do that the Associates at that time meeting with the school they had a team of people come in and they laid out in front of them specifically to here are your students who meet this Sunday period and they were laying it then and trying to see where the students aren't just one right there multiple groups and they were beginning to see how you had these sort of super impacts kids that could have a really large impact

[00:44:00]
and if you could really begin to focus on improving structures for them but then yeah school scores would go up obviously but I think you're also really trying to improve instruction overall and it was really getting the schools to reconsider how they looked at their student body and how they were utilizing their teachers internally and I think that was a really key step and I think your question of look at these students who are a year to year and a half behind adds another layer of data that we could contemplate for our schools as they look then as a district once we get things settled consistently across the district now we have another we have really intense school like school by school which should allow us to reconsider what type of resources were in many cases this school needs way more intervention so maybe we need to load them up on Intervention stuff instead of you know I mean just

[00:45:00]
play get more that direction they're moving in that direction with this type of work and if I may just follow up now that I've been prompted by superintendent Elder there's a lot to talk about exciting work to the walk through process that I described is always followed up by a debrief which is superintendent is getting and we have been using even before the establishment of the goals the Yazi Martinez subgroups as the conversation point in regards to the data and we're prompting pushing our schools to really look at growth or lack thereof and how it is correlated or not to the resource management of their campus and to really guide them through a protocol to see how are at risk funds being used how are Title 1 funds being used how are if you're a family index school how are those funds being used

[00:46:00]
very intentionally within the confines of the scope of work to really meet the needs of these sighted students of tearing resources and so what are the strategies for supporting deep and effective use of mlss at the school level is one of the things that we're really excited about is just very recently the board approved for MLS coaches by the state funded for us to have to Foster promote and really honestly see the mlss process take Route in Albuquerque Public Schools in a more profound and meaningful way so that work is beginning

[00:47:00]
and that work is going to hopefully be lifted up in pretty exciting ways in the very very near future go to do you want me to come back okay how about if I go to board member Peterson online with us have any questions I was planning to do that is like you know round robin on each other's comments that way don't have one board member who doesn't have to say I'm good

[00:48:00]
I'll just practice by I really appreciate the work that all of you are doing it is no small lift what what you put in front of us and I really recognize that and you are really echoing and being responsive to the requests of the board and so I I truly appreciate all the work that you're doing and anything that I say critically is is sort of outside of that because I want you to know how much I really do appreciate the work what a quick question and this and I thought of this when one of our public forums speakers with speaking is there any way and I know everything that we do is fraught with with both positive and negative repercussions but thinking about our specialist data is there any

[00:49:00]
play to analyze that special ed data based on the goals of an IEP and I know it takes it outside of what is State mandated and at the same time whether whether it's a gifted student with with exceedingly high goals and benchmarks or students that are struggling with with whatever disability they may be dealing with to have a true reflection of how we're serving special ed students it does seem like there should be some tie to IEP goals for my clarification to in terms of relationship to us so are you thinking about the structure of that IEP in terms of the structure piece around

[00:50:00]
any IEP will have math goals reading goals whatever the target area in of need for a particular student is and I'm just thinking that it is not that we don't want to increase in Lee and always have an awareness of all of the talents and potential that students that have an IEP are capable of and at the same time when those students are simply put together with with all other students I just I'm not sure I mean I would appreciate hearing some feedback for how do we show either positively or negatively that we're supporting students with disabilities in an appropriate way with an appropriate curriculum

[00:51:00]
and it may be it may be different from if maybe the same it may have simply modifications and accommodations or it may be something else and I'm just wondering how to see okay so I think I see the superintendent wanting to jump in here so before we go down because I go ahead superintendent I'm not sure I want to jump in I understand and if you want to defer I'm willing to defer that but I think it I think it's an issue that should be on the table at some point okay the the short answer to your question is no what you're asking is is impossible whereas we do chart individual progress on individual students and progress towards goals there's no Central data point and

[00:52:00]
the way this is measured into a common assessment and basically what you're saying is is there a way to look at their progress off of the different sort of assessment that's aligned to their goals and right now that's just not something that could be done in in this particular system that's the short answer the concerns around special ed but I think it's the it's the Curiosity about you know what that means and how we get to the end result in sort of looking at that subgroup so I'm going to move to a next question and then I can come back to you board member Peterson so that we can think either you have a follow-up or you have a new question so I'll go to board member to Mingus

[00:53:00]
okay so first I have a technical question just so I'm clear about and forgive me that I was inundated after having too much fun for 16 days but so I didn't get my technical questions in and I won't give them all to you but I have one that impacts the rest of my questions I'm looking at the data for interim 1.1 and 2018 to 2019

[00:54:00]
phone number Dominguez just this date is iStation data and one this is not the State Assembly so that state assessment question was related to another question mark

[00:55:00]
something that is on a score report card that will be that early literacy assessment so for the for our goals and guardrails this station has been a consistent data point okay so here's my follow-up question in interim goal 1.1 in that graph who are the students in special ed e l l i mean who are the students under that category special ed if there's a way to let us know how many else are included in that how many people are not very very

[00:56:00]
disadvantages been changed so they're always going to be around the same numbers for instance students with disabilities that was third grade so that was 1,000 53 that year for the 2001 and 2022 school year at the 2001 2021 2022 school year and so you'll see that numbers to go down a little bit every year so My point that is that third grade will be higher than second grade which will be higher than first grade and kindergarten is that students are in school identification rates do go up right but like with in that category how many of those special education students with disabilities are Native American how many are Title 1 to you it is available on APS dashboard if you do

[00:57:00]
clicking but I'll be more than happy to provide so if we could for one year for example well know but provided as you as you can but for me it would be helpful to know who are so back to the Kinder graph right we have in 2018 to 2019 % of special education students with disabilities by

[00:58:00]
by demographics like Native Americans how are Native Americans Ells and title on kids represented in that does that make sense and the same thing for and the free and reduced price meals you know that at the end of the year we have these great increase

[00:59:00]
doesn't mean that small doesn't matter but when I get down to lower than 10 or 10 is the press that data just because we don't want to identify so they're always some concerns we start crossing the categories what are the wrong numbers Behind These percentages how many I do and I'm sorry for interrupting but I know the numbers get like really smaller but like in general the kids in special ed is you would like to kind of know how many are Native Americans Etc what percentage may be our Native Americans Or Hispanic or free and reduced lunch is that

[01:00:00]
talking about I mean that would probably be an easier if you just did it by percentage that are in the program rather than maybe the numbers I don't know what just the basic breakdown like you know how many Native Americans special education that's on the website under the special ed visualization so you can actually it is there when you start combining multiple filters what do we know about the students mentioned in the report which is about I think we're trying to get at but it's who is struggling the most who is growing the most who is not moving which students are not included in the data so I feel like those types of questions will give us what we need more because I want to be mindful of not asking for stuff but it's not

[01:01:00]
relevant directly to the veterans like there are there's probably there's certainly data about maybe over identification of subgroups and special education we might want to look at that but that's not our interim and we didn't mean it and so I think we just need to be mindful about not putting that extra work on the administration yeah because I'm also concerned about the the purposes of this report is to show or just so percentage of proficiency in this is well and not necessarily I mean because what we're seeing is that like overall if we're just looking at our overall population which I think is what we're concerned about and if you're looking at the overall proficiency of our special our students with disabilities and special it's still very low I don't for me it doesn't necessarily matter what race or category that they're in I'm just more concerned about the special ed proficiency still being low with regard to all the other categories so that student who drops into that subgroup

[01:02:00]
they are falling way behind on proficiency and I think so so I tend to agree with that but maybe perhaps if you can get you know a little bit of assistance in terms of using separate to see how our students are breaking out because all that number is available in terms of like the number of students we have in special ed because this is not demonstrating basically the number they're only is just that percentage of the students that are in that population that are that are proficient so and and I agree with Mr West I think it could get really dicey because that 7.7% could be like two students are represented from a particular group been another you know so so we'll just we'll just hold on that for a minute do you have another question or remember that you know about strategy or just an overall okay do you want me to

[01:03:00]
talk to you okay all right let's go to board member Mueller Oregon so I just want a quick one before I ask one of my questions is when you came up with the you know combined the Ozzie Martinez and African-American students and they were given one overall score so you took all those groups right that belonged to the Aussie Martinez and then added in the African-American students and then how did you do that Mr West did you just like average that out I know it probably isn't that simple I just want to have an idea of how you got to that number for President right so what we do is we say so in the decision and African students there's five groups that were looking at right so we say okay we're going to look at

[01:04:00]
are race and ethnicity so we use the 7 Kate is required to be reported by the US Department of Education so we say are you a Native American in there up you make it in or are you like it in then we go and we look at we say special education are you okay you're in are you in because you're special it could be any of those categories so they go in there and we say of all these students how many of them and that's how they come up with the right so it's not an average yeah the kids in that group how many were professional assessment or in the case of the term goals would have been on iStation okay and you know it was in a simple just like I was close okay so then when we are looking and this is my what what are you learning from students so

[01:05:00]
I'm looking at all other students and I think it was 66% of all other students were at were proficient or at grade level and so I'm assuming those all other students are the Asian the white those aren't that aren't economically disadvantaged etcetera so I'm assuming that who the other students are so when you're looking at that 66% that are at grade level or proficient like what what can you or what have you all learned from these students that might be helpful for those Yazi Martinez students I just want to know and I don't know who would answer that question what I mean I just want to know what you when you're looking at that there's such a discrepancy obviously right in in that total of 66% and I don't remember what the other

[01:06:00]
what is 30 minutes period and then it has proficient at grade level and it has 22.7 and then all of the students it has 66.0 and so all other students was the list that I gave you so I just want to know when you look at that and there is a you know there's discrepancies like everywhere but when you're looking at them like we are focusing on those yes and those African-American students but we can always learn something from looking at that other number and I just want to know what have you learned that we could possibly use to help those other students

[01:07:00]
if you have if you you know where we have to learn something from the data there's reasons that this is this is happening I would say it this time that would be a very difficult that's a question I need some time to think about that would be difficult to answer I mean there's some some quick answers and some of these children are not in the fridge population and they have certain advantages I'm not sure I can learn something from that it does talk to I think a lot about you know parents being able to support with their children and having environments that are safe and secure

[01:08:00]
and making sure that all our kids have that and making sure that school provides the resources it's this kind of help get this kind of your community school thing that you believe in and it's so important the Community Schools Provide support for families that give them the opportunity their kid can actually actualize what they can do and they don't have to be stressed and worried about things that are outside of their control and focus on the test that quite frankly sometimes probably doesn't mean a lot to that child in that moment so you know it talks to Early Education and talks to preschool and the damages that people have and I think it's important so what we're doing their more thinking about we can't control what happens in homes we just can't we can't do that and I recognize that I know everybody here recognizes that so I'm just

[01:09:00]
don't worry about what can we learn that we can do for these children at school because we're not going to give them the salary that maybe some of these children's parents that are in a higher SES have we're not going to be able to give them that what can we give those kids that we learned that we can possibly give them at school that's I know that might be hard but it's it is hard and it's a it's a very complex answer but I think it points to board members of the programs that we provide that go a little bit beyond it's just a classroom breakfast after the Bell making sure kids have clothes making sure that we respond when a child says there and Trauma or stress again some of the programs will begin things like that the investment we've made in early childhood and trying to make sure that our kids we know that you look at our data a lot of times it looks like our kids make a Year's worth of growth in a year

[01:10:00]
and we never catch up I think it speaks a little a lot quite frankly to the goals you've established and the Strategic plan that says that we need to really focus on engaging our students and that we really need to work on rigorous instruction especially for those kids that fall outside of the the subgroup that succeeding why do those kids succeed I think there's a lot of answers for that and some of those things are outside of our control as you recognize so what we can control is environment we create inside the schools to support all students in their learning and like I said some of those are real basic Metals in some of them go down into the instruction and how we work with those kids to that if we were to look at those two you know do we have a number of

[01:11:00]
this particular children that are sort of clustered in certain places too right cuz I think they're clustered in certain neighborhoods in certain communities as well which I think is also indicative of you know just sort of a difference in economics a difference in community support or difference in just the makeup of that because I you know when I look at this I automatically go I know the majority like a large majority of these students that are in that Yahoo's decision that 22 percent large number of those students that are clustered in certain neighborhoods that and when I think of the neighborhoods where I represent it's very significant terms of the things that you see because it's a difference between a school being 100% title one and a school being less than that so I think I think we could

[01:12:00]
I won't say anymore I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt oh no that's fine cuz we can all we all add something and we pray a lot of the same and of course I've been concerned about this since I got on the board just kind of just knowing what can we do what can we not do what can we learn what have we learned yet I mean there's always a way to get better and I just want to make sure we're getting better with these kids and we're learning from those other there are always those children out there that we need to look at that are they're breaking that mold though they're in that group but they're not and they may have a difficult situation that they live in at home or come from an economically disadvantaged I mean those all those things but we can learn something from those kids that are still performing and there's something to learn and I think we need to make sure that we recognize it and we learn so thank you all right I'm going to come to myself

[01:13:00]
since I get to participate in this and and I just want to say I think what I really appreciate about where is this the first glance and I appreciate the Curiosity in terms of looking at what the data how we look at it cuz I think from gives us a baseline looking forward then we can start to really discern what's what are those areas where we saw growth we learned something and so I guess for me on the review of the status what other strategies are we thinking about to assess student performance because I think you're looking at this we're seeing this is coming up things are coming up and down listening to our public forums speaker to our are you thinking about any other strategies to assess student performance that would help us to tell us that full picture of what's what's working well oh please I was going to say we are for the purpose of this report

[01:14:00]
we we specifically looking at goal one and the interims we have developed a goal one team who we are cross-departmental working together to hone in on what does this look like to bring resources and human capital together at the district level how are we then communicating that and embedding that within the schools and then how does that get to the classrooms and the student and so I think our focus in and of itself has just shifted in a very different way when we look at assessing we assess from a bird's-eye view here at the district level the schools are really digging in to their iStation data and that is informing their next steps in the classroom

[01:15:00]
and what we encourage is as we have District goals are wigs are schools also have those and their you know embedded within the classroom so if we're focusing on third grade literacy literacy within our school is our priority is our wig then what does that look like in the classroom so classrooms are then creating their own wigs and then the kids are monitoring their own wigs and it's it's this different shift and momentum and focus and how we're all working together with the schools and with each other that I think is going to is going to be a big difference and what we see so when I think about assessment it's not a different assessment as how we're using the assessment and the information that we're getting and then how in return what we're doing with it you answered my question because I'm not a teacher and I I think of Assessments differently but I mean you answered my question it's really it's kind of like what are the strategies that

[01:16:00]
that are floating down to this process to sort of like really take the Deep dive and being that Curiosity of to get to board member Mueller articles to like what's really working or what's making a difference for some of our students but it sounds like there's this teared approach and if everybody is taking that opportunity to do that and have that Curiosity that's what that's what it lends because my question after that was like around you know I see where we have we're talking about like what's working what's not working and strategies and it looks like District level to me but what you've just described is that there is a partnership and what are those strategies that are being used that are being informed by our teachers too right so that there is this kind of like top up stuff as well where it really demonstrates that collaboration or that collaborative partnership so that hopefully you also learn something right there is a shift in

[01:17:00]
if you're not just our expectation going down this way but it could also potentially come up and inform the district in terms of some different strategies so you answered my question dogs to go to that was that was what I was I was hoping to hear okay so I'm going to move on to board member Gonzalez thank you the big question is what are the strategies to increase specifically I'm curious about the status of the mou within the CDA around engaging teachers to co-develop instructional resources and scope and sequence and sort of all of that work in a Toyota Corolla Gonzalez two things the first thing is on a weekly basis we need to with the committee known as sqt the strengthening

[01:18:00]
opening on strengthening quality teaching and we go over the very topic you've described in launching the relook update of the units of study in relationship to guardrail 3.2 which is grade level standards so that work is dynamic is underway we are moving in that direction and it's been a fun group to be working with the second part of your question was in relationship to how do we monitor the use of high-quality instructional mature no no more strategies to increase the use of one of the strategies is monitoring what we're seeing in the schools the feedback that we're getting to launch our walk which is going to be District wide

[01:19:00]
we are going to be working with the teams that Dr Segunda described at the elementary middle and high school level to really monitor these areas as a coaching and support part with our schools on an ongoing basis that's going to say to that and actually still one of the things that we proceeded with last year was the training so that is we bring in new materials that the vendors are more invested in the professional development and the support for the staff and they have been traditionally it used to be by the stuff and come in and do a quick 3-day training roll out the door and never be seen again without comes base Contracting we're building in some incentives for them to hang around to provide some help desk for teachers you need more so that's in progress and only good for new materials

[01:20:00]
that was not really in place for anybody else we purchased it beforehand but I do know that we've discussed extensively the need to probably go back and reoffer professional development around those materials people will use them if they feel comfortable using them and I think a lot of people either didn't think that PD was enough got comfortable you know what however you want to look at it we are going to have to incentivize the use of those materials as well we also have really put in a strong concerted effort to in the adoption of materials getting valuable input from stakeholders especially from our teachers who we want them to want to use the materials that that are chosen and so that then plays and ties into the professional development that we're offering and I want to just kind of lift up Dr Gonzalez and his team and the Department's for how they are crafting The Professional

[01:21:00]
development in our district to align to the goals and the needs that that we're seeing and so it is a heavy lift to try to train at all levels in all areas within a district discharge and they we just had our first district-wide PD session and the feedback we received from teachers on the math specific professional development was outstanding I went through and saw and it was just a few teachers said that it was not helpful and there was just a lot of positivity and excitement around the use so I think that is a strategy that we are using is making sure that we're providing these opportunities to give teachers and principals we're not just training the teachers but also the principals on what to look for how to support their teachers and they use of the curriculum and I think as long as we continue doing that

[01:22:00]
and being that support system it will continue to increase the use of a board member Peterson observation tool for why was the decision made because I don't I'm not satisfied with the answer that I got the iStation is being used

[01:23:00]
which is being used consistently across the district so I can make sure we're doing with these internal data points is making sure that we have a data point that it's consistent and also extremely as external validity to it so one of the needs for that is to make sure that we're using is assessment that's just not being used in APS something that is being used for nationally so that I have more data points to be looking at reliability and validity so that's why the one is being used of course it doesn't mean that our teachers aren't using their own formative assessments that are linked to their to their units or to the curriculum that they're using but this is just to make sure that we have something that we can consistently look at over time that we know is predictive of the performance on the state assessment so that's why we're using that's why you're seeing this data point being used for each of these internals so

[01:24:00]
I'm I'm going to put Ashley if Ashley is listening I will apologize cuz I'm going to put her teeth on edge and and take a bit of a point of personal privilege and again apologies to our presenters because I think you're working incredibly hard to follow the direction that the board has given you but one of the reasons why I ran for the board is because I am so deeply concerned about what's happening with kindergarten children that using computer based assessments for where they are developmentally is so absolutely inappropriate and to look at what curriculum is being adopted and say that some Publishers period

[01:25:00]
rather than looking at what's developmentally sound for what students need is going to put us off base in a deeply ongoing way that I mean I'm encouraged I know that there's been some really good can you make awareness curriculum that's been adopted I've gotten some feedback that it's it's fun that it's working but the expectation that we are putting on kindergarten children is utterly inappropriate and I say that because I have seen the difference in how kindergarteners turn into first graders and second graders and 5th grade Learners when they don't have the access first off to Leading before anything else a curriculum that reflects who they are when they enter kindergarten in the

[01:26:00]
kisses on language that focuses on Social Development that focuses on curiosity and engagement and I'm I mean I still go to schools where I see I see data charts on walls in kindergarten and I see absolutely no student work I don't see art I don't see the kinds of things that reflect our students and the repercussions of this I think are deep when we start looking at 8:00 period I know it's a point of you know what this is why I ran for the board I understand this and I apologize cuz I'm outside of the room but I am so deeply concerned that I have seen virtually

[01:27:00]
no movement and how we are teaching kindergarten kids and by not giving them access to the kinds of things that are outlined by the National Association for the education of young children that I think should be the gold standard when we look at curriculum so we can have all the data points that we need but it's not going to serve our children as they go forward as Learners with a solid base of language and experience and I apologize I know I'm stepping out of my Lane but just as other board members have deep-seated feelings about various aspects of curriculum this is the one that gets me and I don't think that we're going to alter fundamentally or outcomes for students and upgrade if we don't go back to giving them what they absolutely developmentally

[01:28:00]
I know how passionate you are about this particular topic and have expressed your concerns about this several times I want to try to keep us on track because I know that it's not it's and I will say I thoroughly believe that the community the school district the staff understands your your passion around this particular area and so I'm going to I'm going to move and I'm going to ask board member to make us do you have a strategic question or something that can lead to this so that we can please go ahead so I've been at the national Indian Education Association conference and this is a Hot Topic but I'm going to try to frame the what board member Peterson just discussed I'm going to try to frame this

[01:29:00]
within our guard rails are sosg model so Dr Segura you mentioned that there was incorrect me that at the school level through these we are the district is putting together an interdisciplinary team or approach to addressing support to teachers in their use the word interdisciplinary as our goal team at the district we have our four gold teams and we all meet weekly but each gold team presents each week so it's okay interdisciplinary regarding the department so interdepartmental okay and so how

[01:30:00]
is the district honoring as we pursue gold one how are we honoring the culturally and linguistically responsive how are we using culture and language to reach our goals have board member Dominguez I think ultimately we are bringing the voices to the table that need to be at the table the experts to have that voice and as we are creating these working to align all of our efforts that is a big piece of it we're trying we're really trying to bring everyone together because it has been some you know siloing happening and we walk out of each meeting that we have saying wow that was great we needed to have

[01:31:00]
this we needed to discuss that we didn't realize this or that and so I don't know that I can directly answer culturally what we're doing because I think everyone brings their own perception and and self of culture to the table but I think we acknowledge it and we're accepting of you know we have to be you know consider all of this as we make our decisions moving forward not to isolate anyone popular music coming up and there's going to be a needs assessment where the tribes will be able to give us to be that type of work that's going to allow us to look at our Creek and design the reality is we're a public school system and as a public school system we take everybody and I think that's what the beauty of public school is we take everybody and

[01:32:00]
we try to individualize as best we can so we we have definitely have a history of pretty much teaching from one perspective or trying to expand that and certainly create expanded literature bases you've met our head librarian in the South Valley you've heard her talk about the need not to restrict libraries but to expand libraries and to make sure that we have a wide spectrum of literature you're certainly seeing the Cannons change in terms of what we're teaching and and I think you'll see more of that as we progress but I do think it's going to be the work with those entities and doing needs assessments and listening to them and then try to figure out where we can make adjustments that will make the allow us to make an impact along those lines in the future

[01:33:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:34:00]
you really need to point out that the huge strides that our school district has taken under the leadership of Language and Cultural equity in properly placing r e l students in the proper course for their language development has been absolutely not worthy and I do think that there is something to be said about that work because we have really worked on the home language survey the indication that they mark on that registration form to that kindergarten First Steps first day to the evaluation of that student to the placement of that class has shrunk significantly yeah I mean how do we make that happening again right because the numbers were

[01:35:00]
and so how do we replicate and improve on that year thank you I will remember Peterson everybody knows we're on the same exact page about kindergarten and it hurts our hearts truly and kind of speaking to that someone is when I'm looking at 1.399% to 46% when we're looking at the end of the end of the year and then we're looking at second grade students they went down from you know 1819 from 57.2 per cent then

[01:36:00]
run up to 60 and then they went back down to 48 so when we looking overall at first grade and second grade we're seeing them going have a downward Trend now when we're looking at overall in kindergarten and we're looking at all those other students and they've gone from 47 to 51 to 54 what is that what is that telling you about kindergarten besides I'm like not so fond of you know this test at all but when we're looking at everybody else kind of everybody else the other grades going down but on this one we aren't why like what's happening at that level besides the test was like you know not a good one but my opinion I think the problem

[01:37:00]
I think part of the problem with some of this is these are post-pandemic years and the kids weren't there the kindergarten is right there and then we came back you know and and I think teachers had to renew them I think the kids had to renew them kindergartens a little different but they were they were isolated too some of the stuff is I think a little bit difficult to gauge I think over the next couple of years you'll start to see more of a stabilization of the scores and I think what I'm hoping will start to see is they come in higher to start with I would really like to see us get to a point where kids come in and it's probably not my biggest concern to be totally honest I look at the second graders those are the ones that are getting ready to go into that third grade that third grade assessment that's what I'm starting to worry so I I look at kindergarten and I go yeah they did good or they stayed more normal maybe it was that they didn't have the destabilization of some other kids I don't know but what I would just simply argue

[01:38:00]
I'm not as worried about kindergarten in their scores as I am focused on some of the older older second grade those wizened you know decrepit bodies running around but I do I worry more about them than the fact that it went the wrong way and what what can we do to try to address that and like I said it's going to be done on this you know the school by school is trying to look at those kids you guys keep asking to break down the day to look at it and what kids fall on each other that's where the changes going to currently really understand what's happening and which kids are having the struggles I can leave my magic wand but I'm not going to fix anything for the superintendent Tennessee and again give them the materials give them the professional development that supports the use of those materials and let them teach and I think will work through it

[01:39:00]
highlight something that's like I saw at the first grade level that was very positive that you saw a humongous in I mean you're seeing that increase from 2223 beginning of the year in first grade from 17.7 to beginning of the year for this year to 27.5 you know that's a 10% increase and so we have to say something is is going good there but it's a totally different one I mean I just say you go first graders you go first grade teachers so you know early childhood is having an impact you would expect that to begin to be more of the norm the kids will still come in love with the beginning of your why not it's the beginning of the year was supposed to learn supposed to this is a this is an assessment to show growth and that's what we're hoping to see more of what I like the good things that are

[01:40:00]
well I think that what you'll see in this coming and that's still to be determined as we continue to work through that second round of funding with them and we begin the pilot discussions will probably need to look for it on those Pilots schools and see how they look at their allocation the reality is that you saw that in the IRS presentation there are limitations that are placed upon the district by state law negotiated agreement and they're

[01:41:00]
is there for a reason class sizes there for a reason we negotiated class sizes that people believe in it's it's relevant and there's no more new money coming in its reduced budget the the population is continues to fall so where I would suggest that you look at that budget for a significant shifts would probably be in those pilot schools and see how we can begin to do that work and and see what we can do at the school level to allow them to reconsider the way they spend their money when I guess I'm getting at is if you look at the IRS real carefully there wasn't anything to cut out of administration Administration what do we have in terms of the resources that exist and when we take if you're going to add resources somewhere they have to come from somewhere else and how does that look differently

[01:42:00]
use of high-quality instructional materials per guardrail 3 or we decreasing you so not aligned non grade level not culturally responsive materials PD like what are we what are we spending on some of those unaligned things and if their stuff that can be reallocated there we've talked a lot about program Audits and that type of thing so I get the piloting in the ERS and it's a little bit like Dr Gonzalez spoke to my first question but I'm curious to like to the reallocation piece the analysis is still coming in from errs we're really looking at that when it comes down to instructional materials are funny one because the state's underfunded instructional materials for a very long time specific date we're so far out of our cycle it's it's will never catch up and that's been hurting for a long long time we've got the new Adoption this year I think that's

[01:43:00]
measuring Ela right so that's a really important adoption we have to follow the process I don't know how to define that against a budget I mean the LA adopt the budgets the budget for the comes to the adoption so but it comes down to things like finding MLS support coaches are we going to be able to continue that after State Grant and that's what we're going to be really digging to find the funds to to continue that type of work remember Peterson do you have any other questions I will stop where I am right bored so I guess I need to know what what has been helpful to what new new information

[01:44:00]
process I don't know if it's new information and president I don't know you guys are probably better at answers what new information I think what has been helpful what we're seeing from our perspective is we have goals and we're starting to line the work and it is it in a doctor Gonzalez was talking about how difficult it is to move every part it's a big District there's a lot of different people we still have you know resistance to change and I think there is some concern but will this stay the same you talk in the district do you remember a lot of times people will you stay the course of the schools we're talking about the same idea we're just getting more individualized data versus this is

[01:45:00]
you're not supposed to look at anything other than the district data but at the schools they're getting down to who is this and that's the work that they really were poking at over the last couple years with the walkthroughs and they were getting much tighter now it's even more focused because they know specifically to break those down around these goals and who are those students that can really drive the greatest change for the schools so I think that part of it I don't know if you guys want to add should you do Residential is the only thing I would have to that is specific to the progress monitoring process so I really need to lift up the team because a lot of work goes into this and there's a lot of passion that goes into this end we start off with a long list of what's going well and we really have critical conversations with each other is everything on this list really going well what's not

[01:46:00]
going well we have a list is it really not going well and then the power of the next step is defining the system's next steps as an organization we bring it here in a few weeks will be at a principal's meeting and we'll share all of this with them so there's that time of approach in terms of common language and common approach and really definition which is painful and helpful at the same time because we're really honing in to what are we doing next and sometimes there's things that we're going to not do next that people were very passionate about but it's really defining the work in a systemic way for us to take our Collective Next Step so that's been I think a real powerful lesson for all of us because truth be told we were starting off with real I mean we have 10

[01:47:00]
what's going well what's not going well etcetera but the definition work has been a powerful exercise in every report in all all I want to say is my apologies because I put my own opinion in there in my last questions and I'm sorry cuz I shouldn't have done that so I apologize I'm going to if Ashley's listening I take it back if I could continue with improvement process for all of us so and so any other questions are we holding for good okay I just want to say to what I see happening and I really appreciate the learning that it's creating for us as well as a board because I think we're all still learning how to be engaged with you deeply around these questions and the Curiosity around it right like why it's working

[01:48:00]
play it's not and why the important next steps and so I do appreciate superintendent you and your team you know all of you for doing everything that you do to prepare for these cuz it's it's been it's been a lift for all of us but I think it's really teaching us all a whole lot of ways that we can make our system a whole lot better so that our students at the end or are getting what they need and it's informing us on so many levels right from the professional development to you know what are what is our staff telling us in terms of aligning it with what's happening in the classroom to how are we going to put our resources to play on this how do we align it to make sure that it's all that it's all getting to what it needs to get to and so I really deeply appreciate the effort and everybody has an so I guess the big question is now I do will entertain a motion because we are going to adopt this report

[01:49:00]
I would like to move that we accept the progress monitoring reports for goal one and from goals 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 focusing on early literacy and I will second this is Peggy all right can I have a roll call please hey give me a little air gun yes and yell Gonzalez Barbara Peterson yes yes thank you for doing that so her next item is a president's report and one of the things that we've promised the community on this is our transparency around our superintendent search because this is where it gets that opportunity but I do have a couple of items that I want to bring up before I get to the superintendent search so the first thing I want to say is I loved the website today where it said it's easier than ever to stay updated

[01:50:00]
and it was featured on the aps website today the community and encouraging the community to subscribe to our email process so that they could get notices letting you know when the agendas are posting and when reports like this are there so this is our opportunity to really create that transparency around the board work and what we're doing I just loved watching that pop up on on the email page today or on the aps website and then the second thing that I wanted to do was I wanted to lift up the aps tribal leaders group that is meeting Mr Phil Farson is doing an excellent job superintendent so I'm glad that we have support for that there's a few of us board members that are attending that and board members the reason I wanted to bring this up with you is because it's an intergovernmental leadership team that has been coming together and there's a lot of tremendous energy around it

[01:51:00]
have attended some of those meetings and there's some great work that's coming up I wanted to lift up that there's a needs assessment that they're doing right now in response to what's required as an assessment back to ped but the importance of this needs assessment I think is that it really will help inform us around the needs of that particular Community because I'm the the way that that assessment is being conducted and some of the questions that they're going out to ask the community about and what they need I think it's going to be really important and their plans are to align that with our APS goals and guardrails in our strategic priorities there are some things that are coming out of that that that that that that group that I just want to lift up two because part of the messages that they share on that particular meeting that we last had was you know how they're working with families with special needs and thinking of

[01:52:00]
whole family and not just a whole child I think there's some good learning that we can learn from our tribal leaders and the work that they're doing with their special needs students and they also talked about in schools having someone that they can trust and representation of their culture that really working with our schools where we have students and making sure that there's an opportunity for a Native American students to have someone that they can trust that their school around that one of them talked about the highest population we all know this we can see this from our data but also having a daily check-in for some of their Native American students there's a school that they lifted up I'm not going to name names because we said we wouldn't do that but I think that was such an incredible partnership that we have where there's a daily check-in with some of our Native American students and it's resulted in at higher and an increase in graduation rates I I saw

[01:53:00]
when they were talking about that and some real intentional motivation to inspire students and looking and bringing on mentors who can speak about and how to hold on to their traditions and still pursue careers outside of their community that intentional motivation but talking about the importance of them being able to hang on to their native American traditions and yet pursue careers that might not be a career that's going to take them to live within their Community but something that they could contribute back to their community so the assessment is going to be completed at the end of November there's tribal leader Summit that's coming up where there's going to be a presentation of the draft plan I would encourage board members to participate in that I think there's some things that we can have some learning for ourselves out of that and there's a requirement to this accountability tool to monitor for Success on terms of

[01:54:00]
the young woman who came to speak also mentioned to pow wow I know I went last year it was fantastic highly encouraged our board members if you get a chance to to attend the student pow wow it's a it's a very powerful opportunity to be engaged with them and then finally I just want to say there's something that I need to say to the board I messed up I made a mistake and I want to be able to come clean with that with the board when we had when we had passed our policy our Native American policy it was a beautiful policy and that night I read a land acknowledgment for the first time APS had never read a land acknowledgment and the history of APs I had asked for one because I felt that it was going to be appropriate to to just acknowledge the power of the work that we were doing that night and to and just as a

[01:55:00]
power to that particular Community I feel like I'm very passionate about the Native American Community as you can tell there's a lot of personal reasons for that but I believed that the land acknowledgment for my perspective was an expression of gratitude and appreciation to those whose territory we reside on is a way of knowing the indigenous people who have been living and working on our land from time in Memorial and my reason for wanting to read that was certainly just to agree that you know this is this is native land I was hoping to push that as president that we would have a land acknowledgment as part of our opening statements but I messed up because I didn't do that with taking it to account with my board members and we hit agree to something that there would be no surprises I would like to encourage the board to consider adding a land acknowledgment as part of our opening piece where we

[01:56:00]
say our Pledge of Allegiance both in English and Spanish and that we could add just that quick statement on the land acknowledgment it's about 20 seconds doesn't take a whole lot to do that but I will add that our actions will are more than performative it's more than stating a land acknowledgment it's also taking part and listening to our tribal leaders and their enthusiasm for our district I think they're coming back in great numbers there's a lot of interest in returning their students to the schools that they used to attend at one point and so I also acknowledge that a land acknowledgment in and of itself is not enough because this board members we also have to be we have to be consistent as a district we also have to to live up to our word that we also truly support this community so I just wanted to acknowledge that tonight and state that for for the record in terms of where we were with that and just to let you guys

[01:57:00]
what were we going there so my my last part of my report is just simply an update on the superintendent search we started that off today we kicked it off with Dr Walt Cooper who is with our search for me the consultant with McPherson and Jacobson LLC it's an executive Recruitment and development company we had a great meeting so it was a quick workshop on our part and the work of the board tonight included a review process and expectations for the for the search we established a benchmark in a timeline which will all be posted a couple of dates and a couple of work items for us as a boards that we can get that done we determined how we're going to advertise and some of the venues that we're going to use I want to say a special thanks to Monica who joined us

[01:58:00]
today and it's helped us kind of jumped in there on some of the things that we needed assistance with we also identified some stakeholder groups and discussed an online survey design which is also being finalized because that's going to be a process where there will be an opportunity for online input from the community to give us basically the input in terms of like the skills the traits and the experiences that were expecting from our new from a from the candidates moving forward we reviewed the compensation for posting and disgust you know the the need for posting something so that we can give a range in terms of what that's going to look like commensurate with with experience so I'm not going to State what that is yet because we're going to be finalizing some documents so we'll look that we also went through a process to establish some desired characteristics and selection criteria for us as a board so that we prioritize what we thought were some of our top are top areas I feel

[01:59:00]
Dr Walt Cooper was outstanding today he did a really good job of leading us through a very Dynamic process and a great conversation and that's all I have to add unless there's anything that the board members would like to add to that I'm sorry for our leaders at our schools you know and all our staff but just know that it's also principal awareness month and we appreciate you we acknowledge you we see you and I think the same for all of our staff that are working out at our schools all right anything else all right so the next Board of Education meeting will be held no that's the wrong one that's the one that we

[02:00:00]
