thank you for hearing me hb1 is a contradiction according to hrc.org the trans message emphasizes identity as if you are standing on the idea that kids should be able to be as they feel then by its very nature transgenderism and HP one is a contradiction to its own stance a child changes year-to-year month-to-month even day-to-day why are you then not allowing these children to grow into a fully grown individual to make such a decision instead you trap them in the funnel of this trance idea forcing it on the present knowing full well ideas change feelings change bodies change and every part of childhood changes when entering adulthood and reason you all are smart enough to know without a doubt this fact and if not an HB one is the end all then isn't it appropriate to call everyone here a child without a fence one of the last places in the brain to mature the prefrontal cortex is thought of as the personality Center and it's the cortical region that makes us unique uniquely

[00:07:00]
according to Google it is where we process moment-to-moment input from our surroundings compare them to input to past experiences and then reacts to them are you saying kids have such a rich past on which they can base their Identity On hb1 and the transit of our kids is a hijack of the undeveloped prefrontal cortex and a very contradiction to the be as you feel message transgenders and cows let children be children the beautiful unique in every way innocent humans and only innocent ones left in the world do I really need to be here telling a bunch of full grown adults the truth you already know but are unwilling to enforce you know full well what you are doing and if so and you go to these words make your school board see last forever because at this rate innocence will not thank you thank you for next speaker is in person that is Dr Chinelo but you know

[00:08:00]
you have two minutes once you begin speaking school board members to Advanced educational do you ever wonder why the New Mexico still dead last in education and top three in French

[00:09:00]
for making the controversial book depicting their sexual acts available in school libraries and I quote if you don't want to hear it in the school board meeting why should children be able to check it out of the school system end quote we have perverts that are providing our kids and you all sit back smug in your chairs and celebrate diversity equity and inclusion but you want me to read it so you can hear it so I'm going to call It's Perfectly Normal the book described as a sexual health guy for families hardcore porn masturbation while speaking of religion and during our schools

[00:10:00]
and so many of our Librarians are being in this kind of material into the public school system because they believed that children need to see themselves on the shelf and I quote don't believe that this is perfectly normal I believe that this is perfectly perverted and it needs to stop it continued regardless career ready the notion that controversial sexual related topics should be offended in the classroom and all the address at home between Karen and child thank you and God bless you thank you sir our next speaker is Christine tomorrow hey you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening my name is Christie tomorrow without Community input or thought to how these changes my impact our school Community we believe that these decisions are contradictory to the

[00:11:00]
guardrails of APs namely go 3 guard 1 guard rail 4 and guardrail 5 as well as the Martinez decision and the bilingual Multicultural Education Act of 1973 first we believe our dual language program is being threatened over the past year are program has grown significantly and in many grade levels the Dual language classes larger than the non-dual counterparts because of this we made a decision as a school to fund six dual language teachers and create two combos in our non-dual classes this was a difficult decision as it meant saying goodbye to two really incredible non-dual teachers however the district rejected the school decision the district does not recognize our dual language students as unique with distinct needs they group The Duel language students with the non-dual language students and even though the bilingual students must receive instruction from a bilingual certified teacher however we were told that the Dual language program could not be counted separately and the solution would be to create combination classes at every

[00:12:00]
people from kinder to 5th grade this is an incredible disservice to our bilingual students and has the potential to severely harm our dual language program which in turn will negatively impact our community as a whole in addition the changes to the bell schedule that will recently released were made without any input from our community and kind of came out of the blue and the district seemed to kind of downplay the impact that it would have on our community and so we were not asked for any input on these changes and we hope to be able to find a solution to these issues that will best serve our community thank you for your time our next speaker is Laura Gonzalez 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening my name is Laura Gonzalez I'm a physical education teacher at Lowe's by the elementary school

[00:13:00]
you might recall last time my colleague Michael Anderson spoke on the subject of PE at the last meeting I recall him any Smiles as he was reading his his speech and so afterwards when we convened outside we we went outside to debrief afterwards and all of us agreed we were very impressed with the board and your desire to seek out professional development to I think the words were streamlining your meetings make them the most efficient you can just to be the best that you can and we admire that because that is something we are always seeking and then it occurred to us that maybe the board is not aware of our situation so I thought I'd briefly discuss it as of now currently PE teachers do not have anybody above them they don't have any resource teacher about us we don't have any leadership in our in our specialty so PD is almost non-existent non-existent for us oftentimes peaches are required

[00:14:00]
put it in on the classroom teacher PD is that Focus around math and and literacy it's different for Fine Arts music and art they do receive their own PD so we are really lone wolves out there so seven of us got together to to take care of that to to to act upon itself and we've been meeting virtually in person we talked about best practices best routines and procedures how to support children in a social emotional learning we share equipment we are constantly driving around dropping off equipment between us because that's what we want to do we want to be the best that we can be in our school so we just want to make you aware that and you'll be seeing more of us and when you find out all that we've accomplished we are confident you're going to be very impressed but right now I feel like I'm with the Academy Awards and I have to hurry up so thank you for listening thank you for your time until next time thank you

[00:15:00]
the next speaker is on Zoom Melissa Waller you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you hello my name is Melissa Waller I'm the mom of a wonderful and hard-working fourth grader at North Star Elementary School and I'm also a proud 20-year plus veteran teacher at APS I teach 3rd grade at the same school my daughter attends I'm here this evening to make a considerate request of the APS school board or APS school district leadership and other teachers and parents who may share the same concern I'm about to address New Mexico State Testing Administration dates why are students being asked to take and our teachers being asked to stop corn instruction to administer are mandated New Mexico measures of Student Success and achievement of Assessments so early March and April and even early may have never seemed to me to be appropriate time to gather final proficiency ability levels for our students when their Court Ela and core math programs have not been completed there are still gaps

[00:16:00]
there are standards the students have not been introduced to fully learned and have had the chance to become proficient in most especially in math my grade level team works extremely hard before our school year even begins to take our core Ela program Benchmark and our Core math program i-Ready to Pace each unit according to our APS school district calendar following these programs for Fidelity is always our goal to help our students learn what is required so they can be best prepared for the next grade level when we start these programs the week school begins and they do not do not conclude until mid-may this is when all grade level Common Core skills and Concepts can officially be successfully covered why are we testing students before they know all they will be tested on I understand the State Testing windows are set by the New Mexico public education department my question is why are we not lobbying the PED harder to move the test window to the end of the school year so that all students have their best shot at knowing

[00:17:00]
all there was to learn we are setting our students up to fail parts of these exams when instruction is stopped to test end of your skills a month and a half this has never made any sense my request is can School District leadership school board members and our community advocate harder for the PED to divert State Testing to the end of the year when students can truly be assessed with proper and true validity Gathering end of your Ela and math proficiency levels a month and a half before school and makes absolutely no sense it never has yet we will be judged on those proficiency levels when the state releases the scores thank you for your time thank you for next speaker is in person in person excuse me stewarding him you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you my name is Stuart Ingham my comments are relating to Charter School authorizing and support I was unable to retrieve the current budget number

[00:18:00]
I'm going to have to go on memory I know that Charter Schools surrender 2% of their said funds to provide for APS authorizing I would love to know the amount of that contribution and how it relates to the budgeted support for Charter Schools my memory from previous years is there was a line item labeled services available to charter schools for half a million dollars this seems nebulous and needs to be itemized and I would like to know if charter schools are informed of these services and how they can access them thank you very much thank you sir next speaker is Gail Stewart I have her coming in the room

[00:19:00]
yes I am okay you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking then thank you sorry for the delay my name is Gail Stuart I'm a special education lawyer in New Mexico and I signed up tonight to speak about the link between reading disability and math proficiency that I've observed over a couple decades so I'm I'm concerned in looking at the questions and answers the board was posing to the district about math proficiency and the target goal and I'm not seeing anything in there about how reading disability impacts the ability to learn math it's possible I missed it I looked at it quickly but here's what I've seen over the years when kids are presented with word problems and they cannot read well it's assumed they do not understand the math yet parents

[00:20:00]
tell me frequently my child actually does know how to do the math they can't do the word problems that continually get scored down and then that's compounded in later years when math instruction becomes more complex and there is written text that is relied on by teaching staff to present Concepts and again students who can't read well are not getting the full presentation of those Concepts and it really needs to continue like of math skills the way to address this most simply obviously is the reading but easier than that to start with is ensuring that there's audio I cannot tell you how difficult it continues to be across the state and in APS to get audio access to math books and the result is kids are losing out on math instructions and they're showing

[00:21:00]
no performance that is artificial and is based on reading problems rather than lack of mass understanding thank you so much thank you ma'am or next speakers in the room marrying them you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you and good evening until we have at least 50% competency and dispense with others I think that maybe a reason a lot of the students are leaving yes number two as students student numbers to teachers from the administrative staff as Mentor or regular classroom teachers this will help with the teacher shortage and

[00:22:00]
keep valuable skills administrative staff on payroll number 3 consolidate schools and allow charter schools to utilize the extra schools and number four I'm not sure if this is being done but to do a survey of students and families who've left or are planning to leave APS to discover why that maybe happening and thank you very much thank you ma'am our last speaker is Irene Karen if 2 minutes and I was here two and a half years ago I'm sure you remember me but I'm here for the same reason period after school and on weekends

[00:23:00]
I'm here to ask you again to close Marie Hughes Elementary School in the evenings and on weekends we sit 50 ft from the baseball field and The Baseballs have started coming over again and it's very difficult for us we're afraid we're going to get killed by one of these baseballs coming over and you know there's nothing we can do so you know can be part of this list that closes on weekends and on after school thank you thank you thank you Mom

[00:24:00]
who completes public forum thank you thank you so much for everything that you have shared and again a reminder this is not a two-way conversation but an opportunity for us to hear directly from the public but I know our superintendent and staff are taking notes and hopefully we can resolve some of the concerns that you may have the next item on our agenda is agenda item by which is all about student outcomes focused governance I highlighted a couple weeks ago that we had a big student outcomes focused meeting coming up this is it so I hope you all are asleep as I am we have several different components of sosg on the agenda that we're going to be working through we're going to be starting with the agenda item 5.1 which is consideration of acceptance of the modified progress monitoring report for gold to interim goals 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 which are related to

[00:25:00]
turn off proficiency now we did have a very robust monitoring conversation when we did address goal to we also received a lot of follow-up information that has all been publicly posted we had an opportunity to submit questions and to submit follow-up questions and also to get a whole slew of exciting new graphs and information related to gold too I believe because we have all of this information and because we already had such a robust conversation and we're only missing the supporting documents that we can move to accept the proposal without additional discussion or questions however I would just like to check with the rest of the board if you all in agreement for that and if so we can move ahead to emotion and I'm sorry to yes emotion in a second I'm comfortable with him I moved to accept the modified progress monitoring report for goal to interim goals 2.1 2.2 and 2

[00:26:00]
3 math proficiency this is Courtney all second this is supposed to be nice thank you have emotion from Member Jackson and a second from Member Dominguez King can we have a roll call vote please Secretary of Astoria yes member benavidez member Dominguez yes member Jackson yes president Gonzales yes the next item is agenda item 5.2 consider acceptance of progress monitoring reports for goal 3 goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 related to post-secondary Readiness now as I flagged in our last meeting as well we are trying a new approach here where we are rotating facilitation of our progress monitoring conversations so I'm really excited to hand over the facilitation I just wanted to also say that there has been a lot of work behind the scenes both with the administration but also with the board and board services to begin to develop a process

[00:27:00]
protocol for how we against streamline these progress monitoring conversations and how we make expectations clearer so remember Jackson and I and our s o f g coach as well as board Services have worked on what we're calling a facilitation guide and so I'm really excited that member Jackson is so well prepared to lead this conversation and that I get to just participate but I do want to also say and we all share at the end of the meeting as well that we do want feedback we want feedback from board members we want feedback from the administration and feedback from anyone who wants to give it about this change but with that I will turn it over to member Jackson to facilitate this part of the discussion thank you for remember Gonzalez and I will just start off I do have a little bit of a flutter so I'm just a little nervous so I just so you guys know like I'm as nervous as you are but yes we have put in a lot of work into this facilitator guide and I really do hope that that

[00:28:00]
it kind of streamline the information that we are requesting and helps the public to understand kind of what the role of our progress monitoring is so I am going to jump straight into the progress monitoring session and just to highlight that tonight we are going to be monitoring goal 3 and interim goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 which is measuring post-secondary success now one thing that is a little bit out of Step just because this process is being developed what will be happening from this point forward is that the facilitator will have already met with the administration to review the progress monitoring report to check for four elements that are required within that report next time

[00:29:00]
we will not go over what these four elements are but for the sake of us being a little bit out of Step I am going to review those four elements just to make sure that the public understands what it was that we were looking for in this progress monitoring report so the there are like I said four elements the first element relates to the goal and the questions that we asked as it related to the goal was does it clearly show the specific goal and interim goals that are being monitored and to is there a separate report for each internal being monitored the answer that I had to that question was yes the second element is the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods preferably on a line graph to is the graph that visualizes the current status clear is it properly labeled and does it describe results

[00:30:00]
that are specific to the data sets monitored in the goals and the interim goal language and then third does it clearly show the target reporting periods for example Does it show the annual goal targets now most of that is is the answer is yes but it does we do not currently have the annual gold targets but guess what that's coming up later on in the agenda so we're going to give some Grace on that and going from this step going forward we will have annual goals the next element is the interpretation does it clearly show the superintendents understanding of system performance relative to the goal my answer was yes and then the fourth element is the evidence and the plan and board members this is something that I think is really critical for us to understand when I met with Dr Gonzales to review the facilitators guide what was it was really helpful

[00:31:00]
because they are with you and superintendent Acting Superintendent Blakely you guys are receiving information coaching information from Council great City Schools as are we and so for us to be able to have this conversation it really helped to put into this guide what you guys need and what we're looking for so I want to highlight two things in here the first is is it clearly shows supporting documentation that evidence is the superintendents understanding of system performance these two next things relate to our progress monitoring report that I want to highlight if the superintendents understanding of system performance indicates implementation is not on track has the administration identified the root cause the board members you will notice in interim goal 3.1 systemic root cause is highlighted because of 3.1 is currently deemed not on track the third question is if the superintendents understanding

[00:32:00]
set system performance indicates implementation is on track has the administration identified strategic responses including rational and any next steps to board members you'll notice that the progress monitoring report for 3.2 and 3.3 just has this strategic response rationale and next steps so I just thought that was important for us board members to realize that those those reports are slightly different to to our benefit and to your so thank you for doing that so my answer to all of those four questions was that the monitoring report had what we needed and I wanted to thank Dr Gonzalez for meeting with me on short notice to review that I believe that all the criteria criteria for an effective report has been met but I'll open the floor for anyone else to thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence to suggest otherwise

[00:33:00]
does everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will turn the floor to the superintendent for the presentation good evening Madam president members of the board this evening as you see in front of you we will be progress monitoring goal 3 and as was mentioned earlier the team has done a lot of work on really operationalizing the progress monitoring reports so that it really becomes part of their daily work and driving the work of the schools and I think you'll see that evident in Mr Garcia's presentation tonight and we also took a lot of time with the team we had actually the council great City Schools AJ crabill came and met individually with us as a leadership team and we were coached through a lot of this three and just getting better and better at

[00:34:00]
I'm being able to use the monitoring reports as a communication tool so that there aren't unclear answers that come out in the presentation but not in the report so we're really trying to work as a team is making sure that the monitoring reports really identify what the daily work is in the schools and with the leaders of these goals in the in the work that then comes into the progress monitoring report so often there's like oh we need to do the progress monitoring report but they didn't realize all of these things they've been doing along the way to demonstrate it in this report so I think you'll see hopefully tonight a lot of the work that are high schools are doing under the leadership of Mr Garcia and some honest conversations about some of the goals you'll see where we're off track and plans in place to get us back on track and so with that I'd like to turn it over to

[00:35:00]
Play the theme for the presentation which will be led by Mr Garcia who is the associate superintendent to lead toll-free thank you Lord president members of the board Dr Blakey I first want to start out with a moment of gratitude and a space for gratitude and I first want to start with thinking and having gratitude for all of our students and families who have chosen Albuquerque Public Schools and who are also committed to College and Career Readiness I also want to thank all of our staff at school sites I can't list them all but teachers the list goes on and I don't want to start cuz I might miss a group but I want them to know that they're seen their appreciated and we value every single one of them I also want to create space and gratitude for our school administrators who have also locked arms with us in our

[00:36:00]
play advancement towards reaching our student outcomes that we've have set forth for ourselves and I want to thank my goal 3 team which includes various departments in Albuquerque Public Schools they work right alongside me and looking at data in looking at root causes systemic root causes finding critical actions that will align towards improving student outcomes and I want to also extend gratitude and space for you all in providing us this Journey 2 years ago and in my leadership Journey having the privilege of being in community meetings and hearing the values of the community and you all actually creating goals that is on this path of student outcomes Focus governments and I want you to know through my leadership development in this experience the profound thing that is impacted

[00:37:00]
is that student outcomes will not change until adult Behavior changes and me specifically student outcomes won't change unless my leadership changes I take my position very serious I'm passionate about this work and I'm committed to relentlessly looking at data if there's a gap in the data what are we going to do to improve also I need some water I'm sorry I went from excitement to nervousness and and through this excitement and through

[00:38:00]
play leadership journey into space I'm in today this mindset and learning about student outcomes Focus governance and this mindset of agency belonging and connectedness and in these meetings we get to speak about data and we also want that to Cascade to school so me as the instructional leader of gold 3 in a data dialogue with our Board of Education I can go into a school confidently and have that same data dialogue with schools and also have conversations about root causes and next steps so I think I'm ready for the presentation and excited to share with you all that we've been doing so in looking at Gold 3 post-secondary Readiness is the percentage of high school graduates who who earn Credit in two or more advanced placement ID or dual credit course or earn an industry certification or bilingual cell will increase from

[00:39:00]
.6% in September of 23 to 49.6% in September of 2028 interim goal 3.1 dropout rate the percentage of high school students who drop out will decrease from 4.2% in May of 23 to 3.2 percent in May of 2026 in real gold 3.1 we mark this is off track because this is an area where we're not meeting where we should be at this time and you'll hear some more information about what we're going to do about that so our interpretation of the data the dropout rate for the first semester of 2324 is slightly higher than it was at the same time last year 1.8 compared to 1.5% also at this rate the annual dropout rate would be

[00:40:00]
5.2% compared to 4.2% last year so what are those systemic root causes why why are we seeing the data where it's at so what we've identified is obviously an increase in semester one dropout rate but also in looking at data and specifically our habits and mindset data according to the survey 44% of our 9th grade students feel slightly or not at all connected to an adult on their campus this was a huge red flag a call to action for us also inconsistent transitions from middle school to high school lack of multiple Pathways and opportunities for students to recover credit so what are we going to do in response to this our next level of work support 9th grade students and their families in that transition to

[00:41:00]
initiate early interventions for students at risk of dropping out based on looking at data of attendance behavior and course performance but now we're also adding agency belonging and connectedness focus on quality instruction curriculum alignment career Pathways and systems of support case management approach and sharing on time graduation interventions for the right student at the right time finding ways to engage students developing District wide Credit Recovery strategy interim goal 3.2 Carson enrollment the percentage of high school students enrolled in advanced placement I be dual credit courses or career

[00:42:00]
concentrator course will increase from 48.3% in May of 23 to 54.3% in May of 26 and in this interim goal we put ourselves as on track and here is our interpretation of the data 48.4% of high school students were enrolled in an identified course in Fall of 2023 compared to 46.7% at this time last year and 45.7% of 2021 and increase of 2.7% of 2 years first semester enrollment rates are at the highest since 2021 the second semester enrollment percentages for 2324 is projected to exceed the 2223 rate by 1.7 percentage points so what if we identified as what's going well

[00:43:00]
improving student engagement aligned curriculum creating career Pathways and strengthening our Student Success systems expanding work-based learning no credit and internships updating our course catalogs so that students can continue to choose their programs of study that align to their postsecondary goals and also having one third of our 10th grade students identified as having AP potential so what's our next level of work continue to roll out scope and sequence and lesson plans for advisory develop a graduate profile based on the new graduation requirements of House Bill 171 create a framework for 8th grade Next Step plans to guide course in elections develop process to get potential students actually in the seats of AP classes

[00:44:00]
apply for Grants and stopping to support Staffing and resources and most importantly work to ensure Equitable access for these courses moving on to interim gold 3.3 and what I want to mention is that we look at 3.3% different than 3.2 so 3.2 is course enrollment just getting the students in the course but we know that getting them in the course is not enough are they actually earning Credit in that course so 3.3 is the percentage of 11th grade students who are credit and at least one advanced placement I'd credit 300 language course or a career pathway computer course will increase from 58% in May of 2033 to 64 % in May of 2 6 6

[00:45:00]
location of the data 57.4% of 11th grade students earn Credit in at least one of the identified courses in Fall of 23 compared to 55.9% at this time last year and 54.3% in Fall of 22 and increase of 3.1% points in 2 years more than 5,113 students earn credits and these identified courses 122 more credits than in Fall of 2022 and based on the trends we are projected that the percentage of Juniors earning Credit in Springfield 59.5 percent higher than it was and higher than it's been since 2022 so what's going well for interim 3.2 nearly 2/3 of high school increases in credit attainment work continues to improve engagement

[00:46:00]
are Pathways and Student Success systems what's our next level of work continue to upgrade our study and course offerings and Frameworks bolster student acquisition of grade level skills and content knowledge so they have success in these courses develop a graduate profile that ensures students continue to take advanced placement don't credit distance learning which will no longer be required because of House Bill 171 Insurance exposed students to programs of study and support their secondary goals also High School cost analysis and development next steps to proving earn credits that concludes the presentation and at this time I opened for

[00:47:00]
fantastic you did a great job thank you you're welcome so we will now open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked that questions that are of the technical or a tactical nature have come in before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see our questions during this meeting must help us to understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails so our questions this evening must also be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven in time bound and this is where I will pause we have a handy dandy new flow chart up here on the

[00:48:00]
this for the board that helps us to really understand what what kind of questions we need to be asking the other two points that I would like to make is that just a reminder that it is imperative that each board member do ask a question and the reason for that is because it is our job it's our elected responsibility to be critical of the school system performance to really make sure that we are on track for our students and the way that we are critical for our community is to ask smart strategic questions to to ascertain whether or not we are on track and the other thing that I will say is that while I am the facilitator so I will be making sure that the questions are appropriate and that they are smart I am not the only one that has that has that opportunity to

[00:49:00]
gosh president Gonzalez that was a technical question not not a strategic question I'm not saying that you know so I'm not the only one that needs to do that so we are all kind of holding ourselves accountable to that but one thing that I will make sure is that if board members do ask a question and they don't quite get the answer then I'm going to circle back and make sure that the the questions that we are asking or being directly or so with that I'm just going to go down the diet and I will start oh and one thing I think we'll start with 3.1 we'll go through 3.1 then we'll go to 3223 so do you have any questions on 3.1 it's perfect timing so thank you so much for that presentation it was fantastic and thank you for starting with gratitude I think that that is so important and so many

[00:50:00]
people involved and it's such a huge effort and to thank them and acknowledge the the time and effort they've put into this is really important so thank you for that so I'm glad we're starting with 3.1 because that's where my main concern is I think it's fantastic that we're on track for 3.2 and 3.3 but graduation rates are so important important to me personally and they're important to the lives of these students and so I see in the presentation that you focused on interventions mainly at the 9th grade level and I understand why having had a conversation with a president in Gonzales earlier in the evening what is the strategy just a simple question what's the strategy to incorporate those interventions for grades 10 11 and 12 because I think students are at risk of dropping out at any grade level but I do understand that it's a more critical than my grade level so thank you for president of board member

[00:51:00]
vanity doesn't doctor Blakey thanks for your question so Student Success systems and finding the right intervention for the right student at the right time is for all students and it's not solely for 9th grade but we gave an example for 9th grade because right now if you look at Dropout Trends and you look at the number of students who fail Algebra 1 biology or content course the freshman year data and research shows that those students are the ones that end up dropping out so we've developed teams to start as a base with 9th grade I'd like to give an example of Del Norte High School real quick and looking at some of the data that they've had an attendance so at High School this year there are actually teamed up in 9th grade for their core content classes in those teachers meet regularly to discuss students

[00:52:00]
and to find how they can best support those students the data this year shows that they're 9th grade students attendance has improved by 3030 percent and they've also improved students earning credit by close to 20% so that's just an example of how it can work for 9th grade but when you look at Student Success systems it's looking at data looking at what students are farthest away from opportunity and again when I talked about the right intervention at the right time for the right student you can look at data for the number of students who fail to Algebra 2 and then you can look at the data and also look at focus groups students and if you identify any group of students or students that struggling and you provide an intervention for that student whether it be academic A Student Success plan aligned to attendance or if

[00:53:00]
is showing potential issues with behavior Can we involve restorative practices and really you know focus on that student so I guess what I want to what I want you to know is that we've taken ews which was early warning systems and through the research of Dr Belfast and the and the grad partnership out of John Hopkins University post-pandemic if you look at the data what was done with ews back then it's not working now but what we read in an article I provided for you from education weekly is that what they turned in the article the secret sauce is the sense of connectedness and belonging first you can put a book in front of a kid you can put algebraic problems in front of the student but if that student doesn't feel a sense of belonging or knowing that there's an adult on that campus that

[00:54:00]
where is about them and is going to Champion them then that book is is going to be a lot less relevant and that's how we moved our Student Success systems looking at habits and skills mindset survey for all grades I want to thank Dr Bowman and his staff they've created a dashboard of line to have some skills mindset survey right now I can log in and I can tell you any focus group student and at any school district is a whole where they were at in any of those responses I can nail I can put it down to female name is focus group what that allows us to do again provide an intervention at the right time for the right students but in addition the reason early warning systems work now post-pandemic and the research is showing it is that whole thing of sense would be

[00:55:00]
and now that we've worked with school principals and their Student Success teams and looking at their data and if they show low data as a school as a whole what can they holistically do at that school if they sell data that's low for any one focus group can they call those students in and have a focus group conversation and hear from those students what is it that's keeping you from feeling a sense of belonging how can we create a space for you to feel like you belong to this community I just that's the part when I said I was excited because I'm excited about the examples I can share with you what's happening in schools so I hope I answered your question and if not when they Circle back I'm happy to talk a little bit more so I want to warn you once again going it's going to be hard to stop just kidding thank you thank you thank you thank you board member number

[00:56:00]
what's your question answered I think my question was answered yes and you gave a lot of great information thank you okay president Gonzalez you have a question I do I want to thank you Mr Garcia also for your presentation and for your enthusiasm and commitment to this work I have a current performance question related to 3.1 and I think it does sales nicely off of some of the stuff that you just shared in response to member of this is question around the goal the role of skills habits in mindsets is it really is too high school dropouts Dropout rates sorry and so my question related to current performance is what do we know about which students are struggling most and by that I mean which student groups and what do we know about what are the barriers so you you did share that this lack of a sense of belonging is critical but I'm curious what are the barriers that exist to inhibit fostering that

[00:57:00]
what's a belonging and then also what do we know about which groups are struggling most so in looking at the data some of our students who are showing either not a sense of belonging agency or another area is again one of the groups that I noticed was English language Learners was one of the groups that appeared to be showing need an extra support what are the barriers in the data attendance if you don't feel like you belong in a space and you have no connection your attendance begins to call and we know that when attendance it's hard to keep up in class and when you can't keep up with class and you fail a course it's a spiral and that's where we as adults and changing our behaviors need to intervene

[00:58:00]
so that they can be ready for post-secondary success thank you I think we do hear a lot from community members with concerns about barriers related potentially to housing and security food insecurity Transportation challenges poverty that type of thing and so certainly there are in school factors that can be controlled by focused by a focus on sensibility but there's a out of school factors that contribute to this as well so are there key out of school factors that are popping up as barriers that need to be addressed so word president Gonzalez members of the board of Dr Blakey I think you hit several of those barriers right off the bat but I want to acknowledge that we have Community School spring work

[00:59:00]
and I want to just think Brian Garcia for his work and also being part of our goal 3 team and so in part of ews early Warning Systems attendance and behavior we often do Behavior squared and we look at barriers to learning and ensuring that we align any out of school barrier whether it's food insecurity housing that we provide resources and connect those families and students with the right resources that they need to support their students for re-engagement in school so part of Student Success systems does look at outside of school barriers and we have many resources in our district

[01:00:00]
thank you for starting your gratitude at the place where it all happens and that's the School site staff I especially appreciate that and ending with us because everything it should be a bottom up model that we're trying to engage and thank you for all your hard work I'm because my first question was taken but it was a great conversation or dialogue I'm going to pay you back for president Gonzalez and her question what are what are the plans to address

[01:01:00]
or to use culturally linguistically relevant strategies whether curriculum or through the curriculum or through events to engage families and students ell students using high quality instructional materials that are culturally relevant in the classroom that's the first thing that we can do is is starting in that space to family engagement and when school's plan family engagement activities are they thinking about all the different persons within the community and are they represented in family engagement initiatives are we printing

[01:02:00]
information that's a line to the languages spoken in our schools so I think really starting with curriculum that's culturally relevant standards aligned and high quality insurance that we think about those students in our schools and that we communicate with all members of the school community and thinking and being mindful of of all persons the president Gonzalez Dr Blakey to add on to that another component is I think it is obvious that the girls are beginning to intercept the work of the skills habits and mindsets with the work in this case of the presentation and in conversation with one of our other goal leaders just today I think a good example to illustrate an answer to your question is the idea of being bold and starting some family walks in our schools

[01:03:00]
Community walks in our schools and really from the family I from the community I what is working what is missing in our schools so that there's that reciprocal cycle of feedback to our schools from other perspectives in relationship to how we are meeting the needs of all students including our ell students and any other group of students that we have been really working to see how we are diverse in the way we receive feedback in the classroom at the school level and in relationship from school into the community real quick I just want to make sure that this is this is an important discussion but the high school dropout which is 3.1 didn't actually reference culturally relevant material that was more the

[01:04:00]
enrollment so as I'm looking at my little data I want to make sure that we're not offering recommendations or 3.1 and that were addressing data that has been specifically provided at the board's request in the report so I only bring it up because it came up in the discussion that ell students were were suffering the most and and I think when we talked about ELO I mean like you pointed out Dr Gonzalez the goals and the girls are going to intersect especially when we talked about else students and I would say thank you for the answer the one piece that's missing to my question is the language piece right linguistically relevant and I think this is come up

[01:05:00]
Heritage language that's a recommendation and a suggestion that we can definitely send along later but we need to stay away from statements opinions or recommendations except half of my question was answered so did you get your question sorry secretary historical coming to you thank you I appreciate this changing of facilitation throughout the meeting because I think now that my question is actually partly a suggestion or leading suggestion I'm going to say it anyways but I would love your

[01:06:00]
so thank you for the presentation and my question was around building relationships between staff and students cuz I think that that's super important that's one of the reasons why I you know continued my high school career was because of staff and I know that that's really important so my question is is your team considering using advisory and similar class sections to increase the relationship building between students and teachers and if so what resources or development strategies will you be using so it kind of sounds leading I'm not sure how that works it's it is a little bit of a suggestion to can you can you state it one more time and I'll try to help you to restate your question into us smart question is your team considering using advisory and similar class sections to increase the relationship building between students and teachers and if so what resources or development strategies will you be using

[01:07:00]
so the suggestion that I would say is at the very beginning when you when you say is your team's going to use advisory just take that part out and say what strategies is your team considering to use okay I'm going to okay so what strategy is is your go back so what resources or development strategies will you be using to increase relationship building between students and teachers while in school great question perfect thank you did you get it Mr Garcia words for president Dr Blakey so some of the resources that we're going to be using is the habits and skills mindset I don't know if that's a resource as much as it is a resource so in looking at that data specifically on that helps us in

[01:08:00]
building relationships with our students as a starting point for advisory but advisory right now it's one of our areas that we are working on in goal 3 and again I talked about it in the presentation in aligning advisory to alignment to House Bill 171 so advisory actually starting in 8th grade and continuing through 12th grade so that students can align their post-secondary goal goals with the course selections that they're taking so that when students identify an interest or a career and they take courses that have relevance for them that's when students really enjoy school and we are currently working with Vicky Pryce in counseling at a College and Career Readiness counselor also to Stevenson and other members of curriculum and instruction to provide schools with a scope and

[01:09:00]
point spread advisory lessons that not only includes social emotional well-being also includes ways to build relationships with students but also connecting career connected learning and post-secondary goals through advisory one last thing I'd like to add is as we've been learning about habits and skills mindset and resources available we do have a Playbook that has actual interventions or building relationship and you can actually as a teacher you can identify a class that might need support or a group of students and then you can take a lesson and either do it through advisory and or as a class so we're really advancing how we're doing the work of advisory and it is an area that we know is going to pay dividends towards reaching to now comes first

[01:10:00]
secretary historic at did you did your was your question answered it was and I have a follow-up if I may just quickly since I understand that you're focusing on advisory which is really great how are we going to ensure that the entire School climate is getting the same resources board Secretary of the members of the board so a strategy would be to make sure that we're taking attendance for these courses and also creating engaging activities that interest students so that they attend but again everything we're doing is for all students and interventions at the right time for the right student is for all all students and advis

[01:11:00]
is for all students thank you I think I was referring more to adults right because students are connected to one advisory teacher so how do we make sure that the entire staff at the school is connecting with students on that same level every day and not becoming clusters hopefully that makes sense is it in Gonzales member historical Dr Blakey it does and I think as was alluded to by Mr Garcia as these new advisory lessons are conceptualized and rolled out they are being done and they're being built across department so you have this cross pollination of ideas and Synergy in terms of how we as a support at the district level are supporting our teachers at the different high schools in this case to be able to have common resources

[01:12:00]
common professional development and ability to execute the work of advisory by doing that we will have common language at the district level that will hopefully be able to be translated to our different high schools through our principals through our resource teachers our resource counselors our resource nurses so that there is a Common Thread of support that is consistent to the every school in the district not isolated to one school but that there's a common expectation and common language that can help me help facilitate accountability if you will in terms of all adults at all schools supporting students in a similar way in alignment to the Google I see that your hand is raised do you have something to add yes good evening everyone sorry I couldn't be there in person but

[01:13:00]
I would like to share that you know when we look at whole school we are also looking at our principles and how they are setting that culture and climate and expectations for the schools and for their school and so you know any time that they're meeting with their staff it's promoting the whole child in student wellness and how are we not just focusing on the instructional aspects but also just the human aspect of when you're walking down the hall make contact with a student say hello smile adult to adult when you're at your door between passing periods right welcome in your students by name knowing something about them having team building activities within your classroom so that students know that their teachers care because our teachers do care but you know we've come we've come out of a space in time that

[01:14:00]
has really impacted students and adults in a very and very different ways and so I think all the work that we're doing with goal for is going to enhance our other goals but I think it does come down to that leadership and when we are principals have had two years of professional learning with by ASA the University of Washington and sreb and they have focused on you know relationship building and how to have critical conversations and systems and structures culture building within their schools and so now is the time we're looking to transition to really operationalize what that looks like within the school but I always say the principal is the leading Catalyst for change in a school and teachers will fill that hear that and be excited about that and that will translate to students because we know that

[01:15:00]
got a relationship between a student and the staff is the number one indicator of success for that student so I just wanted to add that piece of the principal ship thank you Dr Segura yeah I was just going to say thank you all I feel like the more that we talked about it the better it will actually become a reality especially when it's about culture and climate right and changing that narrative we have to continuously just bring it up and you guys are doing the work and I really appreciate it and it's showing that these plans and strategies are are making a break through so yeah I'm just really really happy and ready for ready to see the results so thank you if my fellow board members don't mind I have a question to ask and then we'll follow up with everybody else thankfully I submitted

[01:16:00]
on page 3 of our document for interim goal 3.1 under strategic Priority One clear expectations it says you will develop a district-wide approach to support incoming 9th graders and their families as they transition to high school what plans do you already have and how do you think those plans will resonate with families to bring about your desired outcome board member Jackson board president and Dr Blakey thank you for the question so we are calling this initiative operation jump start so really taking what we've traditionally done with just jump start date like one single day in isolation for a 9th grade student is not enough that's not enough for family

[01:17:00]
I want to give an example of West Mesa High School who this year as an example of of taking jumpstart to the next level they actually had all of their incoming freshmen come during March to tour the school but it wasn't just come look at the auto body mechanic shop it wasn't just look at the cafeteria they actually had a science staff that student ambassadors who could talk to students and then sure when that 8th grade students showed up on campus in the fall that they can recognize adults on that campus another thing that they did in these rotations is that their counselors in the past and what counselors did was explaining all of the horses that were available to students and also how credits work in high school and what a transcript

[01:18:00]
means and all of those things so I just wanted to give one example of what what we're calling operation jump start really expanding this transition so really communicating clearly and having a set of expectations of what schools will do to provide a warm welcome welcoming space for students but then also have expectations around that so in operation jumpstart also looking at student data so when those students are coming from 83 to high school where are they academically in math and Ela and are they actually in the right course and do we need to provide an academic intervention on the day they show up not at the end of the nine weeks when they've already fail the course you got to intervene early and progress monitor in addition to that creating family events before school starts

[01:19:00]
stop them to to create that communication and then last one thing I like to expand on is taking our habits and skills mindset survey and identifying those 8th grade students that did not feel a sense of belonging in their middle school doing something before school starts with those students specifically to create a different starting point then maybe they left 8th grade so those are a couple of examples of what we plan on doing strategically to improve the transition from 8th grade to ninth grade okay thank you so if I if I can clarify I do love I love the narratives but I just want to get very pointed about some of the plans that you have it sounds like you are are you attempting to operationalize what happened at Lake West Mesa for example so it sounds like visit

[01:20:00]
early to the school family events using the data of the 8th graders and surveying the the students early is it that's part of the plans that you guys already have in place the board member Jackson board president Dr Blakey so really identifying signature experiences in the in the spring before the student comes identifying signature experiences family engagement during the summer and then also in the fall when students get to school we want to provide autonomy to our schools and we want schools to be able to be authentic to their community so it wouldn't be us top down telling the school what they're going to do but rather having some expectations of like some key points in time that has there's something has to be done

[01:21:00]
but providing schools autonomy and the space and including their teachers and students in these conversations as well so really like a tights and loose like you know in this time you'll have a signature experience what that looks like would be determined by the school Community thank you that answers my question I appreciate it okay I'm going to go back through to see if there are any follow-up for 3.1 board member benefits no but the operation jump starts sounds incredible and thank you for doing that President Gonzalez yes so the first part of my question related to current performance for 3.1 is what do we know about which students are struggling most so the second part is what do we know about what is working and you've spoken to a couple of examples but I think in particular I'm curious about outlier data if you have any data around specific student groups

[01:22:00]
Educators who are outperforming the norm or otherwise is it relates to some of these factors that you're related to but what do we know about what is working so the word president Gonzalez members of the board doctor Blakey in looking at the data what I know about an outlier when you look at Rio Grande High School compared to their statistical peers and the number of students were earning credit they're actually and an alignment I'm sorry an alignment to 3. 1 1

[01:23:00]
how the important goal they identified that if they change the narrative to the from the number of students failing to actually the number of students passing it created a whole different mindset among students and staff and in talking with the principal principal Valenzuela she specifically mentioned that specifically is one of the ways that they're seeing 3.1 data improving and they are an outlier right now compared to their statistical peers thank you

[01:24:00]
all right so for 3.1 there was a question question for but in your I'm curious about a follow-up in your answer which appears on page six of the question the answers you say we encourage students to try different activities and consider their future careers we keep families informed through meetings and various forms of communication and here's what I'm interested in we always check to see if our plan works and how we can improve it what have you how do you check to see if the plan works and what have you learned and how would you improved board member Dominguez members of the board I think right now

[01:25:00]
just monitoring and even looking at our interim goals and our data set in our First Progress monitoring cycle and our data set now like we are doing that in this space right now but also all of our continuous Improvement processes at schools are 90 Day plans are aligned to looking at data and identifying root causes and then next steps in alignment to that data so I think it's it's it's it's it's pretty broad Broad in the way that we do continuous Improvement in the continuous improvement process so it sounds like and I don't want to miss interpret it sounds like we're laying the groundwork for these systems of

[01:26:00]
I guess I'm still not clear and it doesn't mean that we have to get the apps the answer was very Global and I think I can help I think things a technical and tactical question that was provided before the board this board meeting and I remember the question specifically and it was an alignment to that transition from 8th grade and at the very end of the paragraph that states that we will look at what we did find out what worked and what didn't and then you know what would we do

[01:27:00]
what's an example of really being mindful of everything that we do we have to go to see the success of it and it just if it's not working then we need to discontinue those things that are not working if it is working then how do we Elevate that and be able to identify other schools who can benefit from that strategy so I think it was just a statement of like it's continuous we don't we do everything in this mindset of continuous Improvement if I may clarify then I think what I'm referencing it is do you have specific metrics or data are you collecting this and and does it have some form yet or board member domingue

[01:28:00]
members of the word thank you that really helps me out so that's an example of even Dr Gonzalez talked about it earlier when we work with families are we creating space to get their feedback are we conducting surveys for students and families after an event is completed if it worked well for them and or what suggestions do they have to improve what we've done I hope that's helpful president is saying about everything that we're doing to try to align to the work of the goals operationally is connected to our 90-day plan and in the progress monitoring for I believe it talks about how these initiatives are incorporated into the 90-day plan for the individual schools

[01:29:00]
and the reason that that's so important is because that embeds a continuous Improvement for that school to look at what they are their key initiatives that they're doing and every 90 days they have to revisit how it's going and then make improvements or take things off move things in at the school level so the more that we can operationalize our goals into the school's 90 day plan that gives them kind of the tighten loose that Mr Garcia was talking about as far as this is what we're trying to accomplish how Del Norte does it could look different than how Valley does it but the ultimate goal is the same and how they look at their 90-day plan to make sure that it is a cycle the 90-day plan in itself is a cycle of continuous Improvement and we've been doing it very sporadically some school's Grandpa some more than others but now I think

[01:30:00]
team has seen how it can actually be utilized to tie all of this work together in the school looking at their data because essentially what we're doing as a district in doing the progress monitoring is our own 90 Day plans so the more that we can have the schools 90-day plan mirror the progress monitoring then we can at a systems level see the difference in the student achievement levels because we're all on the same monitoring of how we're doing and not you know I think in the history of just like the next shiny object that you want to try oh let's try this let's try this but now there's actually like a cycle of let's look at what we're doing is it working it's not don't reach for the shiny object unless you need something of just doing it because of a we heard this might work it's becoming much more embedded in the practice

[01:31:00]
and if I may I think that this also what you just highlighted is actually embedded in our reports as well you might need to reach for that shiny object if something is off track right and that is exactly why we are doing a that's why they do the root analysis of something is off track it's to say this isn't correct we're we're not we're not going where we need to do and that's where the adjustment happens and that's why we have the root cause but in these other two in 3.2 and 3.3 we're on track things are working and so how do we how do we continue to stay in that continuous loop of progress so if that's all so highlights okay did you have anything else okay board members you have a question another question for three point one I do and it might have been answered during the presentation and I might have missed it but under the root causes of 3.1 it says that

[01:32:00]
only have one method for students to recover credits which is not meet the diverse learning needs of all of our high school students so my question is what other methods are we looking to implement and when can we see this change board member historical historical members of the board thank you for that question so I'm looking at our data and talking with schools we've identified that our current credit recovery options that we have for students students is not it's not what it's not it's not allowing students to earn credit as much as we'd like and we're looking at creating a task force in the fall including the union to look at how we can enhance Credit Recovery looking at real time credit recovery and really rolling out

[01:33:00]
holistically different options of credit recovery so that we can reach students some students right now don't do well for example online credit recovery so what can we do during the school year to provide alternative options so we are looking at that systemically thank you and is there a timeline that you will have on when you might have other methods are timeline is to begin rolling this out spring of 25 and really having a different looking Credit Recovery summer school in summer 25 perfect thank you okay are there any other questions for 3.1 or we can move to 322

[01:34:00]
I'm going to change it up a little and I'm going to go back over to board members and you get to ask the first question thank you I actually do not have any questions for 3.2 so I'll pass it back to you okay word member Dominguez I would I would encourage you board members dog and maybe maybe one will come to you as we're so I'm I'm going to reference my question references the answer to question number four under three point three point two that question was each year the data indicates a decrease in

[01:35:00]
to what do you attribute to decrease in Mighty plan to address it and so in your answer you mentioned student the Student Success plan so how does the Student Success plan work specifically to mitigate dropping the dropping of rigorous classes especially among our minority the least the kids who are not participating which are mostly the Martinez in and populations in African American

[01:36:00]
why we see the number of students enrolled in courses declined from semester 1 to semester 2 and there's a couple of things that that we've identified is that students who are academically in some courses maybe not prepared at the beginning of that course and begin to just on the onset of the course that semester one they're not seeing the success or the grade or you know that they would like so that's a semester they have that option to either remain in that course or they could level down to another course at that time and the concept of providing academic interventions to the right students at the right time really identify those students early on in the semester and ensuring that they have either tutoring a

[01:37:00]
disaster plan specific to that course so those are some of the things that we've talked about I want to pass the doctor Gonzales is it in Gonzales member Dominguez Dr Blakey the question is a good one and I think it is an area that we do need to improve on but I would like to point out an inherent celebration to this in that in APS we Foster a culture where we allow space an opportunity for students to try to enroll in to give it a shot to get their best at it and sometimes it works and sometimes through support the around Services through tutoring through teacher student relationship we see more and more students taking these classes that are pointed out to us for focus in 3.

[01:38:00]
sometimes it doesn't the key here I think is are we keeping track and if a student gives it a shot and comes up short and maybe goes from an AP class to a regular English class for example how are we keeping track through counseling through the grade level administrator through the teacher that receiving the student to be able to see what is the next plan for the following year or even the next semester so that we are able to really keep track of that student support them see how we're able to build up those skills so that they are able to then take another shot at this pathway at this AP class at this industry certification or what have you been the following semester of the following year so I just want to point out that way it may seem like the enrollment from semester to semester decrease or what have you I think it's also something to celebrate that we have an expect

[01:39:00]
a space an opportunity for our students to enroll and try and that we have supports for them regardless of how they achieve in that giving class yes answer your question yes I just forgot to leave something else yes thank you I have a question to strategic priority 3 engines where are you talking about the next step plans so my question is what do we know about the efficacy of The Next Step plans cuz I hear embedded and I see embedded in the answer is either an assumption or analysis that there's something not working right now with the next step plans

[01:40:00]
and so my question really current performance related is what do we know about the efficacy of those and that sort of process of board president Gonzalez members of the board Dr Blakey what we know right now with just being honest with you is that it's a document but is it an actual document that a student's excited about looking at because it's a line to that students post secondary goals is that documented exciting for the parent to look at because they can see their students progress and I and and also have a conversation with their students about wow you're planning to do this and I can see how this plan actually is going to support you when you leave High School I mean really making it relevant something I'm excited about and I'm hopeful is that house bill 171 the state is looking at requiring

[01:41:00]
do you have plans to happen at 8th grade through high school and really aligning the the conversations we've had strategically aligning that next step plan in a timely way so that students when they're choosing their courses students and families no opportunity knowledge and have that vast knowledge to align their courses that they're going to take and really allowing the document to be relevant for the student and family just to add on to that moving away from just doing it as compliance which didn't necessarily have a relevant connection to the student but making it something that is Meaningful the truth is as a district apartments in a meaningful way to offer the associated support to schools so

[01:42:00]
departments have come together to their credit to be able to see how can we take this as an area that the goal has surfaced as needing attention to be able to offer consistent coherent support to schools so it's basically my point is departments have taken out and are working to offer support to schools in support of the goal 3 team and to the high schools Mr Garcia I appreciate you starting with the tagline around student outcomes don't change until a little behaviors change and so my question is what adult for in terms of future performance what adult behaviors need to change both at The District in the school level to enable these next step plans to be more meaningful

[01:43:00]
more relevant and less compliance oriented board president members of the board Dr Blakey it starts with my leadership in creating the conditions that will create the space for teachers to be successful in providing dialogue and planning and working with families The Next Step plans so it starts with my leadership first and foremost by creating the conditions but really mindset in a culture of agency and if one adult on a compass says all the next steps those are just those that don't mean anything that's not a culture of agency so it starts with me by creating the next vacation and myself really explaining and creating the right conditions for this to work thank you for that

[01:44:00]
so I'm going to be referencing the next level of work for goal 3.2 and what's listed there is develop graduate profiles based on new graduation requirements create framework for 8th grade Next Step plans develop process to get potential students enrolling courses apply for Grants Etc work to ensure Equitable access to course offerings I've left out rules sequence and lessons for fall I understand things are important you can't do anything without that but of the let's see one two three four five remaining five have they are all important have they been prioritize and what you want to see first president's we are excited about the promise and potential of House Bill 171

[01:45:00]
it is hot off the press from this most recent legislative session so we have done a few things to begin this work which is in its absolute intensity in terms of implementation this work on this bill that takes effect August of 2520 I think I got those those years right off the top of my head but with all of that said we've done a few things we have conceptually through a macro lens worked with our district and our partners at the Albuquerque teachers Federation to come up with the joint memo to teachers and principals on how we are going to begin looking at this together how are we going to begin looking at new courses for example that may ignite the interest of our students and engages in school that will ignite the imagination

[01:46:00]
teachers to be able to perhaps have a Renaissance in their excitement for the promise of what lies with the students that they now teach in their classrooms so license and permission to think big so to speak we've also have worked with our curriculum board which I think is important to highlight as a very critical group that works on some of these very specific technical areas in terms of the curricular Frameworks of our schools the way that we're working with course offerings how are students are responding for courses how are working with our teachers to keep their courses online and up-to-date and meeting the needs of our students so that work is ongoing and we have a working group that has been established that will really be working throughout next school year to bring to life this

[01:47:00]
house bill into practicality and practice in Albuquerque Public Schools So my answer is brought in nature but as the days and weeks go by it will become more and more specific thank you anything else I'll go ahead and ask my question I do have one actually I wanted to say first thank you Mr Garcia about just kind of explaining why it's important for everything to start with District right and creating that environment I think that that's super important and it made this question come up to me they're coming to my head is what additional support are we giving our subgroup students who are taking AP courses

[01:48:00]
and if we're not what can we do better in order to keep them enrolled in those courses we have horses and are focus group students or not or all of our students and looking at for example like APA and what students are underrepresented and we did provide a document for you and our Technical and Technical responses that had actual strategies from both AP college board but also actual schools throughout the country that

[01:49:00]
I'm promising practices in these areas I want to use our special education students as an example and when we look at AP courses and we look at data and if it's at a school and we have an underrepresented population what are we doing as a school to create a sense of belonging for those students in those courses that they too have the right and belong in those courses one of the strategies in that document is actually having student ambassadors on campuses working with other students to encourage them to take courses I think that's one example but on that document there's other examples but I just really appreciate your your question because we really want to include all students in all of these courses and we want to strategically identify those that are not taking part to a

[01:50:00]
does analysis create an action plan look at the data again and see if there are you know plan worked but thank you for the question cuz it is important to us that we have all students represented in all of our courses thank you and I wanted to connect this to the climate and culture as well just because of my personal experience as a student and be told that I shouldn't be an AP courses because of the middle school that I went to write so changing those narratives and how we speak to students and population is super important for them to be able to want to take these classes or feel like they can take these classes so again I just appreciate the work that everyone is doing thank you thank you for remember historic and I think with that general statement you just highlighted the work that we need to do so thank you for sharing that part and my question is in regards to

[01:51:00]
3.2 on page 4 of our monitoring report under the Strategic priority responsive and coordinated systems you say that you will develop a process for career connected learning grant writing to support sustainable funding for Staffing and resources my question is how are you relying on grant funding as a sustainable action to specifically support the goal of course enrollment very excited that you asked this question the reason is the opportunity to talk about our ABC partnership with the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County through Community Schools specifically I don't know if you saw the media recently through the Community School calendar High School on identified an interest from their students have Auto Body offered on their campus world

[01:52:00]
2017 or so they lost their auto mechanic teacher and they were they haven't been able to at this point find someone but they identified through the community school framework which is one of the the pillars for Community Schools is after school time and providing enrichment so at Highland High School what they've done through the partnership and grants I'm working with Mr B's Auto they took the old Auto space that was no longer being used and they refurbished that area they actually do the City of Albuquerque were able to pay for instructors to come into the course they also were able to identify a curriculum that students could earn a certification in and that's one example of grant writing thinking outside of the box but our current situation

[01:53:00]
in and then talking to Tori Stevenson is part of our goal 3 team we have to consume to write grants and look at different ways of Staffing for Career Technical education and other courses so that's why we specifically put that in there and so is a follow-up is that strategy sustainable to be relying on grants remember Jackson presidents that are available to this specific area is something that we need to do I really want to highlight the work of our career connected learning department and the way that they have let us

[01:54:00]
over the last couple of years to grow those funds so long as they're available at the federal level for example I think we have learned over the last couple of years that we can maximize those funds as a specific example I will tell you that being able to witness how those funds have matriculated down into our middle schools to have alignment of career connected learning programs in our middle schools with Pathways not starting in 9th grade but starting in 6th grade has not become the exception but has begun to be the norm and that has largely been available through federal grants that we have been able to be smart about accessing and that has been largely due to our career connected learning director who has really helped us on maximize that opportunity for remember Jackson I think the other part of this

[01:55:00]
that's important to look at big picture as we developed the budget for the next fiscal year as we move into these goals I think it feeds grants should always be to leverage what we are already using and I say that because right now it's not used to leverage we really use it to provide all the programming for career connected learning so as we move into our next budget cycle I think it's really important for us to look at goal 3 very strategically to how much operational money are we putting towards our goals specifically to go 3 in career connected learning and then how do you use the federal grants to enhance that rather than it being the pool funding mechanism to achieve this part of Google free thank you

[01:56:00]
anybody else any other questions on 3.2 or should we move to 3.33% okay 3.3 and let's see I'm going to start with member benefits you got it you got to be on your toes when I'm facilitating people how do I answer this time president Gonzalez thank you so much question related to 3.3%

[01:57:00]
and it's related to Industry Partnerships that we currently have to Foster Career Pathways and the attainment of credentials what do we know about what's working and where there are gaps in Industry Partnerships to improve career Pathways board president Gonzalez in challenges in gaps is specifically in working with trade unions and students having to be 18 years old to be able to access some specific internships and stuff like that is a barrier but I also thinking some of our CTE courses is is also a barrier for us

[01:58:00]
specifically in manufacturing such as like I don't want to call it would shop because we're you know expanding those courses to be more than that but no welding and all of those other courses auto mechanics the real barrier right now is is finding instructors in those courses and in February we actually have to do yesterday be a Career Technical education review of our district and on that day in February we actually invited industry partners for them to look at the results of that report and for them to actually provide us recommendations so that we can align and make our curriculum relevant but also so that we can identify or academic skills or soft skills like what do students need the day they step out of high school from 1 foot out of

[01:59:00]
High School in one foot into the job site like can that be one step and then and students be ready so I'd like to talk you know more beyond the examples I've given but right now that's kind of what I have and I appreciate that and at this point I think that's a completely sufficient answer I do want to flag that when we did our community outreach in order to set our goals and guardrails there was a specific meeting with industry partners and one of the things that they expressed to us was frustration at how difficult it is to partner with the district and I think some of the things we heard as we provide these trainings already for our incoming staff why can't we partner with APS to provide these trainings and have our trainers work in their schools so it sounds like you're addressing those things already which is great and I think I'm really I'm just really help really happy that you shared

[02:00:00]
to Circle back around which is what we said we would do with our Community Partners and say that we're following up on it thank you and something that came to mind that I'd like to highlight recently is again any opportunity that we have in Partnership if it's going to improve student outcomes we're going to have conversations with everybody and anybody to find Opportunities one thing we're working on right now is partnership with CNM in our Wagner facility which is our current bus depot there's a diesel mechanic Bay and a large space and we just met with facilities department and CNM just last week in envisioning and labor unions in visioning what this can look like and really leveraging the instructors from CNM

[02:01:00]
to be able to teach in this space for dual enrollment courses for our students but then also CNM being able to use this space in the evenings so that students can continue their certifications but then also providing industry partners and trade unions in Partnership to be part of this space and utilize it for training and so forth thank you you'll hear mine because I don't know that I have a question I can ask one I don't know if its strategic it might be technical or tactical but okay let me get my chart so and I just want to say that I was really really stuck on

[02:02:00]
1.1 in graduation rates so that's why I'm a little unprepared at this point but so next level of work for both 3.3 in the presentation that summarizes all the information not the graphs in the data the first bullet says update program of study course Frameworks and is there a timeline for that and I know that's probably clarifying but you know that's my question and if you've already found yeah okay board president benavidez numbers of the board so we started that actually in our First Progress monitoring and looking at the data and finding next level of work so we've already started that work since the last progress monitoring and I could tell you specifically how many have already been updated I don't have that exact number and I don't want to give you the wrong number but we've already done from that progress monitoring to this one we've already done quite a few but the

[02:03:00]
that was really relevant that actually pertains to this one is to 3.3 on page 3 under strategic priority rigorous instruction you say that you will continue collaborating with high schools to guarantee the utilization of high-quality instruction materials I noticed that you use the word guarantee which is interesting because that was part of what board member benefits this question was last time so I'm highlighting that you said guarantee which I'm not going to recommend or put my opinions on that so my

[02:04:00]
is this a current performance of guaranteeing the utilization of high-quality instructional material and what metrics do you have to prove that this will increase the successful Credit attainment in these courses what number Jackson president Gonzalez Dr Blakey there's a lot in that question and I may need you to repeat it but I'm going to start answering part of it how do we what's the Matrix to ensure the correlation between the use of high-quality instructional materials and credit payment in these areas I think what are the things that we recognize is

[02:05:00]
student's ability to comprehend the content in any content area in a very fundamental level using their ability to read is going to be very important especially as they progress in these technical courses that are going to require them to interact deeply with the text so one of the things that we recognize and have been working on throughout this progress monitoring Journey as you well know is working to ensure that high quality instructional materials are being used in every classroom be a district adopted and if it's not distributed following the definition of high quality and giving the principles the tools they need to have those robust and meaningful and dare I say transformative conversations with teachers so that is something

[02:06:00]
that we have taken to heart we have taken literally and worked very hard with great intentionality to make sure that that happens so at a very fundamental level we believe that a student needs to be able to have the tenants and the ability to function in literacy and numeracy go one and two so that they can achieve as they progress in our system and really interact with the courses Pathways and opportunities laid out in Gold three and I feel like I missed one part of your question it was the guarantee the utilization it was is this the current current current action are you currently this is currently and I think will be on going throughout the life of this progress monitoring journey I think

[02:07:00]
we look forward to the opportunity to update board on guardrail 3 in August I think think it's in August with some of the associated metrics thank you you want me to come back you have a 3.3 questions I do thank you my question is what support strategies are we currently using to ensure our undocumented students are given access to work with their industry partners and what if any are the barriers Sports Secretary of score of the board on this question I don't feel confident that I can answer in a way I need time to research that so can I get back to you on that yeah thank you

[02:08:00]
so many questions around culturally and linguistically I'm really focused on our kids and our bilingual kids it's a gift for a variety of languages that's exciting and I think it's actually important industries certification so what system is in place

[02:09:00]
what considerations are happening for collecting data on or figuring out how we collecting data on kids getting industry certification increase so what what systems are strategies are currently in place to ensure that the students listed in the goals

[02:10:00]
are violent well e l l bilingual and I would include special ed kids are getting access to Industry certification and bilingual seal I change the question a little bit yes well that would be a goal 3.2 question though because that's enrollment I think you're we're on 3. 3 9 9

[02:11:00]
in any one of our goals 3.132 and 33 and we can look at school data we can look at focus group data and again and that continuous improvement process and cycle in US relentlessly looking at data we can identify any course of study and narrow the data down to to any school and focus group so that's one of our systems that we do have and again our strategy is to look at all of our courses and school specifically for over in addition to focus group data but one thing I do want to mention in meeting with our goal three team in preparation for this meeting Richard sisneros the executive director of inequity go overseas our bilingual programming provided me some data specifically that I like to share with you in regards

[02:12:00]
bilingual sales and what the data is telling me is that our bilingual sales in 2223 we have $1,392 and starting out in bilingual sales being awarded I'm looking back to 26217 back then we had $191 students receive a sale and I'd like us to take a moment to thank all of our students and families and all those that have contributed to us going from 1901 and 2016 2017 to 1,392 in 2223 and one thing I want to mention is that we're getting close to pre-pandemic pre-pandemic numbers right now so I think that's something for us to celebrate thank you that's encouraging and yeah I mean

[02:13:00]
I can't say enough great things I was just at Rio Grande High School it matters first language Heritage language development will you know we talked about accelerated growth at the last meeting that's how you get it it's with that Heritage language that sense of belonging so that makes me very happy all right are there any other 3.3 questions I think you are officially off the hot seat however I do just want to as I close out my first facilitating session just a couple things that I would like to remind us all about so first of all I want to thank the board members for a very productive conversation a couple things just that I would like to follow up his first of all I want to think Mr Garcia

[02:14:00]
specifically I know that this was a it's never fun to sit in front of a group and answer a bunch of questions you did a fantastic job and I really want you to highlight two things that I really appreciated about your presentation first of all you were very honest and that is very heartening to us as board members and more importantly to the public that you were honest about the data and you were honest about what you did know what you did not know and what was working and what was not working so it really appreciate that Honesty with us and the other thing that I want to highlight is two times you did refer back to the Q&A document and you did mention that they were Technical and Technical questions that had been answered and so I do appreciate your depth of knowledge on the questions that we asked and your referral back to them so thank you so much I know you were not alone in this presentation and I and I don't mean to why do you mean to single out you did a great job so thank you everybody

[02:15:00]
and then just for the board members and just some coaching that I'm that I'm going to address a facilitator is to make sure that when we are doing these progress monitoring reports that we are actually we are asking questions from the progress monitoring report and not from the Q&A document the Q&A document which you refer to Mr Garcia we we have that beforehand so if there's any follow-up questions that come from the Q&A document we need to send those in an advance or after the meeting but really our questions need to be coming from the progress monitoring report that's in front of us so I think those are just the two things that I wanted to see and now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and her team and have the deeper

[02:16:00]
standing of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them to do that I'm going to turn it back over to the board president who will take it from here thank you member Jackson at this point I will entertain a motion for the acceptance of this monitoring report I moved to accept this monitoring report a second this is Heather thank you have a motion for remember Dominguez in the second remember benavidez Miss King can we have a roll call vote please Secretary of historia importante

[02:17:00]
we will go targets are presenter for this agenda item is our superintendent Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey and I will turn the floor to thank you board president Gonzales and members of the board this evening you have in front of you the annual targets that I have set up moving forward for our progress monitoring and as you all know each of these will lead up to us accomplishing our goal after the five year goal and also will be used as a measure in my evaluation and the evaluations of my team as we move forward on progress monitoring in the goals I don't think I need to go into detail on why it's important to have the annual targets I think you will definitely see a difference in the presentations for Progress monitoring as well as the data that you look at because we'll have a very clear understanding if we're meeting our annual Target and without annual

[02:18:00]
targets a long-term Target is obviously very difficult to see if you're going to make it so I'm very excited about being able to dig into these and to create them and I don't want to you know read to you that each individual one because I think you have them I think the importance of understanding how we came up with them was we used a sleep creep leap method and it's really good timing because it's spring and this is also how you plant seeds as you know really this method is to start at the beginning you'll see in all of the annual goals there's a smaller increase because the first year is really putting in the foundation and the work for our Little Seedling seedling to have the right conditions in which they can

[02:19:00]
and so we really are you'll see in the beginning we don't have large leaves because we're setting the foundation you're too we also have like the creep which is we're trying to creep up to you'll see a little bit of a bigger game and this is kind of what you see in looking at data and initiatives and the outcomes of those initiatives over the course of time I see your two as the year that people are saying like are we really doing this so like if we back off a little bit does that mean that they're going to push us back and so it was kind of like a little give and take of are we really going to have this plant grow and that's why you'll see in your two little bit of an increase but really you expect to come down a little bit or to be flat because it's usually in your two you'll see it as a time of people wondering do we still have to do this

[02:20:00]
when it's all well established so now we're a little seedlings have grown into plants of data and you will see a larger growth now in our data because it's been operationalized and it's been sustained as initiatives that we are carrying on with and as we talked about tonight as you progress Monitor and if you're using it and you're 90-day plan you'll start to see that you're going to see bigger increases of growth because you're checking along the way to see if you need to pull back or push in on the initiatives so you'll see in go one for example to get to go to get to the 37.3 per cent in 2028 I've established the 1% and then you'll see it Grow from

[02:21:00]
1% a little bit larger a little bit larger than the biggest sleep in the last year and that's again putting in all of the conditions that then meet their targets and one thing I want to point out is because it's the the creep of that second year to is if we we have annual targets that at the end of this year you see that we have gone over the what are Target was we will keep the same Target for the next year and so that I just wanted to reiterate because we won't adjust the targets we're going to hope that that will help Propel us to be able to sustain the growth to move forward it doesn't mean that we're going to pull back or that we're going to adjust the targets if we meet them we'll keep them where they are because the target is to hit where we are in 2028 now when we get to 2020 these numbers sound like that's like so long 2027 sounds to me like an eternity but it's really around the corner so 2027 if we get there and we're

[02:22:00]
you know 38% then in 2027 that could be a time to like start the next 5 years Target goals because we're so far ahead of where we thought so it's not to pull back to shorten our growth we want to still Propel forward but we really need to look at those final two years and what I hope we would already be at the 37.3 percent by 2027 and when that's the case we can re-establish what our next five year growth would be so that's for Google one and then you'll see the interim goals the interim goals are the three year goals so this is a little bit you'll see these in what we just did for example and so these have a shorter growth because it's over three years of time and then for go to for math proficiency you'll see the same kind of idea again in 2027 if

[02:23:00]
are above 21% I think that would be a good time to start pushing ourselves forward to to move our goal into a higher level hoping that we would be above that by that time and the interim goals will be the way that will be able to tell if we're going to make it to that level of course and that's the indicator of looking at the interim goals with a correlation to the goal to see if those correlations are matching the growth of the of the Big Goal I want to point out go for I think we've talked a lot about tonight you'll see the only interesting one that we talked about the one we were off track in interim both 3.1 remember that's a Dropout so that is decreasing over the course of the of time instead of increasing with the percent so I want to point out goal for this is a skills habits in mindsets we have adjusted

[02:24:00]
the way that we look at and measure the school to make it more understandable and easier to track progress because this goal remember is measuring the percent of students who demonstrate the skills of perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness as measured by an evidence-based underlying tool the line tool as we've seen in previous presentation of gold for doesn't include these all together we're measuring them each separate so we thought that it would be more appropriate in the annual targets to separate them now the part of this so you'll see perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness all separated out as for like indicators with I want to point out that if we were at the goal the target for three of the four

[02:25:00]
because even though we're measuring them individually the idea that this goal is saying that we're moving up in all four so we're measuring them individually but it takes all four to move to the Target to say that we are on target for Gulf War and you'll see that in the interim goals then that we have them split up as well and then you'll see in the interim goals annual targets each of them are split up for the three-year goals and this is again divided up for each individual area but it would take all of them moving forward to be on target so if we were to tell can you do the next slide so if for example on perseverance for 54 percent and then self-regulation we

[02:26:00]
at 65% then we are off Target because again we're looking at all all four of them cohesively but breaking them out for more understanding and to be able to really dig into the levers in which we can increase that for our students and those are the targets that you will now see in the progress monitoring on the data that we display on the progress reports now you'll see a line that has the yearly Target thank you for that presentation and so I just want to remind the board that we do have a responsibility to approve these annual goals and also to make sure that our questions are not providing guidance guidance suggestions or recommendations but also just help us advance

[02:27:00]
whether or not these annual goals also contribute to the ability of the school district to meet the goals and to achieve the vision and values of the community as it was expressed to us and so with that I will open it to questions from the board again with the encouragement that we're focusing on clarifying understanding but also maintaining alignment to the vision and values that we heard from our community and so with that I'll just open up the floor to any questions any clarification you mentioned where are the where the numbers the goals related to the overall you have you have perseverance off regulation self-efficacy these are all divided into their own categories but we are still

[02:28:00]
trying to are the targets the overall so the annual targets that you'll see is over the 5 years overall moving those targets forward and and then on the interim goals you'll see those Broken Out by grade level of 5th graders 8th graders and 10th graders so are the annual goals they're not here though yes they are can't see what number 114 in 2023 to 2029 you're asking where that when the overall the main goal right yeah that's gone and it's now these four

[02:29:00]
for the presentation and again more importantly for the work we look forward to seeing

[02:30:00]
show up in our progress monitoring reports and seeing the progress with them as well with that we are going to move to the next agenda which is agenda item number 6 which is President's Report with a reminder that you don't get to leave after that board members cuz we have an executive session following that however we will not convene again online we will just convene in person to read the statement of closure and then to State the next board meeting and then to adjourn the meeting so folks in the audience to you're not going to miss out anything if you go home after the president's report so I do want to begin by again echoing the appreciation from the board for the team Dr Blakey and for Mr Garcia for the presentation related to goal three and also Echo your appreciation which you began with for the great work of the folks at the school site level including the amazing work of our students and families as well

[02:31:00]
I want to just Echo that appreciation for you but also for the appreciate the appreciation that you expressed and staying on the topic of appreciation I also just want to express tremendous appreciation to member Jackson for being the guinea pig but you're an amazing job of facilitating the first round of our rotating progress monitoring as mentioned board members will take turns running the portion of the meat that portion of our meeting which is the progress monitoring next up is secretary historico who will facilitate the discussion on guard rail to monitoring reports at the May 1st meeting and then again a reminder that we're going to go in order so district one two three four I guess I can't remember I think we're skipping District 3 because I've already done it anyway it's in my email but we will be going in that order and I also just want to fly but there is a lot more behind the scenes and member Jackson spoke to that a little bit in terms of her meeting with Dr Gonzalez

[02:32:00]
review of the questions that were submitted in advance and all of that was captured in the facilitator guide that we prepared and so the facilitator in addition to running the meeting does have a role prior to the meeting and we've also included into that facilitator guide a timeline for when you should be doing what relative to when the reports are posted and when our questions are due so the facilitator has that function and we one of the final things on that facilitation guy is for the facilitator to reflect and there's some reflection questions on there and so remember Jackson will be doing that as well and any Reflections that she has around how this worked how well it worked what needs to be improved what can be improved will work to continuously improve and reflect those in the facilitation guide but again as I stated at the beginning if there is feedback from anyone about the progress monitoring

[02:33:00]
but particularly this new shift in facilitation if you could just please share that feedback with board services or with myself another really cool change that we had tonight was a little cheat sheet a couple of cheat sheets so we do have a flow chart which we mentioned here around effective question asking and so again I do want to thank member Jackson for helping us with the flow chart but also helping us to remember to ask smart questions which are strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time bound we also have a new resource related to Robert's Rules and what Robert's Rules procedures are needed when why and how so that's all we have here at the dance and thank you for that work and also just provide the reminder again about why we're doing all of this because it is a lot of behind the scenes work it is

[02:34:00]
watch of time and effort for the administration obviously to prepare these reports but for board members to to do our pre-work to do our reading to understand the progress monitoring reports and to come up with questions that are smart and the reason we are doing this is because we are committed to improving student outcomes and be careful review of progress monitoring reports is the way that we as a board will hold this Administration accountable for meeting the vision and values of our communities so it's critically important so yay for student outcomes Focus governance I also want to flag that this Friday is the aps Education Foundation and annual gold bar event which helps raise dollars for Innovative programs in our schools it's a really cool opportunity so folks if you have tickets look forward to seeing you there at the gala guests have an opportunity to

[02:36:00]
for listening to the community for their responsiveness to the community and also acknowledge I think all of our phones are blowing up and we're getting lots of emails and we're not going to be able to district is not going to be able to please every person all the time but I think what's most important is the two-way communication the accepting feedback the transparency and always centering students in our decision-making process so I would encourage folks who have questions and concerns about the Bills schedule to continue to share them with your board members but also more importantly with your school leadership with the administration and with the service center if needed tonight we heard in public comment feedback about dual language about professional development for physical education about State Testing dates about Charter School budgets and APS roll their about the link between reading disab
