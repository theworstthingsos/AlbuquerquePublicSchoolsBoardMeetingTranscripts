[00:06:00]
that feeds Taft both draw from the local community I feel that this is an issue of equity Coronado serves a population that has the resources and the time to transport their kids across the city our North Valley Community is in Desperate Missy hold on I think you needed yourself comma population are students if we had a long-term strategic plan coupled with better community outreach from APS thank you very much for your time thank you our next speaker is in the room Carolyn Kaiser I believe followed by Rachel

[00:07:00]
Rickenbacker so you have one minute once you begin speaking hold on let me make sure that hold on give me one second okay thank you madam president and members of the board my name is Caroline Kaiser and I'm here tonight to ask you to delay the Taft Middle School right sizing vote that scheduled for December 18th and I'm also here to speak against the current Coronado expansion proposal I would like to know what if any analysis or strategic planning board members have seen that demonstrates the educational value of the current proposal and if they have seen such analysis that they make it public so members of the community can be informed in the aps parameters for determining area changes the first criteria listed is the educational and Community needs of students and the second criteria is to

[00:08:00]
do all options in light of all facts I would like to know that all options and all facts have been considered and how the district is planning to meet the educational needs of all students impacted by this decision thank you thank you for next speaker is I'm sorry is Rochelle McIntyre you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you my name is Rochelle and beer thank you for your willingness to hear from the community that will be directly affected by this and we ask that you amend the plan do a language programming coming into the neighborhood and not having a track that allows the neighborhood to access that school is exclusionary unacceptable and directly against the parameters listed in the proposal for determining admin School attendance area changes against these parameters this proposal is truly only single School focused either place a quality dual language Middle School at Taylor and Coronado can join us there in accordance with these parameters teachers who are starting at the former task site can now be located

[00:09:00]
Taylor with any new 6th graders from both schools or require Coronado middle school to allow any dual language students living in the Taylor Taft Middle School District to have full rights to attend the program and complete it there starting with the incoming class school year 24 and 25 I hope this change over can be paused for actual Community input and to allow more stakeholders like we see here today invited into the conversation to get this accomplished and fairly thank you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Sally directions Sally are you there yes can you hear me yes ma'am I can hear you have one minute can you still see me yes ma'am okay

[00:10:00]
The Proposal I'm also here to speak against the Coronado proposal I have three kids the oldest is in kindergarten at Alvarado Elementary the youngest is 3 weeks he's in my lap I was a public school middle school teacher and I believe strongly in neighborhood Public Schools I would like to ask the board to inquire of the administrative staff whom they oversee what kind of Outreach have you conducted on this issue to this point what kind of public input meeting place where parents or schools in any manner genuinely consulted in their decision-making process and if not what does the administrative staff plan to do to remedy this allowing a PTA to hold a community Forum to present questions and concerns is not genuine public leadership it's a scrap thrown to the families and Educators who have no ability to affect a decision that has already been made by administrative staff if this proposal really will benefit students and schools parents and Educators the district should have no problem delaying the vote

[00:11:00]
facilitating genuine Community discussion thank you thank you man our next speaker is in the room Megan along and you have one minute thank you period was going to cost even though it was published in APS meeting minutes and as part of The Proposal these Representatives said the remodel would be mostly water fountains and new furniture which is not accurate the remodel would include new buildings playgrounds in administrative wing and an extensive remodel to the existing structure

[00:12:00]
call at the cost of almost 14 million if APS administrative staff are not clear about the details of the proposal and what it entails how can the public have confidence in that proposal or even get the facts straight about what's going to happen in their communities this is further evidence that much more public Outreach and Community input is needed and that the proposal as it stands has been Gravely rushed and poorly considered a delay at minimum is necessary thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Christina you have one minute one should begin speaking man thank you members of the board I have been teaching at Alvarado for 23 years I asked you to delay the December 18th right size I think about and to him in the proposal I am here to speak against the Coronado proposal last night at the PTA meeting at Alvar

[00:13:00]
Elementary APS staff claimed that the expansion of Coronado at the old tap location will not affect existing elementary schools in the North Valley if APS truly believes that no existing students in schools will be affected by Coronado I would ask the board to please inquire of its administrative staff what kind of support will APS commit to providing to the long-standing long ignored infrastructure needs of those existing North Valley Schools to help them Thrive if they are here to stay as community members overwhelmingly desire what will APS do to make sure that they last into the future for the benefits of those communities furthermore were any other locations considered for this relocation of Coronado and if so can APS please provide the data as to why Taft was selected finally it was insulting last night when the aps represented showed up and said that they were not prepared to present anything to our community thank you thank you our next speaker is Amy Ziegler

[00:14:00]
just one minute once you begin speaking thank you members of the board I asked you to delay the December 18th have to write sizing boat and to amend the proposal at the community meeting the PTA held last night we heard many parents say they were upset that they needed to shop for a middle school because they don't have a good option for 6 to 8th grade in the North Valley and in the Albuquerque area what we heard from APS Representatives last night is that the Coronado Community is in the same situation which is why they have advocated to turn their school into a k through eight and into a larger facility I think what are Community is struggling to understand is why one school would get with their asking for and another part of the city wouldn't when we both have the same need it would seem that one potential solution would be to give everyone a well-funded well-resourced dual language Middle School

[00:15:00]
out the lottery system that is open to all North Valley students thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Emily harmonia she is on Zoom Emily are you there I'm here can you hear me yes ma'am you'll have one minute once you begin speaking thank you members of the board I asked you to delay the December 18th chapter of Elementary and Garfield Middle School even though we could send her children to rear Rancho Public Schools Charter or private school in fact I'm actually sitting in the Garfield parking lot because I just picked my daughter up from basketball practice I would inquire this board whether they feel they are in charge of the administration of the school district or if the administration is dictating to the board as well as elected officials you are our voice the administration is well compensated and full time but when a board member tells the community PTA meeting that she was not allowed to talk about this Coronado expansion plan until very recently

[00:16:00]
I felt restricted about spreading the word about the proposal it raises questions for the community whether the tail is wagging the dog the administration of this District answers to you please use the power you have as delegated to you by the people of this city to compel Administration and staff and Leadership to respect the people they are paid to serve thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Karen garment and she'll be followed by Janet Sayers she'll have one minute once you begin speaking good evening Madam president and members of the board thank you for hearing me speak today my name is Karen DeArmond I've been teaching it Alvarado Elementary for the past 25 years I asked you to delay the December 18th Taft right sizing boat and to amend the proposal I'm also here to speak against the Coronado proposal if this proposal is in the best financial instruments of the district where is the analysis that proves that to be true

[00:17:00]
North Valley schools have been deteriorating for decades nevertheless schools like Alvarado Elementary a spotlight due to its high test scores are thriving there are vacancies in our high-performing programs and dual language offerings the district has stated that they want to prioritize Community Schools and supporting the existing North Valley Schools is a wonderful way to do that thank you thank you man or next speaker is Janet Sayers I was hoping to talk for 2 minutes but Madame President members of the board and Madame superintendent so I'm here tonight obviously to speak about the 60th anniversary of Del Norte but we have a staff member they're in the front row and working with our newcomers so I'm glad to see Kara and want to acknowledge her efforts

[00:18:00]
I had no idea anything was happening at Taft but I'm going to learn by the end of it we had Community engagement last night at Del Norte we had several hundred people show up for both a choir concert that involve McKinley but middle school and also a basketball game so people come when there's things that they really care about whether that's oh my God by 5 Seconds anyway so thank you for your service and I want to say something about 1955 Valley High School having their having their 70th anniversary and I'll speak next time about a gift that's going to be coming to Valley high school thank you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Stephen

[00:19:00]
I have two grandchildren in Alvarado and all three of my wife's grown children attended both Alvarado and Taft we live in Lehigh Acres I'm respectfully requesting a delay in December 18th right sizing vote to amend the proposal and consider amending the opposite the current car not a plan APS is planning to invest almost 15 million in the upgraded Carnival campus in the North Valley only 15 years after they spent 9 million North Valley elementary schools for years and is now proposing to spend Millions to move a larger School in the area of a school that will not directly serve our neighborhood to me another this in the community it appears at 8:00 is working with a coherent fiscally responsible plan period

[00:20:00]
please delete this vote and give time to reconsider the plan thank you thank you sir next speaker is in the room Megan Hendricks will be followed by Colin ba making you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you madam president

[00:21:00]
creation was that there was a significant problem with the enrollment drop in the aps system and the district had a long-range plan to right size the schools the premise for right-sizing was that the school has to be a certain size of greater than 500 students or the school would be not effective and not fully staffed this would seem adverse to the State admission of the children who are served by APS and the community in the North Valley that was steamrolled with some really scary facts about what is happening in our community that we feel totally caught off guard and so thank you for holding the space for public comment but what my ask is for you the board is to hold

[00:22:00]
a place on your agenda for the 18th meeting so that we can come forward and have proper input to unpack this complexity that we all are completely caught off guard by we are ready to show you how effective we are to collaborate but we need more time than this familiarity of come to the microphone here's a minute to me how many people are this is a bigger issue that we're asking the board to hear us on because we cannot be rushed and just to remind you until the PTA called me last night you were ready to vote on this tonight so please put us on your agenda and give us the time to unpack this with you thank you for next speaker is in person Joshua Guevara you have one minute sir thank you thank you members of the board ask you to delay the December 18th Taft sorry right and to amend the proposal

[00:23:00]
I would ask you to consider the impact on kindergarten enrollment if the proposal is approved a portion of Alvarado students as an example are transfer students that's including my two daughters that I moved down to the valley to specifically attend Taft middle school and Alvarado excuse me at least some of these transfer students and families would be accepted by the lottery and to Coronado because APS publicizes and celebrates and puts magnet schools on a pedestal this would decrease kindergarten enrollment at Alvarado and it's safe to presume at all other North Valley elementary schools what is the aps plan or strategy to help these Community Schools maintain enrollment and maintain the high quality services they offered and if there's no such plan is the aps Administration proposing that these Community Schools be left to fight amongst themselves for transfer enrollment thank you thank you sir so our next speaker is on June Lee Ross are you there

[00:24:00]
I'm here I'm sure you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you members of the board I asked you to delay the December 18th Taft right-sizing vote and Amanda proposal on one side of this proposal are the Coronado families who are asking for a new location outside of the South Valley on the other side of the North Valley Elementary School communities who simply want to see their school supported and invested in these comprised generations of families who have sent their kids to small high-quality neighborhoods schools within their communities as other speakers have said there's a lot is there a long-term set if there's a long-term strategy to help these schools and if this proposal will ultimately benefit them we would simply like to have access to that information and have a form to discuss it with APS If instead moving Coronado is a step in consolidating and closing North Valley Schools we would expect more of a warning and some explanation I sincerely appreciate your time and my my children are both students at Alvarado and I love

[00:25:00]
I just want you to know we it's a strong reaction that you're seeing is due to that thank you sir our next two speakers are on Zoom I'm trying to get him to join is Jackie Dimas and Aaron Wedington like I can't seem to get him to join us I'm going to move on to the next person in the room and then we'll go to the zoo right after a woman and I would like to thank the school administration and staff for creating such a welcoming environment for our family

[00:26:00]
the Administration staff and teachers at Bellaire Elementary have demonstrated over and over their commitment towards building a Vibrant Community out of a bunch of families that all look different and for creating a self welcoming environment for not just my daughter but for all students in our neighborhood to learn and I would like to thank the board for their continued commitment to creating School environments all across the city where all students can prosper and for not acquiescing to demands from Outsiders who would come in and tell who is and isn't allowed to speak who isn't allowed to tell their stories in our schools giving into such demands would do a service to the entire Community thank you very much thank you for our next speaker is on Zoom Aaron wedding to are you there and yes thank you okay you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you members of the board I

[00:27:00]
ask you to delay the December 18th half-right sizing vote into amend the proposal I also attended the PTA meeting last night I'm an educator for APS and a mother of a former fifth grader at Alvarado Elementary School last year when we were searching for middle schools we knew Taft was on the chopping block and I reached out several times to try to find out information in order to find a middle school for my son because of all of the rumors most of the parents at Alberto chose to send their students to Charter Schools or to transfer to other schools this unfortunately left me without any other option that to transfer my own son because without a community you have no options for carpooling or working together I want to see this board fund the schools in our community and open it up to everybody thank you thank you for next speaker is on June Nina Simba you know are you there

[00:28:00]
can you hear me yes ma'am you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you thank you members of the board I respectfully ask you to delay the December 18th right-sizing vote in Amanda proposal to better serve all impacted members of the aps Community including North Valley students and residents this proposal is an example of how APS and leaders have taken a narrow view of this project and failed to consider the impact that moving Coronado will have on our North Valley elementary schools and communities there has been no APS LED public Outreach North to North Valley Community and no attempt together informed feedback and public comment from those who will be impacted this is a missed opportunity missed opportunity to benefit from the input of these North Valley families who are passionate about supporting and improving

[00:29:00]
are public schools and are trying as much as possible to keep our kids within the aps system but would be excluded from sending their kids to the new Coronado facility I have no doubt that APS staff would plan to hold Community input meetings to help explain the impact of this decision after I gained board approval but that is not a decent public stewardship we elect the sport to help us help our kids get the education they need thank you thank you man our next speaker is in the room Ashley Marshall you have one minute what should begin speaking thank you members of the board I am here today to ask for the delay of the December 18th half right sizing boat and to amend the proposal there are some number of complaints from half Middle School parents in the surrounding North Valley Schools regarding the little information received from APS and how we've been reportedly told nothing could be done to stop this and it was already a shirt thing this comes on top of eps staff telling North Valley principals to prepare

[00:30:00]
you're a slow death parents report the top principal Crystal Abalos will not reply to emails phone calls or publicize any meetings for APS input could be received parents and community members deserve to know what the district is planning there is a bare minimum expectation that the decisions the district makes will benefit the best interests of their students it's decisions like these that keep New Mexico 50th and education fight for the North Valley and the improvements of our students education thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Madeline Bossier yes I'm here you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you thank you so much for this meeting I also asked you to delay the December 18th right so I think vote and to amend the proposal as it stands now there's no option for a dual language Middle School here in the North Valley so for those of us who have kiddos in elementary school

[00:31:00]
thinking to the years ahead the Middle School offerings are limited Garfield is a STEM Magnet dual language middle school but actually doesn't really have a dual language program Coronado would be exclusive instead of inclusive of our North Valley Community so we would like some more time to be able to discuss options with the board as to what would be a better use of the Taft location to answer this urgent need for a middle school a dual language Middle School here in the North Valley that will be a community school for all of us thank you so much thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Tom Dimas Tom are you there

[00:32:00]
hey we're going to skip him and maybe come back our next speaker is Anna Little Nikki yes I'm here can you hear me yes ma'am you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you period based on the information that the district has provided to community members who are concerned about the impact of this proposal APS is proposing to invest almost $15.15 years ago many concerned parents community members and Educators in the North Valley are wondering why that kind of investment has never been made for the existing North Valley elementary schools where infrastructures crumbling and years of request for assistance have been ignored by the district at the district has a multi-million dollar plan for improving and upgrading School infrastructure in the North Valley and schools already in the North Valley are the ones who

[00:33:00]
love to see it thank you thank you ma'am Dimas

[00:34:00]
the process the district appears to operate silently many of us in this community are affected and suspected APS is trying to avoid drawing attention to this contentious issue there were no scheduled Community meetings for Alvarado and surrounding neighborhoods until the Alvarado PTA was made aware earlier this week and took no action took action not informing us of a new case through a dual Language School moving into our area and proposing to provide that school with millions of dollars while our high-performing Elementary School is severely underfunded is simply not acceptable holding Community input meetings after a decision has been made is not public governance and also not acceptable you must delay the Coronado vote thank you thank you sir so our next speaker is in the room Joe cardillo followed by Dr sanela

[00:35:00]
good evening members of the board Madam president following up on last month's meeting which was a great deal more contentious in terms of the overall numbers I want to see a couple things one I fully support this District showing up for lgbtq Youth and showing up for queer and non-binary folks and making sure that all students are included Incorporated in welcomed I think that's a new Mexican value and I want to think the board for you know really being focused on that and not getting distracted by having these Outsiders come in and you know kind of share outrageous claims for for gain political gain and and other kinds of reasons and I also think you know anyone who has kids in their life whether it's you know as a parent teacher or a mentor knows that kids you know they hear some percentage of what we say but they watch Almost 100% of what we do and we need to model really showing up for forks with kindness to accountability and respect and I'm struck as someone who grew up in the South Valley by the input in this room as well and

[00:36:00]
particularly in the North and South Valley which in many cases have been disinvested so thank you thank you sir or next speaker is Dr sinata you have one minute once you begin speaking presidential

[00:37:00]
mutilation according to the US News and World Report the highest ranked High School in the city is Cottonwood classical preparatory school did you know today is New Mexico education is dead last interestingly one speaker a woman who identifies all the celestion voice opposition into an inappropriate materials School libraries and classroom naked and clear that her stand was about protecting children not opposing the LGBT community that probably reminded that not everyone within the community activities agenda and also the need for Clear agreed upon standing between parents and schools ensure that all students are supporting without age appropriate position please talk about telling school education but about nothing to do with

[00:38:00]
Pacheco 1 minute once again you can pay for it but us who do not want our APS tax dollars go into this do not have to it is sad that after depression suicide and regret that you shall think this is still the way to educate I personally lean towards teaching students truth you were born a girl or a boy for a special purpose you were you are here to learn to read and write and do it with my dick for 80 years are schools have been 50th in the nation are 30 only 38% proficient in Reading

[00:39:00]
22% proficient in math yet they still graduate schools are being overcrowded with children from Venezuela Cuba and Colombia parents have been taking their kids out and put into private schools for unjustly treatment of their little ones you pride yourself and inclusion but yet this child and parents were not listen to they were Shrugged off into the corner the child was also bullied sexually harassed yet nothing was done to the perpetrators no investigation to find out who was a rat who asked the child the family first to pick APS as a garbage school system and inadequate do you want to have this as a legacy thank you ma'am thank you ma'am thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Odyssey a boycott are you there

[00:40:00]
yes yes I'm here okay you have one minute when she began speaking thank you madam president and members of the board my name is Rachel roycott and my son is in middle school and were you in Navajo and my son has long hair and my son has been bullied because he has long hair and the for the month of Native American Heritage Month my son was being made fun of because he was there because he is native and this made my son made him wish he wasn't native and that you know that really has affected him and now he's not excited about school you know like he used to be and his bullying I think he needs to be

[00:41:00]
the address to you know even with them the the teachers the staff because the individual a staff member made the situation worse and I think they need to be addressed thank you thank you ma'am next speaker is in the room Mariah Martinez thank you I speak to you today as a former student of the North Valley and as a current mother of 3rd Generation North Valley students in opposition to the administrative recommendation to adjust attendance areas for Taft and Taylor middle schools and the move and expansion of Coronado Elementary School which this board will be voting on in two weeks not only do we oppose this proposal but we strongly reject the matter in which it has been brought about without Community input without public

[00:42:00]
go back without input from affected feeder schools without data or strategic planning made public to support it and in no world with half parents choose to close down their school rather than just making it a dual language school but they were not even given the chance to have that input in that decision they were told it is what it is they have also been told to make a decision about where their child is going to school next year by this Friday when this board has not even voted to put this plan in place we urge you to postpone the items to allow actual Community input or otherwise vote against it thank you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Jackie Dimas Jackie are you there can you hear me yes ma'am you have one minute once you begin speaking music is

[00:43:00]
yes ma'am I can hear you now 1 minute okay thank you thank you members of the board I was a teacher to ask for 10 years and an educational diagnostician for the district both our children and our grandchildren have attended North Valley schools and the community that is involved in the North Valley is is tight and is generational I also would ask the board members why you would support remote distribution of resources and opportunity area

[00:44:00]
nearest current location the current proposal would also the most importantly cause congestion congestion and already gridlocked area of the city it would bring hundreds of cars across from across the city and caused the traffic problem in the Taft area and we have to have we are yet to have a traffic study and I know I'm over my time thank you for providing this opportunity for me to speak thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Katharine Mitchell followed by Mary Walker you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening I'm in North Valley Community in many rolls and I'm here asking you that you please delay this December 18th

[00:45:00]
I also attended the community meeting last night and I was very shocked to discover that there was not a traffic study that could be presented even to the community last night considering where the Taft location is I'm also wondering what conversations have been had with the city regarding the North 4th Corridor pedestrian project I think it's really important that you consider the traffic impact on surrounding neighborhoods in the North Valley Community the community has not been made aware that this is even a proposal and I think that's a huge misstep and I ask that you delay the vote thank you thank you next speaker is Mary Walker when you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening and school board members in APS superintendent thank you for being here tonight thank you for the opportunity to speak and thank you for listening madam

[00:46:00]

[00:49:00]
families and staff so to be responsive to the families and we can make planning a little easier and more predictable we have asked the committee to plan for 2-year calendar the first set of proposed calendars was similar to this year's with school starting in early August well the second option had a later start in August to gather input we conducted a survey that asked students families employees and community members which calendar they preferred we did receive nearly 13,000 responses with almost 80% of respondents selecting calendars similar to this year's calendar with the earlier August start based on this feedback we recommend that you approve the calendars that are in your packet with the early start in August please note that adjustments could be necessary if any state laws or public education department rules or District policies change within the

[00:50:00]
this gives the community a little bit of consistency in the calendar additionally we have included the College and Career calendars we are requesting approvals for the 2025 2026 and the 2026 2027 calendar for college and career high school which aligns to the CNM academic calendar and with that we ask for your approval thank you Dr Blakey is there a motion and a second for approval of the 20 25/26 and 2627 in instructional and college and career high school calendars I will move to approve the 2025 20/26 and 2026 2027 instructional and college and career high school calendars this is member Jackson and I will second this is board member benavidez thank you we have a motion and a second is there any discussion all right Dr oh sorry

[00:52:00]
yes have their Benavides yes Crystal tapio Romero yes Josefina Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes and no Gonzalez yes so the motion carries our next item is agenda item 7.1 which is review of board professional development training prior to tonight's meeting and our materials we received background on the professional development hours that are needed by New Mexico law in order to serve as a school board member as well as the agenda for upcoming convening and information about other offerings available to board members for professional development also as part of our student outcomes focused governance framework and training we indicated in our implementation plan that we would prepare individual plans related to our own professional development this is also related to stewardship as we think about and

[00:53:00]
and for the amount of funding that has been allocated in our budget in our board budget for a professional development funds in previous years there was just sort of a broad budget and members just were parts of multiple different organizations and attended trainings and conferences without much strategy or planning certain members would attend more than others lots of travels and trips and we're trying to just make sure that the professional development that we have chosen to do actually aligns with our individual learning goals aligns with state law and aligns with the governing needs of our school board so all board members for asked just to do a little research into their hours their interests what's available and come up with sort of a draft plan for how they might use their professional development funds and what types of professional development training this is not a vote it's merely a discussion to provide space for board members to talk with each other about interests and should there be

[00:54:00]
perhaps the economies of scale by negotiating better rates for conference attendance or for example of six people wanted to go to one conference we might say okay let's dial that back and have two people travel for that one and they come back and give a presentation and four people go to this other conference so that's the purpose and no one had to do any official homework or fill in any official plan or turn anything in so it really is just space for dialogue and discussion board Services did share in advance a accounting of where each one of us stands with our official requirement of hours from the state so you all should have that everyone also has the upcoming agenda with the sessions listed for the next nmsba training which is coming up next week and so I'll just go ahead and open up the floor for members to share I think you can share what topics you're interested in if you've identified specific conferences of

[00:55:00]
just if you've identified other ways in which you might want to spend those dollars whether it's by earning a particular certificate or purchasing a book or purchasing a membership or whatever that may be offering those suggestions as well certainly if someone is interested in the topic of underwater basket weaving and wants to purchase a book on that then one of us might want to borrow that book so it's helpful to know how those funds are being and so we'll just go ahead and we'll go down the line and just have conversation around again where there's mutual agreement or maybe gaps that we might think each one of us has or we have as a board that we might want to fill when it comes to our governing responsibilities so I'll go ahead and start to my right with member Dominguez so I'm the quiet overachiever apparently because how many I've got plenty of credits or hours store

[00:56:00]
but you know and most of my hours I have to say I have have been through the New Mexico School Board Association and I always find those workshops helpful very useful however this year I chose to go to the national Indian Education Association conference and learned quite a bit it was an eye-opening experience a lot of conversation about tribal consultation and I think that's an area that I'm definitely interested in pursuing with our tribes we need to to have meaningful what is Meaningful

[00:57:00]
consultation and I was approached by the Navajo Nation Superintendent at naiah and he reminded me that they did not feel like they had enough participation in the writing of the wordsmithing of of the goals and so he welcomes conversation about that but I think there is room for at least for me as policy chair and just as a board member that's an area I'd like to pursue Beach weather

[00:58:00]
National School Board Association conference and I think that's another I'd like to continue with Naya and I'd also would like perhaps L especially in light of the international Network partnership that we've got going so yes continue with Maya nmsba and plug in to the international networks up to where there's a lineman or joint interesting I received my nmsba note that I

[00:59:00]
do you have 6 hours none of which actually counts so that's a little irritating but that's my personal comment so my plan is that I will be attending the board meeting on Thursday afternoon as the board representative I don't think any of that time actually counts but I will be there as our representative I plan to attend Friday morning so I will receive a point there and then I will attend Saturday morning and I think I received two more points there so I will yeah yeah see how long I stay but I will be there too to get some points at least for that part what I do plan to do I have personally like just on my own I have joined it's a national kind of a network through the American Enterprise Institute it's the conservative education reform Network and they host

[01:00:00]
monthly just monthly sessions on education issues that are that are going on so I've joined a couple of those there's no cost to it so I just have joined those and two times they've actually they are they have a book session a book reading session so they will send you the book again that's for free so they'll send you the book you read the book and then you join a like a session where you discuss the book and those those discussions are on issues that are actually related to our goals so the first one was on math education math education and then there's another one that will be on structured literacy so I've just been kind of joining those just so that I can get my own knowledge I would like to continue attending the great City schools and meetings because I have felt that those meetings are actually more

[01:01:00]
time to our structure of being a large Urban District that the information that I received there is a little bit more helpful to the interests of what Albuquerque Public Schools has to deal with so I do think that those meetings are important to attend and just two more things I am actually kind of interested in that economics that Georgetown University the school Finance certificate and I might have more opportunities to invest in in doing that I know that there is some study and even maybe some travel involved in that so I am a little bit interested in that and then just finally for my professional development I will just continue to reach out to the coaches that we have through Council of great City Schools I did spend a rousing Friday evening one night with my coach or with two coaches so don't be jealous

[01:02:00]
thank you remember Jackson Remember to Marie to okay I do mean all my requirements for nmsba for the state Rags I do really want to attend the National School Board Association conference I was trying to do a parallel between that and the All City the the great City Schools to see which particular conference will really fulfill my needs I do want to attend a national special education conference and I've been looking into that more deeply I did get a scholarship and I had to turn it down for the National Association of the Latino elected and appointed officials the education fund program the conference that they were having but I couldn't attend but I was really grateful for that

[01:03:00]
leaving that scholarship and then I would really love to purchase I think it was through the National School Board Association they did have a educational law and policy book that I think we could all use sometimes but that was one thing I really wanted to delve in more into when it comes to more policy and legislation and if there's any way that there is a really good conference for that I would love to attend and I could still look that up too but I also have been on the same side as you know who Sophia with Nia and but I've been going to those conferences before I was on the board every year so I I pretty much know what's going on there but there are those up-to-date educational and thank you for the dialogue

[01:04:00]
great thank you remember top of your mirror thank you I also meet all the requirements that's required for our annual training I specifically have attended some of the finance trainings that ped has offered and those have been an enjoyable I say that in quotes a couple of days worth of training as I go with the finance team but additionally I have been interested the same as board member Jackson into genomics I think that would be a really good training I'm taking some classes in that Pryor but I think to actually receive the certification would be beneficial as well and I would also recommend to board member Jackson as the representative to this upcoming meeting if it's possible to give feedback of some of the content that they do provided animus VA meetings to make them more relevant and current and to provide new content to us that it's not the same training that we've gotten in

[01:05:00]
after year because I want to make good use of my time and many times I feel like it's just a repeat with the same slides and same speakers and I would like to receive some new training that helps us in our current role but I'm always interested moving forward in anything that is related to finance and how we could be even more aligned with our budget in relation to our goals so that's where I'm at 3 thank you remember this thank you so much Madam president I am personally glad that the law changed and now requires board members in their first year to take 10 credit hours of mandatory training because we are you know public education board members and it stands to reason that we do care about education of students in ourselves it's important more education the better and I am looking forward to the conference next week because it's going to be provided there and if you looked at the

[01:06:00]
they make it very clear which training sessions apply to the requirements that we have and I think that that's very helpful and thank you if you all are listening thank you for doing that to that end I have one hour of legal Concepts training that I need to do but I'm looking forward to attending the entire conference and as time allows moving forward I look forward to attending anything that's going to enrich my service on the board and make me a more informed and all around better board member so that's all thank you so I looked and I don't know if I for next week period which I thought would be beneficial to my own personal growth into my board service identified sort of too big topics

[01:07:00]
neither which fits underneath the nmsba bucket and so I will complete the nmsba required hours but also interested in student voice broadly and specifically student voice is it relates to governance and school boards and so have been doing my own research and working with our intern around that to figure out or to learn more about how students are represented on boards School boards State School boards and local school boards across the country and what are some models that we might be able to adopt or learn from our Implement here so I'm interested in continuing that learning and potentially maybe attending a conference or webinar or something related to fostering more authentic student voice in decision-making I think we're beginning to do a better job of just hearing students but actually making it really authentic and meaningful and ensuring that decisions consider their perspectives so that's definitely a topic I'm interested in the other is just on building culture building a culture of trust with

[01:08:00]
in the board we've talked a lot about how we communicate with each other how information is shared and so I think potentially looking into just webinars topic is conference conversation around that issue of building trust within a group so with that I'm going to try to list out the topics conferences issues that I heard and I heard a couple of side conversations around like oh I'd like to do that one too so I'll try to include that but also if you could just signal so certainly tribal consultation was won the National School Board Association conference nmsba is another also the law and policy book that they provide national Indian Education Association international schools Network American Enterprise Institute along with their book study the Council of great great City schools that organization overall their conference in their coaches the Georgetown certificate in education finance a couple of members interested

[01:09:00]
I got to do that alongside the finance team so it's cool to have a certificate from Georgetown I need to frame it or something but I highly recommend recommend that one and I do know that they provide discounts for multiple members from the same district so that's good interest in a national special education conference and mention of the PED Finance trainings was there anything I didn't write nmsba because I kind of figured that was obvious but I'll just write that now and I must be a continue with that so with that list are there things that folks want to double click on talk more about express interest in Explorer or more General topics and while we are opening the floor to that I just wanted to level seven on our budget Dr Albright so you can get that information get it ready to share if you don't already have it but you look like you might if you don't that's cool or for PD for

[01:10:00]
thank you for the board each board member has 4000 all right cool thank you so the floor is open to discussion not a president we have 4,000 starting when July okay so have have any has that that some of that has already been used right like with that has already been yes okay okay thank you and I would be glad to tell you specifics if you want to ask me not in the board meeting probably yeah I'd be interested to know how much I have left but thank you Google so we each have 4,000 for PD but my understanding is that n

[01:11:00]
SBA is a separate bucket and is covered that is correct it is there something else that is separate and covered know so student outcomes are the coaches is that a separate budget and covered student outcome coaching is covered through student not come through the contract that we have with them but we don't get hours professional development hours for it correct that's not professional development out thank you other discussion great so it sounds like we have some mutual interest maybe in National School boards Association so we'll share out that agenda and timing and cost and also potentially look into their print resources to see if there's something that we purchased for behalf of the board

[01:12:00]
and the Georgetown education Finance certificate they offer I know multiple cohorts over the course of the year I think it starts with one in person Gathering and then the rest is remote but that's another thing where we can dig into and then Dr Albright will share out with each member what is remaining of their professional development budget other questions comments or takeaways yes member Jackson the one thing that I've actually participated in but I really thought it was was beneficial that we haven't discussed was and I actually got an email about it so I wonder if others of us did and the Council of great City schools has their cohorts their governance cohort that comes out and they are opening it up for January and so I mean I've participated board member Domingo has participated so I just want to kind of throw that out as an option

[01:13:00]
like if you want to immerse yourself in student outcomes Focus governance kind of outside of what we're doing with our work it's it's it's it's it's it's a pretty good cohort and and it gives you the opportunity to have discussions with with other board members in other other districts so that you can learn I mean not only learn what they're doing but actually learned what we're doing is we're doing pretty good so I just wanted to throw that out there as an option sorry the governor's overall don't count but there is a way through my nmsba to essentially petition for two hours to count and so we could do that because there was a category for Effective governance and practice so if anyone were to do that hopefully you could submit to have at least two hours of that count remember to get yes and and it was it was a full year so

[01:14:00]
you need to know that unless they have changed it but I don't think so it's a full year January through December and did we meet once a week I think everyone once every 2 weeks and then in October there there was a 3-day Workshop it was in San Diego a year ago I don't know where they continue with that but it's it's a hefty amount of time commitment but it's useful it's helpful thing it also gives you access to other coaches like coaches that are kind of outside of what we have and so it kind of gives you an opportunity to hear different feedback from different coaches so

[01:15:00]
Pizza folks might want to look into the Council of great City Schools student outcomes focused governance option and remember Jackson can you just forward that email to board Services just so that maybe we can put it in the auto glass this week remember to marijuana I just said question on the those particular classes are those paid for separately through the contracts or how is that also done it is a separate it's different from the contract I don't know if there's a cost okay okay 3,000 per person president and we will provide more information on that all right so I wanted to see then if folks feel that this

[01:16:00]
PlayStation scratches the itch fulfills the need around having a professional development plan having some clarity around what folks are going to do does anyone think we ought to consolidate write down share do more research just generally feeling about our shared commitment to professional development and if there's anything more needed I feel good good good good good we feel good all right so with that then we will move on to the next item on our agenda which is the president's report so I also just I just wanted to say in response to public forum comments tonight that although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that they were hurt and that we are committed to working with the administration to find resolutions in particular tonight some

[01:17:00]
issues that we heard were related to the boundary changes for Taft and Taylor Middle School and potential implications on other North Valley Schools we heard about concerns for lgbtq students and protections and make sure that those continue to stay and also some concern about some bullying in schools so I know the administration will work on these issues and if there is anything else that needs to be reported back to the board it will be with that our upcoming meetings our next meeting is on December 18th so that's going to start again with a finance committee meeting which will be in person beginning at 5 p.m. followed Again by a regular board meeting here in that regular board meeting we will have the first of the Strategic initiatives presentations so this first one will focus on special education so we're looking forward to learn about that that meeting agenda will also include the agenda item related to The New International High School and other boundary changes

[01:18:00]
also the reason I think has already been stated that we postponed what would have been tonight's vote for Alvarado and move that to December 18th is exactly to take feedback from the community and integrate it into the plan so that will continue to happen over the course of the next couple of weeks I know doctor Blakey did have some meetings today as did I with many members of the community and there are many more meetings scheduled and ongoing over the course of the next couple of weeks and so all that feedback will continue to be gathered and implemented to change potential changes to the right size and plan which will be presented to us for consideration for that December 18th meeting on Friday December 20th will participate in a retreat with our student outcomes focused governance coach to align resources and also to review a first draft of potential changes to the governance manual that's also a reminder that each board member has a survey to complete before this Friday to

[01:19:00]
identify areas where you'd like to see changes to the governance manual after the winter break you can't believe it's already the end of the year so that's the end of our meetings for this calendar year which is crazy but after the winter break we will come back with a policy committee meeting on January 6th and a special Board of Education meeting on January 8th during the January 8th meeting we will elect officers and committee chairs and review our time use for the past quarter January 15th which will be the next meeting after that will be a regular board meeting that will include goal monitor progress monitoring for goal for which is skill habits and mindsets for Life currently the plan is that member Jackson will facilitate that one we will also have on January 15th are quarter for sohg board self-evaluation we will also review our board guardrails and additional revisions to the board operating procedures as well as consider the opening open meetings act resolution for

[01:20:00]
play the next year which should include board in committee meeting schedules just want to end with a reminder that tomorrow we're hosting a legislative open house at NextGen Academy I am looking forward to the conversations board members please reach out to any legislators in your area to remind them and encourage them to attend and that concludes the president's report the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday December 18th at 5 p.m. here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard the special education Special Education meeting will be Wednesday January 8th at 5:00 p.m. here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard as well and
