[00:15:00]
Board of Education governance manual board members can ask that an item be removed from the consent agenda before the meeting agenda is posted but not during the meeting is there a motion to approve the agenda and move to adopt the October 23rd 2024 special Board of Education meeting agenda this is member Jackson's This is member Romero and I second it thank you we have a motion in a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes our next item is to consider approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on October 2nd 2024 I move for approval of the minutes for the Board of Education meeting on October 2nd 2024 and I have a second thank you we have a motion in a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please

[00:16:00]
public forum however we have not had anyone sign up for public forum tonight so we will proceed on to the next agenda item 5.1 which is student outcomes focused governments so the next item is to consider acceptance of progress monitoring reports for gold to interim goal 2.1 and 2.2 which are math proficiency the facilitator for this discussion will be member Dominguez and our presenters are Dr Blakey superintendent doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent for leadership and learning and Sherry Jett are chief academic officer as well as Mr Mark Garcia I will turn it over to member Domingos for the facilitation thank you tonight we will be monitoring and inter

[00:17:00]
2.1 2.2 measuring early literacy proficiency before we hear our presentation we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete on Tuesday and Wednesday October 8th and 9th I met with Dr Blakey Dr Gonzalez Chief of Staff Johanna king and the Council of great City Schools coach Chandra Hansen we reviewed the draft monitoring report and had a productive conversation thank you for all your time and thoughtful revisions Dr blakey's and Gonzalez's efforts of well appreciated thank you to coach Sandra Hansen for elucidating elucidate

[00:18:00]
I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report have been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who can provide evidence that suggests otherwise and since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will turn the floor to the superintendent for the presentation good evening Madam president members of the board tonight we are discussing gold too and interim goals 2.1 and 2.2 which aim to enhance mathematical proficiency among middle school students in Albuquerque Public Schools particularly focusing on historically underserved student groups including Native American African-American English Learners economically disadvantaged students and those with disabilities Proficiency in math by 8th grade is critical as it lays the groundwork for success and high school algebra which is a key indicator of academic achievement and graduation rates

[00:19:00]
will our interim goals and goals are on track we have seen improvements in math proficiency on the state assessment for students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students over the past three years but challenges remain for Native American African-American and English Learners students the monitoring report for interim goal 2.1 shows that over the past three years are sixth grade math proficiency has improved for Native American students students with disabilities and those experiencing economic disadvantage well it has declined for English Learners and African-American students interim go to 2.2 shows that 7th grade math proficiency has improved for Native American students students with disabilities English Learners and those experiencing economic disadvantage will it has decreased for African-American students we look forward to this go to discussion this evening which will allow

[00:20:00]
address to delve into the data Behind These Trends Explorer effective strategies to support struggling groups and emphasize the importance of best practices to ensure all of our students have the resources that they need and with that I turn it over to Dr Gonzalez and his team Madame President members of the board superintendent Blakey before you you will find the progress monitoring reports for go to interim goal 2.1 and then I'm going to having to do with math proficiency we look forward to your questions this evening thank you and so I will start at the far right with them again thank you for all the work that you have done my question is on the last page for go to give us some Focus areas at the team is working on developing in connection to those practices are there any strategies or models that you have in place to ensure

[00:21:00]
cultural representation in math studies since we do see a decline in Proficiency in our 8th grade students of color from 2023 to 2024 by the president of the board superintendent Blakey thank you for your question I see a couple of areas of intersection one of the areas of intersection is the work that is currently unfolding as we speak with the analysis of skills habits in mindsets the fall survey that's going on that will give us valuable data that did not exist before that will provide us a basis to have conversations in general for students that really we strive to find a sense of belonging on authentic space for our students to engage in all subject areas specifically mathematics in this case that is a basis for us to drill down and for us to be able to

[00:22:00]
inform ourselves as practitioners in a deeper way on how we are able to meet The Language and Cultural Nuance of the diverse student body in the Albuquerque Public Schools students need to be able to feel a sense of perseverance for sure to be able to engage in an authentic way especially as the standards in mathematics grow more and more sophisticated they need to be able to be comfortable and sure of themselves as they engage in the content area in which we work there are other components that I think are worth mentioning one of which is the diversity that is found within the units of study that we are now really continue to be in the infancy of one of the things that's really important to us is that we not only focused these units of study on the standards but also provide

[00:23:00]
sources of strategies best practices for our practitioners in this case are Math teachers to be able to see how they are able to differentiate a technical content area mathematics in a way that is able to meet the diversity of their student body from a linguistic and cultural point of view can the students see themselves in the content is something that would be important as we focus in on continued professional development of our principles the instructional leaders of our schools but also our teachers so a couple of thoughts to kind of get at your question now I appreciate that I know that we had some conversations when it comes to like early literacy and those aspects and making sure that there's representation and involved in curriculum and I think it's as important for things like math and science so I appreciate that you're looking into that thank you I have one more question I don't know if you want me to wait

[00:24:00]
why don't you go ahead my next question I'm according to the information provided in the report specifically on the subgroup breakdown graphs for 2.1 and 2.2 almost all students are at their target proficiency for 6th and 7th grade math I'm wondering if there are any preparation practices that are happening at the 5th or 6th grade level that may have contributed to the learning outcomes in sixth and seventh grade and if so is there a strategy or plan to replicate that preparation for the other grade levels good evening word president Gonzales board members superintendent Dr Blakey thank you for that question remember historica you know as we have rolled out our mouths programming you may or may not be aware that we used to different materials in elementary that lead into middle school and so indeed as a result of that what are teachers

[00:25:00]
the Elementary in the Middle School level realize fairly quickly was that we need to have some vertical articulation by that I mean the 5th and 6th grade teachers coming together in order to say okay how is the learning taking place in fifth grade because it might look different and we want to prepare students for success as they go into Middle School where again as they enter the secondary World in particular it might look different so I would say that's the primary model that we use across our elementary to Middle School it's an area we can strengthen and we do look to be able to replicate that as we move forward thank you I'm going to switch over to the side to board member Jackson thank you so much question is

[00:26:00]
this is last year at this time this school was off track but this year it's on track so specifically to what do you attribute these positive changes maybe 3 to 4 things that you attribute the positive changes to and as they are positive changes how can the board continue to assist you in those efforts to maintain those positive changes of the board Dr Blakey you're absolutely right this school was off track a year ago and in anticipation of this conversation we went back and looked at the progress monitoring documents to really inform ourselves as to what is going on over the last year and a couple of things to take note of one is the progress monitoring and the process

[00:27:00]
grown more sophisticated the meat on the bones is much more substantial the Strategic plan is much more robust so that was one thing that we kind of sat back in a little bit of you to see how we were we were like wow look how far we've come because if you look at the progress monitoring document from a year ago that I would say is the Strategic next steps in regards to this specifically with a few things at that time when was the rollout and implementation of the wall to wall K through 12 instructions first time in a long time that our school district has had common materials for every classroom regardless of the area of town for our students to be

[00:28:00]
go to access but it didn't stop there because materials are materials but nothing will ever take the place of high-quality teacher offering high quality instruction based on those insurance so we rolled out the work that is outline for us in guardrail 3 and we went around and we looked and we saw we informed ourselves in terms of what's going on with our classrooms throughout the district to see how we're doing with the roll out of materials with the teaching to grade level standards we learned a lot we informed ourselves this year as you know we rolled out a performance framework that even made that work more sophisticated and targeted our attention very strategically and intentionally to be able to say how can we have the most return on our investment of time our coaching or support and really looking at it from a very strategic point of view

[00:29:00]
another thing that we saw was the units of study how do we offer a road map if you will based on grade level standards based on standards we know that high quality construction materials will be here for a shelf life of 67 years whatever that may be and then they're going to come and go but we don't want to do is give the organization Whiplash so we're building units of study based on the standards so we take out this material when we adopt again insert the new one and teachers continue flying into practice so those are some things that come to mind if you compare the strategy Now versus the strategy then we see that we have put me on Bones so to speak and we have grown much more sophisticated in how this goal is complemented by a strategic plan and that works too I mean the credit to our chief academic officer associate superintendent books and teaching and learning

[00:30:00]
has really given us a lot of Promise as to the next steps yes thank you thank you for that question period I think we're pretty proud of I don't know if you had an opportunity to watch the video that we produced about Grant Middle School and that was a really nice example of how we were able to use our district professional development team in the mouth Department too inform fairly simple practices that have a high impact on student learning and in that video we see the social aspects of learning that are really critical particularly for our English language Learners we saw students being engaged wanting to be in the room doing more of the work versus the teacher doing all of the work and so that was just one example of a professional development that came out of the teaching and learning Department that we know how

[00:31:00]
impact and so the ongoing opportunity for teachers to learn not just their content better which I think you know is so kind of an area that we're always looking at as we deal with our high quality instructional materials how am I teaching this how am I going to approach this so that it's understandable but also those engagement strategies that are just really powerful to building classroom success thank you I just want to add the appreciation I have for our team specifically go one team and when we developed our strategic priorities it's a K12 Pre-K pre-k through 12th grade Focus areas so when you think about accelerated learning or teaching up that the grade level standard is the bar but we're going to teach up so that every student has access to grade level standards and that we do just in time teaching so that we can differentiate for those students that might have gaps but the bar is grade level standards

[00:32:00]
another thing is there one instruction and again the differentiation but when we think about differentiation thinking about multimodal learning thinking about bringing in kinesthetic learning thinking about bringing in visual examples and I think specifically for math I think you heard the one student in the math video talk about how his instructor was able to bring visuals and I think math the way all of us myself included maybe some of you when you learned and when I learned math it was very much repetition and sitting in rows and you learned equations and you learned how to do the problems but conceptually could you explain to someone else what the really what the concepts you were doing and how is it related to world world application so in that video you see vertical whiteboards where students are actually up

[00:33:00]
physically standing moving talking with their peers they're explaining to one another what they're learning so that builds on conceptual knowledge and we look at 8th grade math proficiency and what students are tested on on the Masa they have to demonstrate both on multiple choice problems but then they also have to in expression explain how to solve problems so it's as in sixth grade it's the foundations of algebraic thinking geometry and statistics in 7th grade up to 8th grade I think the reason I'm so passionate about 8th grade proficiency and also having the privilege to leave College and Career Readiness when we think about the bills that are students when they enter the workforce or college they're very technical fields and they're going to need math skills to be successful in many

[00:34:00]
this concept of preparing our students to be proficient in 8th grade it's just it it opens up a world of opportunity for our students so the last thing I just want to say is data literacy and when we look at the intersectionality of our data and specifically multiple measures but when we look at our efforts we can't do them like in one way meaning that we have to take into account not just the students academic proficiency but also their attendance and behavior and also agency belonging and connectedness so if students aren't feeling that they belong to the community or an adult sees them or they know someone on campus that cares about them they might end up missing school so it's not one single approach but it's taking the best leverageable res

[00:35:00]
use based approaches and applying them consistently over time and that's what I'm really optimistic about with this plan that we have here remember Jackson if I want to make sure we answer the second part of your question in terms of how the board can best support us I think you hear a lot of passion from using you'll continue to hear it grow because as we go through this progress monitoring process we are learning so much and about curriculum and like you know how to how to support these best practices in schools really digging into how can we replicate the work and so I don't think you're going to stop pushing us to do this but I do want you to know like the the push from the board is making a difference in terms of how we're approaching the work I think the second thing I would add just in terms of your advocacy for the work is Mr Garcia did a really nice job of

[00:36:00]
I got a survey to have middle schools look pretty in depth at their achievement data around this area and we collected responses from them and we asked the same question of the schools how can we support you over and over collaboration time came up we need the time for the teachers to work together in order to support best practices like we always know we're better if we have a partner just that that element of time in order to plan those really excellent lessons and we know again I'm going to reference the grant video their win model right they've been able to set up a structure where they can do some of that collaborative work and it is really making a difference so as we seek to replicate if you could just keep that in mind as you use your influence to improve educational outcomes thank you thank you I you you almost made me want to go back to

[00:37:00]
because you've dated me as one of those people who did learn math sitting in Rose so I I really appreciate the the robust and in-depth answer coupled with the enthusiasm because well I won't add my my personal I really appreciate your your response thank you thank you I'm going to my room and board member told you I appreciate you taking the time especially when you talk about math and a visual concept as having a son with disabilities he taught himself trigonometry by visually seeing the pictures because music cuz he was a gifted cellist he could see the pictures of the notes and then the series of notes so then he related that to math

[00:38:00]
and then he started to teach himself the visual perception of how trigonometry Works which led to his coding and all of those things so that pretty significant place in the brain can be opened up for many children so that brings my question to when we're looking at these two groups that you significantly saw increases in with children with disabilities and the economically disadvantaged children seeing this year increase could you just give me a little bit of what you did differently for the children with disabilities so I can just understand how that follow through work so Madame President a couple of things in regards to approach to this school in relationship to our students with disabilities support support around differentiation for our teachers and really

[00:39:00]
it's it's a word that's used very frequently and perhaps it's lost lost its emphasis over time when we talked about differentiation but the reality is supporting our teachers and supporting our instructional Leaders with the strategies to be able to differentiate a technical subject like mathematics for our students we know that and this is all in the Strategic plan and I want to emphasize that again because I think it's worth mentioning that it's just it's much deeper than what you see in this progress monitoring document there's a whole thing of a ladder that just leads to this place with several initiatives and several objectives for us to really achieve so when we talked about differentiation we talked about the Hands-On piece how do we help our students in elementary moving into Middle School to be able to access the curriculum mathematics

[00:40:00]
a tactile way so that they are able to interface and interact with the curriculum to be able to conceptualize the content in a more comprehensive way we think about the multimodal piece which is alluded to and really outlined in some detail within the progress monitoring piece but we also think about concrete opportunities for our principles and some of them may be Math teachers most of them probably aren't how do we help them from a coaching from a critical friend from a critical point of view go into math question

[00:41:00]
and how do we have our special education department work with our principles to make that intersection with differentiation but also looking and doing a deep dive into I don't know a sample of ips on campus and how can we work to inform ourselves in terms of what are the what are we seeing what are the yellow eligibilities within our campus and how can we use the data because it's there and how do we deep deep deep deep deep deep deep deep to access the rich amount of data we have to truly inform our practice we had a principals meeting this morning and the superintendent addressed the principles and one of the things that she said in her introductory comments was the answers are in this world and I really believe that we have some passionate

[00:42:00]
leaders passionate teachers in this district and our existence in supporting them through coaching our existence and supporting our teachers through sport training and professional development is some of the ways in which we hope to build on the momentum because we know there's still a lot of work to be done in a long road ahead of us thank you I just want to know the understanding of the current on page of five where you have can you define those for me board member don't worry I believe I can work Christmas okay I was just

[00:43:00]
asking for definition cuz I didn't understand I'm good evening with the access assessment so what it means that they're exited that means that they've hit the criteria to exit the program so they no longer receive English Learners services so those those students who have eggs at the current or the ones that were receiving Services During the period of the test so that you're in the program and then they never been in the program so they when they registered and they indicated that they spoke another language other than English as a primary language at home and administer the test they scored in a way that they never needed services and then just seeing as we do put that in all of our reports and that's part of our way of being proactive about showing those students thank you

[00:44:00]
thank you for entertaining that and board member benavidez in Europe so my question is timely because of our budget Community conversation we're going to have tomorrow and Monday but I'm going to start with the question that's in the package that was provided the questions that we gave to you all earlier and then for context and then ask my question but the question was were additional resources are finding allocated to schools with higher concentrations of students from the marketing decision and how were these resources utilize and the answer was yes additional resources and funding were allocated to schools with higher concentrations and it broke down by targeted interventions social emotional support professional development and additional Staffing and so my question is does a strategy exist to further customize the allocation of resources to schools with a higher concentration of Martinez Yazzie students to ensure the

[00:45:00]
if so does that strategy include contingencies in the event of a budget reductions a couple of things come to mine and I do know that I feel confident that we have the beginning of an answer would you saw in the response but I also feel even more confident in what the answer will be 6 months from now period

[00:46:00]
critically to see is what we're doing yielding benefit for our students if it is why if it isn't why not and then being bold enough to strategically abandoned things that perhaps haven't been working but we've held on to because it's hard to let go by doing this which is a very bold Endeavor and it is the very essence of changing adult Behavior we fully anticipate the evolution of priorities does the evolution of some federal and state moneys that may be loosened up or perhaps to be able to be made available to support the school or goals pickles that work is ongoing we are truly making

[00:47:00]
age of the last several weeks we have had departments come in to I don't know budget hearing type meetings where we engage across the table and have some you know tough questions around what are you using for show me that it is yielding a return on our investment drilling down in a respectful way people are working really hard we know but the reality is we have limited finite resources and we need to make the most of them and we also recognize that we are in a declining enrollment State and including enrollment District so those are some of the ways that come to my mind in regards to your question

[00:48:00]
what president a board member benefits board members superintendent Mikey another thing that we are really looking at is a long-term plan so not just looking at the short run but also thinking strategically and purposeful and looking at a 5-year plan and you seen some of the data that we've gathered some of the data from the state on projections to be able to address this like I said not in the room but also in the future any other questions thank you

[00:49:00]
thank you remember Dominguez so I had a very smart question that was strategic measure focused ask oriented results focused on time bound but it's already been asked so I'm going to adjust it slightly so what specific strategies and interventions may have contributed specifically to schools habits in mind that social emotional learning and you spoke to positive learning environment so what specific strategies and interventions in that area specifically do you think of contributed to the gains of 1.7% in math from May 23rd to 24 thank you for that question as I love to talk about skills habits in mindsets I you know I think part of the the games that could be attributed to that have to do with us elevating skills habits and mindsets and you may remember with me rolled out

[00:50:00]
what's Initiative for Gulf War last year we you know we did a lot of work around awareness around the vocabulary around what this would look like in the classroom but we also linked it directly to self-efficacy and the idea of efficacy that when you master something and when you're experiencing success in your learning in your teaching in your profession feels good we want more of that and we definitely saw our principles working with teachers in the school to to elevate this concept of Mastery and being able to stick with something else so obviously talked about perseverance but the ultimate goal was to help kids understand why when I'm really able to do it I feel good about myself and I like how that feels and I want more of it and and teachers when their students are learning they want more of that too right so it's a win-win that

[00:51:00]
I would say definitely just contributed to the overall growth mindset in our schools think this year we're excited to see the data as it rolls out because not only have we moved beyond that sort of awareness phase we've moved much deeper into specific lessons specific strategies in order for teachers and principals and the rest of our school staff to drive goal for forward Mr Garcia I don't know if you want to add anything I do specifically what we think about resilience and math and in your packet you saw 8:00 components of the National Council of mathematics teachers and one of those is resilience in mathematics so really teaching students and supporting them through the lens of resiliency and in math and in our units of study there are some

[00:52:00]
for strategies embedded in it so that teachers can use that lens when they're teaching students in math to work through the struggle the academic struggle and that academic resilience and then also the concept of celebrating when students do accomplish their goals and also as schools see their growth that we celebrate schools as well so I think that's a couple of examples specifically how it has been a line to go for and I think innately the more that we work with the principals and the teachers to make sure that they're teaching on grade level then you're teaching perseverance through the act of teaching on grade level so when we feel like will the kids aren't quite there yet so we're going to teach this grade level and then move them up then we're taking away the ability to

[00:53:00]
push them through learning perseverance particularly in math because for a lot of people math is difficult and because of the academic struggle but it's not difficult once you are able to learn perseverance through the academic struggle of math so I think by increasing our instruction in the classroom that is teaching on grade level of the standards in math then we are teaching perseverance by if kids are struggling you don't have to put hold back but go ahead and push them forward and explain to the kids love the work that we're doing is using the language to to explain to the kids it's hard you're going to persevere and this is how you're going to do it because then they start to learn the academic vocabulary behind what those words mean as well thank you I appreciate that and I think especially the degree of specifics that you have there

[00:54:00]
because often times we do hear things in a very conceptual level but it's really important I think that you've demonstrated that not only is the linkage between skills habits and mindsets and Mathematics instruction meaningful but it's also measurable and it's malleable and that's really cool to be able to show that so I appreciate that I have a second question so I was looking in the supplemental materials that you provided at the grade 8650 Explorer which has it broken down by race in the city for school year so looking specifically at the data for Native American students for math in 2122 there at 10% 10.7 per cent proficient for 22/23 there at 9:00 7% proficient and for 2324 they're eight percent proficiency and so as much as I want to celebrate the progress that I'm hearing tonight the notion that the Native Americans 8

[00:55:00]
play students in math are in single-digit proficiency is heartbreaking alarming tragic and so my question is considering this and the decline with the student population in particular is there a strategy that you have deployed that did not that you know did not work and where there are other Lessons Learned in terms of how you might adopt a president members of the board on Dr Lakey the first thing that comes to mind is the body materials materials that were not coherent we're not aligned we're not outdated

[00:56:00]
so I think that's the first thing to come to mind I mean if you're going to build something you need the tools to build it well and I think that is what I hear your question and when we agree and rally behind your sentiment that is the first thing that comes to mind is until last year we did not provide in a comprehensive updated way the materials the tools for our teachers to be able to execute I think the other thing that comes to mind is we had an outdated road map in terms of open sequence call it a unit of study I saw that it's somewhere over there I'm kind of a thing but to really in the magic that we've seen with these units of study is I want to make the point

[00:57:00]
teachers were coming in all summer long day after day after day to build these and it went all the way through September to really hit that Mark so I think those are two examples of where we came up short I can think of another one if I may and specific to our Native American student population of services alignment of programming alignment of approach and support from this building to our schools I think one of the things that we recognize and are really quite frankly on a day-to-day basis right now working on is how do we build a system of support for our practitioners to be able to be able to in a

[00:58:00]
culturally and linguistically sensitive manner engage with our Native American student population we have a couple of things going on we have some schools that have a sizable Native American student population and they receive perhaps a resource teacher or Navajo classes in class but whereas there be another school that maybe not have a large American student population doesn't get that service what are we doing as the district to be able to centralize or strategically support access to Services access to language revitalization access to awareness of high feast days and cultural customs and the Nuance of the diverse Native American culture that we have in Albuquerque New Mexico

[00:59:00]
are some things that I think that it's also important to note that all of the you know the data that you're looking at is the culmination of finishing go to over last year so it's the it's from the spring so a lot of the work that the team is talking about in the strategies haven't been able to really be measured yet so they're in there because of these data points that we saw in November you're going to see a presentation on the massive scores in general and will have the subgroups as well so you'll see that there's definitely areas where we're falling extremely short and the strategies then that we have to do to be able to make up for that because this is the culmination of last year's data and a lot of the work that they were talking about were things that have happened since then moving forward with the expectation that now looking at

[01:00:00]
data we expect to see the needle move on particularly those areas of students with disabilities African-Americans Native Americans that are in the single digits yeah that makes sense would speak to the decline over this period of time and perhaps an implementation to associated with the more rigorous content but again the single digits of Highly concerning and so I guess the follow-up question is to what extent is the topic specifically around math proficiency the data the single digits etcetera addressed explored shared discussed during intergovernmental meetings tribal consultation Indian parents and procedures meeting all of the structures and systems that exists to engage directly with Native American population thank you for that question president Gonzalez

[01:01:00]
think that is an area where we could do better as our data is coming in and we're getting a better understanding and a lot of it due to this process of really looking at our student populations and what is happening that's exactly the next step I do think to sort of to your former question but then a part of this is also and and I don't I'm not wanting to to blame anyone or say we did anything wrong I think we did exactly what we thought we were supposed to do in remediating a lot of pandemic and we have a focus now on as Dr Blakey mentioned grade level standards that's such a critical part of where are strategic plan is taking us and I think that is another opportunity for us to engage in those conversations and tribal consultation with our our parent groups about how do we design

[01:02:00]
create represent our native youth in these lessons in this work as we continue to push them how can the community help us to push students forward so as we sort of shift gears here I think that is a place where I would love to continue the conversation so as we look forward to meeting the overall goals like what specifically has been done more about partnering with families to ensure that we have their understanding and commitment to reach the school

[01:03:00]
do you like it when we're all just like this I'm going to do it thank you for the question board member Tapia Romero we are constantly striving for higher family engagement in all of our academic as well as social emotional work in the schools we you know I'm going to give you sort of a traditional answer knowing that it's something we can build on we have the traditional curriculum nights we can think about you know when I was an assistant principal at Thanksgiving we had math night and we played turkey Bingo and we gave away you know like you did math problems and you could win a turkey right and it's very well attended because people want turkeys so I mean I think those are the some of the family engagement things as schools are regularly leaning into one thing I would really like to grow though is

[01:04:00]
Morris getting more specific about the skills that can be supported by the family for example you've heard me talk about my 5th grader she has to know her multiplication tables right and this is just one of those things like it's it's pretty much drill it's practicing it but she gets that from me because of who I am right and so how do we make sure that every student has that opportunity you know whether it's they make your own flash cards and we send them home but even as we get up into higher math thinking about how do we have opportunities for students and families can do something like a spreadsheet together right this is a very relevant math skill that actually brings a lot of algorithms into one place so I think these are conversations that we're having with the math professional development team like what are those more real life applic

[01:05:00]
Asians and how do we bring community and family in particularly as representatives of the math field in the real world Dr Blakey to add to miss response from a systemic point of view I would say that we have paper which is available to our families and it is an online platform for parents to students to gain tutoring support parents to support their children it's out there it's still out there I think the other thing that I would mention from assistance point of view is we have a lot to learn from the work around Community Schools in the Albuquerque Public Schools I mean we had Hawaii and Alaska visiting the district this week to see what we're doing in this very area yes we have 60 of our schools approximately 60 of our schools that are Community Schools the rest are you may ask what about those schools but what I

[01:06:00]
say is we are learning we are able to cross pollinate to all of our schools so there's a lot there in terms of a framework to not only engage our partners in our communities in the wraparound services but best practices for building on these math nights building on these open houses building on these traditional things that we do in school when we know every fall there's going to be an open meet the teacher we know we but how do we modernize the way we do this work I think one of the areas that were really looking at very strategically you may have heard that we have a community input in regards to our calendar for the next couple years one of the topics in there is parent conferences are parent conferences today the same thing that they were 10 years ago are they the same thing they were 20 years ago are we still hitting the mark in the way we interact with our parents what are the number of parents coming to the

[01:07:00]
I think we've taken a step ahead perhaps by accident based on the pandemic with virtual parent conferences I think that's taken the number up a little bit in terms of that connection piece but how do we task force this work to look critically at how do we best engage with our parents in relationship to student outcomes and is the traditional space or activity that we know as parent conference is still that space or can we modernize it or shift or tweak that little bit to see if we're meeting the needs of parents in support of their students thank you and and that's helpful and I'm happy to see that we're making like the shifts to not do what we've always done because obviously our goals are completely new and they're nothing like we've ever done before you know I just as we move forward I would like to hear more specifics about

[01:08:00]
what those activities truly are and to ensure that we're making sure that we were Bridging the Gap not just between teacher and student but also embracing the family with that thank you and thank you for the question I wrote it down because I think it's an area where struggling in I think there's pockets of success that specific schools we have things like you know the homework Diner the Explorer of family nights and things that bring the families into how they can learn these Concepts to help with the students but why I wrote it down as because I do want to ask as one of my advisory councils I have a family counseling in the next couple of weeks and I think that's a really good question to ask them as far as what is helpful information for them to get to help their students and what information are they getting currently from their schools and so I look forward to having the conversation with the family

[01:09:00]
learn more about how we can strengthen that because I know it's a the parent involvement in the academic piece I think is a area we're struggling in thank you how are you using internal resources departments to weave Multicultural programs into the

[01:10:00]
strategy for family nights and I'm adding the family nights only because that is the topic especially for groups who have seen a decline better president members of the board Dr Blakey I'm going to start with how we are capitalizing on the Departments here at the district to facilitate culturally and linguistic support to schools and then maybe weave in the family night nuanced if that's okay with you I'm thinking of four specific departments that really work

[01:11:00]
what is o a r r data Department I think we have a great data Department we're fortunate in this District to have that and learn from and utilizing capitalized from the data needs to drive our work and I think in some ways we learned very recently that although we have Smart passionate people who are well-read know the research sometimes we get ahead of ourselves in building the strategy before we're looking at the data so how does the data speak to us and how do we build a strategy based on what the date is saying so I think really looking and capitalizing upon what are Oar department is to us then using departments like our teaching and learning Department are Indian education department our Language and Cultural Equity Department to be able to work as collaborators to

[01:12:00]
Port schools into support the design of the strategy based on what the data is saying I think it's very important to highlight this because we've been over the last year and a half really keeping the thing the thing and looking at these goals and really strategizing and how we can take the next step in meeting the annual Target and eventually the bull itself and we have grown much more we have grown but we need to grow much more reliant on what the date is telling us as we build that strategy and has it informs our plan now in relationship to family nights is how do we help our families perhaps use and track their student data in a way that is able to have the parrot be an agent of support for their student how do we better equip

[01:13:00]
and support our parents to understand how to access apparently parent view to be able to access grades to on track with their children this is where you're going this is what I'm seeing how can we help schools design these parent nights so that we are able to capitalize on the best of what our departments have to offer in terms of a linguistic and cultural for our students through the lens of the students in an effort to make the question about the specific data within the report can you speak specifically to the question on multiculturalism engagement with families and strategies

[01:14:00]
address to address the decline thank you for that kind of just want to get credit thank you for the follow up I do believe I think this is somewhat related to the question that President Gonzalez asked about how are we having conversations about the data that we see and that is something that I look forward to doing more of with our families you know thinking about how how do we take out the education ease make it very accessible in the conversation and that were able to support in a way that is very sensitive to the student Lifestyle the things that the family has their culture their values these are all very critical elements in terms of building our partnership with families and creating our sensible longing for students and Families

[01:15:00]
schools I do have some ideas for example and this is an elementary so I don't want to have you not get points cuz I know this is a middle school goal but for our middle school or Elementary parent teacher conferences we created basically family-friendly this is welcome to third grade this is what your child is going to learn and Ela and math and some skills in mindsets as well here are some ways you can support it and so when the family came into parent teacher conferences the teachers were able to use this tool to put it in front of the families in a very family friendly way and say welcome to third grade here is what your child is going to be learning here are some ways you can support we were able to translate those into I don't know I want to say 8 or 10 languages so that we were able to reach all of the families that came in

[01:16:00]
I think that process will continue to be nuanced in a way that can be more culturally responsive but then also we can do that in Middle School like we can make what happens in 6th grade accessible and what some of the feedback we heard was the teachers enjoyed it they really liked having that tool but one thing that a teacher shared with me when we started debriefing how it went was that will the student was in the room too and the student nobody told the student what they were going to learn in third grade and the student was like well that's cool like I have a list can I write on that can I check things off and I think the teacher and the parent were both oh of course you can have it you can do you know and so we sort of learned too like when you involved the child in that conversation like you're going to get more of that buy-in and

[01:17:00]
going to also have the family say oh my child does understand this list and I can support them with were you going to add something and I'm debating whether or not to ask this question but I'm going to go ahead and ask it understanding that the achievement Gap is not a specific part of the goal how is the district mitigating the gap between the general population and the targeted population in go to and in terms 2.1 and 2.2 and how does it inform your next steps

[01:18:00]
we actually talked a lot about that very topic throughout our preparation for tonight absolutely the work is heavy in front of us in relationship to this I know that it has been mentioned that on November 6th we will be bringing the Masa data to the board I think that's one thing is from The Boardroom to the conference room to the classroom we're having the conversation about this summative assessment data so people I firmly believe people want to do well principles want to do well teachers want to do well and by having this conversation from The Boardroom I think it's something that it will be very helpful in terms of the importance of the data beyond the goals that makes the other

[01:19:00]
I said I would say is we have to be consistent and we have to ensure the common language and expectations so that each one of our schools has the tools that they need to look at this for example I mentioned earlier that we met with our principals today last month when we met with him I believe that was the second principal meeting of the year we rolled out what was called the principal Leadership School and basically what it was what it is is a list of expectations built off of their feedback as they were surveyed and focus groups took place over the summer to ask what do you need your schools then we looked at the goals and the guard rails we compiled that with the principal evaluation tool

[01:20:00]
that is new this year that helped us build a principal leadership this month we took that tool and we built a scorecard off of it and the scorecard is built by our very own Oar department and it has the Baseline data and it has Target data and each one of our schools principles is looking at the same thing but what's different is it's their school's data and they are able to have with their it's supposed to supervisor with their supervisor consistent conversations regardless of what level of school they are what area of town supervisor is it's a constant conversation one of the elements to your point member Dominguez is interim assessment data I hope

[01:21:00]
eventually we will move from to formative assessment data too so we can look even more frequently and how our students are doing by student group so we will have targets for our principles to me we will have common language and common expectations for the entire system to be able to hopefully work toward having honest conversations about this topic because it is the moral imperative thank you Google are there any and that's fine if you'd like to ask a question with Language and Cultural education

[01:22:00]
development integrates strategies and actions that are outlined could you give me cuz I see Indian head here and I wanted to know how those those strategies are integrated as you lead to this plan of successful departments to support the Strategic or come up with ideas of professional development we have Indian education as part of our representative from special education we have representative

[01:23:00]
are soccer team we also have the principal supervisor for middle schools as part of that team and really ensuring that when we're talking about go to when we look at the data that we have multiple lenses on these thoughts so that we don't just go too fast to think we have a possible I don't want to use the word solution but strategy that we're not taking into account all of our focus group students and all students for that matter but the reason that's in there is that we are working strategically to involve all of our departments in this world to the the work we highlighted at Grant Middle School part of that was work that we did with our dual language team in terms of how do you work specifically in bilingual

[01:24:00]
what are the strategies and structures and so that I think it's just an example of how what Mr Garcia highlighted happens in the school thank you just wanted that noted to the previous questions cuz I didn't think we reflected more on how that Outreach was happening thank you thank you and I I think that's everyone is satisfied with the questions I just want to I would like to make a note on a conscious choice that I made on advice of my coach and that was to refrain from correcting the colleges on the diet and it is in the spirit of a planned after the meeting conversation

[01:25:00]
with with fellow board members about questions but I wanted to know that for everybody oh my choices evening was to foster a safe space for everyone to learn and sometimes learning requires making mistakes so but I think we've had a great conversation I appreciate the questions the responses and so I want to thank board members for productive conversation Administration you're working so hard and really appreciate the work that goes into to these monitoring responses now we will vote on whether or not to accept this monitor

[01:26:00]
report in just to clarify board is voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and her cabinet and that we have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students aligns with the vision for them in order to accept the monitoring three questions one does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal and I'm just going to look around and I see yes yes is their growth towards the vision yes and is there a strategy in plan or is the strategy and plan no are the

[01:27:00]
GM plant sufficient to cause growth toward the vision yes so the answer to all three is yes and so the board can accept the monitoring report confident that data is accurate and that the superintendent is performing and so at this point the board president will oversee the voting thank you remember to go for facilitating that conversation at this point I will entertain a motion to accept the progress monitoring report I move to accept the progress monitoring report for goal to and interim goals 2.1 and 2.2 math proficiency this is number Jackson I will second remember we have a motion and a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please crystals yes so the motion car

[01:28:00]
thank you for the reports we'll move on to our next item which is to consider approval of the consent agenda is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda item 6 and then 6.1 through 6.11 I'll move for approvals to approve the consent agenda for items 6.1 through 6.11 and all second this is board member Benavides thank you we have a motion and a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please no let's go yes and yes yes yes Courtney Jackson yes yes so that carries our next item is agenda item 7.1 discussion of the Albuquerque Public Schools 2025 legislative agenda for this item are presenters are Dr Gabriella Blakey superintendent Johanna King chief of staff and Jessica Martinez government liaison you all have before

[01:29:00]
I'm waiting till I get to the floor can you adjust the temperature outside tomorrow comes as a largest District in New Mexico we play a vital role in a vital role in advancing K-12 education Statewide in the upcoming legislative session we will present requests that reflect our genuine dedication to building a better future for every child in our community with the goal of becoming a model district for the state he priorities that we have included include funding

[01:30:00]
for Innovative District programs above the line funding Public School employee Recruitment and Retention alternative transportation funding and allowing high school students to take personal finance instead of economics in response to some board member feedback that we have received we also will add an introduction to the legislative agenda that emphasizes our commitment to student outcome Focus governance and focuses on the four goals and with that we stand for questions thank you Doctor Blakey so acknowledging that this is merely a discussion item not an action item and so we are here to represent the vision in values of the community to provide feedback but it is up to the administration in the superintendent is to other they will take that feedback and acknowledging that the board has had an opportunity to already provide feedback and ask clarifying questions are there any additional questions or recommendations that any board

[01:31:00]
I would like to bring into this discussion I just wanted to say thank you and acknowledge I know in the questions that we submitted beforehand you called out that even though we had a 3% raise for educators we still have to offset that because of health benefits and I think that's a big discussion that I'm hearing on my end so thank you for acknowledging that and working towards it thank you secretary Historia any other questions comments suggestions I want to Echo that and say prioritizing Public School employee recruitment retention and compensation is really important our teachers are so important our staff is important to our administrators are important thank you great thank you I had a question around what is not here but is sort of dominating conversations about education legislation otherwise and so that's specifically as it relates to AI or artificial intelligence in schools phone use in schools and

[01:32:00]
play policies are guidance on Aion phone use and then also infrastructure stabilization so these are topics inflation that are getting a lot of coverage a lot of discussion and I think likely our legislature may want to address them and yet they're not part of our agenda I'm just curious if you could speak to why not so as you know these are just a list of our priorities throughout the session we keep an eye on obviously in her legislative team keeps an eye on Statewide bills that come forward and stay white pills that are being drafted now and this is no way limits us from supporting other initiatives Statewide these are just our legislative priorities so there are several bills that we will hear about throughout this upcoming legislative session the aps will stand in support of it might mean that we're not taking

[01:33:00]
but we are happy to support and likewise there are usually some bills that we also feel that we can't support so at this time I don't know if Miss Martinez has other information on cell phones I have not heard of legislation regarding cell phones and we didn't feel like that was a priority for us right now as far as leading the state in a cell phone Banner policy do you have any have you heard anything about there is not currently any ongoing discussion legislatively around AI or cell phones the infrastructure we have had numerous discussions as well as Mr Hawkins who I'm debating if I call him up to talk about this or not again that is the stabilization of inflation for construction costs is something that we definitely support because it has

[01:34:00]
inhibited us to be able to finish some of our projects but we didn't at this time include it in our priority as a priority but if there are bills that are drafted or carried that include inflation stabilization we would support it great thank you and so seeing no other questions I want to thank you for preparing the legislative agenda and we will go ahead and move on to item 8 which is for me to say the next Board of Education meetings which are Wednesday November 6th 2024 at 5 p.m. at the Allison Bruce King educational complex and live stream to APS edu and then also the special Board of Education meeting which is specifically on Charter Schools scheduled for Wednesday November 13th also at 5 p.m. here in the Alice in Bruce King educational complex and with that this meeting is adjourned
