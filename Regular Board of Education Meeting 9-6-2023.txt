[00:06:00]
kids in the regard of gender identity and I even understand that it may even be without parental notification and I hope that's not true I also hear the students are being taught that their gender can be whatever they want it to be if that's being allowed whatever happened to Reading Writing and arithmetic I guess as an educator is it not appropriate to teach them and stay there in other words seem to me that is an educator teaching facts and history are far more important why so they can truly enjoy the quality of life liberty and pursuit of happiness is going in the wrong direction

[00:07:00]
health and well-being of our children in the APS school district based on cdc's youth risk surveillance status summary in 2021 more than 4 and 10 which is 42% students felt persistently sad or hopeless and nearly 1/3 which is 29% experience poor mental health in 2021 also 1 and 5 which is 222 students seriously considered attempting suicide and 10% attempted suicide this data brings me into the focusing into the level of distress of many students that are experiencing these distressful moments these mental health issues and nearly half 45% of the lgbtq plus students in 2021 seriously considered attempting suicide

[00:08:00]
for more than heterosexual students removing parents and family members from this equation it creates a volatile environment and within the CDC the requirements the recommendations are that the parents are fully engaged in the with the with the kids in the school districts and not set aside they are expected to be with the parents and their parents with the kids it is my request as a grandparent and a grandparent quotes of the neighborhood we've got we've got children better that I know of that are trying to commit suicide that are thinking suicide idealizations disturbing to me it hurts me and it hurts me that the parents

[00:09:00]
not allowed to be in the school districts or engaged in the kids their own children in the schools so you can wrap up in one quick sentence please consider our children now and in the future thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Gregory's Beckman you have 2 minutes once you begin public schools are much different today and when our children period

[00:10:00]
education on woke parents are told they have no part in their children's education gender has become an option children young is 11 and perhaps even younger are being asked if they have had anal sex unprotected sex oral sex and sex with transgender transgender men is that statutory rape these questions no child should hear at such a tender age from learning what their children are being taught students are encouraged in the classrooms many schools are building gender closets where students

[00:11:00]
change your gender identity unknown to their parents it's no surprise that the math and English scores of our students have dropped precipitously while classroom time is being utilized with transgender transgenderism non-gender pronouns and a long list of genders please bring the parents back to education thank you thank you sir period

[00:12:00]
the same because they're related I want to agree with the other speakers who have been talking about the transgender ideology and while you might be saying well she's just that Christian she's that rabble Rouser when I'm talking to other parents all across the city to my Muslim friends they are very very upset because APS has made it very clear that there that their voice is a parent does not matter and I'm giving you that information because even though this is 7:00 and the other ones it doesn't make it right slavery was legal but it was never moral Frederick Douglass said knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave when we educate our children on the Reading Writing arithmetic and when he gives them the ability to read and to reason and do math which

[00:13:00]
may claim to be racist we cheat them out of life out of having someone say that they are more important and more knowledgeable than them when we educate them we give them tools and Empower them to tell other people that they do not have a right to rule over them my second part that I do want to mention is that there is Chatter saying that we are going to be bringing back different mandates when we have one of our guys he's not here but when they were doing the zoo meetings we had one person say that the children of the Mask I was never so bored in my life and I'm going to end with this this is from when they said when they this is when they told the children that they did not have to wear masks anymore and

[00:14:00]
this comes up and your discussion or there's pressure for me is

[00:15:00]
back some of you many of the people in this room were not born at the time but in 1973 I went to Crown Point High School and on the Navajo reservation and was able to participate in the first state track meet for girls so was everything from jail and Crown Point on up to Highland High School and the big schools and in Albuquerque but we were that was the first time that we were giving an opportunity to to run and jump and I'm as girls and then after that I joined the UNM the first UNM track team of that and we just we had you know it was kind of was a really easy to to be doing that but we were really excited and encouraged to do that I'd have a chance to run and jump as women and throw anyway

[00:16:00]
I just am very concerned in that area with the with the transgender movement that are girls at this point are being asked to have men in the locker rooms and in the bathrooms of the schools and also in a related to sports I think that's unsafe and very far with that person I'd be fearful of I'll be fearful of the girls having those kind of situation so I just asked that you would work against that I hear that it's already happening we heard of something in one of the schools were a little girl was going into the boys bathroom and said that she had every right to be in there looks that way but I just really hope that we'll all have be reasonable and and realize that we need to protect our girls

[00:17:00]
Geraldo sennello 2 minutes once you begin speaking sir good evening Children's Museum

[00:18:00]
gender transition will reduce the risk of their child committing suicide seriously according to CDC 85% of disease are caused by emotions by PLS one and I called transgender people have a tendency towards lifelong mental health problems 10 to 15 years after gender reassignment suicide road to 20 times that appears imagine that transgender people have to be one of your students are loved ones on transgender treatment for children they should be no medical treatment for children under 18 years old to be extensive counseling therapy and time is undertaking against transgender treatment for children according to Wall Street Journal European countries such as sweet

[00:19:00]
treatment for children how would you pass the school board members and if your parents but who are parents grandparents and uncles Etc help save our students from this transgender issue are you willing along with you guys to protect our children's health and well-being thank you thank you sir for members of superintendent ever that completes public forum thank you thank you everyone for coming in and speak tonight we appreciate your comments and we're going to be moving along with our agenda so our next item is a super we're going to focus on student outcomes Focus governance and tonight we're going to have a superintendents report on student outcomes and where we are at this time the president of the members of the board short of I know this is our first attempt at one of the

[00:20:00]
I wanted to be able to sort of bring this back a little bit on the superintendent's report cuz I know sometimes there are each of us has interaction with the superintendent and sometimes it doesn't the information doesn't come to all of us this is an opportunity for us to have a conversation with the superintendent altogether and we're listening to information all together so again president Trump and members of the board thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight really what I'm going to do tonight is talk about some changes that we've made in terms of the infrastructure of the leadership team and I providing you with an organizational chart that has the very people and then the Departments that are reporting them underneath it it's a little hard to reach you have to take it home and get put under the reader but I'll take you through it tonight I think there's been some questions about you know how I added positions in some way and I have not

[00:21:00]
when we we have moved people we have eliminated positions and then created positions off those eliminations so there's no more people they're just spread out in a very different way so you may recall that a couple of weeks ago I did come to you and I mentioned that we were going to move the Zone Associates in align them to the goals so and at that time we knew that we had jeans of Adra who was going to be working with elementary students and he would be go one and we know that would be working with the middle school students and he would have gold too since then we've done some hiring so I'm happy to do that Mark Garcia is now our goal 3 working with the high schools you can stand up and way better Mark they've seen you but you know let him know who you are and how many may not have met

[00:22:00]
one position that dealt with our the sort of the equity and inclusion and support what we realized was trying to isolate those important Concepts in one office really wasn't appropriate and so we've spread that work out across the associates and into the work of the Chiefs that are in charge of that so for example we now the chief academic officer and that is Dr Antonio Gonzalez immuno yes we're all very excited some of us more than others but but he will be taking care of equity and he'll be working with Title One Language and Cultural Equity the office of equity the student family and community supports he'll also have special ed and curriculum and instruction so his focus is really going to be on the professional development and support for our teachers and that bank of it

[00:23:00]
Dr Segura will be a supervising the three Associates of her goal one goal 2 and go 3 and then she'll have all the principals falling under there and the principal supervisors and some of the Departments including Innovation career centered learning Athletics and activities and Community Schools will be taking care of the leadership development and professional development for those groups so that's sort of how we've defined it out and they work together very very closely they meet regularly and that whole crew is now beginning to develop processes and some very interesting tools to help them drive this work forward so for an example each goal associate has formed a team this team is made up of their principal supervisors members of the curriculum and instruction Department special education these teams are creating scoreboards by which

[00:24:00]
identify the lead measures that they think are going to have the most impact on us meeting the goals so as you know we do use a program to chart our work on the Strategic plan that's updated monthly internal to that these guys are following the progress monitor the measures that they think will have direct impact on the work of the Strategic plan because it's one thing to say we have a plan and all we're going to fix this we're going to fix that but how are you going to fix it this now we're getting into the nitty-gritty of the work and that's what these people are driving and that's what it's going to look like where you know obviously still in the emphasis but we are getting much closer so we're talking about the students on the administrative side that is how we'll have a much better picture at a much better ability to come to you once a month and lay out the data that you requesting and hopefully show you along the way how were making the

[00:25:00]
don't for a few months into it but I'm really pleased with the way these guys have jumped in and have really organized themselves in very clear and cohesive way so it's I think it's really appropriate and very helpful do you have any questions at this time regarding the organizational chart or where anybody is if you can't read it I understand I can't I have to take my glasses off and get it real close to my eyes but but I just wanted you to have that because I know we did move some people around just to give you a sense of it in your hands and so when you write me and say hey I've got a problem you're going to have a sense of who I'm probably going to turn it to if there's an issue are there any questions I find this really helpful thank you for sharing this is really great are there any questions

[00:26:00]
we could if we somehow get it into a easier to read format it's just a little we can do that yeah I'm able to understand I understand it that's not the same part but yeah it's just a lot of boxes Google play with it we can we certainly can do that so with that said I would like to share just a few thoughts as we started the year and to catch you up on a few things that have been at a concern we are at the 20th day as you know we chart every 20 days we're starting to look at a lot of data points and one of those data points is chronic absenteeism okay the last couple years as we hit the 20th day The Chronic absentium was up at 34% and 33% this year it's a 27% I think we still have a long way to go

[00:27:00]
way too high after 20 days but it's moving in the right direction and I think a lot of it is I visited schools and I don't have any schools you've had gone out to but when you visit with the principals they talk about the kids came back much more ready for school this year and they have a much better understanding of how School works and how they're expected to behave and they really do get their supposed to be there we still have problems with kids getting to school and drives me nuts when I'm driving up you know any streets at 8:31 but you know I did I did on five high school campuses at lunch and I've done lunch duty and I've talked to the kids and they like it you know they like it some of them are really getting into the swing of it but you know there's always make A Change Is Gonna cause some problems and we have some people who are struggling with that still but we continue to work with them

[00:28:00]
along the lines of getting kids to school I have a little bit of good news we have struggled mightily with hiring we did hire a contractor to help us with our special needs students and that is not gone as well as we would like and we may be coming to you soon to discuss our next steps but in the plus side we had a little burst of hiring activity last week and we believe by Friday every student that has an IEP for transportation will be covered that they were routing the the buses today and we think we've got to have it so we have like I said as long as we can keep people in the seat so long as the drivers stay and again if you're looking for work we are looking for a lot of positions but drivers are first and foremost among them because we've got a lot of routes we just can't run and we've had to consolidate we need at least I think another 70,500 at this point we are running as many kids as we could possibly can

[00:29:00]
if you were able to attend the superintendent's cup you had a good time I'd like to thank the Education Foundation and the volunteer committee led by Mr dufay they did another amazing job I believe the morning flight was completely sold out in the afternoon flight was really darn close to have so many opportunities to donate and for people to participate and fun events throughout the course but the best part of the superintendent's cup Bar None is that we have the student participation that's really been something we've been building up over the last couple years I'm very proud of it I believe the Eldorado marching band woke up at least the entire east side of San Diego casino at 7 a.m. but the rousing rendition of the really Rowdy song and they try to take a nap in the afternoon with his band made sure that wasn't good so we have the West Mesa JROTC program that comes out and

[00:30:00]
just one they make it so much fun they hosted a little kick the football if you kick the football or throw the football you can get your drive from there and for people my age it's really just a matter of don't hurt yourself kicking the football but they think it is so funny to watch me kick the football and they're right it is funny but they insist I kick it so I I donate and kick and I did walk away unscathed again so the really cool thing is they have a drone and they fly it to the end of the the green and they try to drop it in the hole and to your year and a half ago kid got me a hole in one and he is not forgotten he got came to the course and he was do you remember me and I said I remember you and I remember you do so but it's just great they really bring a notified I don't want to I don't know if you were going to remember to add this into but part of the festivities included board member Jackson's daughter singing

[00:31:00]
the national anthem and she did such a beautiful job I was right there with board member Jackson and I think I cried through the whole thing but it was it was stunning she did a great job and so it was really wonderful to have her out there yeah that's in my notes that I'm sorry no no it's totally fine she did a great job for 7th grader tremendous courage in front of a lot of people outside in the heat really sounded nice well done was very and that's the sort of thing I think it makes our golf tournament unique the kids they come and participate and of course I'd like to congratulate the Board of Education and the nearest departments who both hosted and supported the community celebration of high school and the education some of the following morning

[00:32:00]
and this it support staff that set up cleaned up took down really did a lot of the leg work and I know that's not easy and it was greatly appreciated because you did a wonderful job and so thank you all for for the work you did I believe that that is my report I am open for any questions you may have any questions about this time was at 27 percent for the 20th day which is down pretty significantly from last year do you anticipate that will continue through the year continue going down I know that's just a guess on your part but with everything that's in place do you believe we can continue to get that number

[00:33:00]
that's why I don't think it can go down and Richard's going to look at me and not his head yes or no I'm either going to be right or wrong here board member letter I'll watch Richard see what he says on this he's doing this once your label chronically absence how do you get it off how does it get off yeah so I don't see how it gets off so I think it can only grow but what I'd like to see is it not grow as much as it did last year and what we're going to do is part of our progress monitoring is we're going to try to look at all right so let's say you have a student who is Miss 10 days or chronically absent and we do an academic we do an intervention did tendons teams doing intervention and for the rest of the year they missed two days okay now I would say but it's not but it's still labeled so this is how we're struggling with some of the progress monitoring that you're asking us for but we think we can do it and we think we'll be able to say it is improved so the number may not improve but we may know that the results

[00:34:00]
maybe you have a different way of doing it and he'll explain to me later but I will say this I think it's our second or third year of full attendance teams I think we're getting better at the interventions we can suggest and provide and I think the schools are more adapted to utilizing the concept of an attendance team they're still in here at barriers for people to get there and as long as we can if we any we can remove on our end makes it better so we're trying very hard on our end to not be the barrier for kids for the entire school year so if they're fourth graders that holds for that year then they start over again next next school year and 5th graders and I don't I don't want anybody to think that there's a Scarlet Letter to the child walks around with a on his background and it does not follow them from year to year and and I'm really desperate

[00:35:00]
give me a signal you speak up okay it's too easy it's not easy we'll get a report and explain it to you but I'm telling you I think that's I think we're going to see better results because I think we're getting better at ways to intervene I think it's still a problem that's that 27 percent that's great that it's lower still too high for 20 days so we got to work on that thank you very much that's a quick question in regards to the chronic apps and he is them and probably can't be answered tonight but and I would be curious to know how that 27 percent compares to pre-pandemic levels like the 2019 and 20th day and Dr Bowman I can't see you but if it's on Saturday just tell me it's on sapper but is it is 27 an average or has it been better we're going to have to get

[00:36:00]
repeat that for you he doesn't know it off the top of his head but we can get it I think we're going to find that it's still a little higher than it was pre-pandemic that would be my gut and the difference is that it's sort of seemed to settle down in pre-pandemic over the last couple years it just kept rolling as a problem and so what we're hoping is we can eliminate that that sort of rolling trend of people missing school I'm sorry

[00:37:00]
staff tries to do a survey of licensure are missing school and I know that's that's how we get that's how we intervene is by knowing how and why they've missed school but I think it would be really informative for us if we could get a vision in overall picture of that I don't know what capacity we have for that kind of analysis but it does get to root cause stuff in the concept of the attendance with the individual student it's not a survey it's an actual conversation what's preventing you from getting here and then we start to look at what we can do to help oftentimes just transportation and somebody got sick at home they had to stay and watch somebody that's usually what it is and so we have to work with the family on Waze to work around those sort of emergency situations and I really appreciate the work that

[00:38:00]
working really hard for us in terms of you know just some budgetary and decision-making stuff decisions that we have to make it might be helpful information and thank you so much for this organizational chart it's something that I wanted for a long time and I really appreciated thank you for diligence and pounding that one through so I'm free I have a question about students focused to the changes that you've made to the org chart so you mentioned that the new association's to develop new dashboards and measures can you share a little bit more about the time frame for that like when might there be

[00:39:00]
first draft and are you anticipating potential changes to the interim goals and guardrails based on this work they've already developed their scoreboards they've already identified lead measures and they've already begun to collect data around that again we've only been in school for a couple weeks so there's not a lot and that's really for them to chart and hold their people accountable to the work that the larger strategic plan is asking us to do so it's one thing to say we're going to reorganize this or we're going to have a great program that how do you get to the Great program we have to have steps some measurements to get you there so this is based off the book study that the cabinet did last year and the principal should be doing this year the 4 executive in that tool to do that so I don't know about timeline will there be adjustments

[00:40:00]
I'm almost positive at some point there will be an adjustment hopefully in a very positive way I don't think the goals will change because those are your goals I mean unless you told me you were changing it was hard some of those are really hard and they're hard to measure and we're doing the best we can it's kind of like attendance he doesn't he's never going to reduce you know he doesn't get him back right you don't reset the button but we can slow it down if we can shut and then have some sort of point that shows yeah he was on this trajectory and then he got to this you know that's that's much better so that's how we're looking at it

[00:41:00]
yes I'd like a clarification So when you say that where is this child who is chronically absent labeled as such it is it in our system or is it a state system or both when you say that a child we can't remove that label from a chronically absent child and in part because he's he or she or they have they reach that they miss so many days of that they fall into so they're in that category you can't you can't un

[00:42:00]
you can't go back and pick up days so that's why they can't get out of the cat year to year it doesn't it doesn't track them so what you're doing on a year to year then is pretty much hoping that that child maybe the next year isn't going to fall into that but I understand what the superintendent is saying is once they've missed that number of days that puts them into the category of chronically absent they're just there was one of our that's one of our inner measures so this is really hard to measure and it's really tough because her in the category right so how do we show Improvement for those we're looking specifically at those kids and are we seeing improvements because of our interventions with the attendance so that's what the next steps that will be trying to bring forth

[00:43:00]
sense because they may still be in the same sort of vulnerable situation that caused them to have high absence is in the first place and if it's getting better then it means our interventions are working which means we should continue with the interventions not take them away that's correct any other comments I just want to say thank you for bringing this forward to us too I appreciate the the organizational chart and just the conversation about you know where we are at this point and some of the things that we're looking at I agree in terms of The Chronic absenteeism we do know that if we can't get kids into the classroom that's really going to set us back but it sounds like there's you know some strategies going in and I really appreciate how you've Blended Equity throughout the entire lens of it that it's not

[00:44:00]
but everybody owns a piece of how Equity gets addressed as we're going through all of our goals and looking you know in terms of what that means for the guard rails and for the interim work right obviously it sounds like the associates are putting together their team looking at what this means addressing their interim goals and what I understand from sfg is yes we kind of start where we we put our best foot forward and identifying and describing what our goals and our guard rails and our interim goals and guardrails are but as I've been watching some other boards that are doing their progress monitoring there's a lot of adjustment and we're going to the district's going to have adjustment because that's that's the commitment that we're making also is to this continuous improvement process because if it doesn't work and it's really because we're sort of wedded to the way that we've defined something and it's not quite working you know how do we

[00:45:00]
how do we adjust ourselves and I know that board members Jackson Dominguez and I had a chance to to see an actual board in action who was looking at something and it was like this didn't quite work out and I really appreciated viewing that particular process with that board because it sort of made the work very real to in terms of the you know the difficulty of it too it's not there is no Silver Bullet it's not like that simple we're just doing the best that we can we put our best foot forward in terms of how we want to describe this work and we're going to make a commitment to looking at it that way but if some things are not working out we're going to probably have to come back and have an honest conversation about this particular measure is really not getting us to the point where we thought it was going to get us or the way that we're looking at the measuring and it's not it's not necessarily yielding what we thought but you know we've got to kind of stick through the process

[00:46:00]
I know it's been a learning curve for everybody and I'm just really proud of the work that we've committed ourselves to in the work that's going on and I'm I'm especially proud of the organizational work and everyone really embracing themselves around a particular goal is because I think that's that's really where the work is going to be and I I really applaud applaud the decision that you made to to reorganize this way may I add sure so because I see this reorganization and work that we're doing playing out in our schools so just before I came here I had occasion to visit one of the elementary schools in district six and tonight they're having a parent engagement

[00:47:00]
I was dropping off some things to the community coordinator and principal haven't come in and we were it was like a mini session of what we were doing it was it was heartening so yeah we had our first professional development at the school sites yesterday K through 8 and I got to visit about four of them and it was very interesting very interesting because they're definitely wrapping their heads around this town and they're trying to do it in a productive way yeah they're still there but they're working on it and I do feel good about the commitment and I will tell you the what I hear from from my Chiefs Peter's directly is the principles are glad that there is just something to point to and that you have made a commitment for five years and then we're going to stick to it provides they're really really excited about

[00:48:00]
hey small wins those are always good it's always good to have something that you're feeling good about and you're celebrating because we do have to celebrate those small wins this week as we move through the process so any other you have anything to add or I think you asked a question okay remember I'm just freezing my brain isn't getting cold so we're going to move on to our next item which is an action item are next time for discussion in action is consideration approval of additional revisions to board policy IH 9 this is about Indian education we have just the Martinez policy analyst and philipson or senior director of Indian education

[00:49:00]
as the president stated we have two board policies on the agenda this evening as well as the proposals for the nmsba 2024 legislative resolution so starting with Ford policy IH 9 thank you sell can be found starting on page 17 of your agendas this policy was approved for additional changes that the August 7th 2023 policy committee meeting in addition board policy IH 9 has been reviewed by the Indian policies and procedural directives committee with minor changes to the language of the policy these changes are in agreement with the board's desire for more affirmative language regarding the Cooperative relationship between the Board of Education and the IPP I would like to direct your attention to the first sentence because we've received a recommendation from the board to adjust the language in the first sentence to read the Board of Education of the Albuquerque Public Schools will recognize the importance of Native American students traditions and

[00:50:00]
use as they obtain their education this change does not affect the content or intention of the policy it is a discussion and action item and Phil Parsons senior director of Indian education is here to assist with any questions so it was just the the change was just will recognize and we just set up paying their education at the end period punto no skills and values just removing that okay any board comments on that particular change I think it's I think it's a good one it's very affirmative I'll move for approval of IH 9 Indian education please tell me about Romero yes yes yes

[00:51:00]
yay so our next item for discussion and action is consideration approval of revision including renaming of board policy kl3 which is restaurant liquor license waivers to kl3 restaurant liquor license waivers and cannabis sales and our policy anus just you have four thank you madam president say that three times quickly so this policy can be found on page 20 of your packet it has been updated to include the state statutes restricting cannabis sales within 300 feet of a school or child daycare facility the name of the policy has also been updated to reflect this change there are board recommendations for this policy the first being a change to the title of the policy so that it will read restrictions to restaurant liquor license waivers

[00:52:00]
cannabis sales the second board recommendation is a change to the last sentence of the policy to read these sales and the granting of such a waiver would increase the risk to students and staff of encountering persons under the influence of a controlled substance to the slightest degree who may potentially interfere with or negatively impact the instructional process and would increase the danger of vehicular accidents within the walk zones surrounding the school this is a discussion in action item and I'm available to respond to your questions so open it up for any questions you just say the title again the proposed title change board member Peterson yes the change to the name would be restrictions to restaurant liquor license

[00:53:00]
by board member Peterson and we have a second by board member Gonzalez and is still have a discussion go ahead that is the most unwieldy sentence you can't like what are we what is the purpose of what are we trying to accomplish and I said in an email let me pull up my so I just want to be really clear to on this but you are doing is basically where we can provide a waiver but it doesn't know I mean it doesn't necessarily mean it will occur correct Madam president comes from the city so all this policy is doing is saying that we are in opposition to any way that would be provided and okay okay okay okay so and there you have it that's it just that simple that we are

[00:54:00]
are opposed instead of ahead and read I mean let me find my APS will not Grant a liquor or cannabis license under any circumstance under any circumstance period refers to a who that refers to a degree it makes it doesn't it doesn't make sense and it does not reflect well on us to have that language

[00:55:00]
I think the policy is clear if there are semantic or grammatical errors I think we've agreed that we would leave those to the staff going forward okay that's fine and I emailed some messages thank you for that yes it's very easy fix I appreciate the feedback this is as the this language is as it appears on the site now so I'll be very happy to go back and and chop it up a little bit and make it a little neater that's all but aren't we voting at the language that's written here with the changes that's that's the motion on the table is the language as written I hear board member Jackson saying is that right the motion is is what's before us is the language

[00:56:00]
being proposed to us and that's what we've got emotion and a second on that we could take a vote and it's specifically to what's on here and then those that are not in agreement would have vote however you want to vote but right now we have a motion with based on the language that's before us go ahead and can we just make a friendly Amendment so that way so that we're all clear but we should be able to do that and I think that it would become clear if we simply let with the sentence that says or the phrase that says Albuquerque Public Schools shallows in all cases alcohol or cannabis sales which could be authorized by the state law says started

[00:57:00]
APS will oppose we don't have I mean I think where we are right now is we don't have enough I don't think we have a clear friendly Amendment at this point so I'm not hearing a clear friendly Amendment what I do feel is that what's in front of us although it's jargony I think it's got a lot of words in it for sure but what's important in there is it says Albuquerque Public Schools are so I mean a friendly Amendment if you want is Albuquerque Public Schools will oppose instead of shallow pose in all cases I'll call her cannabis sales but I don't I don't I mean it is jerky there's a lot in there and we had the opportunity to look at this one this is this the first read on this one president it's it's an existing policy this is just a change we just added

[00:58:00]
cannabis in there right okay okay Miss Martinez can you just read to us what exactly it is that we're voting on again I think you I mean you had given it to us earlier but can you just read it to us board member and you're asking me to give you the language as it would appear with the revisions is that correct so it's the one board member one that we just got earlier it's the one that's in our package as as right you would you like for me to read it I could also read it it's whatever okay all right it is kl3 restrictions to record sorry restrictions to restaurant liquor license waivers and cannabis sales as authorized by state law the sales of alcoholic beverages and cannabis may not be located within 300 feet of a school church or child daycare facility Albuquerque Public Schools in all cases the granting of any waiver to

[00:59:00]
restaurant for the purpose of allowing the sales of alcoholic beverages within 300 ft of a School site in which instruction of students normally takes place these sales and the granting of such a waiver would increase the risk of students and staff of encountering intoxicated persons under the influence of a controlled substance to the slightest degree who may potentially interfere with or negatively impact the instructional process and would increase the danger of vehicular accidents within the walk zones surrounding the school okay so then we have intoxicated in there but then we're talking about we're talking about alcohol and cannabis so with alcohol is that how the law is written like how would what would it say like if you're on accountability

[01:00:00]
we oppose the waiver and we oppose the Cannabis sales then we can just bring this back to the table with an opposition on those simple topics write that last sentence the sales and granting you know describing why just take that out so that is just the state law fails blah blah Albuquerque Public Schools show up and all cases all of these which you know that part which is just normally takes place period

[01:01:00]
the first thing that I wanted to bring up there have been several attempts that are friendly Amendment but I'm not sure that everybody agrees with the friendly amendments that are being proposed and so I would almost feel that the best sorry third we had an opportunity to send in these amendments earlier and there were you know there were amendments made to the policy based on feedback that she already received and this is already a change of what the original policy was so my suggestion would be to vote on the motion on the floor that's already there with the language as she just read if anybody is supposed to that then voted down and then we can come back with the policy with the Amendments that have

[01:02:00]
I'm totally fine with the policy as as she just read it so I I don't think that we need a friendly Amendment all right any other discussion I'm going to call for the vote hey give me another Erica no Danielle Gonzales now because of the lack of clarity Courtney Jackson yeah so the most carries all right so let me get myself our next discussion in action is considerable for the resolution submitted to the New Mexico school boards Association for consideration for the association

[01:03:00]
2024 legislative platform and you guys again except with Dr Escobedo here so it's Jessica again I'm sorry I should have said she has to come Martinez I'm sorry about that next we have consideration of approval of the resolutions to be submitted to the New Mexico School Board Association in support of the nms 2024 legislative platform these are located on page 24 of your packets to be clear these resolutions are submitted in support of the nms legislative platform and are not the formal Declaration of the district's legislative priorities and resolutions we have provided a draft of the IPS legislative agenda for your information it's there on your desks and you can provide us with your thoughts on other agenda items tonight or through email the first resolution is technology device funding which calls for the state to

[01:04:00]
technology devices for all students the second resolution is the behavioral health Pipeline and school reimbursement which request that the state examined the reimbursement process for schools and districts for Behavioral Health Services provided for students the next resolution is Educator educator retirement and compensation which encourages the legislature to ensure that out-of-pocket costs for dependent premiums do not increase as a result of decreases to the employee costs and finally the last resolution is entitled emergency funding for HVAC upgrades where an APS supports the provision of emergency State funding to convert outdated and ineffective swamp coolers we have received a board recommendation that the 5th point be removed from the resolution as it was provided by the nmsba and not by our staff also it was pointed out that the resolution language makes it sound like a c and HVAC are different when in fact they are the same thing

[01:05:00]
eliminating the 7th whereas paragraph calling for converting swamp coolers to refrigerated air and changing the language of the therefore paragraph to read therefore be it resolved that the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education supports the provision of emergency State funding to convert outdated and ineffective cooling and heating systems at schools and District work sites these resolutions are discussion and action items and Dr Escobedo and I are here to assist with any questions that you have so I'll open it up for questions before we move to just a motion for approval any questions on those because these are for nmsba and we're just taking action that we approve these to be part of that inclusion with nmsba that were on board with these resolutions that they have so

[01:06:00]
I have a question about the resolutions but how does that relate to the document on our desks the legislative agenda does that coming next president the one on your desk is the districts proposed this is for nmsba

[01:07:00]
so some of some of these in and I totally support the the ones that have been presented some of them may still be deemed already existing in the nmsba platform in which case what what that committee does and what the body is a hold of the msba just says these were presented with the committee decided that they were already existing but I don't think it ever hurts because it just brings back up to the top the concern and I think that one is one of the things that helps clarify because the nmsba Statewide so it's just that every District needs to be able to deal with in the same way an example for

[01:08:00]
what might be in the nmsba platform versus ours and this is hypothetical but nmsba might say we believe in local control for the way we determine minutes and hours and days what we might say is we have a pilot program called tops that we are finding to be beneficial for students and so is APS we we approach that as a specific remedy for that but it wouldn't be appropriate to do it at the nmsba because I'm just say that doesn't apply to us on the legislative agenda for our district be coming back and we'll take a review at that point so this is just a first read for us

[01:09:00]
and I noticed the verbiage in there again goes back to ensuring that all elementary and secondary school kind of everyone has a device and I know we've had a conversations in the past where we're saying we're trying to move away from like our elementary kiddos everyone being on you know on a Chromebook or things of that nature is that still in the talk but this looks like we're still trying to push for that so specifically what we're requesting board president is really looking for the sake of consistently fund devices and our strategic plan so that's your question if that's what

[01:10:00]
I've heard from technology and Dr Bowman that we would we would support that we're just trying to get ensure that there's consistent funding because right now there's not a consistent pots and 3.5 billion in excess Revenue next year all right okay so just a point about this yet do I okay I'm entertain a motion on this particular item so I will move that we approve the resolution for consideration for the association's 20204

[01:11:00]
Pamela Adams Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes it's on top of your Romeo yes if you need a Mingus yes Courtney Jackson's okay so our next item is a discussion item and this is an update on calendar year 2024 Medical Pharmacy dental and vision Trends and projections are presenters are Todd Torgerson chief of human resources and legal support services Valerie atencio senior director employee benefits Wellness leaves Eric Weinstein with an Executive Vice President James Dickey from also with Aon and Todd Burley the Financial Manager with Aon you have the floor thank you so much thank you for your time tonight as noted on the agenda as you just indicated the team that we have tonight we are going to discuss our benefits

[01:12:00]
and also our Trends and Consulting has been contracted with the district by way of an RFP or Actuarial work or commercial work as well as benefits Consulting and has a national and international presence and local office here run by Executive Vice President Eric Weinstein to my right you'll be doing the presentation here shortly as I share annually with this it is essential really to recognize and remember that we're fully self-insured we are not in the claims payment business we are in the same business and so that's the theme of our presentation here tonight ensuring we have a responsibility to ensure now and going forward that we can also real quick we have the aps benefits committee certainly wishes and maintains a certain balance with respect

[01:13:00]
to our fiduciary concerns and a responsibilities or our employees as well as noted on slide 7 when we get into this presentation all APS employees will maintain 79% of their raise those employees that it was single coverage will maintain 92% of the race on the benefits committee's guiding principles are to continue to offer choice and value to our employees to simplify the district's plans offerings certainly to reduce our claims cost and sure that we can pay claims as part of our fiduciary responsibility going forward the committee believes that the recommended action tonight by certainly complies reports with those recommendations and we play an important role in the benefits Consulting and advisory space hitting New Mexico both for private and

[01:14:00]
it's my pleasure along with James Dickey and Todd Burley to present once again to this board and for Anna represent Albuquerque Public Schools so if we move to the next slide we'll dive into the material this is a overview there it is this is the overview slide on factors facing employers relative to healthcare costs it's not in New Mexico or APS specific but it illustrates a bit of what's changed since we last met a year ago on what we're seeing down the road the points on this slide that I want to call out is obviously we have high core inflation and that's having it will continue to have an impact on Healthcare inflation Healthcare inflation or the cost of increase cost of Medical Care in the future is expected to be 8% or higher over the next few years and then as we see as wage increases moderate and core inflation persist this can lead to challenges in the ability for

[01:15:00]
employees to afford the rising cost of healthcare and then as the economy pools that this can lead employers challenged with buffering healthcare costs increases potentially putting more stress and financial burden on to employees so this all adds up to a very very situation both for employers and for employees and this is the world in which we consultant every day I will move it forward one more slide to talk about and while covid is not dominating the headlines obviously like it was two years ago there are still impacts at APS is and we'll be feeling from covid and covid-19 points coming off this slide covid had some waves and impacts on your claims experience going

[01:16:00]
back to 2020 and more specifically we saw the Deferred care and suppressed care start to really come through in 2022 and into 2023 and as we use that data so we start claims increase in a significant Manner and then we take those claims and we project those into 2024 so that covid suppression and claims coming through later than anticipated as having an impact on your projection in the future might look like although we have not and are not pricing any significant waves into our pricing for 2024 at this point and lastly the high inflation that followed us out of the pandemic and that impacted Healthcare organizations has had a

[01:17:00]
beautiful impact on the cost of healthcare and medical Trends specifically adding additional pressure to Trend as we move forward and we'll talk about that we talked about that the higher trend on the last slide and what we were expecting in part of that is that high inflation and Healthcare inflation as well on the side you see here these are just the kind of last night we have specifically on covid were reporting the amount of members with a covid test all the total cost associated with those members dropped from 2021 to 2022 this is the amount that APS paid members were not responsible for costs associated with testing or vaccines some of this will be changing and we'll talk about that I do think that these are interesting numbers but truly the the bigger cost of covid is the suppressed claims that we saw in 2022 2023 and what will be moving forward and we'll

[01:18:00]
talk about the vaccine and testing in just a moment on the next slide we have I'll point you to some key takeaways four of them off of this slide but just to orient you the top to charts are actually remember per month or pmpm claim charts you may also see peanuts per employee per month the bottom line on the top two charts is that your claims continue to increase at a steady upward Pace you can see that permanently you can see that remember from a month in 2021 from about 400 dollars and it ends a year around 500 dollars there's some seasonality to it but then we start 2022 and it drops back down to 4 5 0. 0

[01:19:00]
play charts below those are your enrollment we are seeing the decline in enrollment on the plan so your plan experience to 5% decrease in enrollment from 2022 from 2021 into 2022 so in a sense you have a combination of claims increasing and enrollment decreasing and that kind of comes together in the bottom box third one over total per employee per month cost of $1,034 per employee per month and that was up almost 10% from the prior Year all of this factors into the renewal calculation and some of the renewal figures which will talk about on the next slide if we if I take your focus to the bottom of this page and and the gray bar with the wife on we have total projected cost increases for your medical and pharmacy program

[01:20:00]
9.8% that's going up from 88.499% this is the fee that you paid a presbyterian Blue Cross Blue Shield and cygna to administer your program the second line is the stop loss premium that you pay to Tokio Marine HTC this protects you from large claimants and any given year so it's an insurance protection for yourself and sure plan work projecting that at 20% increase we do not have that renewal will receive that renewal later this year stop loss is always finalized and the fourth quarter of the calendar year that's the amount that's been built into our renewal projection so when you add administrative fees and individual stop

[01:21:00]
plus you have your total fixed cost I'm going up just under 5% I think the Highlight here is that your fixed costs are almost 7% of your total cost so the big portion 93% are the medical and Pharmacy claims that your members are incurring and those are projected to increase into 2024 at 10.2% or an increase of 8.4 million when we break down a little bit if we were to sort of take the 8.7 million dollar increase in break that down and what's responsible for what is kind of on the right to some extent we've got your medical Trend that's increasing it at 5.4% but some legislative impacts are mandates that will add 1.30 million and the covid suppressed claims and covid inflation collecting 2 million into that number

[01:22:00]
and then lastly before I leave this page the bottom the bullets at right above the shower and I'll talk about this a little bit more but that 8.7 million increase is split between what APS pays and what you your employees pay through paycheck deductions your your share of that is just about 6.6 million and the employees are 2.1 million there was a legislative change in New Mexico that is increasing that shift to APS by 800,000 dollars so that's 800,000 higher than otherwise would have been without that legislative change and the share that APS is paying in aggregate is 66.4% of the total cost her $64.44 million and then that always leads to the next slide a question with this board last year

[01:23:00]
what does a 9.8 percent increase in medical premiums mean given that we have salary increases and the factors are not on the same magnitude so we like to show this chart so that you have an idea of Anderson talked about at the beginning but this chart showing that once if you gave a 6% raise and you did not increase medical contributions at all these numbers would be 100% they retain 100% of their raise this is showing you what happens with the 6% wage increase and as mentioned at the very least their retaining at least 79% of their pay increase and as you can see from this chart there's many in the mid-80s and 90's are listed in the last bullet point of this slide on another slide

[01:24:00]
on the next Saturday do you want to touch on the a couple of the legislative impacts that I mentioned that are being put into place there's Senate Bill 51 address some Pharmacy issues around copay accumulator plans and Drug coupon plans and those are estimated to impact the plan by 300,000 House Bill 27 around mammogram coverage and payment for those coverages will impact the plan by 330,000 and the covid vaccines which will now be paid for by APS will work in or estimating impact of 660000 in Impact there's a potential there could be one we had a listed as 0220000 the 3:30 in the 6660

[01:25:00]
your renewal and then lastly there's the end of the public health emergency and employee cost shares for testing is being instituted as allowed for by the end of the public health emergency and this is an expense members will now pay when seeking testing and non preventive care related to covid I think on the next page I have I've covered house bills 5:33 around the salary bands the fact that you'll still be paying 870 and 60 per cent respectively it's just that what salary level that you'll be paying that and what the chart in the middle shows is that we have no more people or APS is paying 80% will be more people were aps's paying 70% and fewer people wear your only paying 60%

[01:26:00]
because you're paying more for those individuals that's where the 800,000 comes from that you will now be paying that you weren't under the prior salary cheer structure and contribution structure we show the next slide every year and this is the 5-year projected fund balance I think the primary point on this side you keep a fun to pay for yours as well as a claim fluctuation Reserve really a program to make sure that you have a funds to pay for all claims that may come your way after increasing 9.8% in 2024 what you see to keep you in that gray bar which is above the floor and below the maximum we need to increase those the premiums 8% a year and

[01:27:00]
with that assumption I think it's important for the board to know the second to last bullet point we're at 97 roughly 97 million projected into 2024 that would be estimated to be about $128 million or 31 million higher if we take that out at 8% a year and that is our Challenge and that is what will work towards bettering as we move forward with health care cost increases and affordability for the plan and for the members lastly there's a couple of enhancements to the vision plan increase in frame allowance and contact lens allowance these are benefits to the members to the employees and because of how the plans funded and its funding status we don't have to increase rates so we can improve the plan and not increase the rates and that is going into effect and that's

[01:28:00]
a quick summary of the report thank you thank you Eric with that I'd be remiss so I didn't get a shout out to our benefits and wellness folks we have our Wellness start coming up it's going to be October 3rd and 4th comma we'd be happy to see you all there at 2:36 p.m. will be going over switch enrollment changes in the plans will have mammograms blood drive dental vision screenings and all the good work so it'll be fine so come on come on okay any questions this one is always a heavy one it's a lot of information I know and I just want to thank you for all your questions just sort of setting some of the contacts for some of the information so is there thank you I mean

[01:29:00]
Dylan oh my goodness like an 8% I mean I just kind of think how how can we keep doing that you know I just don't know like how APS can keep covering that and then how the taxpayers can cover the other part like how can you do that if the if wages are not growing but yet healthcare costs are I honestly don't know how we do it and I know you probably can't answer that question again please look up the rules of 722 so it will be an ongoing issue it is something that we will have to address and it is something that we will have to see funding and continue funding for I mean we have you as consultants to help us with that somehow right to give us

[01:30:00]
consultants in the right direction to help us figure it out I mean it was certainly I'm appreciative of the you know the quality of the health care that we can you know just the benefits that we do make available to our staff for sure at a time there was once a time when you know I was covered under this particular plan because my husband carried that and it was it was a very generous plan definitely helped us through a real difficult time and we were really grateful to have you know Health Care insurance at that time when he was going through you know his rigorous treatment and all of the stuff that we had to do for his cancer diagnosis and so I can only imagine I mean in that was you know it was but it was spot on I mean we definitely had really good services and we were covered as a family so I really appreciate the benefits that we do make available to our staff

[01:31:00]
how do you spell very robust plan yeah so I was going to have nice benefits nationally is this the situation for everyone 8% and I and I understand that our benefits are generous yeah the average increase that we're seeing nationally is about 7.5 percent and that fluctuates by plan and by certain circumstances so each one's a little bit different as we look at it but if you were to ask me for an average that would be the average I would give you right now or what we're projecting for 2024 I think your increase came in a little bit below if we look back one year is coming in a little bit of a look at this year giving your size you should track pretty clothes not with standing any initiatives that are

[01:32:00]
in a place where are the legislative changes close to that average and so I think the legislative changes at 1.3 million took you probably right over that average so could you explain that suppress so thank you for that question during during 2020 and in 2021 there was a number of members that maybe some other entities so last time I would just ask again what would be your advice like I know you said have a very generous plan and maybe there are other

[01:33:00]
districts or other government entities that don't have such a generous plan you are not you would not advise us to not have a generous plan because obviously that helps us keep our employees so I'm assuming that would not be something you all would advise hard question I know but I mean I'm thinking I'm looking at 30.8 million between FY 23 and 27 and that's big you know I can answer this with respect to your friendly and helpful chief of Human Resources looking to recruit stuff about the money part of it too it's it doesn't come without having the money

[01:34:00]
good stuff you know I would be worried about that and Billy being able to protect our work around student outcomes in you know the work that we're doing at him but I just want to say thank you so much for the robust information and the information unless there's other questions I'm going to move along but I appreciate the context and all of the information and your generosity and answering some really hard questions thank you all right so the next item that we're going to I'm just going to do a brief president's report one is I just wanted to First acknowledge the family community celebration dinner in Summit to we had about 200 family members students staff attend at the event at Albuquerque High School and August 29th which featured information on the goals guard rails and the Strategic plan along with entertainment by the Albuquerque High School Mariachi's and their marching band and I think we also had

[01:35:00]
the dance team out there so a shout out to all of our students and parents that came to that really grateful to principal principal and on this and the Bulldogs for hosting and all that helped and the more than 160 people who attended the next day Summit including the robust conversations about improving student outcomes so thank you to board members too for attending those sessions just got a couple of comments that I wanted to read one it was from an individual set I was impressed with the out of the box thinking that I observed that day I think you and the aps sports are on the right track that was another one was I implore you to engage parents in the monthly student achievement reporting that the board has committed to they will bring the leadership and urgency needed to move the district forward I'm best of luck on the school year you all have a great plan to implement and I agree with that I think just the sentiment was was very positive

[01:36:00]
I want to Tulsa just give a quick and a very brief update on the superintendent's search and where we are with that the evaluation committee is now reviewing the proposals for a search firm and recruiting firm we hope to have a firm on board by the by the end of the month for sure so we are on track to choosing a new superintendent in March which is where we're still heading towards that and onboarding in the spring and ready to hit the ground running on July 1st we're looking forward to a search for that willing to work closely with the board to develop a job announcement based on community input our sosg and our strategic plan and the executive committee will continue to take the lead once a firm is selected will continue to take the lead right now where we are in terms of reviewing proposals and getting that parked up but once the firm is selected the entire Board of the entire board will be engaged to discuss a plan and final timeline through selection of the

[01:37:00]
firm on board and then we'll be coming with that proposal for everybody to review where we are that but we're still on track I just wanted to remind the board that next week we have an important in-person workshop with our coach from the Council of great City School to address board Norms continue Community engagement policy died in the board work associated with superintendent search we're going to have a conversation about all those so I would encourage all of you to schedule a one-on-one time with Ashley to discuss any questions or concerns or suggestions that you might have for that that will help us your one-on-one time is important and could be helpful as you prepare for the work ahead and anticipate some reading materials from Ashley prior to the meeting so she's supposed to be sending something out on Monday September the 18th the policy committee will meet to continue its work on the governance manual policy diet which is fitting because that's going to be right after the soul Workshop will also

[01:38:00]
play get our first look at the budget policy and on Wednesday September 20th we're going to monitor goal 3 which is on post-secondary Readiness so board members watch for your email I know that the monitoring reports and the question deadline is going to be coming out really soon here so they're just we're heading up to that point where they're going to get stuff to us really early so that we have time to do that and then on September the 27th we have a finance committee I don't know I know I did send out if committee chairs if you want to add anything on any additional comments or reminders for the board members of Floors open for you right now at this point well we finally solidified that day so we'll be meeting on the 20th right for our first meeting and then hopefully we'll be able to have you know things moving forward and what our plan is for the policy perfect I know I saw that that finally got scheduled so that's good right

just briefly just to sort of forecast the rest of the anticipated policy committee priorities coming up so you mentioned that in September 13th we're going to be talking about the board Norms guard rails and the governance manual so any changes that we decide to make that have implications for board policy or procedural directive the bee policies those will then need to come forward through policy committee and subsequent meetings so assuming that there are changes that we make those will be talk discussed during our summer September 13th training and then the next policy committee meeting for which those could be on the agenda is October 2nd so it's over second meeting and then if we make changes during that committee they go to consent for the subsequent board meeting in November so those are sort of the short-term priorities for the policy video is really just addressing those be policies perfect thank you okay so let's see a movie right along the other thing that we have is we have a board candidate forum

[01:40:00]
that's also coming up and this is a reminder that this will take place here September the 25th on a Monday the district 2 forum will be from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. in The District 1 and 4 Forum will be from 6:30 to 7:30 so the the board office is also working on Gathering the information for the candidate profiles and those will be posted in the next week or so the election again is November the 7th which is just two months away so bored candidate Forum coming up also just want to do a quick reminder to the board that we're hosting we're the host for the nmsba regional meeting on October the 11th we're going to be hosting this at the Berna fossil Development Center I don't know what to call it but that's what I'm going to call it so calendar invites were sent to hold the date been talking with Johanna and our board staff in terms of some of the I didn't want to do there it's just a reminder that this is not an agenda that we have to run the assoc

[01:41:00]
but it's going to be an opportunity for us to kind of showcase some of our APS greatness so have some exciting items coming up or just in the beginning stage of that believe Johanna just got some instructions from nmsba so we'll be sharing that with the board and then it just a reminder to the board members please share your meeting absences with Johanna she will communicate with the rest of the board and also you know just please share materials resources and other information that you come across to help enhance some awareness and understanding a public school issues and concerns with all of us is bored it's really helpful I appreciate some of the deep Dives everyone else does when I don't have a chance to and I will do that so I owe everybody a penny because I have a penny in my pocket because I haven't always done that so I'm going to give each of you Penny because this is part of our mindset so there you go house that House Savannah and I got some pennies out and up on me

[01:42:00]
and then I just want to let the board know I'm not going to be in attendance at the finance committee on the 27th my daughter is getting married and I have guests arriving on that day so additionally I will be in Portland beginning October the 1st through the 6th cuz I will be MIMA in charge of my Grands so wish me luck I'm going to take him to school and everything is going to be really interesting so more than likely I will not be linking to the regular board meeting on Wednesday October 6th as well but I'm going to play that by ear we'll see how well I'm doing and that's all I have for president's report and if you have any questions I stand open for questions period I just had a quick question regarding the candidate forum and I recall from two years ago like we had very standard questions that we were asked who comes up with those questions is that something that the current board comes up with

[01:43:00]
who decides those questions you know I don't remember how those questions came up we'll have to Circle back because I don't remember we didn't write them so there was a open ask doctor all right Siri put on the community to suggest questions but I'll let her speak to it yes that's exactly what happened there was an open ass to the community the questions were gathered they were sorted so that similar questions could be asked as one so they basically came from the people who were there that night so it comes from the participants in the room correct and like them beforehand but you're saying this is like show up and you're just taking questions from from the floor that's correct being that way when I ran because it was oh you guys were on Zoom that was different so I remember when I was running in a candidate Forum we got the questions on the spot that night

[01:44:00]
so you just have to be ready for it's kind of like your stump speech got to be ready the format is each one has what 2 minutes of introduction for themselves so they have a specific amount of time at the beginning that they should be prepared for and a specific amount of time for a conclusion but all of the questions come from the audience yeah so go ahead go ahead so we've worked really hard on this model invested a lot there's some level of expectation there's a high level of expectation that these candidates again I could I mean what I would commit to do is I'll work with

[01:45:00]
so that we can have that closed as one of the questions I don't see I don't see why that couldn't be included along with what's being asked from from the audience that to me the constituents are really important because this is their candidate Forum it's really not directed by us as a board the constituents this is this is who they're going to be listening to and selecting but we could we could easily I mean I think we could we could agree or come up with a question I could share it with olive oil and maybe even by next week when we're all together we can have that question that we could all agree on that would be a good question to ask Madame President we also sent out a question to all the candidates and we didn't include sfg style question mark

[01:46:00]
we did just a reminder we did do the candidate orientation Barbara and I got to do that with the candidates and it was Heavy s o f g so we did talk about our process and where we are so we did give him an opportunity to hear the you know the context of those 2000 participants in that came to our community engagement I don't know how I recall I know Peggy we did ours at burn a fossil and the room was not full so I'm getting at the voice of those 2000 so let me think about formulating this question how

[01:47:00]
so did we just ask how did it go out to people that they should send in questions for the questions are we sent out for the individuals that show up to the candidate Forum they have the opportunity to submit what question would you like to be asked tonight it's not just send it out to the masses we've invited individuals to come to okay to come to the floor we did yes we will work with Communications to get the word up so we will send out news releases we will post it on the website and the newsletters just are usual forms of communication and it would be nice to include maybe some of the people who were at the summer

[01:48:00]
conversation with us any other questions the next Board of Education meeting will be on September 20th 2023 at 5 p.m. and the special Board of Education meeting will be held September 27th 2023 5:15 p.m. for immediately following the finance committee meeting will be held at the Allison Bruce King educational complex here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live streamed at aps.com edu and I bet you that was not transcribed really well because I didn't speak very clearly you're slowly
