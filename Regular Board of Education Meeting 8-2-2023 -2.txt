==================================================

[00:00:00]
ready to reconvene to open session the aps Board of Education met an executive session is authorized by the public meetings act section 10-15 - 185 and 1 to discuss collective bargaining strategy the matters discussed were limited to that topic so we're going to move on to the rest of our agenda and our first is well let me go here my here we go our next item is consideration for approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 and the Albuquerque teachers Federation I'm going to move first for a motion and then we'll have discussion following it to have a motion I'd like to motion to approve the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 and the Albuquerque teachers

[00:01:00]
operation of second all right so we have a motion by board member Dominguez second by board member Peterson I'll open up any discussion board member Aragon I'll just kind of go through quickly I know I already sent follow-up questions but those can be answered later so I'm just going to kind of go through things that I think that maybe need to be looked at in the future that way we're not sitting here trying to answer several more questions so about the two-year contract if it's still a management interest when the new superintendent comes in and you board members come in and about if we renegotiating existing terms if that's allowable why aren't we doing that about collection of union dues how that's not a violation of anti donation clause about management rights seems to be that a lot of them have been taken away and give them to the unions

[00:02:00]
see no that's not necessary about teachers that are being mentored just because of a lot of new teachers are afraid to speak up and they've been pushed into joining the Union by mentors or union members so making sure that that we're looking at that to ensure that there are mentors who aren't union members kind of I'm looking at Consulting teachers and how they're reporting on the principal to the principals on clients progress as it concerns a principal survey should that I should belong to management about conceptual agreements not being met and how long this can go on because this is going on for over a decade and then about the long list of family members who are included as immediate family to make sure that the taxpayers do know that they're playing employees for this long list of family members when it comes to leave and then about

[00:03:00]
what are the government entities pay their employees who are elected officials while they're away from their jobs and the cost to taxpayers for those that are earning 4% 40% of their salary while on Parental leave and I think kind of talking a little bit more about the mou use and what are the they are attached to a contract and kind of what the legal consequences are if that mou is used are not or not carried out so if some of those you know questions can be answered in those can be looked at as far as dates and recommendations not being made so many of these it's been 10 11 years 7 or 8 years and if it hasn't been carried out then or if there is a set date then those should probably expire and then I just want

[00:04:00]
ready to know that I am very supportive having been a teacher of teacher pay raises of teachers getting paid for the work they do they should not be working and not getting paid for for the work they do I'm very supportive of all the differentials I think that is wonderful and I'm very supportive of putting kids first I want the parents I want everybody to know what parents are thinking parents want to always put the kids first the unions put the Union first parents want school choice the unions don't parents want investment in teachers unions want investment and teachers unions parents want the quality of teachers most important to them instead of the Union goes above quality parents want parental rights they want knowledge about what goes on at school in every every part of their child's education the union believes in secrecy and no parental rights to anything

[00:05:00]
parents and Community believe that the best teacher should be paid more the union thinks all education is quality and everyone should get paid the same no matter if you're the best teacher around parents are very concerned about the state of education and the union thinks everything is going well and during covid parents wanted kids in schools and the union said no in-person school parents wanted kids on mass in unions made sure to keep them masks and look where we are now because of what you did or kids aren't first but the Union's just fine thank you any other comments so I will say that I am very supportive of the the pay raises for our teachers the changes to the prep time the

[00:06:00]
increase in the differentials for our Athletics support the stipends for the Bell to Bell support the PD that you guys have negotiated into this and I and I really appreciate the work that you guys have put into the negotiated agreement the time that you guys have spent where I would like to focus and my question concerns appendix day 29 the standard space teaching memorandum of understanding obviously we talked a lot about the fact that we have goals guardrails in a strategic plan and we just discussed how important it is to what our role is and how how important it is for the administration to have the ability to implement the goal

[00:07:00]
the reason that that is so important is because we did have an organizational diagnostic that was conducted where they found that only 38% of our students were receiving grade level specific curriculum my concern about this memorandum of understanding is that it doesn't have strength and action behind it and so my question is does this memorandum of understanding do you think it goes far enough to assert the management rights that you all need in order to manage the schools and the instruction programs so I believe that the district retains its management and instructional programs as well

[00:08:00]
one of the responses to a question in writing speaks to that particular issue with respect to the Common Core State Standards and where regression lines up with our strategic plan so our strategic plan and one of the Strategic initiatives most certainly speaks to riggers instruction and utilization of high quality instructional material okay so you've yes yes you said he's going to whisper in my area Okay I I am I am happy to hear that I think I still I'm just concerned that the that it's not that it's just not sufficient and so I'm happy that that has been stated I'm

[00:09:00]
it's in writing and thank you for whoever replied to that but I think that's the question I have for right now since we're doing like okay one question thing and then we'll come back sure board member Gonzales thank you madam chair I'm just going to build a little bit off of member Jackson's question cuz I think I had a nearly identical question so I won't repeat the question but I do want to say I do appreciate the new mou and I do think it's appropriate to start with teacher leadership and teacher support in the development of additional curricular materials to enable the district to meet the goals so I do support that I'm glad that it's there I look forward to more work within the district to improve instruction and I still I think like member Jackson have pretty significant concerns about the amount of detail and prescription in the contract overall as it relates to issues of instruction

[00:10:00]
which is a management right management focus and so I think that's still a significant tension that ought to be continued to be worked on over the course of future negotiations as we begin to as you begin to collectively implement this mou with the union and so I look forward to updates on how that is going as well I think that's critically important and as we've talked about over the course of the sosg work the district exists to improve student outcomes and if we have 38% of our classrooms not experiencing grade level content we are doing something wrong and so I appreciate the acknowledgment that we need to face those hard truths that we need to be courageous in implementing change and I hope that this is the first step so I'm cautiously optimistic but still have concerns about that thank you any other board member comments board member Dominguez first I want to

[00:11:00]
thank you for following for honoring the CBA process we are the fourth or fifth largest employer in the city that correct superintendent Elder yeah I think you and him and UNH maybe larger and so to all the parents who work for us just know I'm happy to hear that we appreciate the work we support you on salary my aspirational goal is to get you to a 40,000 entry level so that we're not perpetuating poverty level wages

[00:12:00]
and thank you for honoring teachers because an Educators because they are the foot soldiers and if we're going to make any changes if we're going to move forward we have to suck the tone this diet has to set the tone and we have to be appreciative and honoring they need support and I appreciate that we have the model of collective bargaining that we do that it is interested and that you handle it so well respectfully and I think it needs to continue in that vein thank you thank you another 45 seconds you know I don't want

[00:13:00]
acknowledge the two of you on what you've done you know and just securing what we wanted going forward in terms of the divisions of the goals and the guard rails of the community and holding fast to that you know I'll continue to stress that one statement that the organization and everything should be challenged and it will require change in adult behaviors and that's from everybody that's involved in this process it's not one sided it is definitely two sided and I hope the sooner we come to that understanding the sooner we start to make the steps forward of the progress that's needed so just thank you thank you to the teachers you know I think that goes without saying that's where you understand their efforts in the sacrifices that they make and obviously their passion is what brought him to this and that we need to ensure that they stay in this field they stay in our district and we continue to make sure that our students get the best support and resources that they need thank you

[00:14:00]
I think will first off thank you for the work that was done thank you to both sides because it's a huge investment of Just Energy Blood Sweat tears and everything else so thank you for the work that went into it I mean I quite frankly I have some real concerns about this contract but I don't think it was because of the doing of anyone here the the extended day is creating huge issues and I think that the negotiating teams from both sides really work to dress that in the best possible way for for the community for students for teachers but when we start talking about wanting to support teachers in elevating their practice and that means from the most Master teacher to the brand new teacher that's really struggling

[00:15:00]
if you're talking about elevating that practice which I think I've never known a teacher that didn't want to do that didn't welcome professional development didn't welcome the opportunity to grow professionally it takes time and when I look at the at this contract I really am very concerned about Bill to Bill and what the implications are going to be for actual practice because anyone has been through any kind of professional development knows that regardless of how wonderful the the professional development is if you don't have time to think about it to collaborate with colleague to figure out what it actually means for the students in front of you is a teacher it is not going to pay off so I am very happy that there's

[00:16:00]
search within the contract that's going to let problems be solved sometimes it'll be contentious sometimes it will really and truly and hopefully most of the time it will be with a problem on the table and how do we together solve it because it cannot be solved without listening to the voice of the practitioners that are actually trying to do it in the classroom it can't be solved without the district level knowing what the limitations of time and resources are and and so somehow there's got to be a path forward to make this a good year and I hope that's where we can really focus our attention right now going forward because it's going to be a hard year there's a lot of this contract that is with the best will on every side is going to be

[00:17:00]
really difficult and so the the attitude of problem solving of being in this together and of deep deep mutual respect for what everyone brings to the table it's going to be really critical so thank you for the work that's been done and we'll go forward thank you board members and again just a deep appreciation for negotiation and that process on both sides because I know having been a part of negotiating teams I know how difficult and contentious it can become but you know what I do I have a tremendous amount of faith and trust in the adults that work for our system I know that the adults that come to the system really truly care about our kids really care about our city and really want you know at the end of the day I don't think there's anybody that says gee I really want to mess this up you know everybody comes in with this with the attitude that I really want to get this right I really

[00:18:00]
I want to do what's you know what's important so that we can Elevate Elevate what's best for our students I think all of us have that as the best interest I agree with board member Peterson a difficult year because we've challenged the system in a lot of ways and but again I think the adults in our system are ready to rise to that challenge and we know it's not going to be easy and we know it's going to have some sticky points throughout the year but I have this tremendous faith in the adults that that make up are are collective together it's kind of like a family right if we don't have healthy conflict I mean if we don't have conflict and if we don't do it in a healthy way it's not it's not growth and that's part of what student outcomes focused governance is about right so about this continuous this commitment to continuous Improvement and knowing that we're not going to get it right all the time but we have to have a commitment as a collective is the as the adults that are responsible for delivering this to

[00:19:00]
play make that commitment to each other so that we can get this done so thank you so much everyone who who was on part of the negotiation on this and I'm just going to call for the vote on another item oh you have another one oh I'm sorry I thought we were a question and actually my question is for Dr Bernstein is she's not she's listed as a presenter but you're sitting back there would you like do you want to come up here I don't know you just the flowers were so I think my question for you again I'm my concerns centers around this memorandum of understanding and I heard what the management or how management responded to it so I guess it's kind of the same question to you since this was a collaborative effort with the memorandum of understanding what is your interpretation of how this will play

[00:20:00]
about like in the classroom like day to day with our students being able to get the grade level specific instruction that they need president Montoya Cordova members of the board sorry I've been talking with Dr Segura for some time about the fact that when we started to implement the common core standards we were actually a district that got a grant to do some early implementation and look at how we can shift to standard space teaching so that we can make sure that our students not only get the kind of Standards education that they need and deserve but that are teachers are able to teach deeply to the standards that they can use skills and they can use facts

[00:21:00]
service of the conceptual understanding in language arts in math and social studies and in science in the core subject areas so we did some early work and we created some Dr Segura they're called scope and sequence like a scope and sequence like how like a tool for all of the teachers to be able to use to follow it so that they have the kind of support they need to think about how you paste the standards how you teach to the standards and it has a lot of instructional materials they actually have a different name than what everybody is remembering but they were great units of study thank you so much and they were a collaborative effort between the administration and the practitioners and they worked for a very long time getting these units of study

[00:22:00]
then there were a lot of changes in personnel there are a lot of changes in leadership and there was a lot of lost Focus especially during the years when we were really focused on more than the testing outcomes then how we were actually teaching the kids so that they will test well and so what we need to do is get together we have found some of those we need to revise and update and then we need to recreate the ones that were lost and then we need to get them in the hands of teachers and so what I think we hope to do with the memo of understanding is work together so that it makes sense to teachers it has the perspective of the practitioner is this a useful tool it has the perspective of the people who are in administration who have to Super

[00:23:00]
why is the teachers and make sure that they are teaching to the standards like you're asking them to and so it's really an effort to to correct the wrong and do it in a way that it's very powerful and it's very collaborative so that we can get the right tools in the hands of the teachers as soon as possible okay thank you I appreciate it you're welcome I'm sorry and I had I had wrapped up but is there any other questions I'm sorry we're good okay so now I will call for the vote so we have motion we have a second and this is consideration for approval of the negotiated changes to negotiate a green between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 120 teachers Federation we have a boat place hey Google no Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes Crystal no

[00:24:00]
Dominguez yes Brittany Jackson know just because I think that doesn't go far enough yes I'm so motion carries all right so our next item is consideration for approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 and the communications workers of America food and nutrition services discussion action I will call for motion on this place I will move for approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 and the communications workers of America food and nutrition services this is Crystal second all right so we have a motion and we have a second is there any discussion I'll just ask the question because I always like to ask this what else do you think needs to be addressed in terms of

[00:25:00]
the needs of food and nutrition workers are there are there is there anything that's going to be open for going forward because I think I think we're all relieved that there is at least some increase and that there's there's some positive movement that where else do we need to get to to support this group of employees do you want me to answer that or would you like to hear from from the union either way or both come on I will say I think it's important for us to attract and retain employees the the folks who work in cafeteria Services work incredibly hard and they they are passionate about what they do and they they feed our children and I think that's hugely important

[00:26:00]
so the intention is to what I believe is to try to make their working conditions a little more beneficial for them a little more satisfactory obviously the number one ideas to increase their hourly rate because again I've stated this before they are the lowest demographic of employees that we have granted that they work short hours but doesn't take away the fact that they work as hard as they do with in the short time for that they have to accomplish their goals which is to feed the children so I just we just want to make every intention that we can and every opportunity that we can to improve their conditions and better work in environment with their co-workers management and their rate of pay obviously most of all thank you so much for the work and the group that you represent I

[00:27:00]
I always tell the story that when I started school my mom was working as a cafeteria worker she did that so that she could be close to us but it was so cool cuz I remember walking through that line and I would see my mom I would see my Aunt Sophie I would see my aunt Danny so they were all responsible for her feeding us there at Kit Carson Elementary so and and and and they were just it was a joy you know to walk because I just always remember coming through that line and you know being really excited to to see my family there and I think that's what happens because a lot of our food service workers specially on that front line also know what's happening with our students I mean they are a trusted adult and oftentimes are very important trusted adult that a child might go to First about a concern so thank you so much for the for the work and and working on behalf of the group thank you any other discussion I'm going to call for the vote on this please

[00:28:00]
Eddie Miller air gun yes Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes we still talk to you right now yes Pasadena Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes yes so our next item is consideration for approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiate agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 and the communication workers of America maintenance and operations may have emotion on this place I'll move for approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 in the communication workers of America maintenance and operations all second this is Courtney okay so we have emotion we have any discussion do we have a representative from the union for this one you're still the same person so yeah you're a busy guy so I think going back to the same question that board member Peterson asked in terms of

[00:29:00]
what are some things that we need to consider as we're moving forward for this particular group as well so this group is is an acid and a value valuable group to our our district here and the intent with this particular group is to ensure that we can keep them around because we have lost so many individuals employees in certain departments where we were in I'll use HVAC for example we had 50 employees working for the Albuquerque Public Schools in the HVAC department and we have trickled down to maybe 10 or 12:00 and we have unfortunately we have about 90% of our HVAC that is being contracted out where the district is spending numerous amount dollar amounts in regards to how they are using that the contractors to fulfill what

[00:30:00]
what we believe our employees should be doing another concern in regards to using contractors is there's no vested interest when you have employees of the district who see the needs and know the schools in the familiar with these things where they take pride in the work is is the way that we like to look at it as opposed to just someone who's coming into do a task and then be on the way there's numerous other issues that we've had with contractors that we've seen from our perspective that I could sit here and tell you all day but you know I don't I don't think you want to we would just like to grow our group yeah so what I'm curious what would that look like and what is it going to take to grow or bring back those 40 it would

[00:31:00]
it would take assistance from the the team here and the district to make those spots available to fund those positions that we have lost because once those positions have been dissolved it's almost impossible to get them back and we would love to get them back so if we can work collaborative to collaboratively to ensure that we can get that done the funny thing is the issue there and and I think that if we can move that around some way somehow and rather take that from the contractors and we can learn to maybe move that money around to create positions within the district that would be ideal so they're leaving to work for contractors so here we have a starting rate for an HVAC Tech who can make what we just added to the hard to feel position was like 24 and some change 24

[00:32:00]
2497 and outside in the district they're starting at 3335 an hour so we have APS employees in the HVAC department who are leaving because they can go get more money in a private sector and that's hurting us and it still continues to hinder us and to be a hindrance to this day because we still have HVAC text who are losing and that's not just HVAC that's just an example where plumbers and electricians who are actually doing the same in all different crafts and it's vital for us to keep our people so that way we can continue to keep these departments successful and operating okay any other discussion questions thank you so much for the work that you're doing on behalf of both of your groups there I really appreciate your relationship there so I'm going to call for the vote on this and give me yes Danielle Gonzales yeah a Peterson yes

[00:33:00]
