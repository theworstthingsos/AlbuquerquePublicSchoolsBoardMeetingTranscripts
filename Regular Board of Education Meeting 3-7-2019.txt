do I have a motion in a second for the adoption of the March 7th 2018 Board of Education meeting agenda and approval of the February 21st 2018 Board of Education meeting minutes thank you it's been moved and seconded all in favor please say I was supposed the next agenda item is the discussion of the officer and committee chair elections so nominations and elections of board officers for president vice president secretary and committee chairs will be conducted tonight happens every year tonight's the night we will begin with the nominations and election of board officers and then follow with

[00:18:00]
action of committee chairs the term of office for all officers and chairs shall be one year officers and chairs may serve successive terms of office at this time I will give each board member a few moments to speak about your particular interest in specific board positions and committees you may have an opportunity before voting for each position to speak about why you want that position it is simply a chance to share which positions you would or would not be interested in full stop learning opportunity for me

[00:19:00]
learning that I need to do as we move forward and potentially if I'm on this board you know I would certainly love to look at other positions but I think at this time I'm really quite content with being the secretary for the board thank you that that decision was already kind of kind of made even though we're not supposed to really have that kind of a rolling I've been told that it does happen and so I know I haven't spoken to anybody about what position I I want I've been in the same position for a while I think it's important to to try different things though I've been told often that my worldview is

[00:20:00]
is very different from everyone else is on the board and My Views are different and so I just want to kind of tell some of the new people on the board what has kind of shaped my view cuz I know it is different than most people's and maybe that'll give you a window into what you think I'm capable of doing first of course my view was shaped by my parents who you all know I think that spoke another language besides English who didn't have a college education just got out of high school but hell jobs my dad for 57 years caring member of the carpenters union and my mom for over 30 years and then my dad started his own business and it was also seen my worldview seen through being a Hispanic female growing up in a time when a lot of power and still when I look we still haven't really caught up as much as

[00:21:00]
will you try to pretend like we like we have we have two US senators who are males white males we have a congressman who's a white male we have a male Hispanic Congressman we have a white male mayor we have one female Hispanic congresswoman thank goodness for that we have a female Hispanic Governor my dear friend Governor Martinez and now all little girls can say I can be a governor and I can be a congresswoman and this all happens in a state where we're a minority majority state with pretty much equal numbers of males and females my worldview as many of you know was shaped by living in zip code 87105 and a three bedroom house across the street from the projects I saw my world through education at John Adams and West Mesa and then UNM my worldview was shaped by grandparents who loved me dearly who only spoke

[00:22:00]
what language and who worked hard in the fields and beyond that it was also my view of the world was shaped by two parents who gave me an abundance of love and also told me that hard work was really important and the fantasy and not not not not not not a fact not a fan it was a fact and not a fantasy that nothing was ever going to ever get given to me and that I had to learn to be a giver in this world and not a taker or else my spirit would have been broken I lived in a world where I was taught to love my country that I love so much and my dad was in the military so he taught me I'm an American first I'm Spanish second I lived in a world where girls rules we only were there were three girls in our family and we were beautiful and

[00:23:00]
and we could be anyone or anything if we worked hard we used our talents because everyone I was told was good at something I still live in that world with three daughters and I believe in the power of girls my worldview was also shaped by being told that I had to make my own success and to not let myself be a victim though like many females I too have been victimized in many ways including at 8:00 p.m. my worldview I still think mirrors some people hopefully in the audience and maybe a little bit on the board but I've chosen to rise above my circumstances and people always say you have such disadvantages but I've chosen to not look at it that way and call them advantages instead my view of the world isn't about clipping someone's Wings about taking away their spirit it's not about keeping

[00:24:00]
people poor and un or under educated and just giving them enough to survive but not enough to to live on so they stay dependent that's not the world I was raised in it's not on my parents gave me and it's not what I Aspire other people to to live by and so today I just say anybody can nominate me or tell me what position they think I'm capable of holding and you can be assured that the promise I made three years ago for those of you that were here that I said my service on the board was going to be to honor my daughter who I lost three years and 48 days ago she saw the good and she saw the promise and The Talented everyone and I have told you I know I'll never be that person but I'm trying and I'm trying for you to see for those of you who didn't know her who she was and see that

[00:25:00]
leaf and herself her belief in me her Joy her love her extraordinary goodness and kindness and gentleness and that promise that I may keeps me often times when I'm the only vote against something or I'm the only one for something it keeps me going and keeps me from being discouraged because her love and the love of my other two daughters and my husband and my mom and my dad and my sisters what they have for me is bigger than anyone's dislike for me or just like for what I stand for so if anyone thinks that you know I shouldn't have a certain position and if you think that that's going to make me have a bad day trust me it's not cuz I've had the worst day of my life in January of 2015 so I'll continue doing the best in whatever position I have I'll continue having the children

[00:26:00]
they're my heart I will believe in them and I will care for them and advocate for them and whatever position you decide I should should have thank you Mr Garcia thank you the things that I had to learn different included things like hearing other people's point of view and not necessarily making assumptions either or doing the time that they were speaking so it's

[00:27:00]
an opportunity to grow my my life has changed a bit my wife had a rare spinal stroke on Christmas morning and we've been figuring out how to help her recover and she's made some progress I don't know to what extent she'll be able to recover her abilities that we all take for granted but I'm hopeful that it will continue So based on that and my role as a husband and caregiver I have limited options I think I like being vice president of the board I just think that you know Dr Percy has done an incredible job and that's a heck of a place for everyone but my hope is that I can continue in this role I see myself

[00:28:00]
someone who can bring together different perspectives and hopefully come to a conclusion that will be fresh in the solutions that we offer as policy as decisions we make about the district and so that's where I'm coming from thank you thank you Miss Peterson Construction I feel like it's a place where my heart is in terms of what are we doing with children in the classroom and how do we structure in the classroom and right now

[00:29:00]
in terms of division of the district I am so excited about the approach we've taken with the MRI schools I think it's a real vision for where the whole District can go and I'm really excited about looking at what do we need to do structurally to make sure that we can Implement that approach and that vision for children thank you Miss Patterson engagement committee has really changed and you know I've been able to work with our staff really well

[00:30:00]
and it's something that I look forward to doing and I think we have some great things coming up in the next year and so this is something I like to do and I also represent our district really well in terms of who I am I am black I'm Latina I am Native American and I'm German and I really represent who are who are you know I really represent our district overall and I think that's I mean at speaks to who we are in this community and so I think I would like to continue as the equity and engagement committee chair if there are other positions that you know you feel that maybe I would do that let me know but this is a position that I would like to continue

[00:31:00]
property and Technology committee was was incredibly interesting but because of the guidance of Scott Helder and casino and the rest of the board I've really had an opportunity of the last year to learn more about design Development and Construction and it's really laid the groundwork for me to truly understand what our Capital master plan is all about and I would like to continue that and I'm incredibly interested in staying on the capital outlay property and Technology committee thank you thank you thank you everybody one of the things I think could have been impressed with this board about is that everybody has been exceptionally good at what they do and it's not just the committee's I think we made great progress the last couple years we

[00:32:00]
I think we're out of the paper most of the time in terms of bad things were in the paper in terms of good things I think what we're doing with like Barbara said the MRI stuff the budget stuff that Peggy does so well in terms of the finance I'm extremely extremely pleased with this board and and I'm humbled to be be the president I would like to be the president again but you know again I think my role as being simply a board member and I think being present is kind of more like a good manager and that is you get all the good people around you and you let him do this now I think I'm lucky to have such a fine group of people

[00:33:00]
I certainly would would be pleased to be your present again at least this is going to be a tough Year by the way this is going to be an interesting year for elections it's going to be an interesting year in terms of what we have to do in terms of you know the HB 98 being passed and how we deal with that I think we really need to dress that as a board and hopefully I think again you know being here for a while we can have that leadership to make a good decision on what we're doing there so with that that's kind of my thought on it thank you thank you and so before I asked for nominations from the floor for the positions of for the position of President we need to establish the boards will for the process first how you want to take the vote either by voice or roll call the method does not have to be the same for each office in committee chairs do I have a motion

[00:34:00]
Voice or roll call voicemail is there any discussion okay so we will now take a vote by roll call if there's no objection Miss Davis Elizabeth

[00:35:00]
okay so it looks like we're going to go with roll call and if there is one person nominated for a physician I'm sorry and if there is more than one person nominated for a position would you like to give each nominee 2 minutes to speak in order that they met in the order that they were nominated as to why they would like the position know so I have a motion that we do not allow for two minutes for the election of officers the first officer position to be filled as president and the duties of the president include the one presides at board meetings

[00:36:00]
I'm bored discussions to ensures agenda preparation for each meeting 3 signs contracts resolutions and other documents and for Approved board business that represents consensus of the board nominations are now in order for the office of President so do I have any nominations is nominated and seconded are there any further nominations for the office of President nominations for president so the people who have been nominated or actually the person who has been nominated will be giving well I guess you won't be giving too minutes

[00:37:00]
yes Muller Aragon Lorenzo Garcia yes Barbara Peterson yes Candelaria Patterson yes Elizabeth Armijo Dr David Piercy yes yes the president of the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education and I reluctantly and the meeting I listened carefully to all of you all in particular

[00:38:00]
I can shorten this or you guys can shorten this considerably because all of you pretty much indicated the positions you would like to be Peggy had you know would be wherever she wanted to be so what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow if the board wishes to do that to allow a motion to have a slate of all the people who are in the current positions is that in fact is where you had indicated and if we take a roll call Vonage unanimous to do it that way then we'll do it that way if it's not unanimous then I'm going to go through every single position because I think that's important for everybody to have an opportunity to be nominated for something else if they even sometimes you don't say that you really would like to be that even though in reality you might like to be so I will open it up for the possibility of emotion to to have the slate and nominated in the sense that you all indicate the position you're in that would be

[00:39:00]
vice president Garcia a secret Yolanda Montoya find Finance for Katie that's where you are now pay the policy for for Barbara District engagement for candy and also the capital of and then the audit chair would be the vice president Larry if I have a motion for that in a second week of every single position okay so if we if we feel that way so if I have a motion for that we can shorten this and if it passes that's fine that's fine

[00:40:00]
do I have a second on that second okay I'll take a roll call vote on that please Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes Peggy Mueller Oregon Lorenzo Garcia yes Barbara Peterson Candelaria Patterson Avenue so the first position is the vice president's position and do I have the I have a script so we have a vice president and the vice president's position by the president besides during board member discussion debates when the

[00:41:00]
active engaged in the discussion or debate in absence of the secretary signs are caused to be signed all resolution contracts and other instruments and documents authorized by the board and when the secretary signature is required a performance other duties is delegated by the president and nominations are now in order for the office of vice president and I might also mention signs for the president when the president is not there has been done recently so the nominations OK Google

[00:42:00]
which is okay so with that what we will do is take a roll call vote on the two people that have been nominated and so I would call for a roll call vote on that please Yolanda Montoya Cordova so just to be clear I have to say the individual hey Google

[00:43:00]
nominations for secretary secretary position see if I can find what we do presides the board meetings in the presence of vice president's absence recognizes award recipients is responsible for conducting the public forum segment of the board meeting signs contracts resolutions and other documents as authorized by the board and ensures that board documents and minutes are maintained forms other duties as delegated by the president nominations OK Google

[00:44:00]
committees and the agenda has the committees as being in reverse order which I have often asked for in like a graduation you know where it's always a to z and the Posies are always at the end and sit in the back I'd like to have it someday where the disease are in the front row and you go back to the A's and they call them up and see today so we're going to do it from the policy down and that's the agenda and so we were going to do it that order so I will open nominations for the policy chair and let me see if I can actually read what the order is here we have actually five district engagement was originally in

[00:45:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:46:00]
no other nominations we will elect Peggy Miller organisms our financial thank you Peggy I will go on to Capital outlay nominations are open for Capital Outlet Elizabeth

[00:47:00]
what's the accurate engagement has been a committee that has taken on a new life not a new life but it certainly an expanded life with with candy so Northern nominations because there's no one else here cuz you're awesome

[00:48:00]
I'm done with the nominations and we'll go on to the rest of the agenda well let me let me talk about one other thing yeah yeah one other thing I want to talk about is the planning dates for the actual meetings tell you the truth I can't even tell you when our meetings are very well I just look at the calendar and if it's a meeting I go but I think in general that the meetings have a regular meetings have been certainly first and third Wednesday's that's pretty chairs have the opportunity to set their meetings whenever they need to but with respect to people who have to work with respect to timing and that kind of thing is really a questionable meeting at 7:30 in the morning whenever we really need them but typically maybe Monday or Friday

[00:49:00]
the district Equity engagement meeting is like the third Wednesday is that right can of fourth Wednesday 4th last Wednesday of the month 4th Wednesday and that's usually at 5:00 and you're welcome I guess to do that I think what we need to have a little discussion as the are there really conflicts how do I know some of you actually work you know some of you work some of you work really hard drive in the future if it's if it's okay with all the chairs

[00:50:00]
Finance typically go together it's like on the what the first Tuesday or second Tuesday of the of the month is that right now Monday at 3 cuz I know okay Monday at 3:00 and you do it you do it at 7:30 in the morning okay okay okay for you I mean I don't know you landed the meeting or I'm going to be

[00:51:00]
playing off the freeway somewhere it would be nice if they were at 4:00 I could definitely do four but three is difficult so far I've been able to you know to do what I can call in is always always always an option you know and I and I think that's certainly acceptable you know for everybody that I did that is to be respectful of stuff and you know one of the things I think I'd like to talk with with the superintendent how many staff really do need to be at our meeting I've been kind of keeping track of that a little and you know it's anywhere from 1820 people every meeting a couple hours and that's a lot of stuff time and so if there's a way that weak as a board can be more respect

[00:52:00]
full of the staff and and make sure that they understand that we're not you know if you're if you're not there it's fine with us probably and we'll have a follow-up if we need to follow up you know but yes yes from the public things that are discussed that I think are important to hear and and that's true in the community but but I really want to be respectful of the staff because it's a huge amount of time that you guys have to spend and it's not like you get extra hours a week with the board but and I'm really happy by the way with all the Committees in terms of what you're doing with meeting with your staff people making sure you get

[00:53:00]
I've come by and every time I turn around you guys are meeting with your people and so I want to compliment the board in the staff with meeting and setting those things up I think that's been a really really positive thing and probably I was just talking with Yolanda a little bit and I think that that Lorenzo myself and Yolanda need to meet with the superintendent a little bit more about the the board meeting our regular board meetings and work with the board in terms of do we need some items on our regular board meeting that we need to have some special issues special

[00:54:00]
so so just to give you a perspective of that as well you have some candy I apologize I think she's responsible for actually making the district engagement committee really what it is today she has really worked really hard to make it what it is and I think we really need to thank her and her staff for doing such a great job on Saturday

[00:55:00]
and I always love to play with me let me play you know it's fine my music people are fantastic people but here's here's Madeline shows up and I said oh yeah it's Madeline going to do you know is she playing the instrument was she dances pretty nice I know that she did a little dance in there but here she is giving the Spanish version of all the stuff you're talking about I said yeah that's right cuz I'll bet you 70% of that audience at least at least 70% maybe more thank you very much for that I think it was a great addition to 240

[00:56:00]
play the smoothness of our committees are hugely due to the hard work of Staff people I mean Jermaine and Richard I can't thank you enough not to mention Brenda and or Christy or Kathy for always being there cuz they they come and then I say what about this and what about this and it seems like to me right now

[00:57:00]
but it's not based on on people not working hard so I just I really want to thank the staff people for the job that they do I agree you know I've been so impressed with everybody and board services staff with all of our staff are committees and I didn't realize when I came on the board I actually had somebody who would do something for me you know I was a distinguished scientist I never had anybody do anything for me it was just do it yourself don't I'm very impressed with you guys thank you very much so you know just the smoothness of the transition coming on has been incredible

[00:58:00]
it's been it's been helpful to spend some time with you individually and get to be up to speed but I really truly appreciate the quickness of trying to bring me up to speed and the opportunities to meet with individuals and I will say is like anytime I've had a question or I've had you know I'm still trying to I'm still trying to get myself up to speed I don't think four months is enough to learn all of that needs to be done with this but it's been it's really been a really good experience and it's been very smooth and I've been really impressed with the amount of resources that we have and the talent of everybody that you just have access to to help me get to to figure out what the heck I'm doing because you have the time I still like going what's going on but it's been good so thank you you really

[00:59:00]
contributed a lot to us in just this 4 months and I look forward to a lot more of that contribution to and so yeah any other comments from the board members I think again the message we're getting for you Brandeis that I think the times are probably pretty much the same for all of our committee meetings so that maybe can help you in terms of getting the future with that we'll go ahead with the public forum do we have a public forum and I'll turn that over to our secretary near me to consider provide information or just to see how the Board of Education board of education is established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting in public forum upon signing into speak

[01:00:00]
tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outlines those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will force these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting tonight we have a couple of speakers there for to accommodate everybody will have it looks like we have 2 minutes 2 minutes within the 30-minute public forum the timer remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield or your unused time to another speaker you're always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you're unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with him the time allotted for public forum the Board of Education encourages to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn and only at this time of your concerns be addressed at the direct the discretion of each board member so our first speaker is guys always help me with writing here

[01:01:00]
you were super super wanted to share with you emotion that was passed by the union representative said our meeting last night I think it connects with the motion that you're considering from the Council of great City Schools this is a motion that was passed unanimously and I want to point out the back of the paper I took a screenshot of a meme

[01:02:00]
that was written by Mary Catherine Ricker when she was president of Saint Paul teachers Federation she's now the vice president of the American Federation of teachers when she was just in town for the NAB a conference and I was telling her how I captured her meme that had been going around Facebook and she said you know I wrote that 5 years ago after Sandy Hook when I explained that to the federal reps last night period And I want to let you know how much support this motion has it basically says that as a teacher's Union we will support in any way we can the three dates that are coming up March 14th which is a day that students have organised 17 minutes of Science in honor of the 17 people who had been murdered in the last mass shooting then

[01:03:00]
there's another one organized at tigua Park on the 24th of March and then the teachers unions along with npe and bats have organized on the anniversary of Columbine something on April 20th and will let you know what that is I don't think we're going to try to walk out like the kids of organized that's not what we're going to try to do what we are going to do something District wide and we wanted to let you know that we have encouraged everybody to help the kids the high school reps met after we passed this motion and all of the Reps that were there said that they had heard shared that students had shared with them and almost every High School in the city that students were planning something I think one minute school teacher said students were planning something we had a long conversation about the role of teachers in supporting students

[01:04:00]
when they're choosing to act which is very different than teachers choosing to ask students to ask to act and so their focus as High School Union reps was on supporting the students to keep them safe to make sure that they had a way to have adult guidance during the time when they're marching out and to make sure that students had a way to abstain if they chose to so just wanted to let you know what's going on with the teachers in the district thank you our next speaker is Tom Benton good evening

[01:05:00]
public forum is the safety of our children and I think we're all in this room with what's happened lately is kind of put that to the Forefront however it's my fear that the proposed resolution seems to craft the district's official position in regards to our safety of our children while on campus as well as if you read the resolution without adequate as it stands can be construed as devices and quite possibly project into a more position rather than that of one of based in practices I believe the end state is that position of practicality to where we have viable and workable solutions for our children's safety good intentions and well wishes and

[01:06:00]
play things on paper only go so far I know what there's a budget out there for security and safety and I know you folks are figuring out what to do with that budget I just think we as the public is parents of these children need to have a voice and how we protect our campuses for our children and I'm afraid that the resolution is now would probably divide us more than the bringing us together to try to find the solutions thank you for that include that concludes the public forum thank you Google for congratulations for your

[01:07:00]
your job without your support and encouragement and we thank you every single day thank you for being there for us we started a social media campaign called a day in school that ran during the legislative session the goal was to remind lawmakers who fund and legislate public education of the important work that we do but really it was so much more than that and it was beyond successful we now have more than 90 of our schools on Twitter not to mention principals teachers coaches parents and one superintendent yes I am not I am now a Twitter actually a Twitter I like that better it has a better ring to it and you can follow me at s u p t capital A B Q schools and I think there might be an exclamation mark behind that

[01:08:00]
as of now more than 5,200 tweets have been shared using the day a day in school hashtag and they just keep coming I encourage you to follow along as as if you have are not already following you will be inspired by the positive energetic messages and photos that are being shared We Gather just a few of them and put them in a slideshow and let's watch for the first few minutes

so we're very excited about the fact that ped has approved the proposal for curriculum and instruction and the new and aspiring principal Support Program also known as naps they don't nap but it's the name to co-host the offered this for us to co-host the second annual summer principal Institute conference or siphon will be held on May 31st and June 1st in Hotel Albuquerque and you are invited to attend it was a great success last summer and obviously p e d thought so too because they gave us this grant to continue it very well the focus of zipcon will be the school culture that will be on day one with an emphasis on improving instruction through an understanding of the Common Core State Standards on YouTube

[01:13:00]
conditioners who are experiencing success engaging their teachers in the study of an implementation of the Common Core Curriculum to plant high quality lessons for students were really looking forward to this they gave us a nice time frame for us to plan and if you can please put it put that in your calendar so going on with teaching teaching is a profession that requires intensive preparation and support and the single most important in school factor for students achievement is teacher quality despite this most teacher candidates in the United States still graduate from programs that provide on average only 16 weeks of clinical practice before certification and it's very telling the research is clear aspiring

[01:14:00]
pictures need more support and they need longer time in the classroom to address this issue the University of New Mexico College of Education is partnering with the Albuquerque Public Schools and the Albuquerque teachers Federation with support from the national Center for Teacher residencies to create the Albuquerque teacher residency partnership has a nice ring to it we were awarded a $500,000 grant for seed money to start this and we will be starting at next year each teacher resident in the program will receive intensive mentoring from a master teacher in an APS classroom while earning a New Mexico teaching license and if desired completing a master's degree wonderful opportunities for folks that want to go into the field during their program aspiring teachers complete a

[01:15:00]
play long residency in a high need APS school we stressed high knee because we want to make sure that our new staff our new teachers are prepared and know how to work with with the populations that are in the schools these schools are it will start at Highland High School Van Buren middle school and Emerson Elementary School all teacher residents will receive annual stipends of 14,000 to support their studies graduates from the Albuquerque teacher residency partnership will have the skills necessary to take the Helm of their own classrooms thanks to the Intensive and of course with our teachers union and people I hear are already asking about and thinking of applying

[01:16:00]
that's great news I know you remember Miss Frances Frost who's the family engagement ambassador from the United States Department of Education she came to APS for a site visit at the end of November you remember her when she presented to the board's District equity and engagement committee she informed us about a teacher to lead family engagement Team Summit that would be happening in March in Baltimore of the US Department of Education and Association for supervision and curriculum development teacher's the world in which teachers are valued as the foremost experts in construction and as such our leaders in informing developing and implementing education policy and practice

[01:17:00]
what is systematic Improvement to benefit student learning participation in the Summit is through a very competitive application process the family engagement collaborative led by Dr Selena marmol Dr Muir Miss Everhart and Miss compost apply to be part of the summit and with more with more than 100 teams applying and only 15 selected aps's family engagement collaborative was successful on March 11th March 9th through the 11th of July from APS will be attending the first ever teach to leave family engagement APS Indian education

[01:18:00]
current advisory committee and Selena Thao Community Schools coordinator Van Buren Middle School the aps team will focus on how to develop and effectively use and sustain the aps family engagement collaborative the parent advisory committee to better and and the parent advisory committee to better link teachers and families with a strong focus on underrepresented populations were all looking forward to seeing the plan that the team comes back with in the information that they can share with us parent engagement is a very important component of our academic master plan and as you can see we really are trying our best in moving forward to make sure that we have Cutting Edge information the aps attendance Grant was featured in the ascd smart brief through an article in the report which was titled

[01:19:00]
when's can't learn if they don't show up at school the article featured staff from the family and community supports Division and Alamosa Elementary School it highlighted how APS is addressing chronic absenteeism in an effort to improve student learning by collaborating with outside organizations in this case it's with Mission graduate so finally I want to give a shout out to the students of Coronado Elementary Truman Middle School in Westminster High School who spoke about the bilingual seal at last at last week's meeting it is always an inspiration to see students so articulate and engaged in their learning experiences so there's a little slideshow with a few pictures that will show you during the shout-out I think you've been watching it all along

[01:20:00]

[01:21:00]
with that and see if we would be willing to have an alliance with them on this we also have a a version of this from the San Antonio Independent School District that I kind of liked I liked a lot of their particularly the first paragraph you know where they talked about it being an alliance with that and then they added their own their own name at the towards in some of the things in terms of the of the resolutions instead of saying consecrate City schools in San Antonio independent industry so there are a couple of things that might be different and then you have kind of a initial draft with a few things and we added a couple of our own schools here because we've had some shooting in particular and so they were a couple things here so I was interested in our I wasn't sure if it was this resolution that you were concerned about whether it was the teacher's resolution that they have

[01:22:00]
but I wasn't sure which one of these that you maybe had a concern with it was one of the great Kansas City schools is that is that it cuz you want to make sure that we're clear on which which resolution we're talking about okay so the question I guess is is open up for more discussion I think what I would like to see from the actual had in terms of having an APS thing at the top having that introductory paragraph more like theirs and then putting our own Aztec in Roswell in here and then towards the end where it says now that the San Antonio Independent School District 8 3 5

[01:23:00]
resolution that I have in mind in terms of just supporting the consecrated schools now the question is do we really want to do that is there something different that people would like to do and and what I'm recognizing relative to the teachers resolution is simply the teachers are really saying look we're just going to help support the students and what they're doing and not necessarily that they're going to do anything there himself necessarily other than helping support the students and I think what superintendent and which was I think misinterpreted by KRQE today the truth is that the superintendent saying hey we support that as well but we want to be safe guys if we have 85,000 students out of the street were in trouble so please please please please be careful because he is really really important so there may be other ways to do that there may be other ways to describe how you want to do this discussion of what it is that's the issue is another question the point being is having

[01:24:00]
intelligent discussions about what it is is really an important thing to do so you can do that without necessarily having to put yourself in danger someplace so be careful and we're going to have our SOS help out we'll have our teachers help out but we want to be safe in what we're doing here okay so the demonstration part there and the resolution you have is more in relationship to the kind of plan demonstrations and let's be careful and make sure that we do support the students in their in their objections because in fact that's important that's an important part of the process as we go through but we don't want anybody getting hurt we don't want anybody you know it's really easy when you're getting kind of of a large group together and their Milling around or doing whatever to have a problem so we want to make sure that that we have some organization to that maybe that we have it kind of planned out better and so that we make sure our students are safe the resolution for the great City Schools is more kind of more to the federal kind of a level in the sense of

[01:25:00]
can we please understand how it is that we can make our schools safer and let's see if we can take some real action on that instead of I mean we got a lot of resolutions out here right got a lot of talk but we don't have a lot to do and so the question is is are we going to really do something that really does help our schools be safer that's really the question and some of the some of the the budget information that we're getting you know in terms of school security and that that may help us if we do a really good job of understanding what it is we're trying to actually protect you know our campuses are totally open basically it's very very difficult unless you put a dead gun chain fence around it and monitors and everything else to really say we can't get on our campus we can't get on our campus almost anybody can get on our campus it's very easy to do and even if you put a lock on the door and you put a cart thing on it you can shoot yourself right through that that that that that door so it's almost impossible for us to

[01:26:00]
pure 100% that you going to have the kids safe in general right so the question is what are we really do and what are some of the root causes and how do we try to address some of those root causes and that's really I think what we're trying to go nationally in terms of the complaints and the issues we're dealing with now whether the resolution directly does that or whether it has some issues that are not going to really solve the problem that may be true that may be true you know I've done some of this and you know but I'll let the board kind of talk here about this issue a little bit and see where we are on it I don't want to go forever on it but you know the question is is basically is do we want to have a resolution is a little bit more like the San Antonio one are there anything in that if we had the San Antonio version kind of with our own stuff in it is there anything in there in terms of the resolution

[01:27:00]
I think that's appropriate or do it would change it a little bit that kind of an issue or do we not want to have an adult you know I mean that's also a possibility so at the end of whatever we discuss the question is going to be do we really want a resolution this kind of like the San Antonio on with our own APS on it with adding Aztec and Roswell kind of thing or doing that cuz that's really what we have to discuss now if we want something totally different I think that's something that might be a discussion for another board meeting in other words I don't want to have a school and try to create our own little thing that's very different okay so we can talk about all those issues but I'm going to start down here with with Yolanda let you give us a thought we just work our way down this way you have any thoughts the resolution is important because it does it helps to just communicate kind of our values around

[01:28:00]
on this our thoughts around it the areas that when I was looking at the resolution where I felt and maybe it's speaking to the gentleman who who spoke to us is really is just the lack of reference to like parents and communities as part of this solution that it's also done in you know that the schools are working because you know we say that the school board should explore all options like how do we reference that part to so that we can just make sure we're being inclusive and that we're looking at a way to say that yes it's part of our I understand the need for it I understand the importance of saying something because we do have a lot of families that are really concerned about what is the position of our district around this issue

[01:29:00]
I've heard that from some parents where you know what is what is the what is aps's position on this what are they thinking about it where are we headed what are we planning to do because I think it is heightened up there I like the concept of a resolution because we're also sort of locking arms if you will with other schools that are also concerned about these issues in it sort of puts us in that place with other with other entities I just simply want ours to make sure that it's all inclusive that you know that it also resonates with the community that we serve our parents are children and our communities that they somehow feel that they're part of that resolution that we're making and we're not just making a resolution that's coming to us from the feds and we're just that was the only thing that was missing for me just to follow up is the implementation

[01:30:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:31:00]
I had just kind of going to work I think that this is just something that I had put together with Community people kind of speaking to what I think Mr Benton was kind of talking about his trying to be exclusive so that's something completely different than what we're looking at them the consulate City Schools one or the San Antonio Texas that's why I wanted to say if we want to create our own maybe this is something that we might work on that might be our own phone something more specific to to us or whatever but that's why

[01:32:00]
I want to say since this isn't really on the topic here the only one that's really on the topic is the consecrate City Schools what we're doing so I want to make sure that's clear yeah yes see if I could find some when you spoke of San Antonio we were headed this one that says resolution

[01:33:00]
the other one is the one that says s a i s d on the front which is the San Antonio one and the third one is kind of a draft of ours and that's what we're kind of trying to work towards is the draft of ours was just a slight slight update to the San Antonio one okay now there's if you really just take the San Antonio one and put Albuquerque Public Schools San Antonio Texas to recognize the fact that we are very personally involved in this issue that would be kind of the resolution in general okay

[01:34:00]
Define where there could be objectionable language and I couldn't tell which one which phrase you might have been speaking about so if you could share that that'll help me to make a better decision

[01:35:00]
tell me about you know language within the resolution that could potentially go to the whole constitutional side of things should the school district we use members of the school district should we get involved in that in a resolution or should we just draft our own resolution with things that we can enact here locally versus projecting back to the federal side saying hey this is something for you I would rather concentrate on things that we can actually in a resolution versus it sounds to me like you're referring to the Second Amendment it would be helpful when you share your comments that you'd be specifically you know honestly when you said that you want to take it first when you when you said that the community needs to be involved I have to not to judge you but to basically say you know I wasn't elected by a majority of the

[01:36:00]
the members in my district who voted which was about 65% of the population so I think I have a pretty good read on my communities perspectives and they are varied on this issue in particular but I think I have a pretty good read so I just want you to know I want to step back a little bit and say slow down a minute here what you're saying is important don't get me wrong with anyone comes to us with as a concern is important but what's important is I would hope that you can understand and respect our process as elected officials on the board and I would agree with Dr Percy that I think we need to find a way because we have a philosophy that we have tried to implement throughout many of our schools if not all of them it's the

[01:37:00]
idea that we have Community Schools so that parents and family members and community members could be active in their schools to help our schools be successful and perhaps this is a topic that we can bring to our community and ask them to share with us what they think not to again try to override or create a partisan dialogue but to actually hear what parents have to say I think that's absolutely the dangers are our children and there's one item in that resolution which I really like it actually mentioned suicide I mean that is to me that leading danger to our kids and for that resolution to actually that's a great thing there are many great things within that document

[01:38:00]
that we can capitalize on and expand but there are some things and I'm saying that just kind of cloud the water and if we would just and I agree with that you know my daughter's middle name went upstairs and shot himself killed himself if you last year it was 10 years old you know this is terrible what are the reasonable steps that we could take could we require and ask if the legislature and federal government set in motion something that requires all gone owners to have gun locks on their weapons I think that's a reasonable solution but for whatever so I think there are opportunities to be creative and come up with something that we can all rally around I do not support Army teachers I think that's wrong I think that's done but I don't think that a teacher should be armed simply

[01:39:00]
because you create the opportunity for more accidents and More Death now we can argue about that and I don't want to I mean there's I mean when you gentlemen and ladies discuss like the openness of our campuses and things like that those are I think things that we can all agree upon that we have some true we have holes in our security as far as you know I was I was taking my daughter off at an appointment the other day and this is the gentleman sure enough took my pink slip up there and you know did what he was supposed to do to account for my child's whereabouts but just as he was doing that in my rearview mirror I see a kid cutting across campus and cutting up that the high school kids going to be able to get on that either

[01:40:00]
phase of the knucklehead face and then I would have preferred for him to do I would have loved him to do other things that make a student successful but he had things he was trying to figure out and work out so I want you to know I hear you I'd like to include you I'd like you to be a part of what we're figuring out and help us help us get the word out and I will sir I IUD you for actually bringing this to the Forefront and in that resolution trust me but I was able to get your page period thank you thank you thank you appreciate that

[01:41:00]
play information and again I think where we want to really involve the the communities most is how do we really Implement things that we really think are important to do here the resolution itself just as an explanation you know we're part of the Council Grove City Schools were one of the 70s and so what we're trying to do is the line ourselves some what with all of the districts in terms of a lot of the problems that are happening across all our urban districts and I don't think there's anything in here that denies any kind of consistency let's find out what we can do to prevent some of these things because we do have some issues here and so now the question is not necessarily take guns away is not listening you necessarily but what it is is how do we really deal with that and so I think most of this anyway is around that there may be a few things that are maybe a little more if you but so the question is relative to those individual resolutions

[01:42:00]
are there anything in here that we really do believe that we can't live with I mean that's kind of the idea here and if there is something we can't live with let's talk about that otherwise I mean cuz there's a lot of stuff in here that I said yeah I can live with that a couple things okay depending on how you interpret that I might basically on my research that I understand about might say that's probably not going to help any let's put it that way so the question would be for everybody here is are there things in here specifically that you see that we have an issue with and that's what I think we got to focus on probably because the ones we don't have to focus on that if you have a issue with one of these people see if we need to change it in some way okay so talk

[01:43:00]
I mean I had a lot of things in that resolution that I didn't like that's why when I sat down with several people to kind of go over it you'll see and what I had written the things that I obviously didn't like some I just shortened cuz they were kind of some of them were really wordy I saw a lot of the same things that I thought that we're not making this really local and we always talk about how important it is to have local decisions and make everything pertain to to our school district and a lot of this a lot of this didn't and it's just not it's not practical I just think that we should just try to make it make it our own and try to listen to some other people about it so everything that I did not like Dr Piercy is in the resolution that I put together

[01:44:00]
with other people and some of them did something stayed in there because they kind of agreed with what was in the council great City Schools but I would prefer to sit and just do our own and make it our own instead of kind of rubber-stamping somebody else's and giving a lot of our power over to you know to Washington that never does anything very well anyhow so that's what my changes are all in what is put together that I gave you so and there's a whole whole lot of it so I'd rather just wait and write our own if we really think that this is going to be helpful to our kids cuz that's the bottom line is this going to is this going to help our kids are these things going to happen are we going to get funds to be able to do all these things or we're just using

[01:45:00]
words and then there isn't going to be any action behind them from a lot of people that don't take action so that is me I think again just to and again I want to dominate what the city schools is going to do with this kind of resolution their own resolution basically and with alliances with their districts just to say to the federal government you guys need to take some action that's the big thing so what we do is actually is relative to our own kinds of things like things that you may have said and more local so that's a different kind of conversation to me the conversation here is more like are we supporting the great City schools in terms of what they're going to try to do to push for federal legislation as much as they can around these issues we're probably not going to be in that argument directly in terms of you know them other than supporting them so the question is do we have an alliance

[01:46:00]
2 FM to say yeah I mean yeah there may be some things we have some specifics about that we disagree with and we'll do that on our own here we'll do it in a different way or will Implement a little differently or whatever the question is is the council is really asking the question is our district is going to stand up with us in terms of doing this so that we can say our districts are really pretty much behind us in terms of an alliance about something that needs to be done at the federal level we can do things that are state level we can do things that are local level basically on for example things you have and you have a lot of the similar things maybe not some of the stuff and things like that that you know you make different places of course of course and so I saw that you took some of the data and that's fine you know because what you really saying that the concept is too many kids I don't care how many you're talking about but so I think the question is is you know are we going to go out and say

[01:47:00]
what kind of support the council you go do your thing at the federal level will do our thing at the local level and we and we can work on our own personal internal resolution in terms of what we think is going to help us implementation wise as our own and we can do that separately so the question to me is is I would willing to to support the council itself in terms of what they're going to try to do at the federal level generally speaking or are we just not going to do that we can say we will do our own and that's fine we can do that on our own I think we can do that more specifically in other words because we have the authority to talk about that but we you know this is kind of more of a of a policy position at the conservation Lorenzo your thoughts

[01:48:00]
well I'm tempted to be confused I don't think I am I think I followed everything that was said my only thing that I would like to add is that we include in whatever resolution we pass that we urge opportunities for Community dialogue so the parents and community members can come forward and share their thinking as we figure out what we're about what we're doing here to make school safe and that could be an added paragraph about the community in terms of decisions that involve our personal school safety and in the implementation of details or something like those lines you know cuz I think that's appropriate at the top level

[01:49:00]
the question is what are we going to do and so you know our resolution is kind of that we're going to work on our own personal one to to in fact involve our communities and make sure that our communities involved in those kinds of decisions and I think that's really what they want to do I think that's what the council wants everybody every every every District to do is to make their own you know what I mean in terms of that they're going to do but okay I just wanted something in a resolution that also included the communities that it showed our resolve to wanting to be part of that so I think so did a really good job of connecting because that's the piece that I didn't see in the resolution but the rest I'm fine with if you look at the San Antonio when they added a

[01:50:00]
what's the traffic to the very end that's different than the cancel and that was specific to San Antonio saying something it wasn't about their own District like we could say but that could be a paragraph that we could say the Albuquerque Public Schools results you know that that we will in fact work on our own school safety issues with the community involvement in terms of how we might Implement some of the details relative to this resolution you know or something like that I think it speaks to a doctor Percy if I may follow up as an educational institution it's an opportunity to take that into the community with the community to educate one another on how we move forward and what do we do to find the best solution that we can all work together on and I think that's probably a follower one to make sure we're going to implement the way we want to implement here and San Antonio

[01:51:00]
make your own way in Broward County have a whole lot of things that they do their own way right you know because that's they're very near to the issue but we're near the issue that sounds pretty close to me now it's pretty close and so if you just look at the number of murders in this town so so we probably have our own issues that we need to try to deal with very specifically with our community so that can be again a little added paragraph just like San Antonio Texas

[01:52:00]
and you know you look at some of our some inner-city schools where they're metal detectors and students it's like going into the courthouse or prison every day and that is absolutely not what's going to keep our kids safe and I mean the fear that I have with all of this with any of the resolutions of any sort of a

[01:53:00]
Prophet making landfall for all the security companies that will have cameras and and all sorts of devices and fences that we can put up and it's not going to keep kids safe because they walk out of there or they walk in and it goes back to what are we doing to build community within schools and if that's not where we're putting resources I don't care what we do I don't care what I don't care what security measures are Focus has to be on developing relationships with kids and with our community and that's what it's going to fundamentally make a difference right at this point in time though I feel like there is Merit to joining on with the Council of great City schools and adding our voices to say there has to be a big vision

[01:54:00]
picture of what we want this country to look like and I think that the council statement is is a step I mean when I when I look at Peggy's resolution there's certainly a lot that I absolutely agree with and I think that we can keep working on it and adding it but and and I don't think that this conversation is done at all but I do feel like this is the point in time where is a district we need to add our voice to that National picture you know one of the things that keeps going through my mind on the Kirtland Air Force Base in one of the things that we did was go into their virtual reality setting of what do you do in confrontational settings how do you make decisions

[01:55:00]
active shooter there are people who spend their entire professional career trying to deal with an active shooter situation and it's still full of question marks of what you do and what actually diminishes violence and health and there are people whose profession that is there is not a single I don't want any of our teachers trying to make that their professional needs to be teaching kids and that's more than a full-time job what we ask is more than demanding in and out of school and so I just I mean I think of what does it mean for law enforcement if there's an active shooter situation and she walk into a building

[01:56:00]
you have no idea who these armed people are and who they are shooting at it is so anyway that's I had to bring that up because I keep thinking there are people who do this and trained to do that day in day out and it's not easy for them so I think I think we need to keep stay clear about what our mission is a school as an institution of education is and fight for those resources and it comes down to kids having those relationships and having the resources and that's funny but I support Sunday

[01:57:00]
guest room with lesson plans in one hand and a gun in the other I just can't I cannot fathom that at all and that's not going to happen one of the things that you know when I looked at these two resolutions I think what I like is what San Antonio did I think we need to make this our own and say that we do support the great City Schools resolution but I think we need to make this our only document that is real to the community the other thing is I want you to take a look at page two of the resolution I need clarification on what we mean when we say

[01:58:00]
extending the the extending the gun-free zone perimeter what is that really mean does that mean that we're extending it Beyond you know we're looking at the at the school does that mean an entire neighborhood I think we need clarification on that when I was reading this it's not clear as to what that really means something about right now it's free

[01:59:00]
I mean I don't know some may only be the buildings not that not the grounds for example you know maybe if you got a gun in your car it's okay but it is not not in school and by inside the building I don't know what other districts have in terms of what they call gun-free zones but it could be that in some urban districts it may be very different than others I don't know that but that would be something to be defined obviously and so whether you know I don't know you know I guess I can consider my house but it wasn't because I necessarily said they couldn't be there I just don't have any you know but but that's not a gun for his own a gun for you specifically say you can't have any guns here like there are places no weapons clarified clarified

[02:00:00]
would you please do that for us clarify it exactly so that we had to get better safety in terms of what we're doing now whether you trust the federal government for doing that or not that could be another question right that you have to talk to your legislators and see what you mean by that and there's there's a disagreement I mean you can go out in the community and there will be disagreement in terms of what people will say about that so whether whether you agree one way or the other I mean I think what they're trying to say is would you please have this discussion item and do something about it so that in fact the bottom line is reduce heart attacks you know I mean that's what my doctor said about my my medicine he says the only thing I care about is whether your heart attacks you know it's not whether you're a lawyer or do whatever you reduce the the violence in terms of gun deaths let's see what we can do to do that don't make stuff up

[02:01:00]
because you think one way or the other but go out and do something about it these are just kind of some ideas of areas that you might want to work on I found the same thing obviously because I think I took that out of mine is because extending the gun-free zone perimeter when there's a neighborhood that's right across the street so is it include how many yards away from the school so it's so totally vague and that you can't in French or beyond the school or be on the school grounds depending on every night I mean I know some rural schools that allow guns on their campus so what what that means something different to that cross the street from where we might live and it would have to probably be a local specific I would think

[02:02:00]
what do you mean by that exactly but maybe it would require you to Define that very carefully maybe that would be the the thing that would happen is that you need to be local and to find very specifically what you mean by a gun-free zone and what you mean by that in terms of did the sros allowed to have their guns their you know those kinds of things so you'd have to be very specific what you mean by a gun-free and and what the zone is so yeah I agree completely and and yeah I don't know that you can be that specific here I think what they're saying is let's define what we mean by that so that it's more consistent you know I don't know if I go to another district for example if in reality what that is I don't know what that is so the question would be or another state I don't know and so the question would be can we Define at least tell us what it is so that we know locally at least when we go someplace you know if you've got a concealed gun

[02:03:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:04:00]
play I think it really helps frame our voice it holds others accountable that would be in this partnership with all of us and reference to safer schools I agree with localizing it I love that Peggy took the initiative to to put one together as well I would take out the president's name because you know that's going to change and so this needs to be more I mean not calling out a specific president by name so that way it lasts longer I had an article forwarded to me recently that I was interested in learning more about and it's where police departments were faced with budget crisis like like many are and they partnered with their schools to open up sub stations in their schools so it benefited the police department as well as creating safer campuses and some interested in reading more about that article and and to Mr Benton's Point since our latest contact me every

[02:05:00]
single day and very Lively comments by the way I hope you appreciated my response but very Lively comments but I would have to say that the majority of the folks that have have contacted me and my district do support kind of the values that are out late in this resolution and if I could I'm normally the quickest one but if I could read this to you real quick and what someone sent me it says so I'm confused when the person with the AR-15 comes down the hall firing doesn't surprise in seconds is the teacher armed with a handgun supposed to open the classroom door and expose the children to Rapid gunfire while she tries to shoot the guy spraying her with bullets do you think the children screams would distract her from getting a good shot or she's supposed to hide the children in the closet and cabinets before opening the door to the guy with semi-automatic weapon is she wearing the handgun all day every day is it loaded is it concealed under her clothes or in a holster on her way could a child with impulse

[02:06:00]
control issues grab that loaded gun from her and use it against her or the other students and when she's holding and aiming a loaded weapon in the police respond to the 911 call how will they know she's a good guy with a gun and not the bad guy with a gun how will they know not to mistake her for the shooter and shoot her well the bonuses for the teachers carrying guns come from the money saved by cutting or the money saved by cutting funding for the Arts or is it coming from the money and investigations of college write reports I'm just wondering if guns are more important than reading or arts or girl out all the priorities of our country on the floor chart so that was just I just wanted to share that one comment that was sent to me but we have a lot of input and but I do think it's important to have a resolution so that

[02:07:00]
okay thank you well I've talked a lot so here's what I here's what I recommend and then we'll see what the rest of you think I would take the San Antonio resolution I would put the aps logo schools on the other side over here where it talks about resolution right says San Antonio Independent School District Chicago

[02:08:00]
did Albuquerque Public Schools will develop their own local resolution that will involve community members as to how to improve Local School Safety and Security so that gives us an alliance with Council Grove City Schools let them go to the federal stuff we will try to support you as best we can but we'll do our own local resolution in terms of how we're going to work to try to work with our schools with our communities as to how we want to implement these kinds of particular issues and I've underlined a lot of things here and I put a question mark by a couple things for example down here where it talks about a saltwater the concept of assault weapon is an interesting concept if you it's not well-defined semi-automatic for example handgun is the

[02:09:00]
like two when you can pull it each trigger it's a semi-automatic and that was the same as the rifle down there and there are many rifles that are much more powerful than the semi-automatic rifle that was used down to Florida so trying to you know kind of categorize an assault weapon or something else that's being the thing of issue is probably a question mark because I think guns in general are an issue and that's the question is how do you really deal with that but on the other hand if you look at the instances when things are happening yes so I don't want to I'm not sure I want to go there particularly because you know now you're in the minutiae you're not really doing anything so the question is is what do you do about that so

[02:10:00]
Mental Health Counselors data collection on violence and gun ownership strengthen the universal background checks reducing the number of gun related injuries and deaths that's the bottom line right that's the bottom line how do we do that without taking away in a second amendment or First Amendment rights you know how do we do that I'm definitely a post arming teachers I will have to take my heart out of my hands to ever get me to say I'm an army that is the worst thing in the world I've ever heard about never going to happen as long as I have anything at all to yell about I have no idea what extending the perimeter of gun for you but it's okay with me if you want to discuss it and talk about it in the counselors mental health Psychology Associates I mean you know we need people in our schools

[02:11:00]
to address issues that our kids bring to us and that staff brings to us and parents bring to us if you really want to know right and so yeah those are those are all good things so and you know I wasn't sure about the resolution about the band the manufacturer sale purchase and so forth of assault weapons large capacity I mean he's got I don't know you know there's so many possible weapon types of things that I'm familiar with that I don't know if that's going to help us but I think the idea is is what is it you want to do and and do something about this to decide what kinds of bands you think are appropriate or what kinds of restrictions

[02:12:00]
discussion in conversation is what's important to do and then decide what you think is going to happen so it's not like I'm going to say well I'd have to micromanage here and try to rework this cuz I can't even decide how I reword it anyway you know so I think my my thought would be to make it changes like like I said make sure the logos there and make sure the top is available schools add the Aztec and and Roswell community and to put up our own resolution to tell you the truth to say listen listen to what kind of a resolution we have and you've already started with your community right now so I think the idea would be to work with our communities and say we're going to be doing that with the implementation how do we going to spend our our Dollar Store

[02:13:00]
speak that hopefully we get that deals with security kinds of equipment and so forth and I'm with you too Barbara on that you know they'll come out of the woodwork they all have all kinds of of silver dollar Solutions there won't be any doubt you know and just like you read how's this going to work exactly and you know I worry about the prison I did because you know I had somebody say well we ought to have locks and everything on the front doors and everything and everybody you know and I said yeah but what if they want to get out you know what if they want to get out which is around I want to get out you know and I can't get out cuz all the doors are locked and or maybe I have a fire and I want to get out I mean maybe other circumstances here with regard to how we going to deal with this but so that's

[02:14:00]
if if you want to have a motion on that with those changes that I've indicated here that's fine and you can either motion yes or no or motion yes and vote it down or whatever but I think we ought to move on with what we want to do okay so I will put forth this as a possibility with the changes that I've indicated that are kind of along the lines of some of our thing with the last paragraph saying that I asked ourselves basically to come up with our local resolution that deals with a lot of things that are speaker talked about and and more of the implementation terms of Albuquerque what are we going to do specifically yeah where we kind of support Alliance but what are we going to do here and and souls so that's kind of my thought on it and others to put forth a motion

[02:15:00]
take me to move in a second I'll take a roll call vote on that yes definitely no Lorenzo Garcia yes chandelier Pattersons but the question is what are you doing you want to talk

[02:16:00]
what was going on but but we had people coming and you know Raven rifles and shooting out of their cars and all the people would put up

[02:17:00]
okay with that we will have you guys make up

[02:18:00]
the resolution and we will have that so thank you very much for the discussion I think there's an important discussion guys important discussion this is an important issue for us and you know it's been going on a long time so I'm going to go on a long time and somehow we got to quit killing our kids so that's the issue thank you very much so we got one more thing to do tonight find my my gender of nomination of the New Mexico School boards Association 2018

[02:27:00]
and then State basketball

[02:28:00]
turn the Yahoo to see below girls so that's a good thing also went to the greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce and listen to the superintendent of Denver public schools and the thing that one thing that I remember him saying was We Are Better Together than not I think that's something that we always need to remember that they're all our kids whether they're in Charter Schools traditional schools private schools home schools and we are better together than we are so I think that was a that's what I took away from his his talks so I thought that was important and to Mr Benton I hope your I hope you're a little bit happy with what they decided to do I'm not but I hope that you are good

[02:29:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:30:00]
play kids I will always be available it was wonderful fun then I also this was interesting student perception is very interesting I went to the Community School community council at Hayes middle school today and there were two students there and so part of the conversation is what kinds of supports are there for families for homework for tutoring all of these things and these two amazingly articulate and one of the things that they said they were talking about why their peers don't use the tutoring and you know just what their perception is and it was really interesting that

[02:31:00]
their take and this is not for me this is from students they were not prompted they were not their thing was because there was so much emphasis on Park that it diminishes the importance of the day in day out because they were talking about their grades and which grades do they care about which grades do they pay attention to what do they do and and it was just really interesting what their perception was that the weight of Park overwhelmed and pushed out just the importance of the day in day out learning that goes on in a classroom and so kids don't turn into hearing I'm not saying that's what we're saying is adults

[02:32:00]
and I just thought that's really kind of food for thought that what what are we teaching our students is important but a shout out to Beatrice and the community school council cuz she's working really hard to get involved in both parents and students remembered Elementary to check out the science fair and that science fair buildings was the most incredible thing I've ever seen

[02:33:00]
pleasantly surprised that it was so big and it was so impressive at elementary I'd like to thank Mr Benton for coming in person tonight and so often a lot of our comments are behind an email so it's always great to put a face with a with a with a public comment so thank you for being here tonight and then to nominations I have incredible respect for each and every one of you and every single time I'm honored to sit next to you whether we always agree on everything I always have respect for each and every one of you so thank you for that and I thought you know it was since everything has occurred around just the issues around school safety

[02:34:00]
that's really interesting I have the privilege of living in a neighborhood where I have two school principals that live in my neighborhood once for Hayes and the other is at Polk and so suddenly my front yard has become a natural Gathering location for a conversation around just schools and you know their kids come by and I come home right after I work out when I do get to work out and because it's staying light outside I still have people that want to come and just have a conversation so it's been really it's been really good but the issue of school safety is definitely been on their brains a whole lot more and you know lots of concerns about you know how do we you know what are some things that we can do to assure students especially that you know going to school every day is going to be okay and that seems to weigh pretty heavily on on the leadership of these two principles which I

[02:35:00]
I have great respect for her just they're wonderful people the other thing on the safety too I think the difficulty for me was when I got a call from my stepson who says that there was a call to his school and he didn't know whether to send his daughter to school or not and so when it hit closer to home like that then it certainly has weighed on my mind and you know we had a long conversation and I said you need to send her to school we need to have confidence that everything's going to be okay because we don't want her to feel like school isn't a place for her to go and so we we got through that conversation so I appreciate the dialogue tonight and the conversation it's not an easy one and there are no easy solutions I know if my late husband were here he would be saying oh hell no would I ever want to even be considered a teacher who would have a firearm in my in my in my in my possession or in my classroom that just does not something he would have he would have thought about but he would have been engaged in a conversation

[02:36:00]
how do we make it safer how do we do something that is going to change that culture of this issue of what's going on in our country so I appreciate the conversation tonight the other thing so on a lighter note I'll end on a lighter note I'm going to give a shout out a free shot out to Jefferson Middle School because we're going to be there tomorrow in great force they're having a career fair for the entire middle school so the Department of Workforce Solutions they have somehow way late my entire department and everybody is going to be there tomorrow and it's going to be an opportunity not only for the students but also for the parents because it's going to go into the evening hours and parents are going to have an opportunity to also just being engaged with some of our tools and resources so if you guys have a chance go to Jefferson tomorrow and you know go take a resume building class with some six

[02:37:00]
the other thing I wanted to say

[02:38:00]
I had the opportunity to attend the the sea perch at the West Mesa Aquatic Center organized by Ms Ripley what a phenomenal organization it takes an enormous amount of energy and know how to do that and to watch these the the students with the activities and and the teachers who who helped these students could do them through the process is really an amazing I mean it's really phenomenal work and I want to thank all of those folks to do that and you know all of that came to volunteers to Engineers my husband doesn't today is my anniversary is a first year I feel like I've been here for long time

[02:39:00]
March 1st and I'm also the the board member in Learning Zone 2 Dr Gonzalez as well I just wanted to remind him that I'm also representing that area but anyway thank you so much and thank you for being here today thank you very much thank you for all of you who have said you were praying for my wife and for us to get through this Health crisis have grown have matured in a way that's nice to look at to think about and I hope that we can continue to raise the bar for ourselves so that we will challenge ourselves to grow and I take you

[02:40:00]
that sounds very seriously we have to find a way to invite people who don't agree with us who have other ways of seeing the world and thinking and hopefully get to a place where we can see each other as human beings and move forward I'm frankly sick of the horrible role modeling that we see on a regular basis where people trash one another look for the gotcha moments I'm really not interested in that I'm hoping that as a board we can continue to live and be a group of anybody who comes around I am a little worried because I'm not out in the community much other than back and forth to doctor's appointments and other things and I'm a little worried that you know I will be disconnected so

[02:41:00]
I'm hoping that I can figure out a way to be a little more connected with people including those who you know absolutely disagree with me thank you so much thank you period

[02:42:00]
had the Early Childhood early literacy had those kinds of things a lot of the actions that they have already taken or things that were either working on her or working towards I I like the couple things he said there was a kind of a teacher Network that I thought was a little different than what we did but I thought that was interesting to have a an instructional person that had you know supervisory over you know more of a mentor teacher kind of a thing I thought it was interesting also interesting that the tax increase that the city allowed to pay for that there was more to it but basically to do that but I like to I like to discussions and I thought he was one of the things he said that a lot to is that he said I don't like to call my school's failures they're not

[02:43:00]
since they just have things that they need to work on we need to work together I think that goes to what board member Maria is going to say is we need to work together you know we need to be part of this together and not be putting blame one way or the other and let's just get it done you know and so that's what he's really interested in is really getting things done and and I think he's done a decent job there so I appreciate that and of course I love the Honor Choir stuff I think that's one of the highlights in my ears to see all the parents come here and just so proud of their kids and the kids that are just so energetic you know up there I mean you didn't say all the rehearsals but it's kind of funny in the rehearsal stuff what they do so it's kind of funny but and then the musicians you know all the teachers that we have that are so flexible and so so wonderful for those kids

[02:44:00]
this is great to be part of that so I like that a lot thanks superintendent for all these activities that you got all of our staff doing to improve them I can't even list all of them and I don't have quite the same the same wife issue that learns of does but I do have a wife issue I feel like a caretaker here but yeah he did have knee surgery replacement on Monday and this past Monday a week ago and she's doing well and I appreciate everybody who sent me things and we just delivered a green chile

[02:45:00]
thank you Lorenzo for covering for things you know I've had to call in a couple times and sometimes I didn't even get my call totaled on the deuce you know that but so it's good it's good to have coverage good to have people who can take over and and to help out and I think that's part of being a family in the community here so I think that's what we're about and so I look forward to the next year here to to really make even more progress than we're making so I'm looking forward to that so thank you very much Dr Percy I might add that I think your father and Benny Goodman would have been very proud listening to you with that incredibly competent Intercultural choir you know yeah okay so we have next board meeting Wednesday March 21st to 2018

[02:46:00]
