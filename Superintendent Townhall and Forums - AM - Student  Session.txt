again I want to thank for the invite to be here today and I really appreciate it and my name is Max Zuni I am the Governor from the Pueblo of Isleta and as you well know we are located just south of Albuquerque right in the middle of one of the largest cities here in Albuquerque and the growing population of Los Lunas and we have a lot of kids here in APS and that is the reason I'm here I have to support our kids as much as we can and I meet with all the superintendents for the last several years this is almost my 12th year that I've been in this kind of office and we have an agreement and I hope you understand that that we have a really seriously with the Valencia and several years ago we started

[00:01:00]
APS as well know our kids are very important they are very vital for us period that's what I do when I go to

[00:02:00]
the schools I touched their heart I tell him the history not only of the state of the Pebbles but our village another thing I encourage are young kids is our language and our culture as you well know our kids can learn up to five different languages and are young kids now because of the English language being so dominant and I'm trying to encourage our young people to speak our language of our community and I hope and I prayed today I asked for the wisdom patience

[00:03:00]
and to support our children here in our community in our state and to look forward to when they grow up and I always tell the young kids and they look into the future they might be sitting in your seats or standing here so again thank you so much thank you Google Des Moines Iowa

[00:04:00]
that she was one of the district's associate superintendents for leadership and learning once again you can learn more about both candidates by visiting aps.edu during this next section each finalist will have about 10 minutes to introduce themselves and share some career highlights during our morning session we started with Dr Blakey so during this session period

[00:05:00]
been in the business for 34 years if you don't count my my experience as a student in the public system I've served in a wide range of roles as a school Improvement consultant as a curriculum director a Human Resources Director a principal an associate superintendent for teaching and learning and and finally as as both the superintendent and a teacher I was in the classroom for 11 years and two different districts I was in the classroom long enough to really understand what it takes to be a good teacher what those sort of those Ebbs and flows the teachers experience over the course of a year over the course of several years

[00:06:00]
what's the longest month from a teacher's perspective I understand the impact that seemingly insignificant decisions at central office can have on the classroom environment so that dynamic between the student and the students and the teacher is really in the Forefront of my mind and all of my decision-making as a superintendent a little bit about Des Moines where I spent 14 years of my career 10 is superintendent even though it's in Iowa and I think a lot of people and Iowa as a bunch of people that look just like me that's certainly not the case anymore of our students were students of color are students were born in over 100 different countries from around the world over 100 different languages about 22% of our students were language Learners 13% of our students have IEPs in our poverty rate was bumping up against 80%

[00:07:00]
having a very diverse student population quickly touching on education I'm trying to cover my entire life here in 10 minutes after I after I was finished teaching because I'm at the time I just didn't see the appeal of most educational roles outside of the outside of the classroom that obviously didn't happen I've stayed in public education in a wide range of roles but the the Masters in public administration has been super beneficial

[00:08:00]
me as a superintendent particularly in in sort of those non-educational functions like business and finance and Human Resources I think that's something that sets me apart for maybe a lot of superintendents and it's been extremely helpful for me to have that perspective from from management standpoint so how do I put leadership as an educator how do I see the the job of the superintendent want to share with you a couple of sort of the driving philosophy behind how it is that I operate first of all students can learn and succeed and by all students I mean every single student how we serve every single one of those students does not look the same or system looks like we play students on a

[00:09:00]
either as a as a preschooler or kindergartener and expect all of them to matriculate at exactly the same Pace all the way through 12th grade and graduation obviously that is not realistic although that's the situation that we're sort of forced to modulate so it's really important that we understand I'm in my second really has to be the driving force behind School Improvement we're not going to get results that look equal if Equity isn't driving how it is that we serve our students all staff are crucial to the success of our students and that's not just instructional stuff clearly teachers are the single most important variable in how students learn followed by the principal but every single every single employee of a district needs to have that ownership and investment and

[00:10:00]
how successful our students are going to be and finally people matter Peter Drucker I think says it really well culture eats strategy for breakfast our schools need to feel like a place where we want to be where our kids want to be where are staff wants to be in the same direction with a shared Mission if we don't have that right then you know following all the best practice research in the world is not going to get us to where we need to get with with our young ones stewardship is something that I take very seriously has been a theme throughout my administrative career is really important in order to build Partnerships with our community and have the trust of our community that we recognize that we're operating with Public Funding

[00:11:00]
most valuable asset which is our children we need to take that very seriously and make sure that we're leveraging all of our resources is effectively as possible for Equitable outcomes for each of our students continuing continuous Improvement not just as we serve our students but how we operate all the functions of the district always must be getting better that there are so many people clearly engaged and that the board has taken some really Progressive steps and how they're going to operate as a team that's super encouraging because it really does take everyone will never be able to cover all of the needs that we are trying to

[00:12:00]
for our students Partnerships hugely important I can I can speak for probably for an hour and all the Partnerships that I've been involved with but again what we're doing as a school system has a direct impact on the quality of life in the community and obviously the quality of life of our students and their families and our community needs to understand that we can't fulfill every every every every wants everything that our students need alone and so to be smart and to be to really provide wrap around quality services everything that our students need in order to be successful as a student we really do need to be and I know APS does this already we need to be smart and Progressive and how we establish Partnerships in the community to make

[00:13:00]
this is probably the most important thing I think to to Define how it is that I view the educational process and how how a teacher can be successful how school can be successful our district can be most successful and that is really focusing on student agency student voicemail all of our students all of our students are real people and a lot of them I learned this is a teacher or smarter than we are the experience is that life experiences that we've had but they're thinkers and their doors and if we can capital

[00:14:00]
thank you very much for your kind attention and for those of you who are here earlier for the duplicate message in large parts and I appreciate the privilege of having a chance to speak with you today thank you dot thank you thank you all for joining us this is invigorating to have so many people that have joined us in the first

[00:15:00]
so I hope that you continue this partnership with us and this isn't the last time that we see you as we go on a journey together and serving our students I for those of you that were here in the first session I will be eating but what I did except for this time I'm really nervous because two of my teachers are in the audience to being in high school and trying to get out of PE class but I hope to make them proud as well and I also am putting myself out there with my high school picture so I think I'm going all out during this process I might as well just put it all out there so this is me I'm Gabriella Blakey and I grew up in Albuquerque and one of the reasons that I'm putting the schools on here is because the values that I take for my leadership

[00:16:00]
are solidified in my growing up in Albuquerque Public Schools and my parents taught me at a very young age the importance of public education my grandparents taught us the importance of public education and in believing in public education and going to our neighborhood schools and I grew up in our neighborhood schools going to Sandia base Van Buren and I graduated from Highland High School and I'm really proud of my time that I had and what the foundation that it set for me and I hope for all of our students that graduate from Highland and the attend Van Buren that they someday get the opportunity that I have today to be able to represent themselves and their school in a position that they have strived for their whole life and so I hope that that opportunity isn't just an abnormally but that that's what we have in store for all of our children I grew up in very diverse schools

[00:17:00]
is there in Albuquerque and because of that background I take great pride in valuing diversity and I feel more comfortable in situations where people are different than me and I value that because I think that that's part of how I grew up I am used to being around different people I see people as assets and it's really important to me in growing and evaluating our community that I'm around people that are different than me I also had an experience when I was in Middle School at Van Buren and I was 11 or 12 years old so for a life experience it probably was very different as an 11 year old is how I remember it as an adult but we were doing I had a friend Diana we were in classes together study together and we were doing a toy drive and the food drive during the holidays so the intent was that we bring all the donations together and then we go deliver it to families so we live we delivered the basket and all the toys we went right across the street pretty much from the school

[00:18:00]
into an apartment upstairs and out of the apartment they're about seven children came out from the back really excited about their presents and my friend Diana came out from the back and it was during that time that I quickly realized that in order to get equal outputs in our students we have to have Equitable inputs and my life experience is very different than Diana's but in school we work together we competed together and we grew up together but it's important to know that what it takes to be able to get people to that spot and I think that I value that and I take that very seriously in my work that I do with the community so I was a teacher I still have teacher teacher in me so I just want to take a time to have you think about a child that's important to you and just get that child in your head as we go through this next few minutes together the child important to me is my son

[00:19:00]
Sia is in preschool at Whittier Elementary School Society will be attending kindergarten next year and her world is going to be totally different when she graduates from high school then from the world we're seeing right now with her students but it's also our responsibility as the adults to create that environment for her as she enters kindergarten this fall and I know my commitment to say is my niece that I want the best opportunities for her but I take that commitment very seriously and all of her children and Albuquerque that as I make decisions I do them in the best interest of Science and the best interests of all children and those children are thinking of right now I make the decisions in the best interest of them because that is the way that I think about things I believe that every child in Albuquerque Public Schools will graduate with the skills attributes and knowledge to achieve their future goals and every decision will be made in the best interest of every child to reach their potential

[00:20:00]
and that's from me as superintendent to every employee in the district that the decisions that we make and the teaching that we do in the classroom is the expectation that we have for our own children I just want to really quick remind you of the goals of the board established working with community members like yourselves last year and those goals are early literacy math post-secondary Readiness and skills habits in mindsets goals that you have set for us is through our strategic plan and are strategic plan has four priorities clear expectations rigorous construction engage students and responsive and coordinated systems but I want to give you a little bit of an insight into some of the expectations that you can have for me under my leadership in these priorities so the first priority clear

[00:21:00]
expectations what you can expect from me is that we will demand accountability for student outcomes of all levels of the district and more importantly we will create systems of support and levels of autonomy within our schools we will meet continuously with staff community and students to get a clear understanding of what keeps the district from achieving our goals and ways in which we can remove those barriers so it's listening to people like yourself so that we can get a sense of what's stopping us and how we can push forward to be able to get through those barriers and the third thing I'd like to do is decentralize central office and increase decision-making closer to the school I firmly believe that some of our answers are in the people that are closest to the problems and so being able to listen to people and give autonomy as schools to be able to make some of those decisions is really critical in us being able to move forward the second priority is rigorous instruction I'd like to

[00:22:00]
high dosage tutoring we know that that high dosage tutoring works and we know that we have Partners such as yourself that are willing to provide those opportunities for students before school after school and during the school day so I would like to leverage those Partnerships to be able to provide this type of tutoring for our students who are struggling I also believe that we need to ensure that the lessons in the classroom are at the current grade level standards the third grade class and one side of the city is teaching the same tests that are in the third grade class at the other side of the city because we know the great level standards are all of our students should be able to achieve and it's our job to make sure that that's happening I'd like to partner with the public education department to open a Statewide Literacy Center you may have heard about this as one of the initiatives from the state and in looking at our own assets and resources and some of our schools we know that we could provide the resources in order to do this so we'd like to partner with the public education department

[00:23:00]
open the first Statewide Literacy Center right here in Albuquerque I'd also like to increase support in training for structure literacy in our schools and support our teachers in meeting the individual needs of our students engage students for engage students what you can expect from my leadership is that we would add genius hour to all of our elementary schools right now we have genius hour and some of our elementary schools which gives children the opportunity to develop kind of the right side of their brain and have a time in order to be creative and use creative Outlets it comes from looking at Google and how they give their employees and our day to just decide what they want to do and play around and that's what we need to do with our students as well we've seen a lot of success in genius hour in the schools that we've had genius hour and we really want to make sure that all of our children have access to it we want to make sure that we ensure middle school students have access to elective

[00:24:00]
create opportunities for high school internships with Community Partners increase and establish robust Career Technical education programs ensure that we have art music and all of our elementary schools at this time we have them in most elementary schools but not all of the elementary schools I'd like to support and increase our access to bilingual programs and expand support for social emotional support for all students for responsive and coordinated systems I'd like to increase the teacher residency programs work with Community Partners to increase our Workforce review curriculum programs and shift to student based budgeting and all of this my commitment to you and to my teachers that are out there is to make sure that I'm always listening responding leading and delivering on our promises thank you Google

[00:25:00]
show the aps Board of Education really wants to hear from you they want your feedback so when you walked into the room today you may have seen some purple cards with a QR code on their please before you leave today share your feedback on the two finalists the QR code is the fastest way to gather information but if you so choose there's also a blue card that you can do at the old fashioned way and manually write it out the board members are going to use your feedback as they select the the next superintendent for APS District we are going to be taking a moment to bring our student panelists who are going to be asking the candidates for some some questions

[00:26:00]
okay we are really excited about this next segment because we are going to have students from the high school middle and elementary school levels giving questions directly to our candidates so was the candidates talk about their philosophies and their policies and how they will trickle down to those in the classrooms

[00:27:00]

good morning

[00:33:00]
with an increase in the in the use of technology in the classroom there are many instances where websites are blocked and students must use their personal phones to access the information how will you work with the tech department and teachers to be able to give students access on their school devices so thank you for the question and I have to tell you I was really nervous that my teachers were in here but you all are making me more nervous than the teachers so thank you for the question so it's really interesting because the world is changing so fast that more and more information is available on technology and I don't know if you all were here when I was showing a picture of my niece but I was she's going into kindergarten next year and thinking how technology and the information she gets is going to be so different than even you as you graduate from high school so I think that we have

[00:34:00]
technology sites that you might need access to and also making sure that we're keeping you safe and are systems safe by making sure that we're not opening ourselves up to any hackers or that you're not receiving any information that you that is unsafe for you or maybe a little brothers and sisters that you might have and I know it's important to teachers too because more and more websites and information is going out worldwide that we need to have access to but we need to do it in a responsible way that we're making sure we're not limiting you all from information but we're also keeping you safe

what did we met with a student and the students family we crafted a plan to make sure that we can continue to serve them it wasn't in their home school sometimes we were able to get them back into their homes

[00:46:00]

[00:47:00]
and that we provide those opportunities for them how can we have more music library time in elementary school so it's very important

[00:48:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:49:00]
what are elementary schools they have art and music every year but in some of the other elementary schools you have to do it every other year so my goal is to make sure that you have our music every year in elementary school along with all of those other specials so that you're able to get a well-rounded education and in elementary school you can start to find things that excite you and that you're really excited about myself and so it's really important that we make sure that all schools have those things how can we have more music library time in elementary school
