[00:02:00]
obsession with starts in 2 weeks of the legislative education study committee did roll out their proposal for changes to graduation requirements as you can see on the table we provided you which is on page 19 of your documents what are the biggest changes is to decrease elective units from 4 by 4 units but requiring two of those units to be connected to Career connected learning that's a huge big shift The Proposal also gives you two local discretion units of electives or competency courses that you that you may want to required from 24 to 2224

[00:03:00]
3rd and CTE Pre-K and security words would not be subject to the offset additionally there is discussion to raise the total number of instructional hours from 1,080 to 1140 there's a proposal to raise the minimum salaries for all educational assistance to 25000 and to increase the principal responsibility Factor during the session we can expect to see proposals on improving the family income index the attendance for success and to create an Indian education endowment fund so Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Elder during November voters did pass the Constitutional amendment by 70% in that that will make an additional annual distribution from the permanent School fund for enhanced instructions for students who are risk of failure extending the school year and

[00:04:00]
teacher compensation that needed Congressional approval and it actually was included in the Omnibus Bill that passed Congress right before the holidays so that has been taken care of the educational Retirement Board did give an update and just as a reminder of the return to work for vision that we've been relying on for educational retirees over the past year or so that actually ends in one year unless extended so we've been talking to some legislators about that the public education department after their request which includes a focus on investments and Leadership improving academic achievement really supporting improved attendance and really focusing on Behavioral Health supports and it's going to be an interesting session around all that funding request because there is 3.6 billion dollars in new money

[00:05:00]
are the PED is requesting a 4% salary increase for all staff and then they are also proposing 56 million to help with hard to fill positions or to help us with the compaction that we're seeing amongst the salary ranges in your package you'll also see on page 24 this is the first budget table that we're giving you and you're going to see many versions of this as we go through the legislature but what you can see is the request from the public education department compared to the current operating budget and how those May differ scenarios and you'll see that table get bigger as we go through the session I'll be able to answer some questions but I'm going to turn it over to our chief of school

[00:06:00]
graduation requirements thank you dot and good evening Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Elder and review of the proposed graduation requirements there are some things that I would like for us to consider that could absolutely impact how we make sure that our students are enrolled in the correct classes that we are offering not just the bare minimum but rigorous course work as well as to include aprons dual enrollment classes in those academic areas one thing that are one proposed change is they are giving districts autonomy to determine what that Force Ela credit could be so they will be requiring English

[00:07:00]
language arts 1 2 and 3 but not for necessarily schools and districts can still offer English for but they can also offer a multitude of other literacy-based courses such as critical reading and writing it could be creative writing technical writing public speaking so there are those things haven't been really sorted out but those are things that we need to consider as a district what we want to prioritize as we are really pushing Equity across our district to make sure that all of our students have Equitable access to these different opportunities another change is the removal of the expectation for all students to have the one unit

[00:08:00]
the equivalent to or higher than Algebra 2 so they're requiring for credits in mathematics still but just including the sequence of algebra 1 and geometry so other math courses that may support stem CTE classes can also be utilized again those haven't been identified at this point if we all heard anything loud and clear from the listening session it's that financial literacy is something that is wanted and needed in the community for our students and so that's an option that we can think about they are maintaining the science credits of three with two need to continue to be the lab Sciences so there's no changes there for social studies they're adding a 0.5 credits to make it for credits instead of the three point five and that point five was for the New Mexico history

[00:09:00]
that they are now wanting us to include in US history and geography which usually takes place during the junior year of high school so one question I would have their requiring the US history and geography government and economics which is usually the 12th grade here and then world history and geography which is usually the 10th grade year so it opens us up to the discussion eventually regarding what does that Force social studies option look like in our high schools which is great that we have autonomy but again going back to equity and making sure that our kids have those options one thing that I'm concerned with is the physical education and health they have those separate before and now they're combining it so that it must include content that covers both health and physical education

[00:10:00]
and our big question is are our teachers going to then have to be duly certified and if so they you know many of them are not and so that's going to take some time and consideration from the public education licensure Bureau to see how we can get that done the electives just like Dr Escobedo had mentioned electives are moving down from a required of a requirement of 7.5 to 4:00 with two unit pathway concentration of the students choice and that can be in World Language Fine Arts military or CTE classes my concern here is that many colleges and universities including the University of New Mexico requires two sequential units of language other than English for entrance and so

[00:11:00]
I want to make sure that we are setting all of our kids up for Success not all of our kids are going to go to college and I understand that but some students change their mind along the way and some students like myself don't realize that they want to go to college until their senior year and so I want to make sure that as a district we're setting our kids up for success and so maybe we can discuss with that could look like they're dropping the career the one credit of Career Cluster workplace and language other than English they are also dropping the requirements to for students to have an AP honors dual credit or distance learning course and they are giving two credits for local discretion so what that could look like but they must meet academic content and performance standards and can be elective

[00:12:00]
what units as well so there's a lot to consider with these changes and there is going to be much planning in place resources human capital whatever that may entail and ships they're going to have to take place in order to do this but also with the decrease in credits from 24 to 22 that will also impact students ability to earn a certain number of credits each year and so my hope is that you know we could look at a sixth period day versus a 7 period day I don't want our kiddos their senior year to be leaving school early I want them to have that robust senior experience and so that's something else to consider and that's all that I have Dr Esco and Madam chair great thank you three for that overview

[00:13:00]
graduation requirements and so just want to see if there's any questions or discussion from any of the board members on the update that we heard or that was in our package that this might be a generalized question but I mean it kind of concerns me a little bit as well that are the graduation requirements have dropped and so I wonder what kind of Leverage or leeway we have to I mean is this a minimum 22 and APS school board or District can say that's great but we'd like to keep it at 24 I mean do we have any leverage to do that and I'm concerned if the talk has been about rigorous high-quality education and like really preparing our kids to be ready when they leave school but we're dropping the requirements it doesn't those two things don't seem to

[00:14:00]
so I guess it's an open-ended question can we can we maintain the 24 units if we so choose Madam chair and board member Jackson yes this is a minimum so the 22 units would be a minimum and I can also provide to you and and the other board members some of the research that the legislative education study committee did do to comparison to other states and why they were looking at lowering the numbers so that might help you as we move forward okay yeah well and I think you know obviously too when we see the goals next week and you know know where this strategic plan is heading I think that that's going to also play into our ability to need what our graduation requirements are going to be so I you know I think Dr Segura you brought up a lot of very good points and I think that they are going to once we see

[00:15:00]
the goals are and we can kind of have that decision finalized then we'll be able to to make more decisions but I appreciate you kind of bringing this to our attention beforehand thank you any other comments or questions from board members I guess on page 20 the mention of learning time proposal is APS proposing this how is this being couched I know that the legislative the legislature is proposing this and Pete my concern is how I don't want the community or parents who voted against this aligning APS with that

[00:16:00]
a proposal because I think we should allow the legislature to take the lead and and be the source of that information or is it in our legislative package it's not something that we were pursued in the past the board has allowed the local control and allowed the communities to vote that's been the board's position in the past I haven't heard the board suggests that they wanted to take a different stance on that however should this pass it will be lost I do have a full some more questions help schools that do not have a 70% Title One population do you have information about that

[00:17:00]
I guess that's really the request is to continue the family income index to actually get more research into 3rd year and that's the request that they're having that they're putting on the table and also to change there's a requirement that 1/3 of the money needs to be spent on English language arts one on math and so they want to widen that those requirements of that that's the changes that they're proposing but it would really maintain the schools who are receiving those funds thank you yes thank you thanks for putting all this information

[00:18:00]
how much of that is typed the extended school day in their projection and that's going to be passed and how much would it free up us to make decisions about things like class size number of types and amounts of program supports intervention teachers counselors and so on how much leeway is there would that proposed amount so Madam chair and board members and board member Peterson the amount of money that is requesting is $211 million dollars to get all schools either from the 990 or the 1082 1,140 hours now there are multiple scenarios that the LFC have

[00:19:00]
been thinking about how to incentivize or how to distribute that money but this is the PED request so we got to see what those bills come out to be and we will be working with our budget team to say if there's $211 million dollars came in or about 26% of 23 to 26 percent of the budget how much would that give us and would that give us enough funds to actually make the increase that their would be requiring in law so that's kind of our process and we will continue to do that if you feel like there is a reference compensation increases of 4% is there any attention being paid to classified employees into larger increase in percent in funding to go along with it Madam chair and more members of board member

[00:20:00]
discussion really has been around the 25,000 minimums for educational assistance so that's been the big push there and then the 4% and then the depending on how it's worded in the language that's crafted some of those funds will also go to the additional hours that everyone will be working because of the increased instructional hours as well and finally going back to the graduation requirements I'm just curious if we have gotten any feedback from high school teachers administrators communities what what the feeling is and I would really appreciate seeing that comparison that you talked about in terms of other state requirements and credits what that could look like what's what's the difference if we had a 6 hour period

[00:21:00]
best stuff with more deaths is beneficial to students so it could be that in fact 22 required hours for the 6th period day would actually lead to increased learning not decreased learning but it definitely there are definitely lots of scenarios that are in I guess your life Dr Segura to start brainstorming pulling people together for but anyway have you gotten any feedback at this point board member Peterson Madam chair and members of the board we have not at this point received any feedback because this is fairly new coming from the LSC and so are our next steps would be to be getting that feedback from high schools for each of these areas and

[00:22:00]
compile their concerns their questions their ideas so that we can begin the process of what that looks like for APS thank you for that it will be an interesting process thank you so a couple of questions so have you received feedback from teachers and other staff about the possibility of that increase in hours to 1140 have you heard from them do you think this is going to affect people wanting to leave just I mean that's that's a significant increase around the fact that we put out a number of surveys and we've allowed them to vote a number of times on this particular issue

[00:23:00]
and so they were asking why are you setting this up again for yet another vote it has not been a lot but we heard from it and I would say that there are some people that are less interested in others in this particular proposal I think we've seen this play out in the way the communities have voted in the past and so we have some historical data as far as how people have considered it but we are beginning to hear some people that are are concerned about it and the impact it will have on how we're going to do that so that's one of the reasons we have postponed bringing the calendar for words so that's to not confuse the communities if we bring a 1044 and then also I mean we kind of know what

[00:24:00]
parents parents think about this so how are we how are you Scott getting out to the community that this really doesn't have anything to do with us that that is going to be coming from Santa Fe and that I mean they're going to have to talk to them and not necessarily to us again interestingly enough it's included in my message tomorrow so and on our website we've actually posted when people go looking for the calendar there's a message there that says as we wait for the New Mexico legislature to decide on the new calendar there's a lot of communities that are very concerned about it specifically a lot of the Agricultural communities are just concerned for a lot of reasons and a lot of the communities are in four days are very very

[00:25:00]
this this will be a topic for discussion I believe on the next 60 days session so then I know you kind of alluded to this but you're going to wait about putting out a calendar but do you have you know tentatively what it might look like if it does increase to 1140 it would probably be premature for me to say that what it would include is probably well obviously we'd have to add days there's something else special at the elementary level they're sitting about 990 in terms of hours so that's the awkward thing when we discussed this and I would make it hopefully clear for the public that the state defines the number of hours a student has to be in class not the number of hours but there are bumping up from 90090 to 1140 that's a significant increase even for the secondary level at 10:40 going to 11:40 that's a significant increase to about 10 days in those cases we would certainly probably look at a combination of the

[00:26:00]
I think try to find Days inside our current calendar you've suggested some things in the past that we've certainly have on the table you know there's been one of the issues that came up this year was with the initially proposed calendar as the Balloon Fiesta was very concerned about the loss of the fall break and that they would or the movement of the fall break and that the way they have a structured their event the kids were at the back end of the week and we're going to have to move it to the front end of the week and they need our buses so there's a lot of impacts that go far beyond the school system and as we bump into those we certainly encourage those entities to engage with their legislators and and explain their concerns with with the proposal and I don't know if you have any ideas are there any school districts that you're aware of that already at the elementary level at 11:40

[00:27:00]
Las Cruces is doing there are a lot of different ways to do this Las Cruces has a very interesting but they call the balance calendar they copied it from a little District name to your cigarette has some familiarity with that it's a calendar that goes throughout the year you know so many weeks on a few weeks off somebody weeks on a few weeks off it's an interesting proposal so we'll have to bring some some thoughts forward to the board as soon as we were working on it because anticipating that this is a very real possibility okay and I think the last question I have and I think Dr Segura just kind of spoke a little bit about it when it comes to local discretion I mean I guess you're kind of still giving us some local control will then the local discussion be totally up to each School District then so you can decide what those units

[00:28:00]
play me look like we're about just allowing them just to be electives which I think is very important to students I'm very upset about the electives going down so I think that's a place we can recapture not all of the electives but we could recapture some of them and yes board member of the board they do allow for that discretion and so in you know some of our concerns were that by decreasing the amount of elective requirements was a direct antithesis to be work that we've been doing as a state to really promote Career Technical education and career Pathways and so we do and we will have that local discretion to determine as a district not we're not going to be able to do at school by school

[00:29:00]
but it will be as a district what are our priorities and our strategic plan I think will be and all the input from the community will help us in navigating what that looks like for APS so absolutely we can have those be elective courses I mean I just hope so we need to let kids just play on their strengths and take classes that are of interest to them and excite them and I think that's what electives do I mean a lot of kids go to school you know specifically for their electives to be and you know choir be in drama or whatever so I think that's just something that we need to really consider thank you great thank you and so I would ask if either of the two board members who are joining virtually tonight if you do have a question if you can sign it by using the raise hand feature and I will go directly to board member your room I'm trying to find it I'm sorry so

[00:30:00]
in terms of the electives the 22 vs 24 and I know Dr Escobedo said that we're going to look at some other districts I would just want to ensure that the districts were comparing the 22 credit requirements that these would be districts that have actually excelled in their proficient you know I don't want to make I don't want it to be apples for apples but actually District that is exceeding what expectations should be a board members of the report I've actually just pulled up and actually Compares a 1500 really

[00:31:00]
Wisconsin only requires 15 units but their definition of a unit is a lot different than ours so we will get that to you it just in momentarily great thank you no other questions how can we how can we be an advocate I mean what is it that you know obviously I think with hopefully nmsba is still going to support you know

[00:32:00]
I think that's one of the things that we definitely would want to hold on to and I'm hoping that that's going to be part of the platform with nmsba because I think for us as a board that's really where we would like to have as much control as we have or can have for the district so that we're also sort of in the driver seat of like how we're going to make some of those decisions rather than them just coming down and it's just an idiot right in terms of how it's done so how could we be also supportive with pieces that are coming in from our parents I really appreciate that the superintendent's going to have a message coming out tomorrow with some of these pieces but I guess just listening from superintendent staff what would be some other ways that you would want the board to be supportive

[00:33:00]
I think you probably know the answer to that question just and it's a good way to articulate it is that you were going to be active in this process and I think school boards across the state I'm just from what I've heard from superintendents would prefer the ability to make the decision in their local community and I think expressing that and articulating that and when you're asked by your community what what's going on making sure that you're you're you're clear that we're simply asked if we're not opposed to the concept I'm not opposed it we had a very robust conversation board member Gonzalez made some very clear all of you did about this but we ended up putting out to the community and the community responded to that this would change that ability to do that and I think school boards as as a rule would prefer to have the ability to make the decision themselves so

[00:34:00]
I think just being consistent in that message if if that's the will of the board if it's not then I think the board you know then you're operating as as individuals so but that's that's certainly as far as strategy I think that's about all we can ask of you okay thank you for the follow-up and it's for the conversations have largely been around increasing the minimum number of hours for schools from the current 990 and 1080 to 11:40 what is the conversation around hours and how those hours are used to ensure that there is some quality and accountability for making sure that those hours are actually helping our kids learn so that's one of the details that were waiting to really

[00:35:00]
where is you know there's been a lot of concerned about putting a minimum so you can't add less than 1 hour or less than 45 minutes as an example so definitely hear your concern on the research around that topic and will be paying attention to that and will bring you updates specifically on that and would remember Gonzales just in regards to that we were on a conversation with the state superintendents and Charter Schools this morning with the public education department in a variation of that question came up and the response was that in the past the legislature has acted in two ways in one instance they Define what an instructional our was and what counted in another instance they did not so they believe that in this case and this is conjecture because they haven't seen the actual legislation that there will be some definition of what counts as

[00:36:00]
instructional hour and what does not thank you the nmsba platform definitely includes districts having the autonomy to figure out the instructional hours in the day and not just the nmsba but when the partners presented at the lasc in the partners include superintendents on the principals Association the unions the nmsba and they were all on that same page of saying we need to be able to figure this out at the local level great thank you we will go ahead and move on so thank you for discussion is special issues be consideration for approval of revisions

[00:37:00]
and we have Miss TC Riser policy analyst as well as Dr Chanel Segura for this one so you have the floor okay so good evening to Gonzalez members of the board in superintendent Elder tonight we bring before you many board policies for discussion and action and several procedural directives for discussion the policies and procedural directives tonight or within the area of instructional Chanel Segura chief of schools and Joyce Gormley assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction as well as other members of the cabinet leadership and legal are here to assist with any questions that you may have so this first and policy is on page 28 of your electronic documents the policy icy instructional school year calendar is brought for minor changes and updates to administrative and Department positions this is a discussion action item and we will stand for your questions great thank you are there any questions on this one from

[00:38:00]
are you bored I just have a quick just follow up cuz most of my questions were answered but I know this we were told that this is a position that has been has been around but it was just upgraded from the manager position in 2020 because of additional duties so who was responsible for these duties previously Mr torgenson are you here tonight to talk about that since it came from HR he may not have been able to get on he may be here listening but he may not be in a participant mode so calendar committee was run through human resources prior and it was moved because of the impact it had on scheduling

[00:39:00]
can the person that was moved to manages the and supports the schedules that are done at the middle school and high school level so that so that the move was made over to Dr Bowman's department and that's where the change occurred right and that's that's all you know written down I just want to know who is responsible for these duties previously and when it was a manager position what was the salary because I know the salary now is 65,851 Which is higher than even our level two teacher so if you can just get me that answer you know who just did it before and if you could just let me know what the previous salary was when it was a manager position I appreciate it thank you Lord Huron justification deposition is a 2566

[00:40:00]
so so I sat on this committee this year and one thing that I noticed that I would like a little bit more specificity is where it says shall annually convene a committee of parents Community Partners teachers Representatives I would like a little bit more specificity around the fact that those need to be separate entities because what I found happened was we would meet and they would say whose teachers and they raise their hand and then who have you are also parents and so it was a teacher and a parent could be the same person and I think it's very important that if we're listening them out that we have separate groups represented in on this calendar committee I think what that will also alleviate is all of the parents that are interested in the calendar committee and don't have a say until it has already come out

[00:41:00]
so I think when we do this and the other suggestion is that maybe we do have representatives of employee groups we should make sure that the teachers or Educators that are represented are not also attached to the employer group so that again you have representatives from a diverse group cross-section and I think that that needs to be very specific and I did notice that there is a procedural directive that does go it's called the creation of instructional school calendar but I noticed that it was not attached to this policy so I I'm wondering if that's because of the previous discussion where we're waiting to see what the instructional calendar is actually going to look like but that would be where I would also ask that this be brought forth again and that specificity of those groups is really delineated

[00:42:00]
it might have the potential of making that committee a little bit bigger but when we receive questions of why weren't the teachers or why weren't teachers involved because I did have that question and why weren't parents involved then we can be we can point to this procedural directive and say the opportunity was there board member Jackson the procedural directive is being held due to the previous conversation okay that's what I thought and and what I did notice that it under here the policy the procedural directive cross reference mentions school calendar but I think that the actual name of it is creation of instructional school calendar so that will need to be updated in the policy thank you thank you that we will make sure that that change goes out when this procedural directive comes before the board once it does without are there any other questions or is there a motion for approval of

[00:43:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:44:00]
this item is on page 30 of your electronic document the policy ID school day is brought for updates to administrative and Department positions and references we have had one change to the document that is in front of you the position the department position of executive director of instruction and accountability has been added to the document this is a discussion action item and we stand for questions thank you is there any discussion or questions or so repeat that message the department director is now the executive director of instruction and accountability and no no number of Aragon the position executive director of an instruction and accountability was accidentally marked out

[00:45:00]
when we are adding that back onto this because they do do this work okay cuz I saw it marked out so I was like okay I just thank you I'll move for approval a second thank you we have the motion picture please yes Courtney Jackson yes and then you can yes our next discussion item is for the repeal and administrative related to the bell schedule

[00:46:00]
District practices the discussion item and we stand for questions any questions from the board for approval if there are no questions we will continue this policy is on page 34 of your documents policy I have brought for minor changes and updates to the administrative and Department positions again one change the position of executive director of instruction and accountability will remain on this document on this item this policy this is a discussion action item and we stand for questions great thank you Miss Riser any questions or discussion from the boards I have a question associate superintendent

[00:47:00]
for Learning and for leadership and learning is that a new title for area superintendents know that's always been their title they just stopped and referred to as Zone Associates or supposed to say an associate superintendent for Learning and our leadership and learning becomes quite tires okay any other questions in some way shape or form regarding class size I know we are statutory language and basically all the system but there are always gray areas like for instance as we really talk seriously about increasing inclusion how how do we go about

[00:48:00]
counting students how are we where are the resources and how are we counting what specificity within State Statute is there that addresses class size for instance with inclusion classes and this is this is a future discussion I don't expect an answer right now but I think it would be helpful as we think about as we think about this to have a better understanding of what it really means to follow State Statute thank you and noted we have a motion from board member Peterson is there a second this is Josefina thank you dot please just for future reference

[00:49:00]
I'm hoping that I know I need to wrap my head around that in terms of how waivers are applied is it applied by individual schools and how many do we have and where you know is there a particular zones that that's impacting I don't expect an answer for this I think it's it's important in the procedural or this policy but I just wanted to stay that as a future reference you can answer if you want why don't you go ahead and give us your answer and then we'll move forward we don't apply for ways as individual schools we apply as a district there are no ways currently in place okay thank you thank you and I think still a request for more information around how some of these things show up in the broader context of statue and otherwise but with that we will move to our roll call vote Dr all right yes Barbara Peterson yes

[00:50:00]
yes yes Courtney Jackson yes Daniel Gonzalez yes our next item up for up for discussion and action is consideration of for approval of revisions to board policy ih1 treatment of religious issues and I will turn it back over to our presenters the item is on page 36 of your documents policy ih1 treatment for minor changes to content and updates to administrative and Department positions and references again we have a change we need to leave in the executive director of accountability and Reporting we are recommending deleting bullet number five which was not in the original document prior to tonight and this is a discussion action item and we stand for questions

[00:51:00]
so it it is going to be deleted cuz it's not deleted it won't be deleted in your pocket but it is deleted it is a recommended delete in my document if you move to approve with changes I guess Miss Frazier I'd be interested in some more background on that and it's included in here for the educational process and environment but why was it included and then suggesting to remove Dr Segura do you want to talk to what we talked about and yes Madam chairman of the board and we had a reviewed all of these policies specifically with this one and there were some questions around what does that look like

[00:52:00]
for every employee and so and what does providing the right to the students to exercise his her their freedom of conscience and so we felt like it was a little ambiguous and didn't want to put something in there that confused individuals or or that was ambiguous thank you for that it's probably worth some additional discussion from members of the board if they're interested but I will just open the floor more broadly to questions and discussions which can include that fifth bullet as well and he comments board member Peterson I think the spirit of respecting students and their religious beliefs are included

[00:53:00]
in the previous four points from a practical level I have real questions about what this would look like in practice in a classroom I think it could be very problematic and the kinds of decisions and the kinds of physician that it could put teacher and other students in is definitely problematic I mean right now parents definitely have the right to opt out of certain parts of the curriculum if they if they say cheese and I think speaking from experience certainly religious talk about who they are and what they

[00:54:00]
leave but the way this is written I think could open up some some situations that would be very difficult to deal with in a practical way in a classroom thank you other comments questions so I guess I'm still confused it was it was placed in there for a reason so I guess I'm wondering why it was in what what was the I mean it obviously was placed in there with the best of intentions so what was that intention I will I will feel that the comment was actually placed in their prior to this round of that we've been working on for a while in the person that put the edit in there no longer works for Albuquerque Public Schools when I actually took the reference

[00:55:00]
turn down below and researched each one of the references if there wasn't any specific specific legal reference that tied to this paragraph and in reviewing it with Dr Segura we felt like the content was really in the in the bullets up above and this this bullet was a little bit ambiguous we couldn't answer the question of what does that look like in the classroom okay so you're saying that this fifth bullet I'm trying to look back okay so this this was last reviewed in 2013 so and is 2 years ago so you're saying that this fifth bullet was was kind of added but was never discussed and said okay and it doesn't have any cross references as far as policy procedural directors were legal to it it does not have reviewed all of the legal references and it doesn't really fit with any of the legal references in this document

[00:56:00]
I think that better address is that question as to why it was there in the first so I know board member went over her head or hand up and put it down or it was your question answered yes yes yes it was thank you so much like member Peterson said just how this really looks in a classroom is more my concern and to make sure that whatever is taught and I know you know religious literature is from so many different religions is you know quite beautiful and we're studying and I know and I'm certain I know it's not written in here but whatever is taught whatever literature is taught of religious nature would have to align to would have to align to standards correct and I know that's not really

[00:57:00]
can I hear it's just we're just making that assumption so I don't know if that's maybe something that maybe should be put in here I don't know if it should be or not it's just it's just a thought and you all can make that decision the other I mean the concern that I have is it it will obviously leave a lot up to the teacher and deciding you know what religions but one of the responses and I don't know if you want to respond to what I just said if that's just something that you think you should be added board member of the board I feel like absolutely everything that we're teaching should be related to the standards of our state and so when we look at bullet number four

[00:58:00]
I wouldn't be opposed to and we can discuss it adding if we have religious exhibits music or display of religious objects or symbols wait I'm sorry the third the third bullet the sacred literature of all faiths may be studied only for its historical artistic cultural literary or other secular importance and must be aligned to State Standards I mean that's where I wrote that's the one I wrote it in to so I mean that's up to the will of the board and then the only other I know on my response to my questions one of the things I had asked about was you know prayer and I know that a lot of children they I mean they have broader ability to do that then the staff does which is a good thing but one of the things that was written in here and if you could help me is that students made partake in prayer Etc

[00:59:00]
this is not during instructional time or where it may disrupt the educational educational setting so where is that definition of disrupting the educational setting like where would that where would we find that you know where is that where is that defined as it concerns this policy board members of the board there are many things that can be constituted to disrupt the educational setting when we look at the school day outside of the instructional time would be before school during recess during lunch after school but during the instructional time when the teacher is engaging with students it can become a disruption if students begin doing something and it could be anything not just religious

[01:00:00]
deter the learning and the teaching from happening during the instructional the instructional time okay and why I just remember when you know I was teaching and there would during the instructional day I know during lunch time you had you know children that did prayed before they they ate because that's what many of us do and that wasn't a disruption but then it would be a disruption because then I did have children that would stop and say a prayer before they look at or whatever and so that would be considered a disruption because it's during the instructional day is that correct board member Miller going I guess subjectively I would say no because it's not infringing on the learning of others or it's not infringing on the teaching

[01:01:00]
from the teacher so it's it's not impeding any of that so I mean just I could be sitting in prayer right now and not disrupt so yeah I know where you're coming from no that's how I would see it as a teacher and that's how I did see it but I just wanted to know that everybody would see it that way as long as you're not doing something that is you know out loud or too loud is that and that would be disruptive if it impacts others then it would be disruptive okay thank you summarize that I think based on body language and heading it seems like there's pretty significant agreement to strike that bullet but board member the little boy that was added every album and so I just wanted to see how others

[01:02:00]
feel about that with those two changes only for approval wonderful board member Peterson has moved to our approval with those two changes and seconded by board member Montoya Cordova Dr Albright maybe we have a roll call vote please next item for discussion is procedural directions related to revisions to administrative religious issues in Holiday practices and so we talked on this a little bit already is there any other comment from other members of the board on this one I mean the only thing I would say I'm sure that you've all read I know that they were going to strike the Comforts of all students

[01:03:00]
so that was something that was I don't know if you all got that but they were going to strike so that was in my notes so the one change that we made and this is on page 39 of your handouts the change that we made is that number five let's see if change to number 5 to ensure We Struck it was removed to ensure the comfort of all students that line was removed and then the only other thing that I would just just suggest just because I just hear this from parents that have children at different schools and so there are some schools that you know are able to partake in whatever activities they may decide to partake in and then their child goes to another school and then that school doesn't and I understand that is at the discretion of the administrator at the school if we could just please somehow superintendent is just make that more clear to to

[01:04:00]
parents that it is up to the discretion of you know the administration and I just think some parents don't realize that that's why it may be different from one school to another so somehow if we can just get that out there I'd appreciate it thank you so quick question because I'm super on the alert for Resolutions that I haven't seen before in this procedural directive at the bottom it has board policy cross reference a board resolution 90052 resolution that we need to see is that something that needs to be struck is it no longer their number Jackson the last time I asked this question of Brenda Yeager she did say they exist I do not know where they're at so I will have

[01:05:00]
you will need to look into that and get back to you exactly how where those are in if there is a board resolution related to a procedural directive I'd like to see it please and and we also need to know whether or not it actually does relate to this particular issue and then second I did notice that the the policy that corresponds to this has Department directors does include the executive direct me back up the executive director of instruction and accountability but it's missing from the procedural directive it just has school principals so does the department of need to be executive director of instruction and accountability and school principals or for the purposes of the procedural directive is it just the school principals I believe for the procedural activity should just be principals it was both for treatment of religious issues

[01:06:00]
which was in that department but I will double check great thank you board member of Montoya quarterback number 5 where we striking the last part of the sentence I just missed it so we're just we're striking as to ensure the comforters I thought I heard that but I was just wanted to clarify it thank you any other questions or comments on this procedural directive right thank you so we will move ahead to special issues at consideration for approval of revisions to board policy ih3 distance learning this is a discussion and action item and Miss Riser you have before on page 413 requirements updates to administrative and Department position

[01:07:00]
play some references have been made there is again a change that the executive director of instruction and accountability is on this document also in the last paragraph We Are recommending let me see I want to read this correctly we are recommending to delete the added statement and demonstrate academic progress for participating students equivalent or better than their peers participating in in-person learning as measured by state assessments so deleting from the word and demonstrate all the way to the end of Assessments is what we are recommending Greek thank you for that are there any questions or comments from the board thank you for for removing that wording it was very confusing

[01:08:00]
what did I do have a question on the on removing that so it seems important that students are in distance learning settings do demonstrate that academic progress that feels really important and we don't want there to be a difference between students and distance settings versus students and in person settings so that seems important too and we measure them by assessments so I guess I would want to conversation around keeping that supports participating in distance learning shall be included in the assessment of achievement District I mean I'm kind of thinking out loud here too cuz I'm like hopefully I don't get the impression that we're not going to assess them but

[01:09:00]
I don't know I'm not I'm not offering anything up I'm just like I'm trying to clarify and thinking my head because the last sentence tells me that they are participating in assessment that they're included in an assessment of achievement so maybe if that sentence was strengthened or something I think I just think it was going to be taking out with Riser was equivalent or better right cuz it's there's participating by state assessment so we want that in there the only thing is they don't have to be better that's what was confusing equivalent or better but everything else they should be participating in I can correct that in just delete equivalent or better than their peers if that is the preference yeah cuz they are still going to be assessed

[01:10:00]
thank you madam chair members of the board I agree this sentence is very confusing the whole thing is one big kind of run-on sentence but that last part or that part that we're discussing I'm wondering if we you know just like TC said strike the I even think we take out for participating students because that's just like we know who we're talking about already I just I think it just needs to be cleaned up a little bit and made more clear

[01:11:00]
so however we want to to do that I can do that or we can discuss that address the problem just simply to break or better than and to change that to 2:00 want their progress for participating students equivalent to to their peers participating in in-person learning I think the thing that was a question was there may be reasons why a student's opting for virtual learning and if they're doing the same in Virtual learning as they would be doing in person then it's addressing their educational needs what we want what we want to guarantee is that it is not substandard that they are getting a less than education

[01:12:00]
if we just if we kept equivalent and struck or better it seems like it would address both issues so I believe board member Jackson wanted to get in but I'm also willing to try to summarize where I think we landed but go ahead well I was going to summarize where I thought we landed on the floor so I was going to offer a friendly Amendment and hopefully assess where we are so I would offer the friendly amendment of fully aligned with New Mexico content standards and instructional Scopes comma prepare students for all graduation requirements established by the district and demonstrate academic progress for participating students equivalent to their peers participating in in-person learning as measured by state assessments all students participating in distance learning shall be included in the assessment

[01:13:00]
please break that up

[01:14:00]
Courtney Jackson yes and Danielle Gonzales yes thank you our next item for consideration is special issue issues G consideration for approval of revisions to board policy ih6 graduation requirements and doctor and doctor said what do you still have the phone on page 40 336 graduation requirements administrative positions the procedural director for this policy will not be updated until after the legislative session changes that are suggested the last sentence and the first paragraph of the last sentence in the first paragraph would read or is being recommended to read Albuquerque Public Schools encourages might need to be will encourage and provide an opportunity for all seniors to complete the free application for federal student aid

[01:15:00]
for graduation to ensure all students have access to financial aid opportunities for postsecondary education so removing the mandatory and put will provide an opportunity encourage and provide an opportunity thank you any questions on ih6 statement as the mission requirements I like that statement period

[01:16:00]
thank you so a suggestion to make that its own paragraph are there other questions or comments board member Peterson I really like the intent my my question and maybe it will need to be answered in a future procedural directive but I think the strength of it is that it's saying we are responsible for doing how do we handle students into the next stage of their life and this is saying we definitely have an obligation to make it to improving how we handle students into the next stage of their life the question I guess I have is what does that mean for actual implementation and personal I know one of the things that we've struggled with is having adequate

[01:17:00]
your counselors in high schools and I think this is I think in policy it's a great thing to have because it's saying we are prioritizing this we need to do it but when it comes to implementation I think there will be an impact on high schools for making sure that that happens and so it's just attending to make sure that we really do it and that we put the resources there so that it's successful to just stay on this point I do think that is a requirement does put pressure on the district to make sure that kids are prepared in this way on the kids on the students in the families

[01:18:00]
please have changed State policy to require the FAFSA and it's considered to be good practice across the board so I guess I have some concerns with watering down the requirements to the encourage job just put that out there for further conversation I don't know how other members of the board feel I mean I was suggested because it wasn't like in other states where it is something that's a requirement since it's not a requirement that was just my suggestion just to encourage it provide the opportunity just because it wasn't really required like it may be another state but we want to encourage it we want to make sure they have the opportunity to you know that all the schools do provide that opportunity so that's what it's telling them you have to like schools have a FAFSA night so the kids can come help me so that's encouraging them and I want to make sure that they do have that opportunity

[01:19:00]
but not say you have to do it when we don't have anything to back that I guess I was saying because it's not a state requirement that's why we should require it to be better than the state but I know when a board member has her hand up and I think it was just kind of going back I'm trying to remember like all the years on this but there are

[01:20:00]
get that done it's it could be just the lack of their ability to actually even get into that next post-secondary piece thank you board member Jackson it was not that I mean I agree I think you know we can be leaders in this in this instance and you know help our students prepare as they leave you know step out into the real world and have it as a requirement especially if we have Community organizations that are willing to help so I'm fine with the way it was presented in the document thank you doctor I see your hand yes Madam chair and members of the board also agree and I think that in our strategic plan depending on our goals that are established this can absolutely be a strategy that we're working on as a high leverage strategy

[01:21:00]
need to make sure that our kids are prepared for that next level and that goes kind of along with my emphasis on encouraging our kids or requiring our kids to take to units of a language other than English because that also can prevent them from if they change their mind in the future so something to think about can I ask Google does is there anything in the in the application that would impact students that do not have documentation are they protected is the fill out FAFSA okay with that I will she was not a chair and board member Peterson

[01:22:00]
do you have to document their income but it and so that could be something that makes some families nervous but being undocumented does not impact the students the family or the application process thank you I'm sorry and there is a suggestion to make its own Standalone thank you have a place and I just confirmed the statement will now read Albuquerque Public Schools will require an opportunity for all seniors

[01:23:00]
complete the FAFSA a seniors are all students in our document no changes right now it says Albuquerque Public Schools shall require students to complete the FAFSA for graduation changes its at seniors right so we wanted to go back to all students yes yes Crystal revisions to renaming the administrative

[01:24:00]
GED testing to high school equivalency exam this is just a discussion item so is there any discussion questions or suggestions for this procedural directive I am seeing head shaking so we will move on to H consideration for approval to repeal and archive board policy IH 6A alternative demonstration of Competency for graduating class of 2014 to 2015 and 2020 16 this is also discussion item sorry discussion action I don't know doctor if you want to provide any contacts or is it seems pretty clear with the contact is but I will turn it over I think it's pretty clear so this is a it's a discussion now and we stand for questions so maybe we have a roll call vote Dr all right

[01:25:00]
administrative and Department positions and references one change again we are adding in executive director of instruction and accountability under Department positions and this is a discussion action item and we stand for questions so Madam chair the only question I have why why is correspondence

[01:26:00]
providers and non-accredited institutions why were they remove now or is this something that we haven't done for a while and it was just kind of updating it hasn't been updated since 2013 is yes something that is not really a practice in place and then the non-accredited institutions it's I feel strongly that if we're going to be affording our students a New Mexico diploma of Excellence that we have some

[01:27:00]
standing of what that means and when students are coming from non-accredited institutions there's a reason why they're not accredited and that is a red flag and so that was that was the premise so then in the in the last well almost 10 years since this has been reviewed have the instructional credits been accepted from non-accredited institutions or have they not anyway board member of the board I can't speak to that I know that in my experience that is not practice to accept non-accredited courses because some there have been situations where I mean I could have so good as homeschooling and just have my you know student register their senior year

[01:28:00]
it makes it very difficult for a district and a board to certify and for superintendent to certify that that is an actual diploma of excellence and so I can't speak to the history of APs I don't believe so but that's usually not a common practice to accept non-accredited credit card used to be more of an issue in Albuquerque there was a specific school that we had to deal with and because the policy existed we were stuck but it was always a discussion that school no longer exists I think what you're discovering is if you're not accredited you're going to have a very difficult time driving and that's really not where I was going I am thinking about is a lot of our Refugee kids so we accept credits from

[01:29:00]
I will tell you as a principal has served in Highland High School and certainly had that we accepted the credits as best we could as we could determine what they aligned to as far as meeting requirements in in the state many times would take those credits and play them as elective so for example if they took a history of their country many times it would be accepted as an elective but we the ability to determine the accreditation of an Afghanistan Afghanistan school would be probably be on most for registrar so if they show up at working with the refugee Services we made the airport to to accept what we could and because we we know and I mean I know and I know you know superintendent that there are many of these refugees that have been in a school they've been in a camp so they wouldn't even have really anything it would just be you I don't know

[01:30:00]
play again the populations of change so for me to speak to each specific population at this point is probably not appropriate but I do know there were students who showed up with you know courses and what it did was it gave us a sense of what grade to place them in at least and give us a sense of where we could most effectively help them because some of them came quite frankly someone came with great math skills you know and they may struggle with language skills there were certain systems that had pretty strong education systems and and the students attended so it helped us in terms of placement less than credit because most of them were quite interested in having the opportunity to do the four year experience was high school for example Middle School was really just about placement an elementary I would tell you this that if this suddenly became an issue that the policy was getting in the way of our placement of refugee students we would bring it back

[01:31:00]
we can't place these kids because of this policy I don't believe the practice will change I believe the practice is as it is and I think they're safe but I assure you that if I get stories that Refugee students are no other place because we we we pulled out and on a credit score and they don't know how to play some will bring it back when it does say not limited too yes should we say public schools and other states and countries accepting students from Public Library I don't see any reason why I would be uncomfortable with that

[01:32:00]
okay then I guess I would propose that change and are there other questions or comments or emotional with the change I like that with the other countries all second this is Peggy thank you that was board member moving for approval with an addition of and countries and board member Colorado going to Second so Dr Albright may we have a roll call vote please next we have several directives that are related to this policy and so I'm just going to hand them over to miss her in a chunk we have transcript evaluation basis of offering credit alternative methods of Vernon credit awarding of credit or extra credit for non-academic activities I think that's

[01:33:00]
is there anything that you wanted to say I was muted I apologize I was talking this first one transcript evaluation is on page 57 and we do know that it is a little bit confusing when we talked about a junior high school so this transcript evaluation procedural directive is really talking about when we evaluate a 9th grade students credits when they were at a junior high school which was 788 and 9th grade and so it really outlines what other districts have a junior high and how we accept those credits just to kind of explain that and so those changes have some changes have been made to make it a little bit more clear and then we all stand for any questions that you have great thank you any questions on transcript of

[01:34:00]
probation procedural directive I did Madam chair so on the bottom is Riser on page 58 number for it says transfer students from non-accredited schools will be ranked for the graduating class only at the final four semesters are completed in APS high school and I know we I mean I would just like to have a little more discussion about that was there going to be a change to change that to two semesters instead of four semesters that's my main question from 9:00 board members of the board again going back to when we are providing the student with a New Mexico diploma of excellence and when we are including them in the cohort of students who have been in our district

[01:35:00]
to to include them into a ranking or for their graduation honors many districts require 50% or more of their experience be within that District or school so that transfer students for example can't come in and bump a student who has been there I'm out of that ranking for example so looking at the four semesters as being the minimum of 50% of their High School time to be counted in those situations okay so then can you so one of the responses that I got had been that in practice it has been the final

[01:36:00]
masters of your senior year excluding summer school so then I'm hearing a little bit something different so then the recommendation is to change to quote enrolled in an APS high school for two consecutive semesters excluding summer school so that would aligned with the registrar's handbook and current practice so is that does the registrar's handbook say something different and it says two which has been the practice so I'm just I'm just confused about what you're saying and then about what is written here and board member Mueller article on a member of the board I may have to refer to Joyce formerly on this one maybe we were in our conversation or maybe we were referring to a different part of the policy would you like to respond

[01:37:00]
yes good evening board members of I believe that Dr Segura and I were discussing a different we talked about actually changing for semesters to 44 semesters and elective in a different procedural directive in regards to students that enter from a non-credit non-accredited school and so this policy actually the recommendation is to align with the current practice that's in the course catalog that states to consecutive semesters not including so much so I apologize we we went over so many different procedural directive yesterday that I that you know when they both talked about ranking they both talked about senior year one was specifically to students that came from non-accredited school and then this one is not necessarily for students coming from schools

[01:38:00]
okay so there will be the change so there is that alignment then with the registrar's handbook so it will that will be a change that is going to be made then correct that's correct okay so I think the only the only changes going to be where it's going to just be aligned with the registrars where it's just going to be changed remember Dominguez where it will say enrolled in an APS high school for two consecutive semester excluding summer school so then it would aligned with the registers handbook is that one that's what you were referring to them I think we would maintain

[01:39:00]
number four in that it would keep it as the final four semesters for this particular section okay so are we all clear on this one and are there other questions or suggestions for this procedure so we can move on to the next Christmas update to one credit with University or college credit with a 1:23 ratio so it was adjusted just a little bit

[01:40:00]
it will stand for questions on that one thank you any questions on this one I am not seeing any Miss razor so we can move on to the next procedural directive alternative methods of earning credit this is on page 666 of your hand outs and nothing different than what your pockets says so the although there was one mistake the the number three and in the paragraph the three were struck and those have been put back in and that is on number three in the document 3 and 3 we're stuck with places where there's number three so what was the language change so

[01:41:00]
Joyce do you have can you answer this one stroke and it shouldn't have been struck okay yes I believe you remember I believe she's referring to number 3 on page 66 where the number three in referring to three classes and have approval of the student must enroll in an APS high school for at least three classes and have approval it was just mistakenly strong thank you we were just having a problem following where on the document so that makes sense because otherwise the sentence would not have made sense I'm sorry any other questions related to this procedural directions to Elemental question that I should probably know the answer but as I look at this am I reading it right that in short as we

[01:42:00]
look at increasing apprenticeship internship kinds of opportunities Capstone projects all of those things as I look at some of these these three procedural directives do these relate to those things in terms of how we determine credit and make sure that students are recognized for the work and learning that they are doing or does it have nothing to do with any of those things board member at Peterson alternative methods of earnings credit we're looking at things such as dual credit

[01:43:00]
that discussion has taken place with our legislators and superintendents regarding opening up or thinking outside the box of how we can engage our kids more within our communities and so yes that would be part of this thank you I had another one that I'm sure that I just caught so on on page 67 under online courses so it does say courses that apis is a primary source for online course work and then it goes on to say courses from other institutions which are taking concurrently will not be posted to the student transcripts without prior written approval from the school principal so they will have to get approval from the school principal for them to be posted to the transcript but even when they're posted to the transcript if they got an A to an A B C D or F

[01:44:00]
that letter grade is not going to be posted to the transcript even if they have approval to take the class is I'm understanding that correctly then I mean because it is an online this is not talking about non-accredited it is saying private online accredited institutions but they're not going to get a letter grade posted to the transcript I don't understand why not what member board members I believe that justification or the reasoning behind this I think this was worked on back in June and I believe that the time there was sometimes we have families that will come at the beginning or middle of a school year and say my my student took this class from this online

[01:45:00]
school and now I want the honors credit and the I wanted to to advance him in math so that he can get into a higher math and sometimes that disrupts what the schools can offer that student and we can't guarantee the rigor or the instructional scope from even though it's an accredited Unit School it doesn't necessarily aligned to the same standards that are students are provided in our classes but I think part of this was so that family have thoughtful conversations with their school counselors and administrators before enrolling their students in a private online course that may not be of the same level and rigor and provide the same instruction that they can get in their local school and then I think it also helps equalize

[01:46:00]
Plainfield when it comes to providing honors or AP additional weighted credits I think that was the intention of this okay and I mean I just have a little bit of trouble with that because I know my daughter took an online class accredited and you know she did get you know she was given a grade for it so I just think there are some institution it just works better for some kids and just to say you're not going to get a great that you obviously earned and it's not going to get put on the transcript I just I mean I just don't find that to be fair but that's just my opinion thank you for that so we will move on to procedural directive awarding of credit or extra credit for non-academic activities Mrs

[01:47:00]
this is on page 73 of your documents and we have no additional changes to this so we stand for questions thank you are there any questions from the board there are no questions so we will move on to the next agenda item which is consideration for approval of revisions instructional resources and materials this is on page 75 of your documents policy instructional resources and materials for minor changes to content and update to administrative and Department positions we made no additional changes this is a discussion action item and we stand for questions thank you are there any questions from members of the board I have a comment and a suggested change board member in the second paragraph students

[01:48:00]
shell compensate the school district in case of lost destroyed unnecessarily damaged textbooks and or other instructional materials this came up let's see a concern came up sometime when I was out and about talking to parents given our close to 4000 homeless children families and our 54,000 students living in poverty language that is a little more forgiving acknowledges that many unfortunate result in damaged materials of parents

[01:49:00]
some some kind of language that I'm sure we already work with people right with families just stating that old is a little bit of the practice is that we work with families some cases circumstances

[01:50:00]
pussy present themselves to State Statute that this is State materials and we are supposed to make an effort to you know at least return some compensation over the end of the school year there are I believe and miss you if I believe there is a procedural directive that actually addresses this that gives the leeway to the schools so with this being the policy we don't necessarily need to address it in the policy because I believe and I'm trying to find it quickly there is a

[01:51:00]
digital directive we actually discussed this before you write thank you for reminding me it is in the procedural directed the schools have the leeway to work with families and and they do that's just the practice because it sounds like I was just going to say it sounds like you suggest that we just referenced that procedural directive and cut this sentence students shall compensate personally I I think it needs to stay I mean personal opinion is that the way it's written fine the procedural directives just need to be cross-referenced I see one here but I believe in the emails that I sent to a particular constituent I attached like two more I mean there are copious amounts of procedural directives regarding so I think they just need to be added in that regards and then I have something else when it when we get to

[01:52:00]
I think it would be easier if it started out in the event of loss destroyed or unnecessarily damaged textbooks and or other instructional materials every effort is made to have students compensate the school district because I think if we start with what the issue is rather than it just reads harsh the students show compensate I think that's that's what probably hanging us up a little bit that's what hung me up a little bit but I just say that I think if we started with what the issue is in the event of that you know the students you know every effort is made to assist students and compensating the district or something like that thank you not in your head with that type of change responsibility schools will make every effort to assist students I like that

[01:53:00]
in compensating so miss Frazier and Dr Albright did you capture that change kind of clothes I believe that I have the majority of it and we'll go back and listen to make it I have any events of lost and destroyed equipment every effort will be made to assist students in company it's just switching it around but I need to take it out of the end and put it in the beginning and then I know board member Jackson I think wanted to take us in a different direction I did

[01:54:00]
is there anything else on that piece related to the compensation so this one kind of hits home for me and in the fact that it's in the instructional resources and materials and I'm struck by the sense that there's nothing in here about the requirement of teachers using approved materials and so I wonder if there is a way that we can add you know required textbooks you know under that first paragraph you add something like any teacher not implementing District approve curriculum or textbooks must seek to ensure alignment of their materials to New Mexico Court content standards because I mean this is we buy these textbooks for a reason we we then issue them free to our students and then our teenagers come home with books that are wrapped

[01:55:00]
and so I think that it's important that the instructional resources and materials that we use and that we work that there is a requirement that they are used and that we add this to the policy thank you I see doctor yes board member Jackson of this policy it's how we are as a district are providing the instructional resources of materials to students and how we manage those materials within our district

[01:56:00]
what you're referring to I believe are in our other instructional policies that were going that were still reviewing and updating but I will consider what you said as we move into a revision of those policies so should this be the title be shifted them just to be more clarifying is like the provision of instructional resources and materials I think that would be more appropriate could you repeat that please I just changed the title of it to read the provision of instructional resources and materials thank you clarified that this policy is just about the provision and we'll review a policy in the future related to how those resources are used in the classroom okay

[01:57:00]
let me see if you wanted to link it to the correct procedure directive does board member Jackson is student fees find some charges and section J I texted it to you thank you thank you Google agrees as well so making sure that we have some processes in place to ensure that the money we're spending with that are there any other questions on this one with the changes made I will move for proof of thank you thank you

[01:58:00]
77 we have made no additional changes to that document that we are presenting so if there are any questions any questions on that one selection of library media print material we can go on to the

[01:59:00]
next one the next one is on page 80 and we have made no additional changes to the documents do you need suggestions or questions related to library media disposition of outdated materials either great thank you any additional questions or comments on procedural directive for copyright compliance thank you then we will move on to agenda item under special issues Kay consideration for approval of revisions this is on page 89 of your documents policy IJ one

[02:00:00]
change it to content updates to administrative and Department positions and references and in addition to Dr sgoda we I believe we have Dr Blakey to assist with any questions on this document thank you any questions on this one travel a second from board member Colorado on student Insurance deciding is on page 92 of your documents and we have made no additional changes to the document either

[02:01:00]
thank you Miss Rider any questions or comments from the board on this procedural directive is this to cover the Cancun senior trips no ma'am we do not allow OK Google

[02:02:00]
I have issues to I am teaching you about controversial elections of issues and the side of us on page 94 of your documents and we have made no additional changes it does have some changes to a title that has a title update minor changes to content and administrative and Department positions and references and with that we stand for any questions this is a discussion action item you any questions on this one I'll move for people my second thank you we have a motion from board member Peterson in a second from board member Dominguez can we have a roll call vote

[02:03:00]
controversial issues and outside speakers this is on page 96 of your documents and we have made no additional changes to what you have in your pocket we stand for questions board member Morada on snow on the I think number four it says that teachers must inform and get written approval from their principles and I get that part so my question is there have to be also approval from the parents or the parents have to be told about who the speaker is is that correct like a head of time board member of going Madam chair and members of the board yes so it is always in good practice to anytime you're going

[02:04:00]
bring any guests into a classroom that parents are made aware of of that guest speaker so that if it's something that they don't agree with as far as a topic or the individual that their student can be provided with an alternative engagement so I saw that a number two if there was you know matter of principle that they would be able to receive an alternative activity but my question just because I have had you know parents tell me that they heard about the speaker after the fact and they didn't approve of it but it was already it was too late so then my question is if they're told about a guest speaker are they all talked with that guest speaker is going to be speaking about

[02:05:00]
is that like on a form somewhere where the parents will know board member Miller I am not sure that we have a district flight form for that I know schools have individual forms regarding like for example if you just speak her or a movie that's going to be shown in classroom home to inform and get permission from the parent or Guardian so we can definitely add something in here if that's something we want to do and we can work on that so that principals know that should be the expectation in the schools right cuz I know whenever you're going to show a film if it's going to be our rated PG or whatever that you have to send that out so the parents know when they know exactly what's going on but

[02:06:00]
is it concerns outside speakers I've heard too many times of parents just had had no idea what the speaker was going to be speaking about so I would I've just heard it too many times as a concern so if you could add something like that so that principals do know they need to let them know ahead of time about the speaker and also what the speaker is going to be speaking about I think that will allow a lot of parents concerns about hearing something after the fact it's hard to you know say I don't agree with something in principle and it already happened and then it's too late because you can't hear what a speaker said so if we could do this and be proactive to the front of that sentence period potential controversial issues and outside speakers and proposed content in advance period

[02:07:00]
but generally then I would also make parents slash Guardian wherever parent shows up throughout does that work for you and so then that that would be what you can take to cabinet for discussion are there other suggestions or questions on this one I just want to point out that I did submit some some corrections number three under parents to the accomplishment of the district's goals just to accomplish the district goals and and those sorts of but I will say number five it just needs my suggestion is subject Translate

[02:08:00]
stay out of the typographical and grammar at it will offer that suggestion in advance for trust that that will be considered as well great thank you I think we're ready to move on to the next procedural directive which is human sexuality and HIV AIDS instructions this document is on page 99 of your handouts and we have no additional changes from the document in front of you but that will stand for questions that's great thank you board members are there any questions or comments on this one I definitely do so I know I had said and and my the response I received from you all that the language in the code was just causing some confusion is what you had said and but when you're looking here

[02:09:00]
did tell me that the HIV and AIDS wording it's still stands in here but yet for our elementary students and it says all students in the Elementary grades but that's not what I was told was being taught that that was not being taught until 5:00 which is what I remember when I was teaching but when you look at it still says that even though you all told me it's not being taught at kindergarten first second third fourth grade it's still says provide HIV AIDS instruction in the curriculum haunted area to all students in the Elementary grades and so if it's not mandated in all to all students that shouldn't that word

[02:10:00]
I'm going to try to join us tonight to discuss this and procedural objective but she is actually traveling and unable to log on so I will take your feedback back to her as this is a procedural directive for more review thank you did you have anything else for remember no I just was hoping that it's really the first paragraph that has to just get fixed if we are not going to Garden to 4th graders then that wording has to get changed so if you could just take it away with the required health education content area to students in alignment with the New Mexico Administrative Code so that we don't tie ourselves to what grade is it is but it's just in alignment to that yeah thank you for that

[02:11:00]
change change change the first line of this procedural directive is being deleted and the paragraph updated concerned so I'm trying to find out joy can you speak to this one because I'm trying to find the change Business formerly

[02:12:00]
I am but I apologize to see I did not work on this procedure directive so I don't have the amendments to that paragraph it is the okay so what is being changed is the line that says it is difficult to legally remove materials once they've been placed into the library collection and I don't see that I think that's in a different section I believe that's a little bit later and that's enough what's in front of you is do you have any questions about the one in front of you I do I have a question sorry okay so yeah this is the right one so I guess I have an overall procedural question there's a lot of

[02:13:00]
do you have 15 days and then another 5 days and then all of these things and then we put together a committee so I guess going back to the very beginning what happens to the document or the item of concern while this entire process is is going we're going through this entire process like if there is something that is a legitimate concern is it removed until we've gone through this process or is it does it retained until we go through this process I believe it's retained until we go through the process but we'll have to verify that with myself

[02:14:00]
already been placed in the collection but there's this lingering but if there is a concern about the document we don't actually know what happens during the process for the document so I would be interested to know certainly something we can get back to you on going back to the selection process it's already been approved it's already been through a process which is why it's in the collection in the first place and so there's a reason why it's there if someone finds it objectionable and students have access to material based on

[02:15:00]
can parents concern when it's already been through the process to be in the collection like I said I'm simply telling what I believe to be true that I will need to speak to miss out the Bella to get the actual process I understand what you're asking but I do believe because it's already been placed in the collection it stays in the collection till the process is done yeah I'd like to hear from from Miss antibody and just it's just a curiosity that I have and so I'd like to know the answer questions related to parental concerns about instructional materials I mean the only thing I would kind of go with what number Jackson was saying because that was like kind of my concern because it does say it's legally difficult to remove materials once they are already placed into the collection so it's difficult to do but then it says

[02:16:00]
parents are able to have those media materials considered so I think it's there has to be some kind of like clarification I understand once it's in there you have to go through this whole process so what you want to make sure is before it's housed in the library that you've done everything that needed to be done because once it's there it's obviously difficult to have it have it removed and so I think that that just somehow needs to be clarified because it makes it seem like okay parents might object to something but it's almost going to be almost impossible legally to get the stuff removed but yet you're telling parents that they can be reconsidered so I just think you all have to look at it and just make it just work clear so it sounds like they will do that I had one question which is so the time of this is Parental concerns about instructional materials but it reads that it's largely about

[02:17:00]
parental concerns about library media materials not instructional materials which is more a catch-all for textbooks curriculum technology etcetera so my question is suggestion is should we change the title or should we add and clarify around instructional materials as well and I will say based on my experience with my kids and when I had concerns about the instructional materials it wasn't because of anything controversial in the library it was because the content was way too low for my kids so if my teacher is giving my sixth grader third grade content that is no proved textbook what do I do as a parent so is that something that would fall under this or is there some other recourse for parents around that I believe the record would I don't believe it's a concern about the material it's the the actual practice of the teachers

[02:18:00]
decision to provide that child so to me it's more of a matter to be discussed with the school Authority and in terms of a change of practice well I understand that things don't always work out to everyone's satisfaction I understand your story I'm just saying I don't believe it's actually a procedure directive I think because I don't believe it doesn't relate to the material it relates to the practice of how it was applied I understand your point so I guess so the question is does this need to be parental concerns about library media or something rather than instructional materials which within education terminology does have a broader connotation is sort of the first question the second is maybe this comes in later procedural directives doctor but what what can parents do when they have concerns about the quality of content and questionable alignment to standards so those are both just suggestions and questions I know it's a procedural directives so we don't have to

[02:19:00]
any other questions or comments on this one I think that's it a good clarification definitely thank you we will move forward to criteria for use of video and other instructional audio visual media this item is on page I just wanted to you mentioned the language is difficult to legally remove which is up on page 77 in selection of library media print on print which we already went through so I just wanted to mention that when I did a control sign I don't know if there's reason to go back there if there was comment you wanted to make on that before we keep moving to criteria for use of video I Believe Miss Ali has recommended a change in some language but I'm not sure at this point which procedural

[02:20:00]
call directive attend so she is working on both of those based on the feedback we received through the questions okay so there may be additional suggested changes to selection of library media print non-print material which was considered earlier in the agenda so I was sorry to interrupt you but I don't want to lose that thread so go ahead with criteria okay so the next one is use the videos and films and there are no additional changes to that document for questions thank you questions or comments from the board and then we can keep procedural directive animals in school including service animals so this is on page one oh six of I'm sorry this is on page 111 of your documents and there are no additional changes in

[02:21:00]
thank you questions or comments from the board on animals in school it makes me sad one of the best days that I ever had in first grade was the day we brought our dogs it was a good day and there was a lot of learning that went along with it luckily there were no bites there are multiple children if there are no comments on this one that we can continue to move ahead to the next procedural directive exemptions from health or physical education the document is on page 115 of your electronic documents and there are no additional changes so we will stand for questions

[02:22:00]
wait I have to step back I'm sorry I'm not ready thank you all right thank you so I think there are no questions on this one and we'll move to the procedural directive on flag display and Pledge of Allegiance from this razor go ahead and take that one flag display and Pledge of Allegiance is on page 120 of your handouts and we have no additional changes to this document thank you question mark if we could just have a reminder to all the schools I don't want to call out certain teachers your schools that don't have children so if you could just send out a reminder everyone cuz I'm not going to call people out and do that thank you to do what remind them about the regulations around in the

[02:23:00]
which are has to be said but no one shall be coerced into participation you have to provide the opportunity for the Pledge of Allegiance thank you high school is on page 1225 through that one and go on to the next one reasonable restraint and seclusion reasonable to the PED guidance and updates to law administrative and Department positions and references

[02:24:00]
did it fix the first bullet in the lower section to read prone restraint and which a student is held face down on the floor while or another service in a restraint technique which impedes the ability to breathe or speak is not allowed and this language is directly from the PED guidance so it's almost exactly word for word from PD Guidance with that little stand for questions oh I'm sorry there is one additional change and that the executive director of accountability and Reporting is added as a department position for this thank you board members any questions or comments on this one board member Peterson so I think the language is absolutely essential

[02:25:00]
the one thing that crosses my mind and this may not even be lying in the procedural directive but this is when when a child needs to be restrained it is a traumatic experience frequently for everyone involved staff as well as the child and so in practice whether it's in the procedural directive one of the things that comes up I think just because of how short staffed available Personalities in school so frequently then there's also never time or frequently there is not time for

[02:26:00]
bring back and reviewing what happened how it happened what could have been done differently and I think that lets us not move forward as positive way either for the health and safety of Staff or the health and safety of students and I think some kind of recognition of what of when a child reaches that point of needing to be restrained there are all sorts of things that have led up to it and that continue afterwards and to be really intentional about supporting staff supporting students I think it's realistic I don't have any specific language but I think it's something that we really need to address thank you board member Peterson so there is the added

[02:27:00]
play in documentation reporting related to reintegration so I think it is adding the concept of reintegration up above into the technique section would be the suggestion but reviewing the what led up to the incident is what I mean give a complete information part of the process is to look for the triggers it's part of the process of of when we sit down and review the situation what triggered it so that we can try to remove those triggers if possible in the future you know we do the analysis

[02:28:00]
and all this but is there is there anything that sort of compiles that at the district level so that we look for Trans and we look for an understand like where there might be some difficulties so it just kind of fell short for me on the annual review piece because I think it's at the school level it's important to but it doesn't State anything about action or what they do with that annual review board member and members of the board I know that the way that it is collected happens differently in different districts and so I will refer to our associate superintendent for special education even though this can also take place outside of special education and we realized that as well so if she is samitra

[02:29:00]
evening members of the board so did the new guidance on the update does follow the PED memo that we received in July of 2021 what recommends that we review annually all instances of frustrating seclusion for all students at the school level really looking at reviewing the information and looking at how we're supporting students additional training that's needed we do provide the nonviolent Crisis Intervention training it's offered to all schools that really looks at D escalation and ways to support students in maintaining their behavior behavior management strategies and ways to create a cultural of integrating restorative practices and seal into our schools to really help create that spectrum of intentional relationships with our students and looking at

[02:30:00]
and into the classrooms and I understand that I guess we're still just falling short for me is that I know that that's done at a school site or a school level right and this annual review of all the incidences so I'm wondering if like how does the district utilize that information to sort of identify Trends or to identify challenges you know places that may be additional technical assistance is needed so I just I just I just didn't understand that part to me it says like it's good to do an annual review but I didn't understand to what to what end by how does that how does that review get sort of rolled up into understanding you know as a district and our seclusion procedural directives are they being followed with Fidelity you know is

[02:31:00]
the part to provide the ongoing TA or assistance on that I think it's important to look at it also collectively so that we can just make sure that we can identify if there's you know if there is there are incidences that seem you know that rise or there's gaps or there's also opportunities maybe there are places where there's best practices and things that did go well but I'm just I was just curious about that I mean it's like an annual review is a good thing but and then what president we are looking at ways to systemize our process since it's something that's a new requirement from PB and receive that memo at the end of July we're working to to do a better job at really creating those processes to best support students and working across departments to provide those

[02:32:00]
I really want to emphasize some when we talked about this let's talk about restraint we don't utilize seclusion and the only reason the language is still here is it's in the statute and it's in the the bad guidance but I really want to be clear we we eliminated seclusion rooms we do not utilize that technique any longer so we're not talking about restraining schools we're really just talking about restraint so superintendent is if we aren't using seclusion it seems we should say that I agree what I believe what I was advised by legalism the language of the law and really follows the guidance I certainly willing to reconsider that because we don't

[02:33:00]
practice seclusion and I just think that's an important point to be made and so I think we can keep much of the technical language that follows from the statute of values from the sport Albuquerque Public Schools is committed to providing safe environment for all students Crisis Intervention techniques are intended to Etc we can insert a sentence there take out the seclusion and say clearly directly it is the policy of the Albuquerque Public Schools to not use seclusion and as a technique which means we get rid of and or seclusion this policy or this procedural with legal it was the recommendation that we directly follow the PED guidance for this procedural directive so MIA is I've texted her to see if she can jump in but that was the legal guidance that we received was to follow the PED guidance exactly

[02:34:00]
I understand that you know we have gotten rid of the quote unquote seclusion rooms but the way that the term is used within the PED memo again the guidance

[02:35:00]
we keep both of those in there for the procedure directive and so we can have a further discussion about that and I can provide some additional Insight if needed thank you that's helpful and I do think that is legal guidance makes sense for the procedural directive and it is worth considering what our policy says about seclusion industry and so I think with this one there was just the suggestion from board member Montoya Court the annual review section to say what section to say what happens with that so that maybe the report is presented to the superintendent and targeted technical assistance and support is provided or something like that other questions on this phone and our policy committee meeting so the next policy committee meeting will be

[02:36:00]
W in February at 5:00 p.m. in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alice and Bruce King educational complex and this meeting is adjourned
