[00:39:00]
Andrea Quintana from the New Mexico Network said about Dr Blakey Gabriella has proved support and encourage has provided support and encouragement for all APS teachers through the completion Network to transform the teaching Grant she attended Lee teacher meeting symposiums and several school meetings to learn about this important work and she was doing this while she was supervising over 40 school at the same time this is the kind of work that is so meaningful and that our Educators like Gabriella know and and just can't stay away from from this success she has led the way and pushed for district funding to be provided for 30s to continue with the accomplished teaching Pilots school program these schools will work with teacher lead professional

[00:41:00]
if I teachers and is changing the culture of our profession we see it every single day Violetta jovetic said Dr Bailey Blakey has been involved in the work and activities of the New Mexico national board certified teachers Network since she first attended our annual conference in 2017 think about all she's done in less than a year since then she's been involved in many Network activities and events she was instrumental in establishing the continuity of the network to transform teaching APS pilot program and was able to extend the work to 30 schools who will this year have an opportunity to use title to funds to create professional development around accomplished teaching she fully understands and supports the work of the New Mexico

[00:42:00]
NBC tea Network and clearly sees the benefits of increasing the number of national board certified teachers in the aps district one of the things I have to mention is that APS has the highest number of board nationally board certified teachers in the nation and now I think we're probably going to double and triple and quadruple that Dr Gabriella Blakey would you please come to the podium don't hide with the family and friends of Dr Blakey please stand so that we can meet you

[00:47:00]
director for Americans for Prosperity for a non-profit nonpartisan that is based here in New Mexico and on behalf of my 25,000 members were here tonight will be here in duration to oppose the idea of this tax increase on the citizens of the city of lifelong resident of Albuquerque New Mexico the tax that you're looking to increase on average home in Albuquerque you're going to increase 455 in taxes and for somebody with their first child young family low income as many of us know in New Mexico has or a senior on fixed income that is a very challenging thing for them to come up with that kind of money and I don't think that this is the most prudent way to do this after we just saw the tax increase yesterday on the vote that we had in the city for you guys to come back again to look for more money when we have a lot of ways to get the the teacher some increase in pay if that's really necessary then we can look at that but I don't

[00:48:00]
support the idea we do not support the idea of raising the taxes in this manner and we will be working diligently to bring an information to you guys and to the constituents to work to find a way to solve the problem that you may see that you need to look at but we're going to work with you guys to find a way to do this otherwise so that we can have a thriving economy and we also have families who have enough disposable income to put food on the table and 4555 a month is a burden it's a tough thing for you guys to look at that free of every family in a house in someone in especially for the businesses as well they're going to pay money in special for those persons starting their first company trying to get their first business off the ground I would just urge you to look at another way to do this to not go forward with this tonight and we will be diligently working to oppose this and our members on behalf of all of them will be working hard to to make sure we take a different direction thank you for your time bye-bye

[00:49:00]
chairman and board members my name is Eliana and the president of New Mexico education Improvement project a non-profit organization designed to help people understand and improve education here in New Mexico as I have talked to people about this Mill Levy tax I have gotten several more than several a lot of comments about what this would do to their families I talked with an older woman whose husband just recently passed away and since 1999 her taxes have steadily increased from 3,000 to 6000 she's going to have to sell her home and move away because of taxes and she said I can't afford for another tax increase to begin we don't need any more buildings we have the money in the budget you guys have a 1.3 billion dollar budget that you can use in a proper

[00:50:00]
play to spend on repairing maintaining and fixing the buildings that we already have we have new buildings that we don't even use and so the people that I have talked to are very upset about this tax and don't want it and I just want you to know that we're going to work very very hard to get the word out about it and to do something about this because we don't need it here in New Mexico with all of the bonds that passed yesterday that's a lot of money that we're going to be increased already and for you guys to do this in February it seems like it's being done on the slide because we don't have an election in February any longer House Bill 98 was passed and the new election is in November and we should always make sure that we're doing our bond elections at the time the appointed time instead of doing it at a separate time when it doesn't need to be done we will work very very hard to oppose this thank you

[00:51:00]
my name is Julie hinceman I'm a parent I'm here to ask you all when it comes to the budget decisions for next year to provide more money for special education for training of staff and hiring of Specialists like bcbas certified and applied behavioral analysis and dyslexia as well as oversight of those monies that are generated by the special education students through the state Equalization guarantee I would like to share my story with you to provide a context for my request my son started with APS at the elementary who's teachers are amazing but did not know what services APS have included assistive Technologies and no dyslexia specialist when transferring to

[00:52:00]
what's the score of the middle school tonight are request for a transitional IEP for Rd level son they were unaware of the idea law as were we Madison Middle School did not Implement Sean's IEP due to staff shortages his inclusion special ed teacher was permanently pulled out of the inclusion classroom to teach another class leaving my son without support leaving the regular red teachers without support after many unanswered emails we finally got two meetings the second with the support principal however within four and a half weeks of that meeting my son was suspended twice and we were called to take him home three additional times or strongly advised us to pull him as he was having suicidal ideation the principal made his first phone call to me after my son told several people he was going to a different school there was such a voicemail I am concerned by what

[00:53:00]
can we meet to discuss things I'm happy to say that my son is now succeeding academically emotionally and socially he is actually soaring and doing incredibly well in a private special education school but it is not inclusion thank you before we start the clock I'd like the chairman he doesn't want to be left out I would like to address the appalling conditions of special education here in New Mexico that special complaint result

[00:54:00]
play five violations of the idea in which APS was cited it's been nearly a year and I have not seen the corrections that were supposed to happen we have a group of parents that we formed a group called open organizing parents educational Network we all have children that have disabilities we have spent each and every one of you a personal invite to come to one of our first session that are held Thursdays at 6:30 thank you Mr Garcia for attending and I'm proud to be in your District you know my life has been about music I have nine children until a few years ago and while I appreciate the Beautiful music the children did this evening please keep in mind that our only Avenue of talking to all of you as parents are doing these 1 to 2 minutes it's almost an insult to explain what each parent has gone through

[00:55:00]
rewind to 2 minutes in our info sessions we present our personal stories you have two handouts from us one is a systemic issues that we've developed since January especially here in APS we encourage you to read those and on each one is an invite again for you to attend one of our meetings with an email address we understand New Mexico Coast but we expect more for our children with special education needs thank you ok Google

[00:56:00]
you're very concerned about that proposed increase of nearly 20% in the mill Levy and and the reason is this according to my calculations APS revenue from property taxes has been increasing considerably over the years my home's valuation has climbed constantly every year it goes up and so in spite of the fact that I haven't done anything to the house the value goes up which means the property taxes go up so my property taxes already $300 a year when I calculated it in the last nine years the property taxes is going to APS has gone up by 147.00% increase 32% increase in nine years why isn't that enough in addition to the fact that everybody's house is going up people continue to move into Albuquerque homes

[00:57:00]
why isn't that sufficient and it seems to me that that maybe PBS should be able to get by with what they have but the but the student population from the statistics I've seen say that it's been almost constant grown very slowly in the last few years so if the student population is not growing much the taxes are already going up considerably then why is additional an additional 2019% needed in our property tax Mill Levy right so I think it's going to take a very strong argument to convince me that there's justification for that and I'd like to hear from you what what did justification really is for that thank you the next song

[00:58:00]
good evening I'm bored my name is Leland Taylor I'm a board member of the tax enough already and also known as tea party for Albuquerque and we philosophically believe that good management will actually reduce taxes a little bit over a year ago one of your board members resigned after being accused of her daughter embezzling 700,000 now that is not good management that should have never happened APS should have been auditing should have been monitoring the professionality of its charter schools in its operations several of the schools have had similar problems so based on that type of neither one of them had been prosecuted and I've been trying to find from the

[00:59:00]
Department of Education Inspector General what the plans are to either recover the money or generate some kind of prosecution on it it seems to be a cover-up the other issue is that APS has a declining student account but to keep spending more money you build cathedrals of ignorance in Spanish in the United States so you need to figure out how to get your Architects off of those big budget buildings get down to reality buildings that are functional and not edifices to expensive buildings and that way you don't have to raise taxes drive people out of the sea drive them out of their homes and turn this into a ghost town

[01:00:00]
thank you good evening ladies and gentlemen I'm Jason and I'm here because I have a few questions my first question is why is the solution to every problem in APS more money my second question is if more money we're the solution based on what APS spends per student why isn't APS one of the top 10 performing districts in the country let alone the state if you were a single father who fought to keep his only son here in New Mexico and listening to these ladies before me I can only imagine the horse that they had because I experienced them with my son at Hoover Middle School

[01:01:00]
after one year of Hoover Middle School my son who I fought tooth and nail to keep here in New Mexico into the tune of $15,000 he came to me and said Dad I need to move to Florida I can't Hoover Middle School is not going to work and based on my love for him and my desire for him to succeed I did the unthinkable and let my son leave so would you support paying more taxes for these types of outcomes it's time for different solutions and even though APS lost my son I will fight side by side with those who proposed solutions that are fiscally sound and that produce much better results I'm here to help I'm not here to just so you have more and more people that are going to show up to your meetings to help but we see different solutions then more money

[01:02:00]
every single time so I appreciate you listening to me and I look forward to seeing you again soon hi my name is Franklin Delano I've been a community activist for most of my life and the state turned blue last night so congratulations I was supposed to talk about the governor elect because for a very long time I've heard More Money More Money More Money More teachers more counselors more psychologists you're running your youth out of the state you're running your teachers out of the state you can't pay them you're losing them to Houston whether it's Republican or

[01:03:00]
chat I don't know if that's going to help anymore and I was all on for the you know the blue and the Democrat and no Republicans I'm sorry did I say that out loud I'm sorry I'm bad anyway but I do think that this new governor will help you I really really do and we'll give you adequate funding for your education system which will help teachers educational assistance and so forth so that I can stop telling my best friends that I lose to Florida or lose to drug addiction or any other thing that they can stay here in New Mexico and be happy with their families and then everything's going to be okay thanks guys for sure

[01:04:00]
Presbyterian church and I'm a co-chair of Albuquerque Interfaith an institution comprised of congregation schools and nonprofits the La Mesa congregation is the next door neighbor to La Mesa Elementary School and our church is committed to the importance of public education in general and to the quality of education and our neighborhood in particular it makes a huge difference in the life of these children and really the health of our neighborhood is predicated on the well-being of that School Albuquerque Interfaith is walked in every school bond election since 2004 and believe that the capital Master planning process is the most strategic and Fairway to bring the resources necessary to create healthy learning environments Albuquerque Interfaith is currently delivering a role we will play in the next upcoming bond election I personally believe that the bond election is nessus

[01:05:00]
very unjustified even with the small Mill Levy increase construction costs have escalated every year and this taxation right has not been increased since 2006 consequently the revenues generated are not meeting the infrastructure needs and we're falling farther and farther behind this is not paid by this Monday this comes to the aps for students this is a whole different mechanism of funding I heard the school board to make to do everything possible for this this bond to pass and to work with Community Partners who maybe agree and don't agree or understand how this money comes to bear and bringing quality education I look at the the increase in my house it's just a hundred dollars I'll be honest it's worth the investment and the children in my neighborhood thank you very much

[01:06:00]
the next four speakers Erica Sanchez Robert Beatty Mark Boitano or Burton and Janet Sayers my name is Erica Sanchez at the foster care system to improve their transitions to adulthood and we see that the majority of the young people that we work with haven't graduated high school or received their GED so the data shows that 60% of young people coming out of foster care haven't completed their secondary education by the time they're 19 years old and then that figure gets worse and worse as they get older

[01:07:00]
and this is primarily because there are highly mobile group of students by no fault of their own they're removed from their families and then they're placed in multiple foster homes and these changes often don't happen at the semester breaks so many times they're not awarded credit for the time and the work that they've put in in their previous school which which means that that they're not accumulating the credit to ultimately graduate and they're they're getting more and more and more discouraged in pursuing their education so we need to remove the barriers these students are facing not create more and APS needs to address this issue and we hope that you'll support

[01:08:00]
translation in the upcoming session to provide partial credits for these highly Mobile use thank you talk to piercey members of the board superintendent reading my name is Robert Beatty and I've had the opportunity to serve as a community member on the aps Capital master plan committee having been through several Bond Cycles I've been impressed with the transparency the presentations and the facility evaluation process it's clearly a worst first system of resource allocation as a leader without we will be watching it's going to be about making sure that the work was promised is the work that's been done I've learned in this process that construction and material cost as well as labor cost of reasons significant

[01:09:00]
play and without raising additional resources almost a dozen schools would not receive the upgrades that are long overdue a safe educational environment with all the Necessary Technology is such an important aspect of student learning as well as quality instruction our students and teachers deserve the quality facilities and it's time for the public to step up and support I encourage you to support will be meeting with APS in making this bond election a success I say yes for our children thank you

[01:10:00]
on the LSC and also the tax policy and revenue stabilization Committee in the state senate for 16 years I think most people agree that we need more money for education but if you do nothing if you do nothing APS will receive approximately 53 million in new money every year in property taxes due to annual property tax increases and increased residential and commercial construction additionally as you know the legislature has an unprecedented amount of money this year 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion never before much of that money is going to be going to education New Mexico has some of the lowest property taxes in the country you'll read that on Subway's organizations look at the percentage of property taxes that goes to the

[01:11:00]
State and in New Mexico a tiny percentage goes to the state fact or fiction we have a property tax cap that's kept property taxes down fiction the reality is voters 20 years ago said we want to limit property taxes in the legislature said well you can increase them up to 3% While most counties don't increase them very much but in Bernalillo County and in some counties we've increased property taxes significantly every year fact or fiction we saw the property tax lightning problems fiction we didn't there was a rollback six or seven years ago but anybody that buys new construction or whenever a property transfer ownership they get hit again with property tax lightning this will add to that problem so I want to remind you there are automatic annual increases to the mill rate and property valuation here's a tax bill 2017 to

[01:12:00]
18 you look at your tax bill it goes up 3% in Bernalillo County we're the only County out of 33 what time is that I'm sorry Mr chair could I have another minute or two okay thank you good evening Mr President members of the board Madame superintendent actually came to talk about Veterans Day but I'll just real quick and I think APS gets $200 of it along with the city the county of the UNM Hospital

[01:13:00]
is Veterans Day it's the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War in 1918 and the first class of Del Norte High School graduated in June of 1966 a member of that class was a young 17 year old named Ken Starkey two years later April of 1968 Ken stocky was killed in Vietnam he had was a few weeks away from reaching his 19th birthday he is Del Norte first veteran killed in war and Monday we're going to acknowledge Him at Del Norte I've got some speakers coming in to talk to the ROTC classes about the veteran experience and and Military but on behalf of

[01:14:00]
play class of 66 and on behalf of remembering Ken stocky from my class a young man who didn't make it to his 19th birthday I just wanted to say thank you to all the veterans who are School teachers nurses bus drivers custodians Librarians speech therapist and everything else that it takes for school including security and so thank you and thank you thank you okay our next four speakers Raymond Jayco Junior first lieutenant governor from iqama Paul guessing Richard Huber and Michelle Walsh

[01:15:00]
is the chairman school board members superintendent staff parents students and odds good to see you here my name is Raymond Concho Junior I am the first lieutenant governor for the Pueblo of Akuma first and foremost I want to express our appreciation to the aps leadership for conducting your biannual tribal consultation meetings were you inviting New Mexico tribal leaders to meet with the leadership here to address issues and challenges but we also were able to receive a performance assessment in terms of how our native students are performing at the bottom line is that we want to support your efforts and turns up to achieve and close that performance skip

[01:16:00]
I also want to give recognition to the Indian education department here with APS that they develop a paper where they highlighted five areas and I would strongly recommend you get familiar with those five items and jointly with the leadership in New Mexico do the tribes we can Advocate and support those efforts the other thing I do want to mention is impact a there's going to be a bill coming up so I'll save that when the time comes and turns out we can address an advocate for changes regarding the last thing I mentioned to is that there's going to be a government to government meeting with secretary and other officials within the education department to to hear your concerns and how we can address the academic performance of our native students within APS that way we can continue

[01:17:00]
what's the expression appreciation thank you very much for letting her come a leadership meet with her I can with students to advise and encourage them with a state continue their lives into their future Years thank you good evening my name is Paul guessing I'm president of the Rio Grande Foundation a public policy research organization based here in Albuquerque and also parents of two children who go to Chaparral Elementary School simply put APS has enough money you're going to be getting a lot more money from the legislative process and oil and gas revenue is 16,000 + 234

[01:18:00]
you simply need to be more efficient in the way you build your infrastructure maintain it and hopefully maybe if unfilled facilities are available to sell them off to construct new ones you've got a new training center going in up off of Comanche which is obviously a very expensive undertaking I think it's time that APS prioritized and use the already ample and growing resources available to it in a more effective manner thank you greetings to the board my name is Richard Huber I've been a resident of Albuquerque for about Saturday 16.33% now you're asking for another 19%

[01:19:00]
this meeting today so maybe later in a meeting you can explain to me why you need the money what you're going to use it for and how much you plan on raising I'm opposed to this based on my own circumstances and the tax revenues that are being forced on the residents many of which has been mentioned before provides a hardship thank you hi my name is Michelle Walsh I represent the millennial population that this state can't seem to hold on to so just to give you some background about myself I was born and raised in Albuquerque and then after graduating from you and him I moved to New York City for 8 years I love this state and my family so I came back home and I've been back here for about 4 years

[01:20:00]
last October so October of 2017 I had finally been able to buy my first home so I'm a first-time homeowner super excited and to find out that my first flight I just received my first property tax bill but then to find out now that it's going to go up another 20% well my population has worked very hard to to own a home in the state because there's so many other factors that are against us and that money can be used to improve our property which puts more money into our local economy there's also other goals and objectives that I would like to accomplish and this money can be used for that I after listening to other people speak I now see that APS is going to have other avenues of Revenue to receive and I just want to ask you all to please consider those because this is going to greatly affect the millennial population that we're trying to keep

[01:21:00]
in a state thank you and our final three speakers sharmila garadia Audrey simplicia simplicio and Mike Cruz I'm thinking that's what I see at the end good evening numbers period more specifically I request the board to revise the structure guidelines and mission of our schools instructional councils two more strongly ineffectively integrate parents and his Schools administrative and instructional Affairs instructional Council should act as school level versions of District school boards with jurisdiction to create an Implement necessary programs policies and procedures

[01:22:00]
as well as hiring of Administrators and faculty and setting the schools budget parent representation should be a major component of our Isis I see guidelines need to be enforced many Isis do not have parents do not publicly post their agendas minutes or meetings do not hold elections or have term limits do not include ancillary staff or students do not hold a excuse me do not function as a collaborative entity with with real decision-making Power Hour Public School charter schools have individual school boards why not our public schools are traditional ones furthermore our APS Board needs to include parents in the discussion about creating meaningful family engagement and not just talk among themselves please record an accurate synopsis of my statement in the minutes

[01:23:00]
create a task force and put it on the next board agenda I will probably not stay for comments as I did last time which lasted four hours I mean this is another way in which parent engagement is being restricted so please look at maybe adjusting the agenda as well to reflect parents who would like to be engaged but can't because they have children at home thank you good evening

[01:24:00]
where is Lieutenant Governor Concho from Akron is to help support our native from students here within the Albuquerque within your schools there's about over about 300 plus students within the Albuquerque Public School District that are are from Zuni the students who attend the schools and we just recently have our Zuni or Zuni language be taught in the schools by an individual from that is working with the nearest school system and with the help of the doctor Daisy Thompson and also the support from Jeanne Mahoney what we're doing from the tribe is where we created a MOA and that's still pending but hopefully he'll be

[01:25:00]
play coming back to Zuni for our Governor's signature and so we're asking that we if we could get more of the support of what the tenant Governor had Governor had mentioned and also invite you to the government to government meeting that's scheduled at the end of the month and I also sit on the Indian education advisor as the southern representative so but all in all we as tribal leaders make sure that we support our students wherever they're at and so will continue to support our students and hopefully the new governor and plus are congresswoman that just was newly elected for us for more educational

[01:26:00]
this is our first year at APS recently had an incident where my son was writing a school bus and one of the other students have thrown a rock out from from a window and there was some damage done to two vehicles the school didn't investigation and did not contact me as a parent it in your rule book my concern is is that or do the does Administration believe that they can go and have the authority of interrogating a young student in a case where there's been over a thousand dollars damage to property and where do they understand or get the understanding to have the authority to be able to do this without

[01:27:00]
play getting the police involved this incident was reported to APS police 2 weeks after the incident had happened so I'm really concerned about that I you know I'm not here to point my fingers or to demean anybody by any means but there's definitely something that is totally wrong here I'm concerned that the people I've spoke with have several different understandings of what their Authority is where it lies and that I think that needs to be cleared up but they're definitely needs to be more definition in the rule book as far as APS as far as them having jurisdiction over a child at what point also dissipates so that's my concern

[01:28:00]
thank you all for your input tonight that concludes the public forum thank you and I do hope that some of you all will be able to stay around and we may be able to clear up some of the misunderstandings and provide some information to you so we'll go on for the superintendent's report thank you president Pearcy board members community members and staff I want to give several shots tonight first to shout out to college and career high school they had a really very nice ride up by the Albuquerque business first group of our partnership with CNM and the community I'm thankful for the work happening at cchs and for our partners in the community and every day at appears that more and more people are stepping forward and want to be part of this wonderful work that we do with our students I also want to give a shout out to Dr Chris Muir

[01:29:00]
as you can see on the screens Dr Muir help to give APS positive National publicity in a tweet by the cdc's division of Adolescent and school health thank you very much Dr Muir and you look pretty good on there another shout out goes to Eliza at Zuni Elementary School Eliza was the New Mexico true summer reading challenge winner several board members as well as Governor Martinez went to Zuni to surprise her with a trip to Disneyland so I think I have to go just to make sure she gets there safely finally I want to give a shout out to Art Melinda's and Jennifer Anderson these two attorneys from madre closely with APS on a variety of issues and in a variety of circumstances Mr Melendez

[01:30:00]
was recently named the 2019 lawyer of the year for both education law and Municipal law by best lawyers in America in litigation by Benchmark litigation and this is the 7th Street she has been named in the 2:50 numbers so great work for those two attorneys who really give so much to APS in the community and I'm thankful for our partnership with these nationally recognized attorneys that concludes superintendents report thank you thank you I will go on to the specialist consideration of the gift donation of Genius

[01:31:00]
play some Church of the aps technology department for Google Plus genius pilot program the discussion action and Dr Richard Bowman is going to lead us in that and also Lori Valdez program administrator for technology thank you and good evening Mr President and Madison Middle School the genius program is one that you've heard of before we recognized a few of our kiddos who have become student technology leaders and we're really leading the way in the state and kind of a cross the country these two schools would be one of only 10 schools Nationwide to receive into partner in this

[01:32:00]
play and with that I really just very proud of the schools and answer questions if you have any any questions from the board members do I have a second and your discussion is there any downside to this point is to make sure that we do opportunities that are aligned with what we're already doing rather than starting new things and this is one that's aligned do not see it outside at this point any further discussions will be responsible for your three and beyond for a minimal fee of 495

[01:33:00]
programming with the students are able to accomplish in supporting teaching and learning at the schools that have genius so okay she's already offered to pick as a contingency definition

[01:34:00]
Mission and talk about I want to talk about three things the work of the Lac and this report in particular and then I'll talk a little bit about the lawsuit and then I'll wrap up with what we're going to do in January hopefully so as a legislator I'm able to attend the National Conference of state legislatures which happens three or four times a year and I serve on the education Committee in 2013 the NCAA report by the office of economic development that puts together for international assessment and we started that in 2000 years it started with 24

[01:35:00]
I believe countries and it's to look at our 15 year olds to see how well they've learned their math science and reading so they can solve real-world problems so it's one of the first assessments we started doing to compare a countries so we had a report on that in 2013 and the ncsl leadership was so taken aback by what that report said that they put together a committee of legislators to do a deeper dive into that who's my wife okay so the report that we were giving in 2013 sort of sounded this alarm

[01:36:00]
the history of the pizza if you notice that in 2000 we had 32 countries the US ranked 15th and reading 19th and math and 14th and science fast forward 12 years we've tripled the number of countries to 65 and the US continues to be in the middle for reading slightly below the middle for Math and the sort of in the middle for science in other words in 2000 we had a number of countries that were kind of clustered we were clustered with a number of these countries what's happened over the years as that other countries have improved when the US has not improved so this is the International Education study group that was put together we had a 2221

[01:37:00]
pretzel and Republicans 11 Senator 11 House of Representatives along with a staffing and education experts and we studied the top 10 performing countries or provinces two provinces in Canada Alberta Ontario Estonia Finland Hong Kong Japan Poland Shanghai Singapore and Taiwan so as you see what does the bad news is that we weren't getting any better and that folks that look at the economies of country around the world were concerned about our students not really improving the way these other countries the good news is after three years of study of these other countries this group has come up with four elements that if we can look at

[01:38:00]
when is Country we can improve so let me first talk about a couple of myths who is it that I'm supposed to tell to move that stuff thank you this is our next scores again you see we're basically flatlined in our name scores they go up several so slightly especially at the lower grades but they have not really improved at the upper grades so we're not looks as though we're not doing anything different and education as a country it's certainly also true for New Mexico the the the news I want to talk about is that we cannot be compared to other countries with our education system there's lots of ways to spell that myth this is one way to look at the graduation rates we are no higher than the higher performing

[01:39:00]
countries for graduation that they graduate more students than we do the old myth is that those other countries don't graduate everybody but that's not true they do the second myth is that we cannot be compared to other countries because of the number of immigrants so that also is not true if you look at the one with the highest number of immigrants it's Hong Kong in China where they have four very distinct languages at a minimum if you look at their certainly more than we are Canada for many many years has had a very robust Refugee program where they accept thousands and thousands of people a year they send them to school they get them work they get them started they get them classes to learn either French or English depending on where you are in Canada so yes we are comparing

[01:40:00]
why are cells to some countries that don't have that kind of diversity but also the countries that do so what the study group came up with is the four elements that we think are the same in these other countries that we could learn from the very first element is that children come to school ready to learn and then whatever grade they're in they get extra support if they're struggling so what that looks like in Canada is that if you're three years old or four years old you are offered full day high quality pre-kindergarten paid for by the government if you're in Finland 3 and 4 year old before you get to school at 5:00 and then you don't start until your 7 years old at 7 years old you're taught finish at 9 years old your top sweetie 12 years old you're talking English but what do you do before

[01:41:00]
7 Pre-K high quality full day pay for by the government pre-kindergarten programs these other countries seem to understand that not every child is the same if we give them high quality pre-kindergarten then when they get to school they're more ready to learn I don't want to leave that though before back to work thank you whoever is paying attention is that students get help when they're struggling I'll give you an example of that when I get to the next element so the next element and this is the one that I am the most interested in and the one that I'm working as hard as I can in New Mexico is it it takes a world class teaching profession that is well paid will trained and that has the responsibility

[01:42:00]
high quality high-quality teachers with high responsibility that essentially answer that so that what that looks like in other countries for example the Asian countries those teachers teach for about 4 hours a day in the afternoon they work together they plan lessons they're all in the same room they don't go to their office it's it's a collaborative approach what's the best way to teach an 8 year old how to divide fractions so they understand what that means of the criss cross stuff that we do here which I still don't quite know how we get that so Finland 2 hours a day minimum out of every day is collaboration so teachers work together in this country you know you graduate we have your keys here's your room and other countries they continue to work

[01:43:00]
play Team a work as a team they work together they collaborate there's built in time the class sizes are larger but they're taught by more than one teacher in addition they either in some of these countries first you get a Content degree and then you do two years of teaching most of the countries either have a very high quality mentoring or residency program or an internship they don't just give you four years and then you're on your own they're well-trained these teachers are expected to perform and they do they're the ones that do assessment they're the ones that do curriculum and let me tell you what they do not do in any of these countries they do not have a high stakes test that they great schools on none of

[01:44:00]
is countries do that so the third element is something that we used to do in this country and then we really don't much as much anymore and that's of focus on Career Technical education we have probably about 60% of our students who don't want to go to college or they go to college and they're not successful many of these students want to do applied work they want to be auto mechanic they want to design cars they want to work on airplanes they want to be a carpenter an engineer what will Singapore has high schools all over the country where they're filled with high quality machines and computer technology classes and these other countries they recognize that not everybody wants to go to college and we should not be forcing everyone into that track and then finally the fourth common element

[01:45:00]
is it these systems are designed to just be one piece it's not a silver bullet here and their their well-designed their thought of and their aligned so those are the four common elements that we have determined and the question is how do we get there so you know the first part of the study was fun you study other countries you learned about them I didn't get to go anywhere I was actually asked to join the committee two years in so I didn't go to Canada or China but the second half now is okay now we've learned now let's take him back to your state home bye so for the last two years the legislative education study committee has tried to drill down into these countries we have brought experts before us to talk to us about how and why and when about early childhood about what else to do about teachers and Technical so we are

[01:46:00]
the the most one of the most wonderful things that has happened because of that is that other people have started to look at the no time to lose report so the Thornburg Foundation the Lionel foundation in the Santa Fe Foundation got together and started doing education round tables they had 40 or 50 people that they asked to stick with them for a whole year and then they just followed us behind us so we bring an experts for Elliot see they have the same expert that goes to their education round table and they have done this so much that the Thornburg foundation on their own and the last month put out an RFP for educational institutions all over the state all over the country to say come and help us in New Mexico so they have contracted with the learning policy understood Institute in Stanford run by

[01:47:00]
darling Hammond Linda darling Hammond if you don't know I see some nights of heads is the Premier expert on teaching how to improve teachers how to give teachers the kind of power and responsibility that they want that they could use that they will shine under so they have Heartland a darling Hammond Linda darling Hammond and her job now is to create a road map for the legislature to look at how we improve our education in New Mexico and she has to have it done by the middle of April which is exactly the same time that the legislature in the governor has to go before judge Singleton to give her a plan for how we're going to improve education so the lawsuit Martinez's one of the best things that happened to us in New Mexico

[01:48:00]
laid out that we are failing students with our lack of resources I mean it's that simple and I you know personally worked in APS two times I Was An Early Childhood liaison that program is now completely gone the legislature and the governor has forced you to programs to cut salaries we have not given sellers except for one year in the last 10 years we really as you well know have undermined districts ability to pay for what we need to do so yes we have money this year it's from oil and gas the last time we lost money was like gas too so it's a boom and bust cycle with the oil and gas industry we are committed to try to reform that we have reliable more consistent funding for education

[01:49:00]
tell me the judges requiring that also so we're hoping to take what we've learned from no time to lose to work with the Thornburg foundation and Linda darling Hammond to try to really focus in on improving teachers and ensuring we have Pre-K and that we have funding to do for Technical and everything else so I was really quick maybe you didn't think it was but I can usually talk for a half an hour an hour or 45 minutes on this and I'm happy to take any questions hey Googles

[01:50:00]
a lot of the issues that that we have even heard about tonight so I'm going to open it up to the board for again I know we have probably a lots of questions lots of thoughts so be concise ask her questions and see if we have anything that we need to know a little bit more about just remember Garcia I don't have any questions I just wanted to appreciate you for your leadership and what you've done to keep us focused on the right shoes Thank you period evaluations that is one of the things that I'm hoping that we can learn from her we can get

[01:51:00]
here to help us do a teacher evaluation that makes sense for all of us instead of what we have now so please either come up or listen online cuz we will webcast so many other issues but specifically around education in our state so thank you and thank you for what you do it's been really started with singing then you celebrated teachers and early afternoon remind me of the legislature

[01:52:00]
Pearson Education as well thank you so much thank you for all that you do it I'm excited that the report actually has an emphasis on that career side of it as well because I think it is time for us to sort of rethink you know where and how we're going to do that part because there are a lot of students and we see them coming through the workforce system where it was that Gap and they come and they're really not ready and they're looking for that part but we're catching them when it's too late thank you remember Peterson thank you so much it has been so much of where are we going what what do we really want to do for students in her community you pretty much answered what my questions

[01:53:00]
so where do we start what should be the focus for us as a board and and School District in lobbyists for for this coming year and I think I think you more or less answered it but if you want to say a little bit more about that well I think expanding your pre-kindergarten program very important the correct tactical is is just kind of a trickier thing to figure out what to do and how to do that but when Ellie went to Las Cruces and we heard from the Deming public schools superintendent and they have a very robust Career Technical all of their students for culinary arts actually hired in the restaurant around me heard from a from a senior who said when I got here in 9th grade

[01:54:00]
I want it to be an auto mechanic so I started taking care of tactical courses I've taken one a year for 4 years but now I'm going to go to college and be an engineer because I want to design those cars not fix them so I think if you look at the data behind Career Technical you have a lot higher ability to graduate if you have taken or correct make sure you think about work in the world so pushing on that we are going to be giving districts a lot more funding in January I can tell you that but I'm a firm believer in local control we are going to increase the Ataris funding tremendously but that can be used for all kinds of things before school after school summer school credit recovery smaller classes intervention

[01:55:00]
what's the specialist I just implore you to think big and try to do the programs that we all know make a big difference you will finally after 10 years have the funding to do it it's just so exciting to actually have money in a session so much more that look like them and so when we look at what are we doing to support that pathway into the teaching profession is one of the parts where

[01:56:00]
what kind of comes together where where there are two goals of the Yahtzee settlement that come together and it seems like there are lots of really exciting possibilities with that when it just a couple of things that I want to point out from Elliot meetings one was I remember it was talking about Early Childhood there was the conference not a conference call but someone from New Zealand I believe in someone from England yes yes and one of the things that came up about students being ready to enter school that I think there is this are almost to disbelief that we have students that come in without that there are certain things that happened in England Canada Finland that it goes without saying that mothers have maternity

[01:57:00]
the families have have family leave for newborns that there's Health Care from prenatal on in so when kids get to preschool their their physically ready to be doing all of the cognitive stuff that they need to be doing and so it's wonderful that we're looking at education I think is a community we need to start looking even broader if we really want successful children and I couldn't agree more so certainly school-based health clinics ought to be something that you look at with this increase funding we're hoping to have more counselors and more nurses you know for our school safety issues we really need more counselors that will actually cancel students rather than you know set up their schedule and help get into college so we went to ask this summer and spent a good day listen

[01:58:00]
sing and sing what happened in Aztec last year and when those two students were shot by a former student and the and we heard from six students who are completely involved in it and they basically said they wanted to have what they're calling a mental health check have the ability to go into a counselor and say okay you know I was not my friends went to the movies I didn't I still can't go out and public I'm too afraid just some way for people to understand what is going on we have so many problems with families in this state in the country but in particular in our state so the need for more counselors that actually will do mental health work of the need for more nurses at the schools so you're absolutely right the the health care in many of these countries that were talking

[01:59:00]
sing about they don't have the issues that we do so schools really have to make it up in this country and that's what we have to do in New Mexico thank you for all your work I just have cuz I haven't I haven't looked through very well all of the information and no time to lose so question I had that I'm sure that you have an answer to Is when you're looking at all these top performing countries where is is Pre-K in all of those countries like for all children that all children can attend Pre-K pretty much the provinces in Canada started at 3:45 till 6:00 because they don't start till 7:00 on the Asian country

[02:00:00]
you know we're kind of late as a country to the Pre-K system when it comes to education let me also say and this one this this always makes me sit and think when the committee was looking at these countries and ask them where did you get this information where did you get the research to make these improvements where did you get that all of them said well from you all of course the US has done all the research you know what you need to do you just don't do it you don't do it I mean what does slap in the face so instead of following our research what we've done is you know that teachers with students that are performing as well pointing our fingers at the students that aren't performing well and labeling their school I mean it's just kind of goes on

[02:01:00]
turn on how we've we're just not following research a research says you don't do that you're positive you know it's like the Colorado if any of you heard him when he came down and talked to the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce he says we don't talk about if schools we talk about schools that need more resources to help their children succeed and that is what our school grades Workshop has come up with to change those school grades so that we're not blaming schools but we're giving them the resources they need to improve so then when you're looking at at pre-k for all children in the United States do you think that would be a really good remedy to all that ails education know if there's anything that the study found is that there's no Silver Bullet there's not one thing that's going to improve its a system it's a whole system you know

[02:02:00]
if our vision is that going to take children where they are and we're going to help all of them succeed I mean that's what's behind our Constitution that we will sufficiently fund education so that all students are able to succeed in life and we're not really doing that I mean our our our our Native Americans students need Native American teachers are Hispanic or or first language students need some of their own language in the schools I mean we have a complicated system in education and we have to really address it at every step of the way so Pre-K is certainly one of the things that it looks as though if we do that it will help students come to school ready to learn social skills they they learn language if you have a high quality pre-k program those students are involved and talking

[02:03:00]
tell her that teachers guiding language that are playing with each other so that they develop the ability to like people have empathy and learn from other people I mean it really starts young it starts very very young the science tells us and and we're kind of ignoring that science by not starting students younger than we do now I just remember and I'm sure you do too being an educator when we just had well when kindergarten wasn't mandated and then it became mandated half day and then I think I think in 2004 if I remember correctly that's when it was a full day kindergarten was mandated at every every school and the reason back then that they had said it was really important to have all the kindergarten was to make sure the kids are ready for school so now we're saying that about preschool so I just always wondered how how far we're going to go are we going to say we're going to start preschool because they're not you know quite ready for kindergarten are we going to have to have a

[02:04:00]
radio program cuz they're not ready for Pre-K and so that just kind of concerns me because I would be one that would be like let's make kindergarten I was a kindergarten teacher let's make kindergarten the very best it could possibly be and that that's how I think that we should have started so I'm just wondering where it's going to to keep on going what are we going to do next is it going to be a three-year-old program and that's just it's just a concern that I have because I just remember when this was going on with all day kindergarten that that was supposed to solve a lot of our problems I remember I just remember that exact year because I remember that's when it went really what are study of other countries show is that they have lifelong learning and they just do Life Learning better than we do you know middle class parent will make sure that they're young children has learned their ABCs has learned some simple words can write their name

[02:05:00]
box to that child during the summer will take him to the library we'll take him to Camp we'll take him on trips it's just a different situation then when you have a family that struggling struggling maybe it's dysfunctional maybe it doesn't have enough money and those kids don't have the same opportunity they don't have the same language the current research on languages that there's a 30,000 word gap by the time you're fine the difference between a middle or an upper middle class family that that provides everything and the parent that cannot provide that so it's kind of a way of making school be a year round and all ages and I think that's that's where we're headed if we want to play in the global economy because that's really what these other countries are doing they are preparing their students

[02:06:00]
better than we are it's hard for me to say that I don't like to talk about the education that way but it's true and we need to do a better job because every one of our students deserve to have either a good career or a good job and how are they doing other countries when it comes to having teachers that supposedly look like look like them so when you're looking at Finland does really well or Ireland where the majority they don't have that diverse of a population like let's talk about New Mexico so when you're talking about the majority in Finland or finish you know like 85% or something and and Ireland or Irish and Etc so it's probably much easier for them to find teachers that look like their student population that's a lot more difficult in New Mexico and Canada it's not true in China on it's not true in another country

[02:07:00]
you're very very diverse just as diverse as we are doing well with getting enough teachers that do look like they train their teachers better they pay their teachers better they expect more so they do a much better job of teacher preparation and those teachers are responsible as I said for assessment and curriculum and they are not punished by students that aren't doing well they don't do the kind of testing that we do so it's in a way it's it's harder to be a teacher in those countries but it's more fulfilling its more rewarding Singapore they call them Builders so I'm actually going to offer a bill in January that either changes or set some place a new teacher pipeline so that we offer bilingual educational assistance helped to become a teacher that we offer more help for Native American

[02:08:00]
we have a problem with attracting people to teaching now you know we have some of her 40 of vacancies State why we can't get teachers to come here we don't pay them and then we do all this paperwork on top of them for the evaluation I mean we're just we're just not doing a good job and I know you know I don't work too much so we work to be rewarded but you're right it's it's a challenge but it's a challenge that I think we should try to reach to have more diverse more diversity in our teaching Workforce thank you thank you thank you baby just really briefly one of the things I wanted to offer is that we need to be involved in APS and so usually what we do is you say please invite

[02:09:00]
play whatever I think we need to be a little more forceful and say we need to be involved so if you got committees you got people that are working on this we need to have people in APS that involved and that includes board members that includes Administration that includes teachers so I want to make sure that you understand that we are not just volunteering we expect to be involved cuz we got 25% of students and we need to be involved because we have a lot of these absolute issues that you're talking about so that's one thing second thing is I've been on the CTE framework for quite a while back in August and as of about December I think we're going to get a briefing on that is what we think that is so that may well be something that's of use to you all I have to see it first see what I think and of course we have

[02:10:00]
is it Workforce Solutions person we have some good capabilities I think in terms of that area that we can offer to that kind of a of a development I think that's very very important the increase in funding I want to be clear that is typically not for Capital that is typically operational funding I want to make that clear to the audience OK Google and we have a hand in program Here and Now

[02:11:00]
it's a very small program but we have a person who runs that program who is actually an international expert on this and is invited to many external countries external from the us to talk about that and trained and my understanding is that program is the program that Canada has I may be mislabeling that I'm not sure but I personally friends with this person who is Sandy Main and Sandy teaches this and she teaches it not only here and it's a very intense program it deals with basically at risk kids but it could be all kids in reality third Force 34 year olds that are some interesting that was very similar to interestingly enough

[02:12:00]
in a park and I watch kids play and those kids talked in five different languages just depending on what came up Luxembourg course is a little place that has all these different countries right I asked the person who I worked with their how does that work and he says oh he says well in English I mean you know how do you do the materials when I have people from Sweden and Finland and all the different

[02:13:00]
who all speak different languages including English and I only speak English is embarrassing so I think this is absolutely great and Linda darling I think is a great resource on the really looking forward to the road map idea I think that I'm big on Frameworks and road maps that allow us to kind of figure out what works and what doesn't and how it fits which isn't something we haven't had so I really look forward to that so thank you very very much for your presentation one of those standardized tests

[02:14:00]
that's okay and so I think this is great so I look forward to more on this and and please whoever whoever is running this show if it's you or whoever it is get us involved please in other words you know I know board members would be like to be involved you know we'll spend whatever time we need to I know the administration would love to be involved I think we've got a lot to offer and we've got an awful lot for results that we need to have to make this New Mexico you know so well if I can say something about that I hear you but I'm not the only person doing this and really to get involved you kind of have to just put yourself in you can't wait to be asked I don't think you're saying that but for example one of the one of the ideas that comes out of the no time to lose is that

[02:15:00]
move forward you've really got to bring the stakeholders together it doesn't work if it's you know just me doing it or just someone else so the the Thornburg foundation and the next 6 months with Linda darling Hammond is going to have a very small advisory committee but then that's going to be done by April what I'm proposing is what the no time to lose and it's CSL suggesting is that we do an education commission so that when we move forward because we're going to still be under the judge's order and we're going to be half to work together to move forward so an education commission with all the stakeholders would then help us move that forward be kind of a an advisory to the legislature and the governor so certainly I want you on that beat I'll go as far as saying I want one of your assistance to

[02:16:00]
the next education secretary I won't tell you who but I'm certainly going to tell that to the governor and I've really missed not having an APS lobbyist this last year it's been really hard on me I reach out to people in APS but I reach out to the level that they're really too busy to get to do the kind of work for me that your previous a person liaison did so I've been missing that connection so I'll just throw that out for you and and again as the and I know there will be discussions on the new secretary of education

[02:17:00]
thank you so much thank you so much for Me OK Google a situation where we have a group of people who are now functioning similar to indentured servants they're being exploited at every level and I just I'm just appalled that that is allowable nowadays certainly we need to help and they want to come to help and they see this is an opportunity but there are all kinds of prohibitions against these people speaking out and organizing and working together and we need to find ways to change the law so that if we're going to import teachers from elsewhere

[02:18:00]
until we have enough teachers of our own we need to make sure that that's a fair and dignified profession not an indentured servant thank you yes and I know about that issue we're going to do two things to have you not have to do that we're going to raise salary significantly and we are going to change the teacher evaluation system once we do that I think we'll get teachers back to New Mexico and in New Mexico back to teaching thank you thank you appreciate it thank you ok Google I have a presentation for you I do want to address a couple of the items in public forum so we can go get those

[02:19:00]
haven't been following along as close as we've had to we all know that house bill 98 was passed and that it didn't move these elections however what we also learned was at House Bill 98 had a disconnect with the tax code and so that the tax code calls for any tax levies to be collected in the same calendar year so in November election would require us to assess and charge and collect by the end of December which is simply not possible so we are doing this one time only male in election because it has to be in based on the special election law to pick up this year's revenues and so that is why we are

[02:20:00]
we're doing an election in February it's not an end around or some sort of conspiracy in instead it's a necessary action to an unfortunate situation that really wasn't intended by the legislature and they are going to correct in the 60-day session we've been assured of that multiple times and this of course impacts districts across the state and we've already had these type of elections held in Los Lunas and Las Cruces and other districts so ours is in February the other thing I want to remind everyone is that we are not asking you as a board of education to decide to impose a text tonight that's we are asking you to vote on what we are suggesting so that the taxpayers have their opportunity to have their voice and then they can decide if they want to support this or not we are going to try to present a strong case and explain why we think this should happen but you will not be imposing attacks increase tonight in

[02:21:00]
directions to night you will decide whether or not we move this forward for the taxpayers I will also during my presentation sort of address some of the numbers that came up I know one speaker dropped the 450 a month and I think he meant per year that's even per year that number is not not even close so but we'll get to those numbers I just I hope that at the end is presentation the people that came and shared their viewpoints which I did appreciate I hope we're able to address some of their concerns and and and and move forward so you were handed a couple documents the first is the 2019 School Capital election priority recommendations to the Board of Education I hope you had an opportunity to review these said the four-hour board meetings are difficult I will move as quickly as possible but I also recognize a lot of numbers here and if you need me to slow down I absolutely will

[02:22:00]
does involve a process the process does guide the long-term plan of the district's capital resources so tonight we are not discussing teacher salary we are talking about capital resources only that includes facilities that includes technology and it can include some educational equipment and we'll get into that as well this is very technical work by the capital master plan but it's based on a comprehensive architectural engineering and Technology assessment of all district facilities so this work is done by an independent review our list of priorities off what is developed independently there are

[02:23:00]
guidelines for us we maintain the integrity and accountability of the capital master plan but we also have to maintain some flexibility to meet emergencies and contingencies so we will say we have a set number of projects that we'd like to complete over the next 6 years however we also have to have some flexibility in that because things happen and we'll talk a little bit about that the concept is to bring schools to Equitable standards that's not necessarily all the same but to make standards Equitable we are an aging infrastructure and we'll talk about that major allocations are Project based and they have specific implementation schedules and commitments so the funds that come only come from a few sources there is the house bill and the Senate bill and then there are Geo bonds and we had a moment today where people say that's a house bill it must be funded there's a senate

[02:24:00]
it must be funded it is not the Senate bill in the house bill Grant you the authority to tax and put the money and put the funds into the various accounts they do not come with money from the state so this is how this works and that's a misunderstanding I think that that we need to make sure people understand we do consider operational consequences and we do look to look for cost efficiencies we do look at cost-effective approaches and trying to avoid funding overlaps in the 2016 election 27 major construction projects were approved by the taxpayers as of today 13 of these have been completed 7 or currently under construction and 7:00 to begin construction within the next six months however and this is where the funding begins to have some real construction and escalation of construction costs means that there's a

[02:25:00]
opposite of around 18% in their construction budget given a today's estimates so 14 projects from the bond election 2016 or at some level of design and the idea is that this next election will provide the funding for construction we do this in in in in in in in in waves there are phases to building schools so at some point it goes into a design phase and when we put projects in front of the voters sometimes we are simply asking for the money to design the school which can take two years will come back with the next election and ask for the construction money so that face starts to kick in and that's the big money sometimes will come and you'll see in the list of projects that will ask for both design and build process so there is a misconception I believe that when we ask for this money that we are giving at

[02:26:00]
beginning of the period a large chunk all the money is just given to us what happens is this is assess over 6 years so we get a 6th every year and that presumes 100% collection obviously there's not 100% collection foreclosures happen people don't pay their taxes things happen in the world so it's we have a pretty robust collection rate but it's not 100% but we do plan with that in mind I do have in front of you a table of construction cost Trends between 2005 and 18 what you see is in the glory years of 20185 the cost per square foot was around $142.00 in 2018 moved up to 216 and then we had the great crash and contractors were basically working for free

[02:27:00]
and they wanted to stay in business so prices dropped again back down to about $151 but they have steadily increased when I began this position in 2016 the average cost per square foot was 238 over the last two years we have seen some significant shifts in New Mexico and across the nation that have had major impacts on construction at a national level but specific to New Mexico those costs have really skyrocketed at the last project we brought to you we price it at 315 a square foot and increase of roughly 80 dollars a square foot per project if you're doing a 60,000 square foot project and you have to increase it by 80.00 we know that there are some reasons for this one the rest

[02:28:00]
what are the states around us began to experience economic revitalization New Mexico did not what happened a lot of our technical workers began to leave the state what that's done is that's changed the cost for the technical workers the plumbers the electricians the framers because there are fewer of them and with fewer than being in existence they can charge more because there are fewer people I know just anecdotally maybe this isn't the best story but the public is feeling this as well we've talked to the construction industry they've got story after Story of struggling to keep the people on the site okay but just in the public people are beginning to winterize their swamp coolers and the many times they will call for help and what they discovered in the old days and the good old days you could call in a plumber would come anywhere within 24 to 48 hours that's no longer the case even the contractors such as

[02:29:00]
even the contracts that they're doing this type of work are struggling to keep technical workers because they're going elsewhere for greener pastures it can take up to a week to two weeks to get somebody to come in and do your work and it's really rough if you have an emergency as my mother discovered last week and called on me for help which was another disaster but we won't talk about that we also have seen a major increase in building materials we know that the United States is engaged in some trade medical business with other countries that has increased the cost of Steel so that's great if you were still maker not so great if you're still buyer and we have to buy quite a bit of Steel in Lumber to build these buildings and we are seeing significant impacts with our contractors and they will speak about it in 2016 we lost a year of project time due to an election lawsuit that we won

[02:30:00]
where we had projected cost we lost a year of time class went up in that year one of the questions is why you know why can't we you know something I believe the question came up from the audience about assessed value Rising thus the taxes why isn't that enough well I can answer that in the last five years Bernalillo County area construction costs have increased on average by 12.4% where the growth for the district's assessment value has been 2.7% right so that's over the last five years if you spend it over 10 years which may be is a more fair way to look at it the construction cost of increased 4.3% compared to 2.2% growth in the district's values so we're still being doubled by Construction

[02:31:00]
and that requires some looks at how do we raise the revenue again we've talked about the prioritization guidelines on remember when we talked about Capital Management not only discussing building buildings we also have maintenance priorities we do have to maintain these facilities and our fields we have over 15 million square feet of educational facilities with including over 500 Acres of sights and Fields of those facilities 40% or 30 years or older the older the building the higher the maintenance costs the more degraded in an equitable is the learning environment for the student we see our HVAC systems are beginning to struggle in these older facilities we have to go in and work on them and again because we can't hire the technicians were forced to go to contractors the contractors are struggling to keep the technicians the prices go up and we sort of cycle that

[02:32:00]
we're struggling to get out of one of the points I think is really important is this over the last 10 years since 2007 APS his on average controlled about 70% of the commercial builds in the region we have been a major contributor to keeping the contractors the plumbers the electricians the framers in the area should we stop our bills those people are going to look for work and we could exaggerate the situation that we have currently we are hoping that that number for US reduces we would love to see more commercial build but you just don't see a lot of commercial sites popping up around town but it's the economy does seem to be improving but as it stands right now we are one of the the main if not the main provider of employment for large number of people in Albuquerque maintenance is extremely important if we won

[02:33:00]
what are the reasons you rebuild or build new buildings is oftentimes the cost of refinishing or refurbishing a school is so much that it's actually more cost-effective over the long term to build a new building that's just reality and common sense so that's why we choose to build new buildings and not always refinish although there are plenty of projects where we are just doing a portion of the building replacing a roof changing HVAC systems we do that all the time but there are reasons we do some of the major projects as well one of the other priorities that you'll find in the capital master plan is instructional technology we do use the capital money to purchase classroom student teacher and District Technologies these are computers that can be used by the classrooms all the things that you need to educate

[02:34:00]
play students in a 21st century economy and items that we need to run the district effectively and efficiently we simply cannot operate without functioning instructional and information technology for the schools is often reflects in what we call refresh money this is these are funds that the schools can use directly to purchase money for their site locally decided by the school what they need to refinish or to increase or to even bring something new in but those are funds that we access through Capital that we give directly to the schools and they can make those decisions the district has done an excellent job of leveraging financial matching funds and you've heard a lot recently from Dr Bowman and his team and their project to Leigh High Speed fiber optic facility Library

[02:35:00]
in class such as severely reducing dependents on private internet providers I believe that Dr Bowman has reported that our costs will reduce from over 2 million a year to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in terms of cost so we are saving a ton of money and what we've done is we've created competition inside the city for other providers and we've noticed that other governmental agencies are now tempting to piggyback on this work so they can take advantage of this as well so these are ways we have leverage our funds working extremely well with government matching funds to to benefit not only the schools but the city at large another priority that comes out of the capital master plan our instructional priorities the board has authorized us to utilize some of these funds to support instructional equipment instructional materials in a number of categories

[02:36:00]
is include science equipment school music instruments in fine art equipment School library equipment School physical education equipment school vocational education equipment classroom student and teacher furniture and what we call School discretionary instructional equipment and Improvement fund which are sip funds which the schools have access to their granted as a set amount of money each year and they can use those funds take care of small projects on their campus that they see fit a great example recently we had a school that wanted to put in a filtered water fountain for their students it's a lot easier to take the number of plastic bottles that kids were throwing away and they notice of kids walking around with the environmentally friendly metal bottles and they said if we have one of those and make it so much easier on these kids and on our staff and they could buy it they have the funding their base on this that they could install one we did

[02:37:00]
save them a lot of money and they've made a difference in in their environment music equipment because you guys have made such a commitment to music and art across the school district we do by music music equipment for all our schools so that there are no inequities as far as musical instruments available to students but you see in one part of town you seen another part of town they have access to the same equipment so that they don't have to go out and purchase or rent at a high cost of a very high price string instrument this happens across the city based on this funding as well the last element is something that's not new to us but it's taken on a new level of importance of the last year and that Safety and Security in 2016 the district asked the taxpayers for 6 million dollars to improve security at the schools at that time we had plans that we would maybe improve our

[02:38:00]
please Dispatch Center work on our cameras because some of the school safety issues we deal with really involved theft and vandalism add some locks and and move forward this is beginning of a project well of course the events of the world have forced us to accelerate that last year the state legislature appropriated 40 million over 4 years that we could apply for APS applied for 7 million of that we received a large chunk of that however based on offset rules we will walk away with the round 3 million dollars to actually apply we anticipate needing 25 million dollars to really secure the district and I want to assure you that the type of work that we're doing to secure the district is what we call Common Sense securing it's very low Tech but very high impact one of our first project was to begin to install classroom in the inside so that teachers did not have to lean out in case of an incident and put a key in a door

[02:39:00]
unlock it they can now lock the doors from the inside that project is ongoing and we're moving across the district as you speak we're installing card access readers at school so that we can now begin to reduce the amount of doors that are open during the day in Albuquerque we built out not up we built campuses with multiple buildings we wanted everyone to be able to get in and so we have gates open all over the place and we have doors and we left them open so the parents and community members would feel comfortable walking in unfortunately we can't do that anymore so we have to have ways to lock those doors but allow staff and students to move freely through the building we're putting perimeter fencing around the district in the district with 15 million square feet of instructional space we have a lot of acreage it's a lot of fencing that dramatically we are also improving our district wide camera system one of the steps we've made is we are now in the work of our students are excuse me our school

[02:40:00]
and we're building a new Dispatch Center part of that Dispatch Center will allow them real-time access to the cameras inside the schools also with the software and the servers that were able to provide using this money we will be able to link with the Albuquerque Police Department in their real-time crime Center this will give them in the case of an incident opportunity to link into a school and see the cameras in real time and have an idea of what they're running into this work has changed its become vital and this is not something we had planned for in 2016 we had a slow growth process to make some of these changes now this place has accelerated and we need the adequate funding to install security million dollars in this particular elections and this is what's important to know

[02:41:00]
you don't pick a dollar amount and say well what can we build we start with the priorities we've laid out so we know that we're going to need money for security we know we need 150 million for district educational technology the district wide renewal and support which includes maintenance and operation upgrades sustainability water and energy conservation ability to change bus and parent pick-up drop-off areas maintenance contracts electrical upgrades 88 compliance over 6 years comes to $214 instructional support the renewal for the equipment over six years of 48 million dollars we do have to have Administration and Contract Services that's another 32 million in the design and construction of our new projects is 5524

[02:42:00]
and vetted through a capital master plan committee we invite principles we invite community members from across the city to sit and look at the ratings and look at the rankings and help us to develop this as a matter of fact I believe we have a number of the CMP committee members here tonight I believe that Johnny Pena is here Georgia Army Brasher Bernadette Chavez Marco Harris Cesar Hernandez Robert Beatty and Marjorie Germaine I just like to take a moment and thank them for being here if they're behind me thank you thank you so I do appreciate you being here and being supportive you see that we have we have on the reality of funding we have do not have a large number of new projects to place in front of you we have 11 new projects there's a heavy emphasis on middle schools are middle schools have needed some work for quite some time

[02:43:00]
we built the west side we really focused on high school Improvement and Elementary's always get help because there's just so many of them but we have some middle schools that are in severe needs so you see Harrison Desert Ridge Washington Van Buren Hayes and Grant appear on the list these include in some cases simple design so we're asking for the design for a Washington and some place design build so we will not only design the schools but we will build them these are high cost items the reality is Middle Schools as we build in the past we're sort of Monolithic one building facilities you can't just do a portion of the high schools are much easier to rebuild we can take a building offline rebuild it but the middle

[02:44:00]
serious work especially in terms of its title 9 peer we'd like to think of sometimes the schools in the heights of the Cleveland is the El Dorados is all those are the new schools well the reality is those schools were built in the 70s and the 80s and we're now 40 years later the schools are aging and we do a good job our maintenance operations is a good job of keeping them up but there comes a point you have to do something about it on top of that you see 24 ongoing construction projects and some of these again are on here because we had planned to have them on here to ask for additional monies for example we designed and built a phase of Jackson Middle School we are now coming back to do the next phase and we have to ask for the money in this particular election some of the you see again a list of all the schools from Jackson to

[02:45:00]
Roy deloso Barcelona Janet Kahn which is a pretty significant rebuild an entire rebuild of the school will be a construction basically replacing that school we need to complete Taylor and Truman on the west side we need new blocks new classroom blocks those buildings are aging you see a number of Elementary's from Monte Vista to Navajo to buy Vista Maryam Binford you just see significant builds across the entirety of the city and that's been important to us is that if the taxpayers are going to pay for this they need to see these benefits across the city so in some cases these projects appear because we intended to bring them back at this time to ask for money and it requires us to ask for additional funding so when you lay out all the maintenance you lay out

[02:46:00]
will the educational technology all the instructional priorities the security needs and the facility you come to 1.1 billion dollars currently we do have tax rates in place that raise about $810 million dollars over the 6 year period we need one point one there's been some numbers that have been thrown out tonight that I do want to explain the increase in APS tax rate is 19.14% that is correct if you are thinking of your tax rate your current tax rate on a mill is $10.45 it'll go to 12 dollars and 45 cents so two dollars on a little over ten dollars is about 19% however I think that's been missed construed to think that the tax rate itself will be 19% the actual rate on the home

[02:47:00]
is 4.7% and that's on the taxable value of the home so some of the numbers that I'd like to share if you have a home value of $100,000 your net taxable value is 33,000 so you're in for the year is $66.67 that's $5.56 a month over the 12-month period if you have a 150,000 home your net taxable value is 50,000.33 a month if you want to 22000 home and that's an important one because that is the median cost of a home in Albuquerque taxable value is 73,000 and 1 4 7. 0

[02:48:00]
10000 home your net taxable value is 93,000 your increase per year is $186,156 a month and if you are fortunate enough to own a 350,000 home your net taxable value is $116,000 a year your increase per year is $233 or $19.44 a month so those are the numbers we understand very clearly that this is hard to contemplate I would like to remind everyone that APS has not asked for a tax increase for a long time and we have managed the funds efficiently and we

[02:49:00]
have done things that are good for kids we have built nice schools they are attractive they have Windows they bring natural light they're safe the HVAC Works usually we do a good job it was not likely that we place this in front of you to consider to put before the taxpayers but as a school leader as a person who is spent the last 28 years working in education I do not know how I come to you and say to you this is what we need but we're not going to ask for it we will run a campaign to try to convince the taxpayers to vote for this election

[02:50:00]
and that is the right as a voter I respect people who came and shared their opinion tonight I'm glad they did I hope they'll continue to share that with me I can hope they'll listen to us with an open mind we know there are people who are willing to do this and there are people are not but that's why I think it's important that it not be a small group of people making the decision but that is the taxpayers have the right to make a decision how they want to support their public schools and I believe with that we are open for questions thank you

[02:51:00]
I'm not a tax increase kind of person so I'm trying to to be open-minded if we don't Scott if we don't increase the mill we would have received $800 and some million dollars correct is that about right not exactly we've already collected on a large chunk of that I know exactly Missouri 810 million dollars that you see that 100 million dollars has been authorized in the last election and about 400 million dollars of House Bill 33 we would have to reauthorize another

[02:52:00]
102 million of Senate Bill 9 which has expired after 6 years so basically right now as we speak we have authority of about 575 million of which we've only collected 3 years of a 6 year period assuming you accept the recommendation then the next step in this process is to hand you the resolution and there are three questions each question deals with a different component of the revenue Senate Bill the house bills so the Senate bill again we got these events staggered and Senate bill is running at 6:00 so we can't collect anything off that anymore unless we reauthorize that in the next election so then if we don't increase everybody's

[02:53:00]
then what projects would have to wait that would be looking at your priority you know you have your top 11 I think and then you have the top 11 or not prioritized as above the ongoing construction projects we would have to step back with our Capital Master planning committee and figure out which projects wouldn't get done it's it's possible that for example one of the schools that have not started may be in a situation where we need to prioritize it over one that's already begun so for you know if we build a new cafeteria and we say well we're going to come back and do more we may not come back and do more for another six years because we have to do something that one of the newer projects it's a higher priority at this point

[02:54:00]
when we're looking at the taxes is imposed and it's imposed for the next 6 years from 2019 to 2024 or something like that correct so then in 2024 it expires so will that mail those two meals then go away it would depend on what we decided to do in 2024 likely not because likely what happens is they just continue for the most part that's what history has shown they just continue that would probably be historically true yes it would depend on the economy and what's going on with construction costs if you want to bet that the construction costs are going to go down then maybe the Middle School in 2024 the board would have to pass a resolution for unusual authorization

[02:55:00]
and it's the prerogative of the board and the taxpayers would then have to ratify that new rate of Taxation so nothing's automatic every time a tax expires we have to take it back to the taxpayer to approve or disapprove so it's like I'm just thinking about I was talking I talk to you like dozens of people like 70 or 80 people this weekend to ask them what they thought and kind of went over how I understood everything that was explained to me and what I was told is like you're looking at tax hikes and their built over time and they're built over time and we I was told to be sensitive to that reality so we're not just talking about talking about city taxes we just got a city tax we had got a county tax increase for property taxes

[02:56:00]
a couple of years ago and so we're saying we haven't asked for a tax increase for a while but we have to think about other entities that that have so we are not just an island onto our self we have to look at everybody else who's asking and has their hands out to taxpayers I was talking to somebody who makes $749 on Social Security and their taxes for their their home with this was going to end up being $219,219 so when you're you're taking that away from somebody who's making so little and we say oh whatever that's just a trip to Starbucks or trip to McDonald's or trip to wherever well a lot of those people don't make those trips there when you're living on that kind of income

[02:57:00]
they were telling me what their they were telling me how much they paid on utilities how much they paid on food they don't have anything they don't have anything left and that's not just a few people that live in our city it's it's a lot of people that are on those kind of on those kind of incomes I was looking at a property UNM near UNM that back 10 years ago was 100 valued at $159,000 and they told me in over 10 years their property tax bill had increased 39% that's a lot of money for us to think that it isn't and we're just saying you know where were employing people you know the taxpayers of the one that are the employees they're the ones that are paying for it all so we need to not forget

[02:58:00]
but that's who is paying all these bills and I just have a hard time just because I did not talk to a single person every single person that I spoke to said they were all for education but they don't understand why we don't close schools that have hardly any children in them why do we don't use those schools for Charter Schools why we don't do better with the buildings that we have and why we keep buying more when they see our student enrollment going down so they just don't understand it but they are all for kids they are all for kids and want the best for them and not a single person told me that they were not but they also have to think about what they can put out and I think that we need to be a little sensitive to that thank you remember Peterson

[02:59:00]
in the election in all of them overwhelmingly passed both the state and the county Bond issues and none of those included an increase right it was just a continuation of the rate do you know that I believe that's correct so assessment values might change but not the actual rate right and that was mentioned by one of the speakers home values in that does not because someone imposed a new tax it was just the value of your house changed and that's something I don't really have any or any of us have any control over I think there's there's there's consideration

[03:00:00]
I mean we're community and I am uncomfortable always thinking of taxpayers because we're Community we have an obligation to students to children to families and we're citizens in the broadest sense I don't care about documents that I don't care about you know where you were born and where you came from but in the broadest sense of the word were citizens of this community and we have a responsibility for it I mean to me personally I think there is compelling evidence to support an increase but we're not doing it if we don't have that power you know we put it out to the voters he put it out to people who are going to go and make that decision and

[03:01:00]
and we'll make a compelling argument for what's necessary in in people who oppose it will make a compelling argument for why they oppose it but I think it's a reasonable thing to do and just the more transparent we are about what's needed and and why and what it's going to go for just like in everything else that we do as a school district we need to be transparent and open and accessible and I went to that end point out that we these documents are currently posted on the board of education's web page under tonight's agenda people want to look at the actual projects and their costs they can go to the aps.com for tonight's meeting and they can find these documents and look at the actual list of projects and their costs

[03:02:00]
I was very helpful I think I just have a couple of questions in terms of the projects that you've projected how many of those schools are Title 1 schools 12344 you mean more than 50% probably I'm going to estimate 8.00 increase numbers of free reduced lunch population growing everywhere so I want to say I appreciate the comments on a fixed income I know I am and I can tell you I was not happy

[03:03:00]
can you get my tax bill but I can tell you also that how are we going to move forward if we don't invest in public education this district has been under attack for ever since I've been on the board teachers have been under attack labeled as failing teachers and it's very difficult to try to do what I think are functioning when we operate under those kinds of conditions rumors fly seems like they're very easily remembered as opposed to facts when we began to look at our situation as the recession hit I asked the question how much of the building are we doing in Albuquerque and was told we don't we don't know so when it was looked into

[03:04:00]
you found out that we were doing 75 to 80% of the building in Albuquerque that's a lot of jobs that's a number of contractors who were supported and yet we we struggle my sense is that we have to as a board of obligation is to try to create the conditions so that good education can take place and it includes facilities it includes technology we have to get past the digital divide that exists out there people are in need of Housing and it's a very difficult situation that we're facing but I think as board member Peterson said we have to invest in public education thank you

[03:05:00]
there's been a couple of responses right I mean they're they're definitely worried about their money their income but I've also spoken to families that were in my community were a significant change in a compass made a huge difference in morale so I've seen Rio Grande High School just the morale change because of the new facility and what it's done for just that Community as a whole and feeling that they are you know worthy of like something that's so because it is a beautiful facility and all of the facilities have definitely improved tenfold and it's made a significant difference for those student

[03:06:00]
Vincent terms of what they see and how they feel about themselves and also how they feel about their schools and it's made an improvement for the community because it's also created a lot of value for the way that we look at our community in the South Valley that's really important so you have great schools like we have with George I Sanchez and Atrisco Heritage and the feeling in the community is that those are their first class learning facilities and so it really has created a sense of ownership in the community in a sense of Pride and so I'm grateful for those kinds of pieces because I think it's really it's changed perception in our community a whole lot and you know the need to you know what just seeing Harrison on that list I think the building that currently exists at Harrison was the school that was there when I was

[03:07:00]
who's going to middle school at Ernie Pyle was the same school so and and so it's important and place matters you know where people are living and what they're experiencing and as a school board member I know that part of my responsibility is also to listen to what what ails my community and what they're feeling and I'm hearing a lot about our facilities I'm hearing a lot about the air conditioner doesn't work the roof is leaking in one section our water quality is not good in some section we're having problems with you know drainage or sewage and you know so you listen to those kinds of things and you see the impact that it's having on our families and how they feel about school and how they feel about our willingness to address you know where they are I'm also cognizant of the fact that the costs have gone up

[03:08:00]
and we've seen that just in the cost of construction for new housing starts to houses are you know it cost a lot more to build a house my house probably was built at a much cheaper price but I know if the same house was built out again today it would cost a whole lot more and we wouldn't have as much houses I have now and so so the reality is is that those things have changed I also appreciate the fact that APS is the major employer in the city not only for the district but also for people around City are system supports it's like a cog we're part of that citizenry of this of this community the school district is such an important part of the Cog of how things happen and What needs to go on so I agree it's not I'm grateful it's not our decision I'm grateful it's something that we just put out to our communities and through a democracy we get to have

[03:09:00]
I'm way in and say yay or nay I know on my side I'll be supporting my families that are concerned about the facilities and and I'm just grateful for having the conversation it's been it was a hard pill to swallow it was difficult but I understand and I hope that we can have an opportunity to clarify some of the concerns that were raised tonight about what happens because I raise those concerns and it was through the conversations with with Scott and with that really helped also educate me because I needed to be educated on it as well and so thank you very much for the presentation and we'll just see what happens moving forward Patterson

[03:10:00]
I was a part of the capital master plan out in our community for many years and have always supported you know there's an echo I have always supported have supported our our students and actually it's not necessarily APS but it's actually a student actually an investment in our community and in our students as well that we do this I think we you know when you look at some of our schools and I know what those needs are of that committee and for those who are here today I want to thank you for the time that you take to be a part of that in our district and you know

[03:11:00]
we know what it looks like and what are what are schools really need and it's an environment that we need to make better for our students it's a space for our teachers it's a space for students as well as our community and so I think this in and of itself is really an investment that we're making and ultimately the taxpayers make that decision and I want to tell you as a taxpayer my husband and I are on fixed income and I don't mind making this investment on our children thank you thank you really appreciate the presentation that you gave tonight the only question I have outside of everything that's already been asked is why hasn't there been an introduction of an increase in the last 17 years

[03:12:00]
12 years but basically we've been able to manage the funds in a way that we could meet the needs that were times probably the projects weren't done and that there was a reset during that time and a lot of the older or more veteran principles remember this where we had a list of projects that were to be done and they just disappeared they just couldn't be done because they're just wasn't enough money and the Capital One had to be reset did you want to speak to that Tammy we're just getting to a point with some of these older buildings that the reset would have some pretty dramatic impacts at this time so

[03:13:00]
one more thing to add what member of me who is that projects deferred me have a cost so you can only defer your priorities for so long and so if you defer your projects for a certain period of time there's an escalation of Maintenance costs there's a de-escalation of the quality of educational environment and we are reaching a Tipping Point so making a choice and this is something the boards and the boards before have been very cognizant about they've been cognizant about the fact that there's nine other entities in our district that also tax our taxpayers when not the only one I think we're about 20% of the tax burden of the typical homeowner but we're reaching a point that if we don't

[03:14:00]
don't do something and this is the same point we reached out in 2006 where you have the maintenance catch up to the point where you will reach a point where you have to make another huge investment where in between 2006 and 2010 we ended up building 11 new schools because we had to build 11 new schools and that's because 50 10 to 15 years period and they said maybe in 6 years old was supposed to last about 8 years in 6 years they said maybe we'll come back and look at this well 15 years later all those modular schools were having the floors drop out they were having

[03:15:00]
Max systems that don't work you all know that our utility bill is $50,000 a day 365 days a year about 18 million this all is related to the kind of buildings you have so that's one of the reasons we that we didn't we didn't do anything I think there's nine other entities take APS into consideration before they impose a text I'm not subject to the decision-making and yes it has been 12 years and I'm proud to say that it's been 12 years we've held back as much as we can we

[03:16:00]
in many many instances and spent sleepless nights we just can't anymore our kids safety that's the one thing yes we want good safe clean buildings for our students absolutely but when you was talking about the expense of trying to keep our kids as safe as they can be there there are our children and so yes it's been 12 years but we just can't do this anymore not for our kids and so that that's why we find ourselves sitting here in front of you and and expressing our concerns and and I recommendations thank you thank you thank you very much I appreciate all the information you know the one thing I hope again is that I know they're going to people that want to vote no because it's a that's okay but what I hope is that people don't distribute incorrect

[03:17:00]
one of the things that we want to do is to be as transparent as we can about what it is I want to make sure that people give the right information if you want to vote no because of that that's okay but don't give the wrong information don't give that wrong information because you want people to vote know if you want to give the right information and that's okay so don't tell me it's going to be you know $500 increase when it's really only going to be $146 okay that's all 146 maybe too much and that's okay we have collaboration greatly the ones who came and said hey I'm here to kind of help I want to collaborate on this I want to know what other ways we can do things are how can we make some improvement that that's the right that's the right attitude that's the right attitude okay because we don't have all the answers but I guarantee you this Capital master plan and the prices that they go through was one of the best

[03:18:00]
it's been recognized as one of the best in the nation guys they go through the prioritization aspect and review with all of our schools every single year we probably have 2.3 billion if I or somewhere in that neighborhood of real need 5 billion I'm sorry it's gone up inflation 5 billion dollars of real need and we're only able to say this is the amount that we think we can probably you know make reasonable for our constituents so we have to keep working on that every year every year prioritizing looking at this the population growth what is population changes so so that maybe we have to have different schools like the West Side had a large population growth we had to have more schools over there actually they're 14 new schools since I have actually been on the boards

[03:19:00]
11 on the west side because I think we have a couple of on this side so again I just asked that that we be a critical about it think about it but don't put out false information don't put that false information we're going to try to be as honest as we can about the projects we're doing and about what it costs and those kinds of things so that's what I'm asking in terms of the ideas I I'll give you some thoughts we do have a tax increase in the sense of the amount of taxes we pay because of the evaluation goes up I treat that as an investment my house is an investment guys I now have 57% more since I moved into my house in 2002

[03:20:00]
a little

[03:21:00]
a bit different kind of attacks kind of a thing I'd be more willing to pay more taxes I can do that I'm more willing to do that okay so you just asked me and I do pay more on my income tax because that is one of those kind of things but but the point is a lot of things that these board members have made this is a community this is a this is an investment in our kids this is an investment and what we do and the future of what we're going to have here and if you listen to what made me Stewart said in terms of what we're trying to do here we're trying to make this a whole lot better here in New Mexico New Mexico's got great culture New Mexico's got great opportunities here to do great things and our kids are very good kids let me tell you something I had somebody say they're probably not 10 kids who could tell you something about the college stuff and I said that's incredibly wrong we have great kids but we have to really provide facilities for those kids

[03:22:00]
and hopefully through the legislature we got to be careful because this is you know the 1.2 billion on by 7 billion or 2 billion there's a bunch of numbers out there that's not reoccurring money guys next year the oil companies could go bust and it could be you know minus 2.7 billion so I'm just telling you that's not reoccurring money we're talking about the ability to have a reoccurring set of funds that comes to us and a regular way that we can actually plan over 510.15 years to actually get our facilities upgraded and and so I think again we've got lots of of projects in a fishy we got the community that works on the fishing seasons of all of our utilities how do we manage those water electrical

[03:23:00]
collaborative with us but I want to be collaborative with all of our people and even if we're not convincing you that's okay as long as you collaborate with us and you don't put out bad information that's all I ask okay all right so we'll go on we have a need to have a motion to approve our basic set of priorities okay we will go on to the next item in the February

[03:24:00]
Play 50,019 Special School Board Mill Levy General application Bond mail in ballot election and the presenter on that is Scott Helder and Casita with ginger again and also if it's here and presidents to that resolution and I'm going to allow Mr Melendez to run you through that quickly Scott has accurately described in resolution the election Proclamation is the document by

[03:25:00]
which the board under New Mexico statutes is able to put before the voters the questions about whether there will be a tax levy or a general obligation bonds as a predicate in order to have the election the board under New Mexico law has to vote to call for the election it's called a proclamation of the election the second part of the document that's before you is a document that directs the county clerk who will be carrying out this election to implement the process for the election the manner that it is to be held period will receive 28 days before the election which is January the 8th

[03:26:00]
ballot addressed and mailed to their address they will then have until February 5th to return that ballot in a self-addressed stamped envelope back to the county clerk and in that ballot there will be three questions it will be broken into three separate questions so one of the questions is going to ask the voters to vote for or against a public school Capital Improvements tax improvements is the legal language for maintenance maintenance of the facilities that is sometimes in our language referred to as sb99 that created this texting ability that tax has a maximum limit of $2 per

[03:27:00]
listen of assessed value that can be imposed so in the question put to the voters it will say shall we impose a property tax of $2 for each $1,000 of net taxable value over a 56 year period the second question is the school building the second question is the school building number 33 that created this ability to ask the voters to impose it that has a maximum

[03:28:00]
amount of $10 per $1,000 of taxable value so in historically in the Albuquerque Public Schools there has been a tax rate of $3 $4 and it varies slightly over time so the question that will be asked is shell the voters impose a property tax and here I want to be very clear $4.83 for each 1,000 of net taxable value in president period This is a $1 increase in the residential property tax residential voters the second

[03:29:00]
is a little different than what we're talking about home values in other words I want to make I want to be really clear about the idea when we when we give this thing I said we got home value of 220,000 the question is how much of a tax increase is it for that home value now there's another part of the value too that's here that you deal with but we need to be really really clear about exactly which ones of these apply when we give examples I just I'm not sure that there will be clear

[03:30:00]
potential property or commercial property that tax rate will be $5.34 last year it was $4.34 and so that is a $1 increase in commercial property the final question is a general obligation Bond and that question will ask the voters if they will authorize the school board to issue up to $200 million dollars in general obligation bonds let me let me take a quick explanation of that Albuquerque Public Schools will take over a four-year period this is the historical process and issue 50 million dollars of General obligation Bonds in each of the four years until that 200 million is used up those will be the three questions that will be presented to the voters and

[03:31:00]
if you leave through the material you have you will see that we have given instructions to the county clerk or you will be giving instructions to the county clerk this is the form of ballot that is to be used so that the voters have a very clear example of vote Yes for vote no against each one of the questions and with that I'll stand for questions okay let me make sure that the board understands so we have basically this Proclamation here that goes to the county clerk then we've also got kind of the actual but they go together right now I mean that's all just one action that we need to take OK Google

[03:32:00]
whether they are State chartered or locally chartered and they will participate in the house bill 33 in the SB 9 Levy should it pass they're looking at 1 0 7. 0 0 9

[03:33:00]
but it's nice to have that out in the open okay I'm going to open up for Lord comments I'm just going to raise your hand I'll call on you is board member malaria so Art Is there any way to and I know I had asked Scott and cosito this that is there any way to add the verbiage that would say that your taxes will go up cuz it does it says that we will impose a property tax but it doesn't say that your taxes will go up so if it's not in there then I mean that's could be you know construed as being deceptive by not having that in there and I was just wondering if this is just statutory language and you can't add something like that Mr President

[03:34:00]
I have thought about that and I have contrasted it with the language and the statute and we conclude that we should put the exact amount in the question and trying to say it's this but it's increased by this we believe will create a problem because it's not exactly what the statute requires my hope my expectation is that there will be clear transparent material presented to every voter so that they will know that there will be same $2 for the sb99 there will be a $1 on residential and a $1 increase on non-residential and that that will be available to the voters but not in the question and we don't think that

[03:35:00]
the risk I think this is the best way to go and the other risks confusion the language translator

[03:36:00]
you know what it says underneath it says minority language can we remove minority language and just leave it with other languages translation to Spanish translator

[03:37:00]
is that in the English language language instead of using the word minority Google OK Google

[03:38:00]
so no other questions raised the the thing that's on everyone's mind which is how do we make sure that this is truly what it needs to be so there's no challenge so we don't go through what we went through previously with challenges to the election I personally think that there will be a challenge to challenge us on everything we do I understand but I think again in terms of using exactly the language

[03:39:00]
we try to be good guy and do whatever we get in trouble so we'll just do it exactly the way that the statute says the word I think that's the idea okay anything else tonight

[03:40:00]
let's let's take a roll call vote I think it's nice to have a roll call vote even though we probably could figure that out do I have a motion to approve the actual resolution OK Google yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay we have a last items here we have a briefing Board of Education

[03:41:00]
25 * 0.65

[03:42:00]
we attended the conference the cube conference which is the Council of urban Boards of Education in Las Vegas Nevada for 3 Days in the middle of September and is the district equity and inclusion District committee meeting chair might take away where these four things that I you know these were my takeaways at this conference so the first thing is a couple of speakers one of the speakers says is actually one of the CNN contributors who was one of the youngest legislators elected in South Carolina 266

[03:43:00]
and he's also one of the most one of the 100 most influential young people across the country and one of the one of the discussions that he had you know with the with the one of the things that he talked about was you know you see a lot of us you see a lot of us people of color everywhere and most recently you saw you know we had President Barack Obama but one of the things that he was concerned about is that people of color everywhere you don't we still have institutional and systemic racism it's pretty pervasive and you know he was he quoted some of the his bedroom and class

[03:44:00]
the other speaker was Dr Brian Marks who is who spoke about implicit biases unconscious prejudices and that we have that are you know it's according to a role in our community what that means in our community and he is known to have actually trained many of our Law Enforcement Officers across the country including some of our Chiefs and most recently in La Petite he trained the entire staff and he's also noted for having my brother's keeper which was Barack Obama's initiative when he came into office and one of the things that he talked

[03:45:00]
bad is you know our role in our community is reaching out you know what we need to do is reach out beyond our borders and we don't do that enough it's reaching you know beyond our you know not a level of comfort making connections and Partnerships with those who are different from us because that's who we are as human beings that's what we need to do as human beings and the other thing I wanted to share with you that he was pretty impressive he's actually a minister researcher and a professor you can imagine him in a classroom as a professor he was really quite Dynamic the Richland South Carolina is a district about 23,000 students they have what they call a program during the summer called Summer and it's amazing what they do

[03:46:00]
what is a program that runs 8 weeks during the summer and it's K through adults it's everybody in the everybody in the school the students their families go to camp or they go to summer school to either recover do credit recovery credit accessing and it's it includes steam is what they want one of the programs that they have which is steam is science technology engineering arts and math that's what they call Steve but it also includes summer school include zoology Aerospace coding anything you can think of in the family is actually can go to camp together and do these summer programs and they're actually funded by 21st century Grand it's a 21st century non-profit that actually

[03:47:00]
put some of the education for these families and 50 about their about 50 sponseller helped the district educate their students and about how about 20% of the students actually attend summer school about 5,000 and so this district is pretty impressive their graduation rate is 78% at the at this point and over the past 10 years of had to work up to that level the other one the other District that was quite impressive was Cleveland metropolitan district and that included the Academy teacher teams the parents are actually involved in the curriculum in the education of their children they make decisions about

[03:48:00]
what they want their students to learn but you know it also helps that there's legislation in Ohio that says that parents are mandated to participate in the education of their children that's very helpful any of these parents you know if these parents don't show up what they do is they make home visits they reach out to the parents and the go to the home and stuff and so this was really interesting concept the other thing that I really loved about this district is that the children or the students actually prepare the invitations to any any events at the school the students are very involved in preparing the invitation to the parents it's personalized and I really like that it's customized and I just want to tell you that the district is Head and Shoulders above everybody there sorry to compare but we need to I think

[03:49:00]
what we have in place so far and the fact that we have a capital master plan and you know that we are have taxing Authority is really key many of the schools don't have that capacity and I think for that reason I think it was my privilege really to represent the district and I thank you thank you Candy that's a great report I think these conferences are exceedingly important for us to hear from other districts to hear from other schools other board members and Educators you know because we get and I think sometimes you realize that we actually have some really good things here for example we have the ability to actually have a capital master plan

[03:50:00]
lot of districts don't have that capability and so you know those are some really good things that come out of learning this as well as of course things that we might like to do better so the comments from the board at all or I mean we've been kind of watching the slideshow period

[03:51:00]
5.5 board member down there doing his work no he's not here right now but I did spend time it was awesome thank you for the opportunity to be able to go and represent

[03:52:00]
I took advantage of attending every session possible on Career Technical add I wonder why so I really did try to try to maximize my my focus on that cuz I think it's it's where my interest lies and it also is just beneficial for me at work as well so I thought it could be something I could figure out ways that it could strengthen the relationship between Workforce and the school district there was some important takeaways from those the importance of offering credential options for high school students one state has a goal of a 60 percent of students earning at least one industry recognized credential by 2030 which I thought was really cool because there's studies that show that just even one credential attainment passed High School increases earning potential by just upwards of 8 to 10,000 dollars a year so there were so School succeeding at these options are also reviewing where credential attainment is

[03:53:00]
is occurring it wasn't limited to community college campuses but also available on their homeschool campuses and especially looking at this for a way for equity for students that struggle with attendance or who may not be fully prepared to actually go to a college to be prepared for college work so there were some integrated teaching options where it was a co-team approach where you have an Adjunct professor who's coming in from a community college and so it's a way to actually fully support students who may have difficulty with that was so interesting that there was one school that was actually required students to take at least one online course during their high school years the importance of that is because that is the trajectory where post-secondary Ed is going to a lot of course work is done online so sort of developing that skill is important there was a lot of importance on coordinators this part was important to me

[03:54:00]
the importance of coordinators who work on campuses to support College and Career Readiness you know specifically for business engagement and support during work-based learning activities and I thought perhaps maybe this could be something that's built into our community school model approach for the high school level because it's really about needing to engage businesses in a different way and and and and and looking at that coordination work that needs to happen it was a career in college readiness and other one that I heard mentioned as well I have some other notes but I'm going to try to convince and go fast one of the products that was developed and implemented in Long Beach I think is had a lot of components that are that is included in our next step plan but what their execution of it is what was best

[03:55:00]
they actually had figured a way to execute that plan so that there was more communication and it was a living document that was actually developed and used throughout the high school career and what I loved about the sections that focused on using the guy to track technical education advances including hours completed and workplace learning career awareness career exploration preparation and actual training and it did include things like college choices you know Readiness are you on track for this or that and I do have the handout for that it's just it's like our next time except that it's just executed better because of the way that they communicate it with the student its online and it's a living document and they actually are referencing it each year and it's a way to actually Mark progress for that student as they're going through high school and the finally one of the quotes that from the session that resonated with me was our public school system is set up for the outcomes we are receiving and

[03:56:00]
this quote was used from one of the schools to evaluate outcomes specifically for boys of color noting the courage it required to look at processes that that lead to to True system change and noting how the system might be flawed for children of color so this program uses this Mantra to elevate their activities and lit and that has led to significant changes specifically for African-American boys so I just thought it was just like taking that thought you know it's like the outcome we're getting is because of the way that we're set up and just the courage to be able to look at that and say this is truly the impact we're having and then I just want to know that there were two keynote presentations that sort of brought something home for me mister Khan's presentation reminded me of the significant sacrifice and fear families face when they are advocating for something that isn't popular or when their voice is the only voice for change families and with us when they are angry isn't comfortable for us as a district but more importantly it's uncomfortable for them as well

[03:57:00]
how many are afraid fearing they aren't prepared or equal to those they are confronting and it's a reminder to us all that family engagement requires tremendous patience and willingness to be in the shoes of the families before us and then last Jill Biden reminded me of the importance of teaching not only as a profession but also as a calling her commitment to adult education was inspiring and reminded me to extend more gratitude I'm going to get weep because I'm tired expense extend more gratitude to our entire APS staff and Community proving many do not choose the profession the profession has chosen them and thanks to all our staff that feel this call to service near value

[03:58:00]
the different components that need to be in place for change for real change and it's really starting out with the vision and then building consensus and then making sure that we have the skills to actually Implement that they're incentives that make people I mean they don't have to be they can be tangible they don't necessarily have to be but there has to be something that gives you some positive feedback for for the for what you're taking an action plan for cybersecurity

[03:59:00]
the reports of the task forces and I was really significant because the the council had started really studying what's how do we serve males of color in particular and the board meeting it was reminded that you know there are women young women and girls of color that have a whole other set so we're not done in analyzing but the really exciting thing I mean the thing that significant about this is that include test scores

[04:00:00]
but it's so much deeper than that it looks at things like how many students are enrolled in a p classes it looks at attendance across the board graduation rates what's happening to Children what's the access to preschool and how many students are in preschool it's it is a huge document and APS by the way stands is in good stead when it comes to the number of students that are enrolled in AP classes there are some other places where it really points out that we have some work to do but I urge people to go to the Council of great City Schools website because the amount of research that's gone into everything from the academic key performance indicators to things like best practices in procurement of

[04:01:00]
favorite topics and other performance indicators there's a lot in APS by the way is District Number 14 so when you go to the website you can go through and really look at where do we stand what are we doing well what do we really need to improve on I'm always torn when I go to National things because I know what it's like to present and it's always nice to have friendly faces so I'm always torn between going to new things and going to the things that are folks are at and this time I kind of opted for going to a lot of the things that are folks presented at and they did us proud they absolutely did and the way that the

[04:02:00]
have great City Schools sets up their conferences or their breakout sessions is really helpful because they don't have just one District presenting one thing they'll take a topic and then put a panel together so that we for instance Training Day Dr Blakey and Dr Gonzalez talked about instructional rounds and and supporting School leadership and so it was just a way of looking at this is something else that's going on this is not a drill with casino and Scott talking about the security and safety things but the thing about that was that his

[04:03:00]
play superintendent for Broward County Schools was there and and so they talked horrifically about Parkland and what it was like both both living through it but then having some having some thoughts really in place about what does the district need to do how do you come together and support people but also what do you need to have in place for communication because the most difficult thing immediately is how do you communicate with families how do you get in touch what systems do you have for for taking care of the just incredible communication and you have media and wanting information mean parents don't know where their children are or you know what happened to

[04:04:00]
the cellular network when you have so many people trying to use it so there are things that districts can get in place and so anyway but Scott and casino I think really really and truly thank you thank you Doctor Gonzalez and Doctor Blakey for your presentation and and then our Language and Cultural Equity folks gave the presentation on bilingual seals and the thing that's interesting about all of this is that lets us kind of where we are and for instance one of the others that I went to was on teacher and this was it and New York City and their association with colleges with the New York City College's and you know what we're doing some good things

[04:05:00]
we really are there are some districts that are farther ahead of us like on the residencies and how well established they are but then you look at dual language like the New York city folks talking about you language and they were talking about how many students they lose between 3rd and 4th grade you know kids that entered your language in kindergarten and then drop out and I thought you know that's something that our district does really well to support and encourage families because there is a real drop off there's there's like this plunge family start talking to their their their you know some cousins who are not in July language and third fourth grade is kind of a scary time for July language but I think with an APS we do a really good job of supporting families and explaining to them

[04:06:00]
that it's worth sticking it out that it's scary right now but by the time your student gets to fifth grade it's going to look different for for how they're working within a dual language program and I think we do is a district you're a really good job of that of helping families feel supported that kind of Rocky spot and sticking with it and Lasting through so that was that was all helpful to me one of the most powerful I guess you could say little have you ever been in a ballroom with three marching bands playing in the morning and a whole lot of fun and there's so much more really

[04:07:00]
play some Julie I just encourage people to go to the great City Schools website because there's a whole lot of of information about what's going on but finally the the speaker that just grabbed me with Michelle Alexander who's the author of the new Jim Crow and talking about the incarceration of young men of color in particular and it she talked about her own personal journey of approaching this is an ACLU lawyer who you know they were trying to find the perfect case to start and then realized there was no perfect case because they could not find a young man of color who hadn't already been convicted of a felony because of the way the system is set up so she was talking

[04:08:00]
how about how she had to back off and re-examine and think about what's what's the structural system that gets set up for our young people and what for one class of people who look a certain way is boyish indiscretions and what gets labeled as criminal for another group of young people and how we have got to find ways of fighting against that and that was really true that some people end up in excuse me the White House and the Supreme Court and other people end up in prison and it starts with what happens in our schools doctorate

[04:09:00]
one of the things that I wanted to share aside from all the wonderful meetings and presentations is that great City Schools is moving forward working very closely with Harvard Business School in Harvard school of education on their leadership training for school boards and I it appears it's certainly you know because I did ask did we get dibs since we were you know the ones that were already you know and it sounds like APS is on the aps board is going to I mean they said we were first on the list I don't know what that means but so they'll be giving us information it's a four-day training and it would be in July and they'll give us the dates and things it looks like they may be getting some funding by you know from from corpor

[04:10:00]
in which case the flights would not be covered but room and board would be covered and it would I think the price is like $4,000 but they would pay for half and so as I get more information and I'm sure that will all hear it I'll pass it on and and fill you in more as far as we get to go to Boston you know first off in the executive board I kind of I kind of was very forward as far as saying that I think that we were very interested and they said thank you for the trip to Alaska he was interested and then when they met with the board and I know that Barbara Peterson was there and they said that that I requested that they selected by alphabetical order in which case would be first but in either case I think

[04:11:00]
to me that kind of was a very good positive feedback so that's good for us to think about guys because I think that's a very interesting concept and also a program on immigration what's happening locally gathering information

[04:12:00]
delete all of us we can possibly use to protect families and the other thing is with Essa right now it seems like there's kind of a lull in in terms of there's not much conflict with with the feds with the Department of Ed at this point and so that they're also trying to track that just to make sure that implementation of as a plans is being done in a way that's helpful to districts and what I what I said was that was that so far because mostly with the with the education department in the way our state

[04:13:00]
in terms of Richard's concept

[04:14:00]
what's the different things you can sort them you can look at the indicators you can look at all the questions you can look at all those kinds of things for the different indicators and just remember that we're 14 so you can look at all these different charts in that and it's very interesting where we are in terms of things and a lot of times it's a little behind because it's 2014 to 2016 2017 so it's not the 1718 and we've made a lot of progress in 1718 but again remember where we were back in 1314 505 period

[04:15:00]
so thank you again for that the only thing I really wanted to ask tonight is we've had multiple presentations over the last year on various engagements we see the different programs we hear what their missions are in their Vision but is there a framework or road map around

[04:16:00]
the parent engagement and the parent voice and perhaps we've seen it mean when we see a lot of presentations every night but I mean there's there's various presentations from various programs on how parents are being engaged but is there a larger road map that we could see is there one or something and I just think that would be a great opportunity to to meet with our parents who have expressed that interested in and see how that voice that engagement could be there so that's my only comment tonight thank you

[04:17:00]
and I believe that I know City counselors

[04:18:00]
is generally respond to those who come before them for public comment there is absolutely no reason we can you know there's no reason we can't do that I agree with you that I think we need to change the way that we do business here and that we respond to you so that you have an opportunity to get home as well with your children and that's what I just wanted to say and thank you for being here Peterson the group that came out I think it would be really important for our district to just look at a partnership with them they are planning to develop some legislation that's going to address the concerns around Foster you there in an organization that supports system involved Youth and they do a really good job of advocating on behalf of that population I know that APS is done some different things but they're still remains an issue

[04:19:00]
sounding like that movement for students that are going between schools I know we've cut down on that but it's still a concern especially for a high school students and I think the last thing we want to do is put more barriers up for these youth who already have a difficult time we I mean there is a ton of research that demonstrates that the graduation rates for these young people is exponentially just lower they have a lot of concerns and issues with that so just highly recommend that you reach out and I'm can and work with this organization they're they're really strong legislative I brought this up before these these parents of children and I can't tell what's going on frankly stories and their concerns and

[04:20:00]
I think we need to listen to them and we need to find if there is a place to find Common Ground there should be a place there if we made mistakes we should apologize and clean them up and move forward but I don't think that it makes sense to either ignore them or write them off and if I'm wrong please share information with me I've asked to meet with staff and no one has called me and my concern is this every parent's issues are legitimate as a board member I'm here to represent my community and they include people who often will say things that are either what is going on or not going on I take a lot of heat on a regular basis

[04:21:00]
anticipate that that was one of the jobs that I had to do here but it is and I am not always the best representative for the board but I do my best to try to get back to people and be direct and be honest and I would ask that is a district if we're going to hold our head up high let's hold it up high and say yes we we have these concerns as well this is what we're doing or no we don't know what we're doing here we have to be that we're doing the best we can but we're not we're not where we need to be it's very difficult I share the son of it around public forum I think that is a public forum there needs people are here asking for for information and trying to see if we're just another one of those folks that is going to try to pull the wool over their eyes so we can get more money you know that's the attitude that people have it's not our

[04:22:00]
it's not their fault but it's the attitude that we have to deal with and I would ask that we try to do our best to present ourselves with Integrity but always get back to people so if someone brings a complaint up I think there should be a staff person that automatically talks with that person right after they bring up their complaint and we try to find a way to problem solve I just don't see how we don't have that in place and if it's just that we've overlooked it okay but let's find a way to get these things resolved so we don't make bigger problems for ourselves there are people here who came this evening that are out to make bigger problems for us because that's what they do they attack APS let's not pretend and there's news media that cludes and they've been colluding for the last few years and it's not been a pleasant experience for you and certainly isn't a pleasant experience for teachers and hasn't been that Pleasant for me but I'm learning that

[04:23:00]
so I hope and pray that we can move forward I wanted to say that I got a chance to go to Los Padilla's to the genius hour and walk through a number of different classrooms and get presentations from kindergarteners all the way up to 5th graders and it was incredible what they're doing at that school is amazing I got a chance to go to the school choice fair and that was amazing I got to talk with stuff and left and just enjoy the moments and to some young people from Ernie Pyle I won't forget I thought someone had hurt herself but she actually had some kind of Halloween decorations you know we have a great District I don't think we're a good District I think we have a great District but I also think that there's always room for improvement let's just do it let's move forward

[04:24:00]
so one quick sales pitch Hawthorne school is going to be at Barnes & Noble this Saturday they're going to be signing cards for veterans thank you notes for veterans but a portion of the Barnes & Noble's Revenue that day will go to Hawthorne I'm sorry I've got some flyers and that that's fun you know I think it all comes down to democracy and we've been in this powder keg over the last few years of Staffing so stressed everyone in this building being so stressed teachers and administrators being so stressed that it's really easy to just not listen to each other and to start putting up barriers and I think the Community School calendar of how do we make schools more democratic Place how do we how do we open up

[04:25:00]
opportunity for real authentic discussion and conversation and concerns and it's I mean we I think what we do doesn't come from a bad place at all I think it comes from a real driving desire to make this District work the best way it possibly can and so we we all I think grab onto something and plow ahead and in that serve the model that we've been driven to use and maybe we can kind of take a breath because I think every single one of the parents who came in here today have real concerns but also a real care for the community and I was at yesterday or the day before and I think he has no meaning but I heard a term that I really loved because we talked about you know angry parents or

[04:26:00]
it makes it really hard but if we can just kind of take a breath and try and try to listen to

[04:27:00]
where that core where is where is that bottom line core and and try to hold on to that maybe we can do better one thing to about the conference the council that I forgot was the student panel not for sure you were going to miss it that's why I didn't say a word about it for those of us who went we walked out of the whole of the whole conference these incredible articulate people young people from Marie's a student from Baltimore a couple of one of the driving motivation was the environment another was just

[04:28:00]
protection of immigrant students and and what's happening to her to DACA recipients and immigrant families they all came with the spurning passion but one thing really stood out to was that almost every single one of them had a formal way of relating to the board almost every single one of the students came from districts that it figured out a formality and I think that the super sack is really wonderful I think you know the conversation that I see going on there is great and Via is another model that I just about every single one of these students had a way of relating to the board as a student representative and it's something that I wish we could kind of pursue

[04:29:00]
because our meetings aren't long enough we can shoot for 5 hours of collaborative Community also I have a presentation at the next msba meeting tonight

[04:30:00]
it's going to be on this Saturday December 8th at 9:45 10:45 so tomorrow we have a workstation 47 so November 14th 2016

[04:31:00]
I can probably get to the 9:00 one but I probably can't get the 2:45 cuz I think I have a African-American kind of a student Summit there but I think all of that in fact you could look at all the different things they've got and there's just tremendous number of things that are useful I'd love to be there for the whole thing but so if anybody can get off I think that's a great great opportunity for us to see some of those things and again I think we've covered the comments from the from the audience thank you very much appreciate it

[04:32:00]
do you say okay we're going to put a 2-minute limit on each one of us and that's it we have a Dinger and when you're done you're done so if you so if you have a comment so if you have a comment to make or something to do but you can't go on you know because we are already at 9:20 and so I think again that that may be a way that we think is kind of important to say follow up or whatever we can do that in a quick thing after all the public forum is done and say we're going to take 2 minutes that's all we got because that's all we gave you guys and you know that's not a real what I call a dialogue is it you know but at least give you a little bit of an idea of a response immediately so that you know that you can have that before

[04:33:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[04:34:00]
you know I don't know that we would have had enough time in 2 minutes to respond to the kind of people that we had tonight who had some concerns so you know I think again this isn't exactly the right for him to have a real Dialogue on what we're doing you know that's so I tried to emphasize that again you know is that this isn't really quite the right for him but but it is important to get some immediate feedback I think what board member Garcia said in terms of you know when somebody has a question let's get some immediate feedback that's really a quality as I've been told that my quality background for a long time that is you get back immediately to the people and you let him know what the time frame is this is nothing you have an answer me but you have a response immediately and say Here's what the time frame is and when you will in fact have a response or what we need to do to proceed not as a quality

[04:35:00]
start service organization to some extent we need to look at those quality things so if we think that it will help to put a 2-minute shot just to see if we've got something that the public would like to get an immediate thing back or maybe just please contact Scott cuz Scott's got all the answers you know or or please contact the superintendent you know and we'll make sure you get together or something like that sometimes that helps because sometimes they don't know what's going to happen or there's going to be follow-up and then they leave and they don't know what is but we do need to keep it in a reasonable amount of time because again it's not the place to have a big long discussion that's a different name is basically about doing business and so the public for me is an option in the sense of having a public forum so there's

[04:36:00]
play different mechanism that we need to have to say we have a broader discussion where we can go back and forth talk about issues that kind of a thing and we got to be careful with that because if our staff needs to be there they're here tonight look how long they're here they have stuff to do you know so it's not like we can take all their time just because we think it's a great idea so we've got to be a little careful with our staff of people so that's that's the reason I have it necessarily pursued having us say something because in reality our staff here is it if our staff hears it they go and they talk to the individual almost every time that something they can do with it so it gets done but if we would feel better about

[04:37:00]
lights for seven people that's no more than 14 minutes so now we're at 9:45 I would like to be able to have a set up so that there is a feedback loop that's all have an immediate response to that and so that they do that even though I think a lot of times are staff does get up and they do that that that's kind of initiative I think that's good okay great thank you guys the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday December 5th 5:00 here and then we'll be Tuesday November 20th 7:30

[04:38:00]
