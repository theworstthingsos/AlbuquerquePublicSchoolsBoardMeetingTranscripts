[00:13:00]
so we'll go in the order that we called you up so Deborah okay thank you members of the board and superintendent Reedy the anti-racism training institute of the Southwest RT invites APS leadership to join the City of Albuquerque and UNM at an intensive today undoing racism workshop May 4th to 5th this year and some of the board members have already participated in these workshops are organization is a project of United South Broadway corporation which worked with the institute for Democratic renewal in Claremont California and the UNM Institute of public law to develop training and education that addresses institutional racism we've been doing this since 2004

[00:14:00]
add train 1200 Community academic and government leaders throughout New Mexico are approach is distinct from cultural competency training which focuses on the ability to appreciate and interpret other cultures accurately already workshops go deeper to ensure that New Mexico's leaders gain a shared analysis and common vocabulary of what racism is in order to uproot it by building alliances both within and outside their organizations they learn that institutional racism as opposed to individual bigotry or Prejudice is systemic and is the intentional or unconscious subordination of specific racial groups through organizational practices in Norms we'd like to meet and talk with both the aps superintendent or designation and the aps board president

[00:15:00]
your designee about this invitation within the next week and look forward to aps's participation in this exciting timely and essential initiative to undo racism in New Mexico thank you very much but also an ongoing institutional commitments United has been organizing these workshops with already and others for about 10 years now and we don't have a budget we just do this on our own time and we have developed trainings that are based on the principles of the people's Institute but there's nothing like an actual undoing racism training with the people with their with their core trainers and so that's really

[00:16:00]
did the Bedrock of our capacity building in the community so it's a real privilege to be at the table with them when they do those workshops and to be mentored by them and we want to just invite you along and the timing is perfect because the city is also stepping up to institutionalize that the trainings in their institution so imagine the power of the city and APS both comedian ongoing funding to these workshops because once a year once every two years just more administrators more teachers in partnership with our students so thank you hi I'm Francesca blower and I'm a retired APS Elementary School teacher I'm here in support of APs implementing anti-racism training I took a two-day already anti-racism course several years ago

[00:17:00]
at the end of my teaching career I reeled from the experience and the profound effect it had and continues to have on me it was mind-blowing uncomfortable exhausting and liberating my one regret is that I didn't take this decade earlier the enormous take away from the 2-day workshop was at the true power of racism is not in the individual but in our institutions together we examine and learned about the power dynamics of institutional racism which is foundational in her housing Healthcare Justice economic political and education systems most importantly the two-day training made me reflect on my complicity in these institutions through my actions perspective and choices I realize that the great hope to undo systemic racism is to First IGN

[00:18:00]
which its historical Roots think about the current status of institutional racism and then reflect on our complicity with that system the two-day training affected my teaching every moment of every day from the books I chose to read aloud to setting up our class library to parent-teacher conferences to organizing field trips to building a curriculum to facilitating more interpersonal Communications to developing a classroom culture that questions are institutions ongoing anti-racism training embedded in APS could have the potential to transform our public schools from institutions that make and enforce the statuses of learning that are undoing and dismantling systemic racism

[00:19:00]
next three speakers Karen Keifer Matilda Walker I hope I said that right and strata Patel I hope I said that correct too good evening I chose to move to New Mexico 22 years ago for the culture and the diversity that the state has and this is my 18th year in New Mexico working for APS I am a product of America's public school system and I was raised learning about my cultures history far too often for my students though they don't have that same experience as adults who have been raised with an institutions that teach a eurocentric history it's natural and normal for us to perpetuate what we know and we see that all the time in our classrooms from the materials that are chosen to the things that are said to the opportunities our students

[00:20:00]
what's our given and so I really believe and I know that you the board has a great opportunity here not only as the largest District in the state but also as one of the districts that has the largest diversity to undo some of the racism that is present in our institutions I have conversations with my colleagues that a lot of times I say I'm not racist I don't see race it doesn't matter to me and as Miss blowers said the issue is people don't understand their complicity with this until they are pushed to choose to do so I am here to ask that you provide us Educators with more training and more information and that these conversations become a normal part of our district so that we can serve the students that we have in our classrooms better thank you would like to encourage you to imp

[00:21:00]
and the undoing racism training by Artie into your institution and mainly with the hope that it will affect larger curriculum change that supports anti-racism and decolonization I was born in Albuquerque I went to a public school and a private school and I am a first-generation European Jewish American person and that sounds an oxymoron first generation European American to a lot of white people but I have grown up white on what I consider Albuquerque to be greater Chaco land so this is sacred land that's never been seated and when I consider that continuation of

[00:22:00]
oppression I would like to see the same amount of continuous effort to work Against Racism my graduation high school speech not mine the one I received the one I listen to as well as from my all of my schools essentially all my teachers my middle school down have asked me you know grow up go out travel learn but come back and I've done that and I couldn't see a greater purpose in in life to really try to promote this Justice and I just love to see it happen in an as an ideological change there's like no excuse in my opinion thank you

[00:23:00]
good evening members of the board in superintendent my name is Shruti Patel and I work for the New Mexico Asian Family Center as an agency I'm here to urge you as members of the board to allocate funding for ongoing anti-racism trainings this would be a step towards addressing racism in our community and an active way to combat and an undue structural racism our students need to be supported and heard they can't be if they're an environment that don't see them and don't uplift them please support our students by finding ongoing anti-racism training for both Educators and and teachers and everyone in the system thank you our next two speakers Janet Sayers and Burlington and distinguished members of the aps staff and I'm going to have two hats on tonight well I'm Janet

[00:24:00]
so I have my Del Norte hat on but I also do New Mexico history and I cornered Dr Gonzalez and found out that he can get me some brochures to the person in charge of social studies so we are New Mexico history conference is at the end of March at at at at the Embassy Suites right here in Albuquerque and teachers can all come for free that is free with a capital f and we want them to come they would need if they come on Friday they would need to get a day of personal leave but if they could just come on on Saturday morning so he's going to hand those out to the right person so thank you for doing that and we do encourage those High School teachers who teach New Mexico history to be able

[00:25:00]
the participate so then with my Del Norte hat on again I want to thank the three businesses at the corner of San Mateo and Montgomery that are so good to our alumni association that's the Starbucks who gives us free coffee every month for teacher appreciation and then the Chick-fil-A has helped us on a lot of things with food and then the Albertsons he's been giving us gift cards to help buy some of the items that we do and then last Sunday I had the opportunity to be with some of my Del Norte alumni who are lot younger than I am but we did a fundraiser at Holiday Bowl we raise about $1,000 which we are splitting with the ROTC students who participated and will use the rest for different alumni activities so that's my report for the night and and congratulations to the newly elected

[00:26:00]
officers hi my name is Verlander and I have three major points of contention for today the first one being is the last equity and inclusion meeting that I was at there was a public forum at after one of the agenda items per your usual procedure for that type of meeting the limit is 3 minutes that person had gone over for 3 minutes and 20 seconds and no method was made in order to notify her that she went ahead of her time as well there was even a conversation between direct violation of what you call as the open meeting and do I need to remind you that the equity inclusion meeting is the first meeting that the indigenous Community was at that you had really important these procedures and having this dichotomy between how you act towards this one individual versus the entire indigenous Community is in itself based in

[00:27:00]
it is a problem secondly I need to make sure that you understand your own code of ethics one of the main points 0.4 to be specific is that you need to establish an open two-way communication process with student staff families and all segments of the community in regards of communication with myself aside from two of you all of you have failed in this regard as a former student and as representative of my family you need to meet with me and have these conversations more importantly I have been in contact with the Johnson's a the family of one of the students affected at the people high school and they request that you put them on the agenda or the entire business community on the agenda at some point you need to set up a quorum and needs to be on the agenda and as of right now I'm going to give you a deadline for this because again it is in direct violation of your own code of ethics you have until April 29th to assemble and have this meeting happened because that is the same amount of time that took between that first equity and inclusion meeting and then the Native American open Community forum and that is an adequate timeline obviously since you got it done to assemble a meeting

[00:28:00]
this needs to be done and if it is not done by then then I will be doing my best to seek legal action thank you the final two speakers Kara I can't see your last name and Michelle Melendez and I'm sorry karaoke OK Google I'm not able to stay until later in the evening but I am from a group of parents called

[00:29:00]
open organizing parents education Network and we are meeting together each Thursday night at 6:30 at the lab board on Masthead and we welcome you to any of you to join us because we are trying to make changes for our children who have disabilities within New Mexico and tonight I am wishing to discuss with you that we have found discrimination open discrimination against children with disabilities when they are applying to Lottery schools I need to Charter Schools whether it's through the lottery or throughout the year when there's spaces first it's required to disclose if there's an IEP before and during an application period it's on websites that we have to say whether there's an IEP and also our parents are being told that there is not room

[00:30:00]
Pacific Charter Schools when there is openings in fact there's low enrollment and so we've been following us for a few months and this is heartbreaking to us because to have our children shut out of Education opportunity that they would benefit from plus the dishonesty of being told that the school is full and there are no openings and being told what number you are on a waiting list during the year after the initial lottery so I've been trying to meet with Joseph Escobedo but he's been busy with PG deadlines so I'm hoping that one of you will come to our meeting so we can discuss this further thank you Lord president of the board my name is Michelle Melendez I'm the director of the city's office of equity and inclusion and I'm also a product of training by The People's Institute for survival

[00:31:00]
Beyond and have been a trainer in the past for Artie so you can imagine that in my new role as the city's director I have brought anti-racism training to the city and the mayor has mandated it for city employees so we have begun a series of community conversations on racial healing and I'd like to think many of you board members attended that last week it was a first step to start opening the conversations and we know that we have a long way to go to really deal with racism in our community I also want to point out and these are things that you know better than any of us were a people of people of color majority City and we've had 174 per cent growth in the people of color population in the past couple of decades 74% of our youth are young people of color and so the mayor has really embraced that our way forward is a city is to be safe inclusive and Innovative and you can't

[00:32:00]
do that without addressing inequities in our community and we're talking Rachel and other inequities so I'd like to join ask you to join us we have different anti-racism and racial Equity trainings planned over the next few months including the May 4th and 5th event that's just been described and we would love to be partnering with the city of between the City of Albuquerque and APS to host these jointly and leverage our resources and bring in as much resources we can to build our own local capacity to do this training we have a Grant application that we're putting in so that we can continue to fund these going forward and anytime that we can we will invite APS to join us in those trainings and we would love to be able to have the same opportunity if you have an opportunity so that we can send city employees so that we can all grow our emotional and social Intelligence on this and address

[00:33:00]
the Deep inequities that exist in our city thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for your infant tonight and that concludes public forum thank you we're going to the Super potential report Thank you period High School is a school on the rise as you may recall a new features was designated a CSI school by the New Mexico public education department based on its graduation rate with the funds made available based on the designation its own summer school program for the first time new features will have the resources and ability to ensure that New Orleans do not have to wait until the fall semester to continue or even

[00:34:00]
delete their High School coursework rather they will be able to work through the summer on their coursework and have the quality child care that their new babies need this type of Common Sense model will undoubtedly lead to impressive results as these new and expecting parents work towards Crossing that finish line that we call graduation we have very high hopes and I'm very happy to be able to report this to you tonight are middle and high school band programs just wrapped up their annual music performance assessment during these three days this 3 Day Festival schools were judged by three Professionals in their field and we're giving a rating based on their musical performance the following schools received a superior rating meaning that they were Superior in every aspect of their performance

[00:35:00]
it's a long list we have Desert Ridge Middle School Eisenhower Middle School Garfield Middle School Jackson Middle School LBJ Middle School Tony hillerman Middle School Van Buren Middle School Albuquerque High School Atrisco Heritage High School Cibola High School El Dorado High School Highland High School La Cueva High School Manzano High School Sandia high school and Volcano Vista High School very very proud of this designation so I need to forewarn you because several APS teachers have gone Renegade they've begun what they call an accomplished teaching podcast and it's called hallway Renegades the podcast is for a growing community of educators

[00:36:00]
are committed to listening and learning from one another in the midst of busy lives the first podcast is a delightful interview with our very own Dr Gabriella Blakey on the trust in education you can listen to all the podcasts at www.hollandamerica.com

[00:37:00]
how much as one of the top school districts in the country for lead certification APS committed to a goal of lead silver or better for all new construction more than 10 years ago so far the district has an impressive 54 lead projects within its portfolio all of which contribute to lowering aps's resource consumption and therefore lowering operating costs also from the article a quote we have a quote from Tony Sparks and Mr Sparks says lead provides the way to ensure you're getting the things that matter to you if you see Healthy Living Spaces and environmental stewardship we found that the cost of Leeds beyond what we would do anyway is Tiny yet it is crucial and critical in holding our teams accountable for

[00:38:00]
desired outcomes on each and every project the article also mentions the work of the water and energy conservation committee or what and from this article another quote APS is dedication to Green Building remains intact because District leaders have consistently focused on prioritizing results for student health and well-being and on the district's long-term Financial sustainability through Smart Energy Management I'm excited for all the ways that the staff and Leadership of the district are helping to make the world a better place not only for our students but are having an influence nationally as well this concludes superintendents report thank you thank you Google Assistant

[00:39:00]
play Dr Gabriel Becky on Rogue associate superintendent from Georgia Line and Dr Ellen Bernstein president of Albuquerque teachers Federation maybe they're all Rogue I'm not sure they don't listen to me when I tell them to come over that's more of authority thing has never said thank you for being rude that could be a quote to give you a little bit of an update on the MRI schools and where we are now as you know we went through this process last year and then seeing the hard work of the schools we felt like it was a good time to Showcase how far they've come with the immense task that they were given at the beginning of the school year and how each school is really designing a school unique to them even

[00:40:00]
I know they all use the same framework so we have the principles here that will share with you different elements of the plan just to remind you a little bit about the plan remember it was built on our theory of action regarding Community Schools and we use the four pillars of Community Schools to design the work and in that work we also had some core beliefs that we shared that schools should be designed around student-centered learning social emotional learning formative assessment backwards planning standard space cross curricular planning and teaching and distributive leadership the redesigned elements in the community school framework where were added into each of the pillars and so I know you will remember this we went over it a lot talking about Blended learning dual language adding genius hour using the sqt model for

[00:41:00]
teacher development the beginning of the school day the staff comes in at 7:30 to 8:30 they have the sqt time and then in the afternoon we have genius hour for the students they also are building a robust community schools within their school so what we did was in about a semester after the work and it felt like 5 years I'm sure to the principal of felt like 20 years of work but it was only like 4 months so we met with the survey out to the three School staffs to kind of see where they were in the model in the different elements of the model and then we met with all three instructional councils to talk about things that were going well where they needed more support things we feel like there's an opportunity with the public education department to have those conversations but we needed to hear from the school's first as far as what the conversation would be around what was working and what

[00:42:00]
you'll be able to hear a little bit tonight from each of the principals but overall the initial Impressions that we got from the instructional council's based on the survey were that they had an overwhelming belief that the plan implementation was going well and remember we took this survey right before winter break so they were either really honest at that time or really waiting for winter but we were really happy with these results they also said that the Blended learning strategies were beginning to be integrated but there was a need for more support in that area so that was one of the areas of support that was needed they felt that there was definitely an overwhelming benefit of Genius hour for the students they found that about half of the teachers that were surveyed are interested in pursuing their national board certification and

[00:43:00]
they felt that the time allowed for training and professional development they felt that that at this time has enhanced their ability to complete tasks and you know there's never enough time it feels like you add time and then you feel like you still need time so that was one of the elements that we were looking at as far as adding the 8-hour day for for the staff we have Dr Bernstein here to go over kind of some of the nitty-gritty of the survey because she's a doctor she can read the surveys but to really talk about the you know when we made the plans we really worked in coordination with the school staffs and with the union and so we were all kind of on this team to rebuild the schools and so she's here to present some of those findings thank you very much I think you can basically see

[00:44:00]
how clear the pie charts are they the staff at all three schools were asked if they felt their redesigned plans were going well and a large number of Staff feel that they're going well the next one which ones next one thank you the next one is at 50% of the people because of the exposure are thinking about becoming board certified which is huge in any given school the next pie chart talks about the genius hour and I think one of the things that was significant for me when we met with all of the instructional councils in December was listening to the stories about the staff the kids in the community around genius hour and what has been happening with that

[00:45:00]
oh sorry and then the last one that I was supposed to talk about is that I'm able to plan lessons for Blended learning environment and I think that Dr Blakey mentioned this earlier people feel like they're starting to understand this but that they need more support more time and to integrate it more fully into their teaching thank you ok Google I want to say a few things about what I found as we met with the schools instructional councils and

[00:46:00]
listen to what they had to say both in terms of what we got wrong in trying to create something different at the schools and then also what we got right this work that was a very collaborative effort and I think a very respectful effort has affirmed for me that centering our actions in an asset-based belief system results in positive change for everybody our collaborative planning was based on the belief that the teachers have assets that they are part of that community and that they're not interchangeable pieces on some imaginary game board like so many reconstitution schemes have done throughout the years are work with centered on our shared belief that the students and their families have assets and for all aspects

[00:47:00]
with an R control in this process everything we did with these three schools was based on that idea that we are not there to fill somebody's deficits this is a significant departure from that tired No Child Left Behind driven initiative of blame the teachers and fix the kids I think what this affirm to me is that we can do great things with collaboration and Imagination and that we don't have to punish schools based on this idea of failure and I want to thank very much the work that I have been able to do in this area with APS and specifically with Dr Gonzalez and Dr Blakey thank you

[00:48:00]
okay so some of what we saw in the overall survey of the staffs were things that were going well we're genius hour the extended year for students teachers actually getting paid for the 8 hours that they were doing the work anyway Community Schools as a framework and the time embedded for coaching and PD the areas for adjustment is that there's excessive assessments coming to save me I can feel it there is still this looming aspect of school closure that we're working on with Pedro the schools are looking at adjusting the calendar for the PD days to have more time within the school year instead of it all being up front at the beginning of the school year

[00:49:00]
we need to help the schools access funds to support genius hour which was put in but the schools really need funding for it and each School works on Minor Adjustments to their master schedule to be able to meet the needs of their individual schools so again all three schools are using the same framework but it's really exciting to see the personalities of each School come out in the highlights and so we want you to hear a little bit so we want you to hear a little bit from each of the highlights of each of the schools that we find to be really Stellar Hawthorne is going to talk to you about their implementation of Community Schools Los Padilla's has some great things to share about genius hour and Whittier does an exceptional job in working in coaching teachers that I think everybody needs to really hear about so each of the principles are going to go over those elements with you beginning

[00:50:00]
if Judy Martin from Hawthorne Elementary School but thank you very much and before I begin I want to thank you for allowing me to be one of the principals at an MRI school it's just been such an honor and I'm happy that I get to talk about a community school councils because this was something that I did not care for in the grant it scared me because I heard horror stories about Community Schools and I didn't think I would be able to give the energy necessary to complete that part of the plant but when you surround yourself with good people good things happening and that's what we've done our community council is composed of 42 members we meet twice a month we have a represent

[00:51:00]
location from our school staff to District support to our nurse to parents we have a student on the council and we have a community members and elected officials and I'm very proud to say that board member Patterson is one of our council members and Senator Mimi Stewart so you can tell we have a very active and robust Council so what we did is and we not all 42 members show up at once but we have usually 20 to 25 always in attendance so what we did is we followed the framework that we received at a conference recently and we chose a goal what is it that we wanted to work on as a community council and so we looked at our data and we chose absentee

[00:52:00]
so we brainstormed what how how do we come up with an activity or quite a few activities or what can we do immediately to help with our tardies and our absenteeism and so with brainstorming with the council members we came up with an idea called lunch Lotto this has really really been a terrific little Edition that's so easy it can be done at any school and what that is is that we put the names we have 45 targeted students so we put names in the Hat in each grade level of children with good attendants along with one or two of those that were targeting and what we do is we pull out those names and those children get to eat lunch in the cafeteria at a special table with the table cloth and blue and they get

[00:53:00]
yes it's just I love it I get to eat with them every Friday and they get a donated meal that the council goes out and gets you know from McDonald's or Freddy's or Burger King and they're very special they wear a star with a beautiful lanyard and they wear that all day and when I sit with them so many times I hear my mom's going to be so proud of me and what we talk about is well you know you're here because you have good attendance or even proved your attendance and so they understand the concept we just started that after the first Friday after winter break and so far we've seen that out of the 45 students 25 have improved their attendance which is very very good very impressive they know what it is now and in fact they made a little video about it today and they're going to present that video at

[00:54:00]
another board meeting on Monday is not your board meeting but it's for the Community Schools the donations we it's it's wonderful the donations we get and that the Community Partners want to work with us we have one lady who goes and picks them up every Friday she's a community members she has no children in our school but she wants to be active she gets those lunches every Friday for the students and the businesses are so good about donating those and we have felt that not only has our attendance in our parties improve but the community council has drawn in and made such an impact on our school that this is just an average but our average scores have improved 12.4 per cent since the beginning of the year and that's average of all grade levels so I went kind of kicking and screaming but not telling anybody

[00:55:00]
I was kicking and screaming I was just kicking and screaming in my head about a community school and to just loving it and being very very grateful that I've had this opportunity to work with so many different people and I actually look forward to those 7:30 meetings so thank you Google period

[00:56:00]
what's the students and their parents what kind of classes and activities will they would like their students to to have access to once we do that and then within the five resources and who can actually be a support to the students many times and we always have to have a teacher but many times are community members we have an aquilo class that starts by community members there's a teacher have a cooking class that is actually done by community members and we also have resources from the community when we have the celebrations demonstrations the presentations we have 150 + Community coming to school every six weeks that promotes communication with the parents knowing the school the way it is now in in feeling good about what the students are doing the

[00:57:00]
side benefit of having something like this at the end of the day is the students go home Happy the students go home and they talk to the parents about what they did for for the sports class for the robotics class for you know all these other classes that we have and then the conversation starts in a good manner instead of sometimes the students being so tired but want to three in the afternoon it's actually a time when they're going to start doing activities and have all these activities in the afternoon then the other part that we did in trying to reach again as a community school is when I talked to the one of the centers that we have close to my our school that is realistic dancers in the purpose of this is to also reach out into the community and so our students every six weeks ago and

[00:58:00]
something could be poetry could be a dance could be a little play or sometimes even an interview to the elders and and so we have this communication with them I was able to provide transportation for free because the community center is working with us and they're taking our students over there so we're trying to create a something that is the community as a whole that is working on sorry for students and doesn't really allow for dental visits or doctors visits sometimes when the kids go in the middle of the day they want to come back and just like the previous example of improving and influencing my school also got up at 7:44

[00:59:00]
good evening members of the board superintendent reading my name is Kim Fink I'm the principal at Whittier Elementary and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the work that we've been doing with teachers I think we all believe all of us who worked on this MRI issue that the real unit of change in this process is with the teacher that those are the people who directly impact the students and so if we do the correct things there and and leave for the ground we're setting everybody up for Success so some of the specific work that we've done is making sure that we have a line curriculum and that our teachers really really understand the programs that are being provided to them by the district specifically we've worked very closely with the Stepping Stones Consultants that was provided by the series to make sure that there's a clear understanding of the math content and it's really exciting to hear

[01:00:00]
recovery making sure that when we do have kids who are struggling we actually have strategies that will help them grow in mathematics we're working through the ELA because we were able to adopt the new curriculum early which is Benchmark advance so really learning that and being absolute experts and making sure that there's a line curriculum a lot of that has been done through the morning work in professional development the sqt which has been absolutely essential we're meeting with them every morning also common planning time that we provide during the day the budget steering committee was very generous and making sure that we had all the resources we needed for pull up classes so that our teachers have common planning Time by grade level every single day that they always have that time we've done a lot with

[01:01:00]
I need analysis it's part of the the embedded professional development I call it dirty data versus clean data I think for a long time there's been this view that assessments bad assessment is not bad assessment is something that we absolutely have to do but it has to be used in the context of how do we drive what the decisions we make in the classroom and how do we drive decisions we make for individual students and make sure that we're meeting their needs so we do a lot of work around examining student work actually sitting down and looking at writing samples we do that once a month we do data analysis on our Stepping Stones it's an actual item analysis where we take a look at why kids missed it's not enough to know that they missed it we need to know why so for example in math if a kid missed an area problem if 75% of the class missed a problem on area is the problem that they don't understand area or was multi-digit multiplication that actually tripped them up so that we spent time in our time the correct things and

[01:02:00]
and it's taking a look at things like good old Running Records or schools going back to Running Records we don't find the iStation provides the kind of day that we need to give students to have a clear picture of what children can do so really knowing kids very intimately on an academic level we also have a coaching and feedback system that we do on a regular basis all of our teachers score themselves on a rubric that we build based on a book called Get Better Faster by Bob Marley and it really takes a look at planning versus actually carrying out of the classroom they rated themselves and then based on the feedback that they gave us we kind of teachers who get weekly visits teachers who gets every two weeks and teachers to get visits every three weeks these are not evaluative visits non-value we're going in just side by side with the teacher talking about the one high leverage thing that we think that they can do

[01:03:00]
in the course of a week 2 weeks 3 weeks it could be something very very simple like just making sure that there's equity and call outs in your classroom the classroom visits last 5 to 10 minutes and then we always meet with those teachers within 24 to 48 hours we did a school climate survey and we found that 100% of our teachers either agreed or strongly agreed that that was something useful to them in their personal practice the results so far what we saw was between August and December we had about a 15% shift in our i-Ready math scores and then I already reading anywhere from a 4 to 25% shift depending on the grade level Mr President members of the board superintendent reading you know that this has been quite the journey in terms of the work that we've engaged in over the last couple of years but the implementation in reality has only just been over a semester as mentioned and one of the things that has been quite remarkable

[01:04:00]
watch has been this legislative session and seeing how so many pieces of legislation have reflected components of these MRI plans be at the community schools peace the genius our national board certification piece the extended time the study of quality teaching the sqt work and so on so I think that has been one of the things that has brought great hope and validation to the work that has taken place at least three schools what I would say in terms of what we've learned intentionally intentionally or quite frankly tripping over our own two feet we really have celebrated the implementation of work that has been taking place the study of quality teaching in our district a task force teams in collaboration with our teachers union for several years looking to see what does that mean well these schools in these plants is giving us an opportunity to integrate those studies those that research those best practices and really see how it's taken off at these three schools we've seen

[01:05:00]
where it's worked we've seen where we need to tweak a little bit and it's really put reality into plants that have been on a shelf for quite some time so we we celebrate that we look forward to continuing to perfect that work we've also seen what the real local narrative and Community Schools in the specialized Focus to these individual schools around the community school framework and concept have been realized we've seen as many examples have been shared this evening in regards to community council is really taking ownership of their schools and owning those dreams those postie those little sticky notes that many of you saw at those Round Table conversations when we build these plans will that has not been forgotten and really these same people in many cases that attended those Round Table conversations are the very people that are sitting on these community councils at this time we've looked at what funding

[01:06:00]
and resources and sustainability looks like in relationship to these plans and we've had intentional conversations of what's next in our district in regards to supporting schools down the road and owning our narrative as a district in relationship to Performance Frameworks and systems of supports as we look forward to Lessons Learned and what does the future hold and having quite frankly a great deal of Hope for what that means for our district and it's allowed us to really enrich our students experience and their Pathway to better attendance and morale in all three schools cases be at genius hour be at additional time we have seen a spike in excitement in joy of learning in the schools so that has been something that I don't know that you can put a number on but it's been amazing to watch and see so what's next

[01:07:00]
really are on the pathway of prioritizing structures to replicate or scale up some of this work conversations as recently as just a few hours ago are taking place in reference to looking at these prototypes and how we can look at the future in terms of everything from budget to Lessons Learned to working together as teams to look at owning that narrative and looking to see how we can scale up some of this work with some other schools perhaps determine systems and prototypes to replicate sustainable structures what is really working and I think you saw a lot of what's working in the feedback that was given and discuss opportunities to grow and Mentor Future Leaders for schools I think was something that we really looked at very intentionally as we see the great success that we've had in these School leaders the teacher leadership piece has also grown at all three schools just looking at the data of half of the teachers at these three schools

[01:08:00]
22 pursue one of the highest bars of achievement in the teaching profession and that being the national board certification so we're excited and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with these three schools and excited for what the future holds in terms of school transformation and with that Mr President we all stand for any questions that you may have thank you very much I'm opening up for board questions I very much appreciate the presentation this evening and congratulations on your success I do have some questions for example when we have a survey that says going well and yet you have 25% saying they're neutral and 6% 6.3% saying that they disagree can you dig down a little bit and say why people responded and that way

[01:09:00]
so the results that you have are a combination of all three schools so part of it is we could guess I don't know because I haven't talked to the individual teachers some of it in the disagree is that the school transformation work is really hard and the schools have all worked with some teachers had the idea of it but choose to work somewhere else because a variety of reasons and I think when the neutral teachers it's because it's only been when we gave this it was only December so I think some people are hesitant like is you can't really say if something is working full on or not you know they felt uncomfortable saying that when it's only been till December when they took the survey but our hope is to survey again

[01:10:00]
at the end of the year too and see how it's progressing and to be able to dig into those data a little bit better but you know if it said 100% strongly agree I would be concerned that there was a misunderstanding of the question that's that's very helpful thank you the tracking of the implications of what your implementing for me is still really engaged and challenged that's all very very important in my mind as organizational culture in a school and whether or not people are willing to transform the way they do business and my hope is that

[01:11:00]
please play witness that at Los Padilla's I was actually pretty amazed and very pleasantly surprised that the number of parents who themselves were actually going to get their geds other parents who want to be teachers that to me is very exciting and I was concerned about the energy level that children might have or face at the end of a school day when one piece of feedback is that the children seem very enthusiastic about what they were doing in the genius hour and excited to be able to present and I believe that you had the children presenting to each other so thank you very much for what you're doing

[01:12:00]
yeah I just like to say thank you for all the work I mean I think this is real testimony to what happens when we approach a school with that Outlook of their strengths in the community and I mean I keep saying it over and over again but the way that the community stepped up and all three of those schools to say this is our school and we're going to fight for it in the way staffs State committed and and Rose to the occasion with the leadership of the principles of collaboration one of my concerns and one of the things that I heard early on is how difficult it was especially at the beginning that wonderful

[01:13:00]
ideas are wonderful but implementation is a whole nother thing and and so I'm I'm really glad that over time maybe not as rapidly as we'd like but over time that bit by bit there's the analysis going on and what other resources are needed realistically what do we do so that we can sustain the growth because one of the issues right now is there's been this huge investment up to this point what do we need to do to guarantee that the people who have done the work up to this point are able to stay and continue that process because one of the hardest things when when there's a real massive redesign is maintaining the stability of the staff because it's it's just hard work but one of the things that strikes me every time I walk into

[01:14:00]
either Hawthorne or Whittier I confess I haven't been to the list of this even though I would like to but the level of just personal relationship between staff and students and family that it's so clear that every single student in each of those schools is known and recognized and that their needs and sometimes those needs are overwhelming I mean there's a reason why these schools were identified as as you know failing schools their kids that come with tremendous need and it's not always easy to figure out how do you move forward and every time I walk into either Hawthorne there's this level of around services and it's almost

[01:15:00]
Musical part I mean it rain on lose almost physically wrapping around to what does this child need and I think being able to address really and truly deeply that social emotional need of students in a respectful way I mean and respect for the staff respect for the parents respect for the children is deep and the level of professional growth and just the professional conversation that I hear is really exciting thank you for Running Records thank you my heart and so anyway it's I think it's really critical that we be honest and this is the one other thing that I wanted to say I really appreciate the honesty that I hear from from

[01:16:00]
review about not crossing over not saying oh everything is wonderful just smile and go on because that doesn't help us grow and and so I really appreciate the level of honesty of saying what's the need where are the difficulties where are the roadblocks what do we need to do because that's what we absolutely have to do if we're going to grow this model so thank you comma I was just going to say thank you too for all the work that you're doing I think highlights for me is that that reality that there is no Silver Bullet right that it's a number of things that are going to make a school succeed and you know sometimes we want to put just like all our eggs in one basket and it's just this one thing but it's a combination of of things that are going to help a school or help a student and the community succeed

[01:17:00]
I also agree that it's it's a semester I mean and I and I get that you know it's a semester and so it'll be interesting to see you know with time and what happens over the course of the end of the year right so that we can see what are those places that you know with this particular model what what does stand up pretty firmly I guess across all three schools and where are the areas where it doesn't write what are some of what are some of those things that make a difference because it is based on the community it is unique in terms of of what kind of support you have and what is needed to actually make that happen so I'll be curious to see how that goes because I think that's going to help us see evaluate further what what's the real support that needs to happen or you know what are some of those things to that could happen with very little

[01:18:00]
attention and those that require a lot more intervention to make happen to sustain a community school cuz I think that that's that's the trick in it Community Schools are not an easy design I mean you know it's it's a shift out for the community and it's also shipped out for the school you suddenly have to embrace people to come into your school and work with you which I think is is really different and then I just want to say you know congratulations again to being able to like keep our schools open for those communities because I think it's you know they they belong to the Community Schools don't belong to us I mean there's an infrastructure there that was built for a purpose because there was a group of families and communities that live there and they needed a school to attend to so close in the school was never really it was never an option we needed to have a place for

[01:19:00]
what are kids to go so I look forward to hearing some more and I do want to come out for one of those 6 week celebrations over at Los Padilla's so let me know when the date is so I could come out to that and I love the idea that you're doing some intergenerational work too and going to Las estancia's I think that's a that's a great idea thank you ok Google that actually make a big difference in the community and I appreciate that you're here today and we should see you here more often but I know that you have things to do after work and I know you have a long long day I know it's a very long day for you and I appreciate all the work you do with her

[01:20:00]
and thank you so much for being here and thank you Dr Blakely and talk to Gonzalez for all the work that you all do everyday thank you I also appreciate the update thank you for being here this evening and thank you for sharing all that you did and again you're honesty we really appreciate that I'm very impressed and what's taking place in the last 5 months it sounds incredibly intense though and I also Echo the sentiments on sustainability and and giving the support that we can to the staff and the teachers around that I also really enjoyed hearing about the the support around teacher leadership and the encouragement around that in the next steps on that and especially how important it is on developing relationships real relationships with students and children and and having that approach towards that whole child so thank you again to all of me for being here tonight and thank you again for this report thanks

[01:21:00]
thank you just a quick question just to Echo some of the things but the one thing I really do worry about I do worry about sustainability of the capability to do it and I worry about scaling possibilities because typically when we do these things the idea is not just to do them for free schools the idea is take these kinds of Pilots these kinds of things that we think are really work well and expand them to some of our schools right so I worry about cost us to do that but more than that I worry about the energy it takes for a person to do this it's a huge amount of energy and you know we start these things I've been part of these things where you really can you work and you work and then you get tired you know and

[01:22:00]
it's hard it's hard work like you said and so I worry about even the ability for us to take these three schools and say hey we got really good things we're getting good results we're getting better attendance and yet it takes a huge amount of effort a huge amount of effort and then if you take these teachers who want to do national board certification that's not an easy thing that takes a lot of effort you know what I mean so if they're going to do this along with national board certification all of a sudden now we're using up about 36 hours a day you know and then you go to meetings like this and then you go to meetings like Community meetings and then you go to meetings like forums and you go to all these other things you know and sometimes you don't get the kind of appreciation that that I think is needed so I worry about that so this from your own perspective I know we haven't really done probably a really good costume I know how much it pretty much cost is for individual schools

[01:23:00]
we may be able to do that a little cheaper for like I say a CSI school or TSI school maybe a little different kind of format what are your thoughts just briefly you know do you really think we can sustain this I mean and then is it really possible to scale it I mean you know these principles are working they're working 24/7 you know I mean you know really I'm serious and and so it's a hard job you know and then we're going to have maybe some other things put on people you know maybe we'll have a bunch of other things and we'll have other stuff pretty soon you know it's it's a commitment doctor and no answers I'm going to let everybody know you know that

[01:24:00]
if you think that's not a general problem at is a general problem and it isn't because we're not smart people it's because if we had the answers they'd all be coming to us across this whole nation so I'm just telling you okay so a couple things one s q t stands for supporting quality teaching and we've used that committee to do some deep research and work on multiple things over many years we used it to do our work on our car program we used it to work on the idea of time and how we might get to an 8 hour day and that work that we did in collaboration and that committee is the work that was applied to this model when we applied it to the model I think one of the things that we weren't in a position to do yet was allowed the staff not to be busy in every single hour of

[01:25:00]
play single day and to maybe look at some of those hours as being just for what you need to get done at that moment in time you know personal planning personal preparation and we need to kind of balance out on some of of that we need to look at Staffing so we can maybe differentiate that's not the word I'm looking for so that we can look at ways in which it doesn't have to be that classroom teacher doing genius our also that maybe we have other supports and other people coming in so that it's not just on that small group of people but maybe we'll have some resources to expand the number of human beings doing that kind of intense work and support I think it's very important that we don't do what we've done in the past and I've watched it go through many cycles and that is some initiative usually at the state level says you're not doing well as the school so we're going to provide you

[01:26:00]
with mandated support in that kind of oxymoron kind of way that we mandate support and then the school does better and then we pull away the support and so we can't do that we really need to look at what it's going to take in these three communities before we go to scale so that it's not that they're going through the roller coaster of oh now we're going back to a Traditional School model now we're going to expand our supports for kids families I think that there's money in Senate bill one and House Bill 5 to do some of that work because they're increasing the risk factor and I think that that's what some of this money is intended for however we also run the risk of what I hear in the legislature right now and that is how do we afford it don't worry it's in that risk factor and so I think that's going to be interesting I know you have an update later

[01:27:00]
weather in it'll be interesting to see what that's for there's also the implication of how do we learn from this so that we hold on to these lessons because what I've witnessed also is that we go through generations of initiatives and then we forget what we did so there's some implications for this work that I want to make sure I say out loud one is plans are written down when we worked with the rethinking of Rio Grande and Ernie Pyle we tried really hard and then later at Emerson and also at Eubank which is now Janet we tried really hard to make sure that what we're doing as a plan that guides us as a school is written down not that it's written down to keep us stock in what we thought was a good plan but so we can review and revise on a yearly basis but that we have something written to guide us so

[01:28:00]
that we can refer back to it when things get so busy and we lose our way that's important and then it's important to that we document the good work we do and we're doing some really significant work in our Partnerships right now we have The Residency program where we're working with UNM the union and of course the district and we're going into our second cohort of residents so we talk a lot at our meetings in The Residency program and I said I sure wish I knew a grad student who will take all of this great work we're doing and do a little research and write it up and get it published and then Dr Krebs said oh I know somebody and we met with her last week and she is amazing she's a parent at her doctorate in the College of Education and she is so excited to help us do some qualitative research so you might get phone calls principles on what

[01:29:00]
we're doing here with the schools and then look at some implications some lessons to be learned for the rest of the educational Community because the other thing I think we do is good work and then we don't immortalize it in any way and it's time to start doing that OK Google how do we sustain this type of work is in how we look at schools of choice and how do we sustain these three schools to become a school of choice where it is

[01:30:00]
I have these elements as part of their school rather than it it being almost an idea that oh look here we fixed with your now like take everything away let's go do a little plan on another school but in taking that whole asset-based approach that we've taken with these schools and building it to be that you want to go to a school like Whittier or a hawk or Los Padilla's because they are a school of choice that have so much to offer that it becomes a model of innovation within the District of a school to sustain so I guess it would be kind of moving towards the sustainability of a Cadre of innovative schools that come up through this redesign of transformation that it's a good thing that the schools were able to get the support through the battle but when we come out of

[01:31:00]
what parts of the plant are really relevant and good for the community that they them become a school of choice and not an MRI school but that would actually mean that they were an Innovative school thank you very important one is extremely important I don't care what we're doing whether it's this particular activity or whether it's Sops or related services or counselors or whoever's documenting information that's important because we got to know where we are we got to know what we're doing we got to know what we're doing right and that thing that's really important I think it's very interesting you got a person who wants to do some research I'm always right and so we need to understand how

[01:32:00]
it's really working with regard to our overall picture of what we're trying to do here for research so I would suggest that that would be a good thing and besides that he might be a nice Mentor for the purpose of if she's getting a doctorate how does school really work I would suggest that's a really good idea and I love the idea but School of Choice Innovation and then I'd like to say well what I really want to do is I want to make that to Norm it's just a normal school right I want to go to my neighborhood school it's a normal school I get in great education there whatever it takes to do that so we want to move from Innovation that's what I mean by sustainability that's what I mean by skating you know all of our schools probably need some of this aspect and so I think that's those are all really good things so thank you so much for for your comments I think these are all

[01:33:00]
doing things we don't hear that all the time and yet that's that's what we should be saying is that we're working towards Innovative things that are going to become the norm this is who we are so yes Mr President members of the board of one point that we don't want to be missing in part to answer your question is the whole concept of leadership development and how we've taken lessons in the development and roll out of these plans but also the intentional Mentor principal concept that we have in place with two Master principals in Geneva and Kathy house in the work that they have done in the track record of success that they've had in their leadership and principal in over years and the support that they've given and I think

[01:34:00]
three cases I think I see the principal's nodding that their support has been absolutely invaluable a critical friend a thought partner somebody that they're able to bounce ideas off of work on budgets with talked about hiring practices deploying professional development and the list just goes on and on and I just I know on behalf of all of us that have presented not enough thank you can go out to these two individuals for the support that they have given behind the scenes but also in the Forefront of the work they have just been Pioneers in the works so thank you thank you Miss house I think that's great and bring something to the individuals how do we build these Master Teachers that are going to maybe scale to other schools you know so interesting questions if we had all the answers we would have done a long time ago so I think

[01:35:00]
that took place in anticipation of this it didn't just come up like Topsy there was a lot of thought reaching out to the community members listening to teachers and mothers and fathers and talking to students and administration talking to and working closely with the Union all of this took a lot of time and effort because we wanted to do it and we wanted to do it thoughtfully and I think we're seeing some of the results it is very very hard you're absolutely right but her kids are worth it and and and and and what we're seeing here is the fruit of literally the love that to everyone had for the students and we're seeing that results so I would love nothing better than to see these

[01:36:00]
what school is established and looked at as models for for other schools across the state in the country and I see that certainly is within the realm of possibility and I'm just very very proud of the work that's that's taking place and I'm so glad they were able to give you some of those details thank you and the last comment I'm glad the city's here because I think collaboration with the city and all of these kind of things is extremely important I mean we're talking about Community Schools we're talking about the other side of things later on we'll talk about other kinds of collaboration but that is really important because the city is part of our community you know we are part of the city so that has to work in terms of all of our 143 schools and so those are important things so I'm glad that the city is here to hear this because we cannot do this without the community we cannot do this without City without the club operation so that is an important thing for us to know so yes okay thank you

[01:37:00]
board president Piercy and members of the board in the superintendent reading I just wanted to jump up here real quickly and thank you for all of the comments about us working hard and being tired in the long days and I wanted to address that because I'm very tired but I'm pretty old too but the only thing I have heard is it's a long day for kindergarten and first graders that's about the only drawback but I think the ones for a school that does work the hours that we work you need to find a leader that really values what a teacher does in the classroom I know that I am absolutely a bear about anybody from the district offering any training to my teachers unless it's a 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. I don't care they come at that time my teachers do not stay

[01:38:00]
after 4:00 I really talk to them about their national boards about not doing the whole Chunk in one year they have three years to do this just to take care of themselves and their family I insist on my teachers are out that door at 4:00 at the end of the day so so that they can go home and they can rest I'm also working on a schedule for genius hour next year where I have enough teachers to cover genius hours where each teacher will have at least six weeks period off so that will give them an extra 45 minutes in the day to do their work I just can't tell you how how hard teachers work in this day and age I don't know how they do it not only with everything that's on line and all the testing and all the mandates and everything that they put up with our students are coming to us with social and emotional problems

[01:39:00]
better taking away their instructional time so just keep that in mind when you hire the new leaders for the for the other schools coming on if you if your teachers are happy your children will succeed and one of the things they have to do is they have to enjoy their own family and get a good night's rest thank you yeah maybe they need a nap in the day I don't know shut up thank you very much I greatly appreciate this presentation it's great to have an update so thank you so much and we'll go on to our next special is the governor of government Affairs update will do that with Dr Joseph Escobedo so you guys can give us a thought about what's going on

[01:40:00]
hello good evening president Pearcy members of the board superintendent reading this is Final Countdown maybe to the legislative session yesterday was a big day where Senate bill one passed the floor on the Senate side and House Bill 5 passed on the house side they are nearly amended to look the same there's a slight difference in the teacher pay between House Bill 5 and Senate bill one they both brought to the floor a similar amendment that helped move those off the floor that amendment was around the age 22 cap question and the amendment held will hold harmless for a year on the funding for schools that serve adult students or students over the age of 22 and then we'll put into place a pilot program with 3 million dollars in funding

[01:41:00]
in collaboration with higher ed and ped to study how to transition to higher ed surveying all students for high school course work I guess I don't and and then diplomas as a possibility but that's not for Mandy there so the age 22 cap in a sense passed and those schools the Gordon Bernal that was most impacted by it and did the best job bringing people up and talking to legislators did feel like this solution was one that would serve them I think they talked with the sponsors of the legislation before the amendment and help make the amendment which is why they waited to maybe discuss those yesterday so that's a big notable thing those should go pretty quickly and the Senate passed 41 to 0 the house it was 53 to 14 in favor so when they

[01:42:00]
Kris Kross now they I don't expect that they'll meet much obstacles that does care about 120 million in funding for APS and those bills so I'm outside the age 22 issue there's a lot to look forward to and those bills and they are lined up right now with House Bill 2 which is the appropriation bill that lines out the anticipated funding for the legislation that they hope to have passed around at Risk Index increased to the SVG teacher salaries Etc otherwise everything else has felt minor but still can cause enough to keep keep updating and keep watching him updated this chart for you again it's the same one we've had with most of the same bills a few added in but there is been more movement is there any specific ones that you want me to focus in on for you

[01:43:00]
cash reserves that were swept by Governor Martinez previously has that been introduced or is there a decision about not doing that I haven't seen any legislation on that there's been a few people who have brought that up I'm the only kind of parallel as a backfill allocation for instructional materials so I haven't seen any legislation anything definition law and what

[01:44:00]
you don't see a description of how it's changed or has it have some of the challenges with that lot being addressed at this point so House Bill 407 is the election law 50 or 2:00 and that is I'm going to the house floor it is on the calendar now I thought it would pop up today but I think it'll probably pop up tomorrow when it was discussed last week in Senate Judiciary it was pretty unanimous it was about 8:00 at night last Thursday I think and there was a packed room and they said who's here to support and everyone raised her hand and who's here to oppose and there were no hands and there was some discussion and it passed you know out of there so once it gets passed out the house it's been assigned to in the Senate and and keep an eye on it from there do you have questions on the specifics of 407 or well it has to do with mail-in ballots and the amount of time that we have to be able to

[01:45:00]
do something if we do choose to have a another Proposal with regards to the maintenance funds from what I understand it's going to align the election law and the tax code so that ballots that are elections that are passed you can get taxes for in that same year which means we can collect on funds in 2019 with an election in November so it will you know if that would have been added in last year it would have made the male and election maybe not necessary because we would have been able to go to November but that wasn't the case the tax code didn't match up with that so this will allow for November elections to occur so in 2019 and that for us to still collect money on them in December for the whole year but there's

[01:46:00]
requirement that that particular election be a mail-in ballot know I'm not remember Garcia that 407 doesn't will continue to say all elections should line up in November local state city but if you if any entity wants to do their own election they can only do it via mail in so the idea is to try to get all elections on to one cycle for one trip for the voter to go vote and to discourage anything else and so the mail and election will be the only exception you can use if you don't want to use that synchronize election day going forward thank you I mean we're saying that it's going to allow us to like collect the taxes so does 407 have or include language that directs the secretaries of State or the the you know at the local level to do that it does it does it says it's going to delay the

[01:47:00]
the actual putting in the actual information to the tax information that goes out to the voters president piercing member from my understanding as long as you make your declaration by July then the tax bill can be delayed to wait for the results of your election in November but we have to make the Declaration by July so that's that's a message to make it by I think it's July 31st we have to do that other comments board member what is your name Peterson

[01:48:00]
the the education retirement bills to my Salazar's Bill 338 I'm wondering if you've looked at it it all I mean I think it's I think it's really attempting to be a fix but I'm wondering if there's an alley this came to was brought to my attention earlier today is there an allocation in it to cover the district's portion of the increase and I guess that's a question for salaries for benefits as well on the other end for salary and if so what do we need to do to get sufficient money put into it so president I would have to get back to you on that particular bill

[01:49:00]
I have heard that the request was you know 4.5 or the funding and hb2 is a 5% and so that would leave employers with the other 5 cuz the request was 1% but right now llc's recommended you know budget for that is 0.5% so I'm not sure what bills that tags up to What legislation in house bill to but that was that's something I've heard but I'm not sure what the solution is or who we go to on that or what the hell that will work out it'll probably end with a houseful to appropriation question mark how

[01:50:00]
call Chris money is going to come is it going to be in this includes things like the community schools and all of that how much is going to be specific line item how much is going to come to a school to or District rather to say here's here's the amount of money you decide how you've got to allocate it within the district what I know there's been a lot of debate about how many checks and balances they're going to be what kind of oversight do you have do you have sort of a global picture of how that's all going to shake out President Pierce and I have I can give you a understanding is probably going to be up to no leadership in school board I do think you know it's a 0.25 in 0.255

[01:51:00]
and so that equates to what Miss Coleman has and Teresa Scott have explained in numbers from 30 million to about 60 million for Apso 30 million increase that at risk money was did not have any kind of narrative attached to it in House Bill 1 or Senate bill one or House Bill 5 House Bill 5 amended it and send it to one accepted the same amendments that say here's will they both started out with that when districts submit for their operational budget to ped for approval they'll have to submit a narrative say alongside their budget request saying this is what we're going to do to serve at risk students and then through the process they have added in things that say for example these are some things that you could do but they are guidelines or suggestions there's not anything in the language of either bill that says you'll have to prove you use this or prove you do that and they give

[01:52:00]
feels like Community Schools are socio-emotional programs so I think the at least the intent as of now or the conversation now is that that money increases going to be left to districts to decide how they want to allocate resources to service at risk students but that in the past that money went into the operational pot and there was not really any mandates or you know ways to code or report on that funding and now there will be some but some of that may be worked out in PDD regulation once the session ends I think the appropriate place for it is with us and making those decisions but it's going to put some real serious conversations on us because on the one hand we recognize that no students in the state has had an educational

[01:53:00]
play the MRI schools is a real good example of we can't talk Equity without having resources behind it and I was looking we got we got a note this is just a sort of for instance we got a letter from the district drama folks that have analyzed for instance there are 14 middle schools in the district that do not have a drama program six of them are in zone one five of them are going to this is an equity issue if we don't put additional funding schools like the middle schools in zone one and two end up having to make decisions about when they don't have sufficient personnel and when they can't find programs that are needed do they do they focus on basic stuff which is what all of the testing

[01:54:00]
has moved people towards which means the things that students need most which is the programs that make the money come to school get underfunded and in schools like Van Buren end up deciding for instance I have an amazing Garden teacher there's an amazing school garden well where does that funding come from the schools that anyway so this is just I mean this really isn't for you you're doing exactly what you need to do it's just bringing to my what kinds of conversations we're going to have to have because it means allocating money differently from from school to school or else we are going to be not serving the children that are most we've got an obligation

[01:55:00]
to to meet the needs so hopefully there's going to be a whole lot of money in that hopefully we can make good decisions but I just felt like we need we need to be thinking about it because it means that some schools really have to get more than other schools in the district are the board members comments well I just want to thank you for tracking number 400 bills and keeping these 45 and and the visibility that the three of you have had up there has been incredible and the way the people move out of your way and open up the Halls when you walk down them seen it happened so but I mean the the leadership that the three of you have had up there is a positive thing up really appreciate the the visibility

[01:56:00]
what are the three of you have had up there and and how you are you're there to answer questions and be supportive and testify at hearing so thank you again for keeping these 45 in front of us and and for tracking over 400 bills for us thank you for Patterson with regard to House Bill 129 on security I understand there's a loophole OK Google so the community substitute does committee substitute does not really look like the original bill at all

[01:57:00]
it does focus in on our original intention which was to narrowly Define school security personnel and who that is and she worked closely with you to make sure that she was aligning with what they need to have in order to meet Insurance guidelines for school security or people who are considered eligible to carry a weapon on campus so it only identifies who can carry weapons in the school is that correct resource officers and whatever is designated within the school I'm not Patterson I don't think it's about school resource officers it's about retired police officers or people who are trained to carry weapons so it's not about Army school resource officer school security she was trying to close loophole because the word school security was not defined in statute and sometimes schools you know name someone a security person and

[01:58:00]
she felt like that could be misinterpreted so she was proactively trying to close the loophole around that language thank you for clarifying that and I just want to ask about that bill is what is it 4070 elections upon signature by the governor or approval by the governor is that effective immediately present period

[01:59:00]
how about some things you know what I'm saying and I'll continue to talk to and all the board members will too a lot of interesting things you know I looked at 1:29 and it was totally so it was different and I'm not sure how to dress what my original concerns were you know about having people who are 19 and over being able to carry guns on campus which I said no I don't want that you know that was in the original statute and I wanted to actually that part to be Rewritten to say no only people can be carrying his school security people unless Define school security people listen to find security security anyway so appreciate it thank you very much and we'll move on okay thank you

[02:00:00]
what District 1 I just want to say thank you to the families and students in the staff that organized and facilitated last night's meeting with the Native American Community I thought the small group discussion was excellent in my team I can only speak for my team I think it provided an opportunity for voices to be heard and more families to participate so I found the discussion to be really useful so I just wanted to say thanks to the to the teams and everyone that got together on that is just because as I'm thinking about like everything that the school district has to do I was thinking about all of these things just MRI schools getting plans ready putting all those things in place to organizing meetings to

[02:01:00]
I just think of like all the small little there's there's a bunch of little small things and they're big things because there's an incredible amount of staff time that goes into putting everything together whether it's our capital outlay and our budgets and so it's just really appreciate all the work because it seems like I see all the same people at all the same meetings we're always at all the same meetings whether its board meetings or Community meetings and so thank you for for your time I also am grateful that the city was here and wanted to thank them for including us in their Auntie races and community meeting that they had last week I found that really useful as well it was good to get out I like to again the small group discussion the opportunity to meet some folks I also got to meet some people from my community which I thought was great and then I just want to do just a quick shout out to a couple of schools elementary

[02:02:00]
I had a chance to go visit school it's been awhile cuz it was on Valentine's Day but I forgot to mention it last time and it was just such a nice event it was a science night and it was also the Premiere Dance night for the little girls dance team so it was they got to show off their new costumes and do their new dance it was really exciting and the parenting engagement was incredible there was so many people there which I thought was great and I had a chance to polish up my Spanish talk to my family members and it was really exciting because I you know I did ask them you know how are things going you know what do you like about our school what do you think we could do better and the it was just overwhelmingly everyone loved their school they all talked about how grateful they were for the changes this year they loved their school and

[02:03:00]
the things that they requested were so small and they were all really appreciative of their principal and so I left feeling you know like we've made some some good strides with that school because I know that there had been some problems in the past but everybody that night was just in such a great mood and then I just wanted to say a shout out to Jefferson Middle School for the second annual career fair which was held yesterday it's a career fair that they do in partnership with my agency and every student runs through that cafeteria and is engaged in some sort of career exploration so that also takes an incredible amount of coordination and I appreciate the school staff being willing to do that it's a lot of fun my team has a blast doing it they all like can I go I guess it's all right so nobody was in my office yesterday everybody was at Jefferson and then finally I just want to say baseball

[02:04:00]
I'm so excited and I'm going to a baseball game tomorrow at Rio Grande High School so I'm excited about that I've got it on my calendar I'm not missing it I am going to the game so that's it thank you thank you thank you the efficient meeting tonight I thought that it was very stimulating everyday at this point maybe it's just me you know I appreciate the reminders and the challenge that we support the people's Institute and undoing racism training I think that's a good idea I'm not so sure exactly about the training from the standpoint that it

[02:05:00]
feels like it's a lot of information Overkill and I think that people need to have an opportunity to process the information sort it out and so I would offer that as a friendly criticism I am wondering about our relationship with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the teaching tolerance and how that reconciles with some of the training options that we have and I would hope that maybe at some point perhaps whatever Patterson that this could be an opportunity for us as part of the district equity and inclusion agenda but actually explore that further you know what we do in committee's often allows us for some leeway simply because I think and that Committee in particular was to hear

[02:06:00]
Community Voices and concerns but also have some kind of interchange I don't see it as a violation of Ethics I am concerned about the issue raised about special ed students and Charter Schools this is something that never makes the media this is something that really is an issue we have folks who are skimming creaming whatever you want to call it at Charter Schools or the applications are 20 pages in some cases and poor people just don't have the time or the ability terms of being able to navigate that kind of an application and that's a problem and I want to suggest perhaps superintendent reading through the staff that we can Advocate with ped to take a look at some of the contradictions in that if you're concerned about racism take a look at that that's one place where it's showing up over and over again what was raised this evening about special ed students

[02:07:00]
I don't know how to say it except for in Spanish for the last time it's a big heartbreak and we have to get better both as an institution APS can certainly do better but we have to look at these most vulnerable students and families and my hope is that we can come to some some plan on how we propose to move forward I think there is there is some way that we have to begin to have more real conversations with the city or other entities that would like us to partner with them but it has to be a process of dialogue and hopefully negotiations that we can say what are intended outcomes are and how we hope to move forward and that we evaluate those intended outcomes as we as we move forward it means changing the way we do

[02:08:00]
Christmas and I don't know that we're always used to that I don't think that we can just say will commit to a certain amount of resource to be put there without having some saying how we move forward but I do appreciate the comments from the individuals and I do appreciate the amount of I think determination that you have to hopefully be heard and are determination to try to hear what you're saying and move forward

[02:09:00]
with Albuquerque and what we're doing with with solar energy with with sustainable thing there's a wonderful quote by Karen Allied Building lead is a win-win-win scheme the occupants the taxpayers into Mother Earth all win and it's true I mean I think it's why we've made that commitment to having healthy buildings that are sustainable and wise in their construction so that was that was very nice to come over but it's something that's the theme that I'm feeling pretty deeply and it will continue I will continue the district and then how we look at the actress money

[02:10:00]
and some disagreements but I think we can keep moving forward and work through it I absolutely agree with the issue of Charters and one of the things that's hard is that we have absolutely zero control over the ones that are State authorized and most of the ones in the city are indeed State authorized and are not hours and but it's something that we should check out because I think virtually every school in the district is impacted when kids come back because they've been discovered that they have an IEP they're all too frequently welcome

[02:11:00]
the resources stay with the charters and we serve the need and it's an untenable situation long term so it's something that we need to keep looking at I think you know I I went through the anti-racism training and I and it was powerful it was a valuable thing for me I've done enough professional development as both the recipient and the deliverer to really know that what that adults need to be treated with the same respect that children need to be treated with when it comes to learning and that one format works for one person but not necessarily for everyone and so I mean I think the important thing for us is a district is to look at what time and I think we absolutely share the goal and need to work with the city need to work with resources and so

[02:12:00]
I mean what I'd like to see is to say yes we need to make it possible for our staff to participate we need to let people know if there's any I don't know how we can go about thinking about funding but it's something that we could look at but but I know that there have to be lots of different opportunities I mean dating adults just like we need to we need to make sure that we're moving in a direction and honest I mean one of the most powerful things about the conversation last night that makes me go ok Google

[02:13:00]
play down because I went for the group of retirees up there today so driving down through the the Rio Grande Valley to Albuquerque and you start thinking land what would it take to put little plaques in every school of whose land was this whose land did it become because I mean there's all sorts of land that's that's the history of that I mean history is all around us and we don't do enough to recognize it and talk to students about it and it's something that seems like it would be fairly straightforward to address but the deeper stuff really understand about ourselves and about that history and our

[02:14:00]
relationship with the rest of the community and that I keep going back one person yesterday talked about time to reflect teachers needing time to reflect and an environment in which they can reflect and that's something that can't just be done with the two-day training even with as many people as might choose to do that it's something that needs to be ongoing and and integrated into what we do I think one step the work that's being done with the materials just looking at literature what literature what books do we have accessible to to schools and I think a lot of work is being done in the right direction for that so they're little pieces that are being put into place that are really that are really important the ethnic studies and the process that we need to go through to really have that

[02:15:00]
because it has to be it's painful because it's slow because it's working on 500 years of what this country has been and how it was established and how do we understand that and address it and deal with it so opportunities and I think that I think teeming with the city is one really important opportunity but it's not going to be for everyone so I can be sufficient and that's that's the challenge that we have thank you sir I want to thank you because they reached out to us and invited the mayor as well invited

[02:16:00]
yes to the anti-racism A Place For Us last Tuesday and there were quite a number of us who were there so it was well done and I appreciate that with regard to the partnership on anti-racism I think this is something we need to do we've been talking about it I think it is time that we do this I know we're looking at the budget right now we're going to do we're going to approve the budget and I think it is our responsibility to take a look at this really hard I think I've seen a lot of things I've heard a lot of things that actually and what happened at sea life I think it is time that we do the anti-racism training and we do it now we can decide how we do this in partnership with the City of Albuquerque and let's look at that budget and let's put it in our budget that should be part of our staff development should be a training there's no reason we just can't do this we should be able to do it we can figure this out once we take a look

[02:17:00]
and see how much it would cost and we can do it in steps and phases we don't have to do it all at once but it has to be done and stuff so and one of the things that I wanted to address is superintendent reading on January the 23rd we had the super sack the superintendent's student advisory Council and you know the students want to participate in what we do or one of the voice on the board and I'm wondering what is happened to that this was on January the 23rd I just want to I want to make sure that we respond to this they came before the district attorney inclusion committee meeting and I want to make sure that we do respond to that because that was a recommendation

[02:18:00]
to look at and maybe perhaps maybe at some point have a presentation on that on what they do it sounds really exciting and an opportunity for our students and really and truly a jewel here in our district among all others is the Spanish spelling bee it is it was it was so much fun we were serenaded by the Mariachi from Heritage and then there was a performance by what was interesting is that we had students from elementary to high school and the winner was they're all winners that they were able to get up there and and spell some of the most difficult words I've ever heard and so you know it was a middle school

[02:19:00]
I really think we need to recognize all of these students who were there I think we need to bring it to the board and they come before the board and recognize these students they were so outstanding they did a great job and I think it would be Hoover's to do that absolutely all right thank you thank you then then you know I just I love music you know it's one of those things that I attended I went to El Dorado High School to the Performing Arts always working and I had an opportunity to listen to the the 4th grade Honor Choir and it was so interesting because not only did they know it's interesting what the teachers are able to do with this Honor Choir what they did is they actually sang music New Mexico music

[02:20:00]
play Harry Belafonte and the name music I thought that was so interesting so unique for 45 minutes and I just wanted more but obviously you know that's the time allocated for that and I want to tell you that was standing room only I mean the the Performing Arts Performing Arts Center was using with people they were all even outside trying to get in so I was lucky that I was able to get in so I want to thank you thank you thank you about spelling you need to know that I was in Coronado Elementary and those children could read the word Murcielago very difficult word in Spanish

[02:21:00]
they were studying bats and they knew all about murcielagos and how many syllables were in that word and this is kindergarten wow isn't that amazing so I think we need to recognize the work that is being done also in the teachers that do all of this work and I know Dr marmol and Miss Jessica Villalobos outstanding work well done thank you thank you thank you so much period just wanted to bring that up I also want to mention that today March 6th is educational assistance day we have nearly 2,000 and APS and about 80

[02:22:00]
play son of a work in special education so I just wanted to honor all of our rias tonight and they need a special recognition for everything that they do so thank you I also wanted to bring up Bill doesn't know this yet but we've joined the aps challenge that starts on March 25th and we will be tracking our steps and we will be part of the Walker tracker challenge that starts March 25th so just give me a heads up bill that I signed you up to so again I'm pleased to to chair the capital outlay planning and Technology committee so I look forward to working with that group over the next year and a half now so I think Janet Sayers is already left the room but you know as a board member I'd love to send thank you notes to the businesses that she brought up tonight that are providing so much support to the teachers and in her school so

[02:23:00]
I think she's already left the room but I'd love to find out more information on how we can send a just a personal note from myself thank you to superintendent reading for tonight's report it's always great to hear good news about APS so thank you for that we we still need that so I appreciate that thank you to our Albuquerque High School Color Guard tonight too for being here it's always been an honor to to have that start our meeting song with so thank you to all who share the encouragement and support for us to attend the undoing racism trainings we appreciated what you put on last year and we look forward to attending this year as well such an important opportunity for us to work together and to move forward together as a community and and you both have a long-standing reputation for for providing that in our community so thank you for that I'd love to get more information on the New Mexico history conference that Janet Sears brought up as well I'd like to see the

[02:24:00]
agenda I'm curious to see what they would be covering as well so if you can get that for us the Native American form that we attended last night I also felt like there was really positive interactions in our we broke up into groups discuss certain objectives came back with ideas into a larger group and so I really did feel like there was a lot of positive interactions and conversations that came out of that again the process is it does feel long sometimes and we just want to jump to being able to do things but we understand that processes key in reference to sustainability and success so I do appreciate that we did have that second form last night I do appreciate the conversation that we had and what's come out of that and all of the work that your department has put into that so thank you for that and and thank you to all of you for being here this evening thank you

[02:25:00]
a lot of the things that I wanted to say which is always wonderful Christmas me to take credit for what you guys are saying but very first I really appreciate Michelle being here from the city I think it's a great opportunity for us to collaborate and actually be a part of a systemic solution across our whole city you know all of our schools the city itself and so I think we need to look into that collaboration and how that might work how he might share funding how we might do that and there may be many opportunities besides just the arc you know training but other kinds of training as well and the Forum that they held before so I think there's lots of opportunities here for us and so I think that's a really good way to do things because I think it treats the systemic issues that we need to deal with assistance with individuals it's just an individual kind of thing and so we need to get all these individuals part of

[02:26:00]
that kind of a of a conversation because I think when we solve multiple problems we we we we we address all those issues and I think it's it's hard but I think that's that's the way that we need to go cuz that's the way we can sustain this so I think that's a really good way to think about that again I love Janet being here thank you you know I mean she's she's from my wife's graduating class I mean I know them very well and she's just a wonderful positive get out there and get things done and so I really appreciate all the things she's doing so all the things that you mentioned you know it's like what is the New Mexico history conference about and getting I think it's great for us to send to these three businesses she mentioned that we actually send a thank you to those businesses I've actually gone down out of my way to go down there and I say every time I go there I say thank you so much for support because this really important those people are

[02:27:00]
so I didn't I don't drink coffee at Starbucks so I'm sorry about that but you know I think that'd be good you know what I mean and the Starbucks they could bring sandwiches you know just doing their job and when somebody comes up and says you know really appreciate what you guys are doing I just make their day you know and that's important so I think that's really really important thing to do so I like those kind of things and I appreciate all the comments and I think that you know we can work towards towards a lot of these things so I'm very positive about that I am really happy about the article we had in our in our in our newsletter

[02:28:00]
I think it explains very well what we're trying to say here about what quality means in our facilities and how we get that funding back the lead funding is very small compared to what we get back in terms of a better facility a more cost-effective facility for utilities and everything else we get that back tenfold and what they're doing with the wet Community with the committee is is wonderful you know we say 2 million dollars in terms of utility costs the last year and what they're doing with the partnership they have a partnership with a partnership with a partnership with other districts we're talking about Los Lunas we're talking about is helping us understand how do we really not only we're talking about saving resources so we have a goal of 20% reduction in our energy used by 20

[02:29:00]
so I like that a lot you know since the last board meeting I've been at 10 different events some are multiple days I see so many great things the Inez Expo

[02:30:00]
you know what I mean and to sit there and just let them explain what they're doing and ask him questions and they're so proud of what they're doing you know it's just wonderful to do that I went to the Community School principal Academy just a little while or the principles are all learning about the Community Schools what a great what a great training activity you know I went to the wedding breakfast for the Dallas Cowboys

[02:31:00]
somebody who's who's taking time out to say this important it's important for our kids to understand that physical fitness health and eating good breakfast and so forth is important you know it's great stuff and you know I don't normally don't call me on on our individual comment committee means that but you know the Dei meeting last week it was wonderful you know there was so many positive things about what we're doing in else and violin Woods education and the literacy stuff that the library is doing you know I just said that and said this is the stuff that needs to be known by people because we are doing that and they're looking at all this this inclusion kind of of like in the library of information which is not always the case right and look at that

[02:32:00]
so you know we're doing some good things there I went to the Sea perch underwater robotics thing holy Toledo all those kids were just sitting there and they were diving into the pool they had their little robotic things and they're trying to figure out how they're submerging because they have to go through these little obstacle courses and obviously courses are underwater you got a submerged your little robotic thing and move it move it around these these little obstacles personal what I needed to do to help my personal finance and in 10 minutes to you as the junior high school it was great to be junior high

[02:33:00]
she

[02:34:00]
so yeah and

[02:35:00]
you know the March 5th we had the community Forum open Forum I thought we had good my my group that was wonderful I mean my group had two University of New Mexico professors had two people from NACA NACA and connection had my husky from the Volcano Vista and they really discussed the issues they discussed the issues around the questions but they discussed the contacts that was really important and there was another person that in one of the groups from the high school job so I was impressed I thought it was great to have you and him folks beat

[02:36:00]
the facilitators this time I think that was great so that was just wonderful and I'm really looking forward to the La Cueva Colorado Orchestra performing here in this Thursday they're going to perform for the American strings Teachers Association National Conference is the first time any kind of a New Mexico has ever been asked to perform at that conference so and they are really good so great stuff I got the legislative and so if you guys have any questions you want to ask Google

[02:37:00]
also we have this July 28th 3100 training I think that's a great opportunity for our board I know that I think pretty much everybody said I know candies we're working on the accessibility kinds of things and we'll see how that works out I think again this is a lesson to those people you know if we have people that need accessibility things they need to know how to do that right and so this may be a nice thing for them to research about how to do that and make sure that you know okay and the other thing is that I want to make

[02:38:00]
make sure that the last thing here is that since we have pretty much the same group here in Comedians and so forth make sure that you get immediately any changes that you might want to have about the days when our committee meetings are and I think you know that you had one change that you might want to make 6 a.m. she said 7:31 we want to make sure that you can get out to your schools or early but I don't know if there are any changes for other things I think probably the same I don't know if you want to do I kind of the way you've done it but please let

[02:39:00]
do you know soon as possible cuz they need to turn that around right away to be able to get those meeting notices out on the calendar and Barbara same thing with Google we know the community wants to be out early anyway so please do that as soon as you possibly can so that's really all I have I appreciate it again the meeting I appreciate the audience I'm sure that we can work something out here to make sure that we have a real systemic solution to what we're trying to do here and and they're just all kinds of things that we need to address you know certainly the race directly the race things but a lot of different is we need to work on you know what are those different what's the power issue that goes into this and it can be within ethnic groups it can be Crossing

[02:40:00]
play LGBT it can be lots of different areas here and so hopefully we can look for systemic solutions to those things you know certainly working on the Native American that's that's an immediate thing we're working on that but we want to make that part of a systemic approach to how we really deal with it so that we can solve lots of problems not just one area and then do bad in another you know that that's not going to work very well I think we tend to do that sometimes you know we do one off Solutions and then we find out there's another problem so anyway that's what I have and the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday March 20th here and then we'll be Monday March 25th at 7:30 here so thank you and we are adjourned
