[00:05:00]
Madame superintendent Madam president and members of the board I have comments on a whole bunch of stuff first of all you know when we pause to remember those who died while in serving of their country it occurred to me that we do have many APS students who served in law enforcement or perhaps Corrections or something else who you know sometime we might consider just remembering remembering those individuals secondly John Milne as we stand in the Melanie meeting room and just remembering the person who served for 45 years superintendent of you go to 45 years this could be a while anyway 45 years superintendent of APs just amazing and the next I did want to comment on several things on the tonight

[00:06:00]
I totally support making the the parent-teacher conference days a synchronous I think that means the kids stay home and are doing some kind of work on their computer anyway I've always felt like those given the number of errands that actually participate in those conferences we're missing out on learning those couple days I was excited to see that someone left 200,000 the k a n w radio and I hope the aps radio station and I hope that can be used to get more students involved in learning how to do public radio and I was also excited to see that the new Billboards that are going to be driving revenue and again that was probably went out and bought all these things

[00:07:00]
so and then next on the 30th and the 31st is registration at Del Norte near very well invited to come and and join us as we welcome students back thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Dr Samoa you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking sir good evening Minister and did you know according to the Center for Disease Control and prevention New Mexico and it is

[00:08:00]
congenital syphilis cases as sexually transmitted infection that is passed from a pregnant woman to her unborn child in the Last 5 Years 203% increase nationally of congenital syphilis do you know why in The Last 5 Years open borders sex trafficking slavery drug trafficking dangerous covid vaccine and speaking of that because that reduces the main function of the individuals ineffective unscientific Mass lockdowns what transgender and pornographic ideologies and Cetera do you remember your oath of office section 222 Dash 5 Dash 4 dot 8112 policies

[00:09:00]
sexual policy of protecting children from indoctrination with gender or transgender transgender etiology should we have should we must return to common sense of biology reality disposable season may God bless us may have may God bless have mercy on APS and New Mexico thank you thank you sir our next speaker is on Zoom actually our next two speakers are on Zoom first is Megan long making love 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you to express in the leadership in the majority that has taken over our school board I feel that the latest push to appear transparent was more has more to do with the upcoming School Board election then any responsibility to families and community members despite this attempt to

[00:10:00]
spell concerns we will continue to push for Meaningful Community engagement rather than robocalls impromptu School site visits and vague surveys we refuse to be an afterthought or misstep as you rubber stamp the actions of the superintendent we will push for culturally competent coaching from in-state resources that can better meet the needs of our diverse students and communities we will continue to watch attend an audit board meetings and Communications to ensure they are meeting the requirements of the open meetings act while we count the pause on renewing the cgcs contract and the reversal of the board media policy a win we will not stop there this is only reinvigorated our community to continue fighting and holding the board accountable for the actions they take on the dice and behind closed doors I encourage the public to question instead question why this contract was extended initially and how the change the media policy was made in the first place rather than applying the putting

[00:11:00]
how far is we should be asking how and why they were started public education is under attack on a national level and is the responsibility of parents families and the community members to ensure an equitable public education is accessible for our children thank you thank you our next speaker is Dr Alex directly I believe you have two minutes once you begin speaking you got it right that was great it's not that common unfortunately hello good evening I have a student at 8 p.m. I am a primary care physician here in Albuquerque I moved here six years ago quickly fell in love with New Mexico and decided to make it my long-term home unfortunately my story is an uncommon one too many health professionals have chosen to leave this state all my patients have to wait over a year to see specialist at time

[00:12:00]
in our community is in crisis over this and there's obviously a lot of reasons for that there's many reasons people choose not to live here or move out of state but the one thing I do want to talk about tonight is the schools when I first moved here 6 years ago and then I was trying to decide should I stay here or not I was told by many people if you're going to stay here don't put your kids at APS go private go to Santa Fe do something else and I am a big proponent of public education I am a product of public education on I did not think that was a reasonable thing to do I decided I'm not doing that I am going to put my kids in public school and with that I had a great experience I have a rising first grader who really did great and I really enjoyed the experience and so why is this perception of APS in our

[00:13:00]
Public Schools not meeting my experience why are people despite having great schools great people in these why are we still having this perception and I think that really comes down to transparency I think obviously the current board members aren't to blame for some of the historical things that have been done by this public school system but I do think that there are steps that can be taken to improve transparency going forward and help bring in the stakeholders in the parents into the process so that we can be a part of that and hopefully change our perception and we can hopefully recruit more people who want to stay here thank you for your time thank you sir our next speaker is in person Mary Walker Herrera and you'll have two minutes once you begin good evening and thank you for the opportunity

[00:14:00]
my name is Mary Walker Herrera when a teacher Hears A student making a statement directed to them saying that they want to change their name their pronoun What do teachers say how do teachers handle a situation like this have they had any gender dysphoria training where do the training come from what gender dysphoria training do APS school counselors get paid to do social workers teachers staff who sits with a student and asks why what is going on in their world that tells them that changing their name their gender will be a cure-all for deep running psychological trauma hurt bullying things that they've seen or heard in their young lives that they have come up with the idea of gender transition and so begins a journey in which these children are not questioned or heard but streamlined and applauded into an irreversible biological reality that question are they prepared for and what if a child wants to detransition

[00:15:00]
this is a rapidly growing underserved population that the Psychotherapy profession is generally unprepared to support in an article from Psychology today titled surgeon detransitioning cases it was concluded that in an anonymous survey detransitioners quote felt that they hadn't been given an adequate evaluation from a medical or mental health professional before starting the transition process unquote what can we do at school board members would you prevent this from happening in our community thank you for listening and thank you for letting me share thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Lauren Mitchell Johnson good evening members of the board

[00:16:00]
tonight I would like to speak about the process that you guys are about to enter in the request for proposals process to find and contract Professional Services for the board I would like to suggest to you guys that this is an opportunity for you to demonstrate to the community that you have heard our feedback with regards to incorporating the input from parents and students and teachers into your process I just want to point out the fact that cgcs and sfg so suddenly disappeared from the agenda language without any meaningful public discussion makes the boards commitment to the public process seemed a little bit more than a little more than smoke and mirrors especially considering the board's issues with observing the open meetings act in recent meetings we expect this RFP process to be a reset and it is an opportunity for it to become a reset for the board to release show

[00:17:00]
the community and parents who are concerned about the direction of APS and the board leadership that it can do better and not through promises or recession of language from agendas but through action thank you all so much for your attention and your hard work we really appreciate the service that the board provides our community our next speaker is in person Renee Pacheco and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking all right thank you for this time for listening New Mexico public schools are 50th in the nation being leaders on the APS school board you are in a Leader's position to to promote education Society they need to be able to read write and do with it

[00:18:00]
there should be there should not be anything above teaching the children but instead of teaching there is fighting against Trump with the teachers union teaching about sex before the children are ready and diagnosing them with gender identity problems God created US male and female in His image with the plan for each one of us thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Gail Stewart are you there yet I am okay you have two minutes once you begin speaking OK Google

[00:19:00]
have each meeting to see about the accuracy and understanding reflected with regard to delivery of special education to students with disabilities I'm specifically wanted to comment on question number one about aps's response that it was using the aims es for professional development with regard to professional development needed for student I'm sorry for teachers Math teachers and the information shared and my review of the aims for us or S4s information online indicates that this professional development is really skewed towards helping people working with English Learners and it doesn't have anything about specialized instruction for students with disabilities and I found the

[00:20:00]
information about that it's focused on diverse Learners to be somewhat deceptive in 2015 the US Department of put out a letter a dear colleague letter putting everybody on notice that English Learners and students with disabilities do not have the same services and conflating those two is rampant across school districts it's also rampant in this district and I don't think it's helpful to be putting out that a professional development which is focused on teachers working with English Learners is also going to match the needs of teachers working with students with disabilities in math thanks a lot thank you man our next speaker is on Zoom Dominica Chavis good evening Madam president and members of the board my name is Dominique as and I serve as the advocacy

[00:21:00]
New Mexico kids can our organization is committed to fighting for the changes that will ensure New Mexico students are prepared to be the future Civic and Business Leaders are State needs that's why we're proud to support your strategic plan and student outcomes Focus governance tonight you are engaging in progress monitoring for goal to math proficiency and conducting a board self-evaluation this is powerful important work that must be continued regularly checking your impact and holding yourself accountable especially in a public setting is not easy many leaders avoid this entirely but by stink focused on student outcomes this board is acknowledging hard truths and taking meaningful action you've set measurable goals committed to transparency and put a plan in place to move forward that is what it means to put student learning first and it's the kind of leadership

[00:22:00]
are students need and deserve thank you for these efforts and please continue to put student outcomes first thank you next speaker is in person Amy music you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening APS school board members and superintendent my name is Amy and I'm the principal at Cleveland Middle School and our Evolution to becoming the only public Middle School in the state of New Mexico offering the international Baccalaureate middle years program as Dr Blakey included in her APS Rising first year report Cleveland finished last year in the top five APS middle schools for growth in both math with a 15.5% increase and Ela with a 12.9% increase our work has been very intentional

[00:23:00]
we have prioritized building relationships professional learning opportunities collaboration and using achievement data as a as a new APS magnet we prioritize the work to become fully accredited by implementing the IB myp philosophy lesson planning instruction and assessments we work to create a whole student according to the IB learner profile inquirer's knowledgeable thinkers communicators principled open-minded caring with takers balanced and reflective we use high-quality instructional materials by implementing the IB math texts which teach math skills but also add contacts and application teachers participate in an ongoing collaboration and alignment with State Standards i-Ready tests and the San Diego High School IB diploma program some teachers use both IXL and Lexia power up tutoring and next year or master schedule includes daily high dosage tutoring for all students Cleveland's strength is

[00:24:00]
people the teachers educational assistance kitchen and office staff custodians counselors and administration team show up every day with a passion and commitment to do well our demographic data shows that our student population mirrors the diversity of the school district as a whole the vast variety of student and adult perspectives and experiences is our superpower it is exactly what what makes CMS extra special goals thank you and board members that complete public forum thank you to our public forum guests the next item on our agenda is to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring reports for interim goals 2.1 and 2.2 which are math proficiency for this our presenters are Dr Gabriella Durant superintendent for leadership and learning and

[00:25:00]
play Jet our chief academic officer tonight we will be wondering and 2.2 measuring math proficiency before we begin however we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I believe that all criteria for an effective report have been met but I'll open the floor for anyone else on the board who thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have any evidence that suggests for missing any elements of the report excellent since everyone agrees that we that the required elements are present will open the floor for a monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails those

[00:26:00]
meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time bound and we will work to support each other through this process so let's get started is there any are there any opening remarks that the administration wanted to provide before moving to our questions board president Gonzalez we don't although I do want to introduce Mr Chris Sanchez who's joining the team tonight he in our reorganization is the assistant superintendent for middle schools he's our latest assistant superintendent who will be a familiar face as we embark on the goals and so for goal to now you will see Mr Sanchez leading along this work with Miss Jackson write thank you Dr Blakey and welcome Mr Sanchez I'll go ahead and just start to my right number to you have any smart questions for our presenters I do

[00:27:00]
but before I embark on that a smart question I have two technical questions that I think are important to better understanding and of year results and I did submit them per hour hand out technical tactical and strategic tips for Effective monitoring question mark I did submit them a week ago and this is in response to constituents from the black Leadership Council who want to know the impact of enrollment at the end of the year and if that is impacting the results on the test so I wanted to put them at ease what what was the enrollment in 6th and 7th grade for each targeted

[00:28:00]
population at the beginning and end of the year and how did the changes in enrollment affect interpretation of interim results for these grade levels particularly for each subgroup if at all thank you remember Dominguez and as a reminder the reason we asked Technical and tactical questions in advance to make sure we have the appropriate staff able to answer them so it looks like Dr West has come to the table to be able to respond to that and is rapidly trying to pull up an answer Dr West would you can we pause on this question to him to get the answer and we'll come back through since okay thank you remember oh yes I am pulling up my is it okay if I Circle back as well yes we will remember benavidez shockingly I'm ready good evening everyone thank you all for being here so my question is in I'll give a little bit of context about

[00:29:00]
my question because it's in regards to question I asked during the Tactical and Technical question so what professional development have staff received and what more will be provided to Math teachers working with English Learners and students with disabilities and the response was APS has worked to bring the aims for us I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong training to k through eight teachers and so what strategies are in place to ensure long-term sustainability and scalability of this program across all Schools board president it is a set of strategies tools

[00:30:00]
to support our English language Learners in the classrooms it's a set of strategies that allows the students to interact with math in the classroom but not only on top of that it allows the students to interact with one another so think of an English learner they're all that different levels they might be a level five on listening but they might be a level 2 in speaking so they're able to interact with one another on a math problem using this specific set of strategies of aim Forest good evening for president superintendent members of the board thank you for the question of scalability you know one thing we have a Year's worth of data now to look at and we have a Year's worth of stories behind that data and so what Mr Sanchez just

[00:31:00]
articulated is part of that story and so as we go through and we're really looking for the best practices we're leaning into what does make a difference in terms of improving student outcomes so as we begin to really I would say pinpoint those strategies that is where we would want to lean in and invest we know we're we're going into maybe some lean times we have to get really targeted in terms of how we are working with our classrooms and our teachers and really what is going to have the highest return on learning thank you for the background thank you dot looks like you might want president England with time

[00:32:00]
adult time teacher time and being creative with the way we schedule students being creative on the Lessons Learned of how we have had creative scheduling initiatives to open up time for the adults to engage in professional development like the one-sided in response to the question differentiation is differentiation and it's good whether you're an eel a student with disabilities a student who is proficient that needs to be taken to another level in their educational academic Journey so we recognize that one of the things when we talked to our teachers that they need in their professional development work in their professional practice is time that is the thing you hear of over and over again so that's the burden that we think about in terms of how do we leverage best practices like genius hour that we are able to

[00:33:00]
what's the educational experience of our students while also being able to open up time for adults to engage and collaborate to have professional development like the one-sided into response to the question but also talk to each other evaluate student work discuss the progress or lack thereof of individual students we talked a lot about redesign in regards to our Middle School and High School experience well that time for teachers is going to be fundamental to work thank you remember Jackson thank you just the first thing that I wanted to point out which I think might help board member dominguez's question is if you look at the bottom of page three there is a separate table where the disaggregated data has been provided for us and it does give the specific

[00:34:00]
number it might not be the the before and the after but it does give the number of students that were tested in 2324 at 11:00 I'm sure Dr West will correct me if I'm wrong but I just wanted to point that out that the disagree disaggregated data has been provided to us and if I can go down to page 7/8 and I'm looking specifically at goal 2.1 and for the sixth grade because to me sixth grade seems like the the fundamental the start of the shift right you're going from elementary school to middle school so I was looking at that day and I want to first point out that I absolutely love the fact that you guys are using coaches in the schools as for the priority and the emerging schools I think that definitely is a is the best practice and kind of highlights that we all need coaches

[00:35:00]
play we all need somebody to just make sure that we're staying on on on on on track I also really like that you are allowing the principles to take charge of their site and providing site-specific systems and structures so my question kind of leads into that at the bottom of page seven and leading into page 8 and it says that furthermore principles will receive training and coaching from the assistant superintendents to support setting expectations and support systems that ensure this shift in teaching and learning is occurring to me that is two separate issues there's a shift in teaching and there's a shift in learning so how will you ensure Fidelity to your incredible strategy I mean just as a third aside this document is chock-full of strategies that are very well thought out

[00:36:00]
and I applaud you for that but how will you what strategy will you use to ensure Fidelity to what you guys have laid out for us in the use of grade level high-quality instructional material given that sometimes requirements to use those materials are not their board member Jackson thank you for the question I'll start us off and then I would encourage just had this conversation earlier today about how some of those systems get set up and how we support our schools in doing that really in terms of the Fidelity to the programming a lot of this is going to be about monitoring so I even wrote down at some point today we need to monitor what we're monitoring one thing that we are committed to doing better is understanding what the performance indicators are that would tell us that our strategies are on track

[00:37:00]
we also feel confident because we have our teaching and learning coaches in the school they're able to report back to us how how that work is happening what are the shifts we need to make so the systems that we've put in place allow for more of a just in time approach to any shifts that have to happen and through that I think we're able to ensure that Fidelity mainly because we're making a commitment to monitor it and as we look out what those systems are what those indicators are in our teaching and learning work for example I'm thinking about data literacy it's very important to us our teachers are using the assessment data that they have to identify specific skills to students have and then have the instruction in the teaching that addresses that learning need how do our teaching and learning coaches then help the teacher do

[00:38:00]
plan the lesson create the small group work and then make sure that we have some kind of assessment in place to ensure that the students are getting that this is a much more like tailored approach to how our students I think interact with the content they have an opportunity to really get exactly what they need through the use of our coaches and how we're looking to shift adult practice so I actually had a follow-up to that which I think that you can probably elaborate and you got you started so what strategy will you use to teach up the teachers if and when their analysis of the Integrated Systems might fall short how will you know if that analysis is off like you the strategies there you just alluded to it it's just you know the just in time approached but what's the next

[00:39:00]
stop if the Justin Time approach you realize is maybe not working thank you for that we can definitely talk some about that by having this information come back to us I'm thinking like a two-way communication model and sometimes things to sort of get stuck in the school level but through our educational resources team and also through our principal Leadership Academy is that we've been talking about we feel confident that we're going to have more of that situation so first of all we're going to know when our strategies are not being affected and then it comes to our team of experts through our add resources team through our variety of departments who have the expertise to help us make those shifts I don't want to say well this is the exact shift we're going to make because I want that shift to be tailored to what we're seeing in terms of the practices and if we're not satisfied with the outcomes we're getting that we are

[00:40:00]
root cause analysis and were able to make the appropriate changes Madam president may I say one more thing Mr Sanchez did you want to jump in and fill in on any of that Gonzalez is happening so through the performance framework we have lined up so if you're a priority School your receiving switch for example I would be going over to Georgia O'Keefe if they were a priority school I'd be meeting with that monthly and having conversations regarding accelerated learning how is the implementation of accelerated learning in the classroom

[00:41:00]
Leonard space instruction which is an essential practice of accelerated learning and working with the principal on how it's being implemented and to what supports they might need and then I would come back and work with the district departments and supporting that school specific grade levels specific features to increase those aspects of the essential practice thank you did that help clarify what would have been your follow-up are you done it did I I think what you clarified was was that piece of the two-way communication you are that piece that is allowing the two-way communication to happen between the schools and the district to understand if and when there's a need to Pivot right so and I just wanted to say like we should be celebrating I understand that we are asking you guys very strategic questions

[00:42:00]
based on what you've provided us but this is really good news in this report that could be reported if you know if this is good we you guys have done a great job and we're on track Noah Noah thank you thank you yes maybe my question based on Gail Stuart I can email to you because we don't have that particular information before us is that would be my question too but I can send it to you but my other question is when we're looking at Family engagement you stated that you were using the John Hopkins University and education week research and it talked about the two-way family communication and I know their strategies but it's also stated that one to look at academic

[00:43:00]
progress and how to inform families better that was on on page 9 under the 2 points the second 2.2 in in the first one based on the the other family engagement with the first grade that the first grade it stayed that there was also two-way communication and how to make that better else so can you give me a few of your strategies on how to impact the two-way communication that you're looking at and what barriers are you seeing to that two-way communication and hopefully to to also include and help families to understand better not only about your processes and what's going on but how will those sessions also become listening sessions to really hear what the parents are going through thank you

[00:44:00]
right in saying that this strategy is reflected info 2.1 and 2.2 our family school communication we believe is a pivotal place where we can help families understand the importance of the work we're doing at school not to say they don't think it's important but we're always we all know school from our previous School experiences and school is different today and so we really when we work with our sixth graders we're thinking about that transition from 5th to 6th grade and really ensuring that our families not only have an opportunity to hear from the school about how that's different than to also interact and and get more information when they feel they need it the seventh grade you a communication in particular to go to interim gold 2.2 is really about the importance of those assessments and how we are preparing students for particularly algebra which we know is a gatekeeper class or high school graduation

[00:45:00]
so we do want to really lean into some more specifics I have a I think I've told you if it's going into 6th grade daughter I've sort of tapped out on some of my math like I'm going to have to start looking it up right and that's fair like some of these things we haven't done in a long time so how do we help families see this is what the student is doing this is how we can talk about it in home in the real world and I think an important part of that is our shift towards interdisciplinary learning so really working with our Middle School teachers to not teach these contents in isolation but rather from a real real world perspective and allowing more opportunities to see the application because the application is in family life too like when we talked about the application of learning it isn't limited to one place where our lives are really complex and diverse so having that communication and

[00:46:00]
thinking about what does it look like in the home I would say a barrier that we brought up against is sometimes as students enter young adolescents there is sort of a pullback from parents for whatever reason and so how do we continue to engage the the parents I think also one thing that we've talked about and that we heard some of the schools you really well who had made gains was using a variety of platforms to get consistent messaging out about attendance Behavior the importance of Assessments the fact that an assessment is coming up you know how to help your student be successful if we if we aren't from the district perspective we can do a better job of removing the barrier about what that message is and so that is one way that we're beginning to address that is think about okay we all know that the i-Ready window is opening so what is our message and how do we use our various channels to get that

[00:47:00]
even through you know our community school impact coordinator they have a role in helping our families understand what is happening and the importance of us getting good data so we can really help our students hope that answered your question and I provide a follow-up and how would that look for our Martinez Yazzie subgroups families sure you know there is a variety of ways that we're attempting to engage in Martinez families including African-American students certainly you know making sure that we're using languages that are accessible to our families it's a commitment that we have is a district and I would say you know anytime we're looking at communication and different platforms we're really leaning into translation and interpretation services in addition to Martinez in African-American families also live in this really diverse and complex world and have experiences that

[00:48:00]
I hope to inform our interdisciplinary work the experiences of being a part of the 21st century so thinking about how we use like a family advisory Council other things that are principals put in place maybe you can help me with some specifics in terms of getting that student student and parent voice because I think both are important I also think this is an area where we can grow and I'm really interested as we go down this interdisciplinary path how we do that in addition to that are all of our middle schools are you have advisory committee that is created a diverse group of students within the school and principals are getting lots of feedback on how to adjust instructions

[00:49:00]
how to communicate with families from these packs that are happening within the schools we also have our principal expectation tool that was ruled out last year within that expectation tool sorry is one of the essential practices is how our principles communicating with their families in addition to you and lastly is the implementation that will be rolling out next month and all the middle schools of the web program where when we're talking specifically about 6th graders how are we supporting them and making the Middle School experience as well as possible so that they are able to communicate I need help with math or how am I getting how to how do I inform my parents about what's happening there through an 8th grade mental so we have systems in place to support the kids

[00:50:00]
we know that we are currently working on sharpening system thank you thank you member are you in a place where you can ask your question yes I am thank you before I asked my question I actually do have a follow-up to board member to Moreno's question is that okay so just following up on the communication between the families and I know this information might not be available right now but do we do data on Roblox versus School Flyers so then console is some member historical Dr Blakey we do have analytics that inform the number of robocalls through school messenger that are going out the number that are connected the number of phones that are disconnected so we do have that

[00:51:00]
lyrics that informs our strategy in terms of connecting that way we also have data that informs in person meetings I also want to draw to the words attention and response to board member to burritos question is that there's a lot to be gleaned on the work that was done last year in relationship to the guard rails and the accountability that is put on to the administration through the internet's specifically the work of guardrail 5 I believe which is the instructional participation of parents so we now have that data where we are accountable to ensure that there is parent voice on a critically important body at every school's campus the instructional Council that's being monitored that's being held accountable to ensure when these academic programmatic decisions are taking place these discussions that we have that data

[00:52:00]
we also have a lot to learn from the best practices at the 70ish community schools that we have there are best practices that are Community Schools and are non-community schools can glean from in terms of best practices for really supporting this two-way communication for our parents in a dynamic interactive way we do have that data in a pretty diverse set of data form that piece awesome thank you so much and yes instructional councils are amazing and I know that they have been a great asset for all of our schools and especially when it comes to engagement so for my question before I ask it I just want to say I love your reports I feel like they are always full of information and it's hard to ask very strategic questions because you are on top of it so thank you so much for all the work you put into it I'm going to follow up on the conversation you all were having

[00:53:00]
2.1 one of the next steps is to give each School differentiated support that will be led by quote I'm teaching and learning coaches at priority and emerging schools and by District Middle School interdisciplinary experts and monitored by school principals for impact and Effectiveness so my question is what is the district strategy to have consistent and adequate support by the coaches for example is their capacity for each school to have their own coach or have the targeted schools already have already identified any additional support that they might need a better president member of the board Dr Blakey so we use the performance framework to inform these decisions because we have a final amount of resources and these resources are deployed to begin with our priority schools moving into our emerging schools and so on so I'm happy to share that next year every priority school will have the coach that you cite in your question

[00:54:00]
there will be capacity building in that the chief academic officer and her team will be offering monthly professional development to ensure the minimization of variability amongst what we're doing with this group really it is a new service it is a new coach it is a new support to schools to really leverage these strategies bring them to life in a way that is Meaningful for the teachers and practitioners in the classrooms so a lot of thought and intentionality has been has gone on has gone into building our support plan at the central level so that we are able to support not only the teaching and learning coaches but also our community school coordinators and our Student Success resource teachers we have this real if you will of support comprehensive support to our priority schools moving into our emerging schools to be able to

[00:55:00]
bring these strategies to life in a way that is actualized and has an impact on the other thing that I would say that I think is important is we're all looking at the same thing in a month or so we will have before the board guard rail to which talks about school visits and the assistant goes back to the accountability question and in there what you're going to see is that every school has a scorecard which is near on the goals of the district so they are tracking the same way we are tracking here at the local level in relationship to the indicators brought forth by the community Through the board to the school district to work on so I think that's important and we're all looking at the same thing in terms of the common language and common expectations thank you so much I have one quick follow up with

[00:56:00]
everything that you've discussed with the coaches and the extra professional development and the resources are we seeing any pushbacks that might occur with loss of federal funding president members of the board members of the reality is that several of these positions currently moving into next year are funded through various forms of federal funding be a title to 34 or Medicaid we know that these funds are in different stages of question in regards to the standing injunction and implications involved in the recent legislation passed the federal level we have several scenario plans

[00:57:00]
in place to address any number of realities that may manifest themselves in front of us the good news is due to strong fiscal planning on the part of the district we are able to cover these positions in their entirety through the 25th 26th school year that will give us time to be able to truly continue strategic planning scenario planning in relationship to service to students which is our Guiding Light in terms of minimizing any impact to the student thank you I appreciate that and I appreciate the team's effort to always stay before the issue right and always making sure that there's plans thank you thank you remember a story I want to also thank the team for a great report that's very comprehensive that includes all of the data that we need in the strategies but I think most important

[00:58:00]
remind me to call out that we are on track we are on track for meeting our math goal we're on track for meeting the goals for these Martinez Jazzy students and that's definitely worth celebrating super exciting I hear a lot of questions in the community about like are you on track or off track and so I think it's really important to just say loud and clear we are on track and as we're on track we're learning about what we can change and improve so just want to celebrate you all in the superintendent for the great work that you've done so far and my question was already asked and so I'm going to reframe a little bit part of my question initially was on what are the barriers that are getting in the way so giving that there was less growth for the Martinez Jazzy students particularly in numbers and operations and measurement and data there's a chance that there could be some sort of a plateau or some barrier there and so I do still have a question around what are the barriers that are getting in the way or potentially getting in the way and you spoke already to challenges with

[00:59:00]
time broadly time for teachers time for students and also lack of time for collaboration and interdisciplinary learning so I feel like the barriers are very clear and real but I wanted to just see are there other barriers that might be getting in the way or that we might anticipate or where board policy or other policy might be causing challenges for President Clinton's members of the board I would say that one of the barriers is just that we are in a human element of business and so you know with all of these data we have different students in each student has their own story so the more that we're able to put systems in place that provide the system structures and supports for our students the more will see the organization start to move but because there's a human

[01:00:00]
element in all of these behind all these numbers are different individual students each year I think that that's just a natural barrier that we have to make sure that we really stick with what we're doing because this year I do feel this sense of like are we still doing this are we not doing it are we doing something new did it work did it not work and to really see institutional change you have to stick with something and so if you see that oh man I wish we could have gone up another half you can if you stick with it and that you're really intentional and you don't get distracted like this might move as faster but what will move as fast faster is actually being really on point and strategic with our systems and structures we do need to continue to look for different time for our teachers because you need time to look at data to be able to then adjust your lessons and so if we're not able to provide that for the

[01:01:00]
teachers they know what they need to do but it's like if you're just going for meeting to meeting to meeting you're like well I need time to actually do my work and it's not a fair expectation that teachers do that at night at home when they're trying to feed their families and so how we're able to really put that in the work day for teachers is really important that's definitely a barrier that I think we face in the schools that we've seen deliver like these results that are really high have creatively figured out how to crack that collaboration thank you my other questions similarly related to this question of time so it's on pages 8 and 9 where you talked about the work across sort of looking at multiple measures multiple components Student Success systems the performance framework the i-Ready data everything sort of coming together and

[01:02:00]
I guess my question is like how do we make it go faster and I'll say it in this way I too have middle school kids and had a kiddo going through 6th grade math last year and struggled at the beginning of the year and struggled and we went through that first parent-teacher conference okay they're struggling all right what are we going to do well we're going to assess them again like okay they're struggling okay well we're going to assess them again okay we're going to provide the teacher professional development okay then came the middle of your test still struggling all the way to the end of the year still struggling and it was sort of like we had identified that someone out there is struggling the kid is in the ocean drowning and we all have the life preservers vest things on the beach but we don't know who's going to send it out there and when and how and quick enough and I think that's what I experienced with my kiddo who then didn't pass 6th grade math and so how do we make sure that these great strategies that

[01:03:00]
talking about here happened fast enough and so we can go and you know train teachers on new strategies we can provide time for him to interdisciplinary learning so my question is like how do you move quickly like is it those coaches I haven't heard anything about tutoring like for example for my my kiddo I'm like all right is it just these standards that we know he's missing because you just tutorial on that like are you thinking to about summer school like how are you using summer school as remedial time haven't really heard anything about that and I know in the context and the research base around the importance of Shifting away from remedial instruction towards accelerating there is still and I hear a lot from people around well they're not hungry level and we need to get them up so there's still that constant debate between remediation and acceleration and so that's a long-winded way of saying is how do we do it faster and better with the current constraints that we have word president and I might have missed

[01:04:00]
answer some of the specifics you mentioned high dosage tutoring and that sorry high dosage tutoring is really one of the ways to do that now it is very human and monetary and time intensive but it is if you want to move faster it research doesn't does show that it is not productive for students to wait until summer school to them catch up on what they're missing at the time so often what we see your families that have access to tutors hire a tutor they work with their student they catch them up on math and they're able to catch up and that's really that like if we really want to intervene right then with Gabriella who's struggling and sixth grade math being able to identify how we can find the means to expand high dosage

[01:05:00]
is during the day like during the school day is the other part that really is an element that we haven't cracked yet and Logistics that moves students faster and often is where you see an opportunity Gap because there are families that are able to provide that to students and not all families can't thank you Dr Blakey I agree high dosage tutoring is the fastest way to answer the question and that is one of our promising practices but because of the intensity of the type of intervention figuring out how to implement that at school sites has been a challenge will just be honest I do think high dosage tutoring though depends on the system that we talked about in making sure that we truly understand what the learning Gap is that the student has and so the

[01:06:00]
what times we're putting in place in terms of getting really good at using our data platforms really clearly understanding the learning gaps that a student might have and then beginning to address that if we could have lots of high dosage tutoring but if we're not tutoring the student on the right element it may not we're leaving too much to chance so while we work on high dosage tutoring because we know its impact and we know it is Speedy our systems implementation is really really important so that we do understand what our students need and we can be really targeted reach thank you for that Dr West you are ready with an answer around attendance and enrollment end of your tests so just so you know so we we

[01:07:00]
whether it's our interim assessment or some of the assessment like the nmmc we make sure we go for the 95% of our base line so we make sure that all of our students are assessed reason we do that is because when we're presenting this information to you or actually talking about all of our students we're not just talking about a sample of our students so that way what we see in our internal assessments the gold interim assessment is so informal instruction and the Martinez Jazzy decision if you write as many times as I have many of the facts that are used in that case are actually their test results so we take those results very seriously and every one of our schools we have somebody testing coordinators and then we have a district test coordinator who are cases are assessment so between him and the school test coordinator

[01:08:00]
is there expected to hit the 95% and that position is actually in State Statute so all those individuals have their licenses also tied to the expectation so we make sure there's multiple opportunities to give students assessment so we watch those we want her during every window so we make sure that all the students are assessed and if they're not actually in the process where then people at the background why they want tested and why do we do that because if you don't assess everybody you don't know really so we make sure that all of our students are tested so if we saw I don't actually have trackers and everything to get updated during testing period but I know like our African American students I just looked at her mom and dashboard dashboard and we're assessing those kids so if we so would there be the instance where there would be the difference would be if we were comparing apples to oranges in the sense that let's say well you only test is 70% of African-American students in the fall

[01:09:00]
50% what's going on there but because we're ensuring that all of our students are assessing we don't see this as being problems to interpreting our data hopefully that's a long answer but it explains I don't know that that will okay so here's I do the best I can when I'm out and about in public but once we get into these and this person is wicked smart about data so and I'm not so and I don't have you next to me so again the line of thinking from the council the black lady Leadership Council is this they want to assurance that the same number of kids started 6th grade and 7th grade are in fact the same number that are being tested at the end there's some suspicion that

[01:10:00]
we have we lost them have a quit going have a been disciplined out of the system and so I'm trying to ask a question here that reassures that population that I'm trying to give them the right answer president so we have roughly $125 so students are black rapper they're not Hispanic and 366

[01:11:00]
citizen test but I also know that because the work that we do that stuff is documented so that it wasn't that there was an attempt to test the student and I also know that in the middle school I think some of the things you're talking about which unfortunately I think sometimes it's a little confused with this is thinking that there's Mobility or something going on where the student is not at school and are moving schools those students are being tested so we don't see that Mobility until that which really going on there is we see our sorry our drop out of high school so that idea is that the same kid that doesn't really happen in terms of Middle School Mr West if you could just get closer to the mic and having a heart attack period we don't see that being an issue in middle school and elementary school because we don't even if a student moose they're still being assessed so in each of our testing windows are basically a month long that doesn't mean that students are testing every day in that month that means that this teacher has opportunity to test and then there's anybody who doesn't

[01:12:00]
yes we then try to keep having opportunities for them test during that month and I and I can assure you that we don't have they're not gaps in our data like that because we watched them like a hawk because we make sure that they're getting those 95% levels okay so I can go back and assure the castle that we started with 125 students the most recent years dot we had two point eight percent of our students who are African-American so a little trip there is if you click on that 2.8 it'll actually filter the whole thing so I can tell you there's a that's how I know that there are there were 123 American not Hispanic students

[01:13:00]
is there and there were 121 and 7th grade and I can tell you that that over that we that they were tested if they were in school at 9:00 so we didn't lose anybody the end we were testing 95% of them and it's all I have to do is touch on or click on that so remember to me if we can try to get out of the technical and Technical detail here to get to the Strategic question that would be great we can make sure that we understand how to get number to me because the data and also how to make sure that the members of The Counselor getting the answers they need so whether that's referring them to Mr West or to miss compost who meets directly with them or whatever the internal structures exist that would be really helpful so if there are other technical questions that you have that will inform your strategic question you can go ahead and have fun I'm ready for strategic

[01:14:00]
which is so and keep in mind I'm trying to understand 3/4 of our conversation should be trying to understand the current reality of students in this case the 6th graders and 7th graders and so I'm trying to get a better understanding of where where have we been what has been happening this year and where are we now and how does that I'm trying to understand what impact did the superintendents interpretation of the data so we will

[01:15:00]
we are doing we're on target absolutely but when we disaggregate our data we see that for example on Native American students for the second year in a row experienced increased end of the year math proficiencies Alleluia something something work there so like what happened right what happened and but then we go to English language Learners and we see that they're flat so why right and students with disabilities experience less growth between the middle of the year and the end of the year assessments then last school year so there's kind of flat so while there is a lot to celebrate in the

[01:16:00]
I want to know how what were the strategies that worked with Native American students what what have you learned from that and how is that informing informing some solution to those kids who are not growing the same way and interestingly I'm disappointed that we didn't that we did not get key observations on African-American students because I think they did if I'm looking for this information correctly I can go back and say rest assured Council black Leadership Council that the increase their that you see at the end of the year is real

[01:17:00]
so what what worked with these two demographics what happened this year and how do we what what worked I'll leave it at that what strategies worked thank you for the question very excited to talk about what work because it is what informed our strategies in this progress monitoring document as we move forward Mr Sanchez was instrumental in helping us look at where our games were particularly by student population and then working with the principles to find those stories and so I know in progress monitoring you get a sort of generalized approach to the strategies we don't always include all the details sometimes I wish I had

[01:18:00]
the Whiteboard down here and we could just really break it down but the strategies that we see that were most impactful were number one is system where teachers were able to have time together to look very carefully at the data and look at that data by student population including our African-American in Native American students and then work together to come up with sophisticated interventions that were going to support the student and I'm using intervention broadly we've talked about academic Intervention when we know exactly the skill Gap that the student has we can address it but there may be other barriers that were standing in the way of a student achievement and so by for example looking at attendance and using our community school coordinators or even just working with families what is going on with attendance how can we help you with this how can we help you access School in a way that works for you those were a lot of the really

[01:19:00]
sophisticated conversations that we were the schools that made the gains were able to have and they are also I don't know if you can speak to Tony hillerman would you be I don't think about it we do know that there were schools that may gains and I'm looking at Mr Sanchez cuz I don't know that I can speak well to the details but we would be able to do that offline because they did do very specific strategies particularly around their Native Americans students so I just can't stress enough the importance of this collaborative time and the systems in the coaching that help our teachers really recognize what the individual needs of the students are and then how we address those needs versus there's a one size fits all that isn't going to work so I'm going to circle back to what Gail Stewart pointed out with regard to special education students so

[01:20:00]
how how then is what's missing there because you mentioned differentiation and I just and I'm assuming so please clarify her point was that the program aims for us period

[01:21:00]
what's what's happening and what's the strategy to address it in what it has the school what have the schools been doing that prevented special education students to Progressive I can't tell you the exact story in a lot of various few years ago I was a principal supports to

[01:22:00]
their school was performing this current year the conversations that we are having as assistant superintendents with principals is looking at all of their data and asking them what systems do you have in place to support students whether it's El students special ed students African-American students what are the systems in place and it's not just a one-and-done conversation I am then following that conversation up the next time I have a scheduled meeting with that principal and it's there's this sense I tell them I tell the principles that I work with I want to create a sense of healthy urgency with all of them I know that toxic urgency it's going to feel that way but want to create this sense of healthy urgency so even though our data with special ed students might be flat at a grade level

[01:23:00]
I do think that we need to know that so then I can go out and focus on that specifically with the principles and work with them insane let's hear let's look at the strategies that need to be put in place to support but also continue to follow up with them the next time I meet with them it's not a one of them right I guess I'm suggesting it's a root cause analysis that needs to happen I'm yes I'm trying to figure out and I'm not hearing that there's there's been a deep dive on a targeted study of Why students with disabilities took a dive so they did not grow and they did

[01:24:00]
thank you remember I will come back to you thank you so my question is somewhat related to yours president Gonzalez about the strategies that are listed here in our report cuz obviously the strategies make complete sense but to ensure autonomy happening across all all schools are there any specific incentives I know Bergen's asked about can we fast track but how do we or are we providing any type of incentives to the schools the staff teachers principals to truly ensure that these strategies are going to be implemented because I love what you reported I love the intent behind it but to again to ensure that we have autonomy across all of our schools what is that looking like for the district it's all this number of Superman

[01:25:00]
is answer may help with member dominguez's question as well I hope one of the things we do with every single progress monitoring process is we look at the top five schools that gained and we look at the schools on the other side of that the five schools that did not what do we learn from each of those student groups as you can see in the progress monitoring document you will see on top of the required you will see the disaggregated data by student group that we are looking at is African American so through that process what we're doing is we're looking at the schools and we're seeing what happening Mr Sanchez and his team are having conversations with those schools sometimes we offer Google forms to collect stories to inform our practice sometimes these conversations are

[01:26:00]
the coaching visits the assistant superintendent takes part in sometimes these conversations are part of principal meetings where a dynamic conversation takes place in relationship to the work the stories are being teased out what is happening in terms of motivation to your point is and this might sound fundamental but in the world of an educator in the world of a principal it's huge at our principal meetings one of the things that leadership of superintendent Blakey at the end of the year for example the schools that made the highest games in every single one of the goals including go to the five top schools were brought up in front of their peers and they were celebrated and the emotion in the face of these principles was profound because they are putting forth as examples amongst their peers hard-working principles the principal ship is a hard job but to be able to be there in front of them and say you know what you

[01:27:00]
I need to talk to you you did something great that's an incentive that is really huge in terms of I don't know maybe even bigger than any strategy that we read about tonight because what it's doing is it is actualizing the goals that were working on in the fabric and the being of these practitioners because the human condition is that they want to be successful these principles want to be successful we have given them a common Target and we are creating an environment in a culture where folks are able to see what's working talk to each other dig into the data share these progress monitoring reports with them month after month after month and one of the things that we need to be called to action and we've appreciate these conversations because we learned too and hopefully what you see is a culture of continuous Improvement in these documents is

[01:28:00]
what is the specific specificity per student group and that is taken to heart I want to tell you that Mr West will correct me if I'm wrong with this but I don't think I am we're looking at the interim goals and this is cohort data therefore it's deceiving to compare year to year because you're looking at different kids so in relationship to the question that was asked is what did we learn well I think we learned a few things number one we are all talking the same language therefore when a person is superintendent speaks to the principal about their progress or lack thereof along the lines of these goals but they're able to see his it's the same student groups therefore were digging deeper with sixth grade Native American students at Jackson Middle School so we're looking at that student Group which will be a different conversation if we're looking at in her assessment data next year

[01:29:00]
so it's just I think an important piece to take into consideration I hope I did Justice to a little bit both of your questions know that was helpful thank you and and just for a clarification on something you said earlier when we talked about like accountability metrics are you referring more to the scorecard that you've all introduced that you talk about that numerous times now so that's what we're using to ensure that we're on track and they can measure them their growth themselves as well yes okay fantastic in additional I think it's important to know that there is a big shift you know I wish we could say oh in a Year everybody every child grew 10% but that's unrealistic and if there was one specific strategy that worked with everybody then schools across the country would obviously be using that and when we look at our students with disabilities particularly behind many of those students is in the IEP that has specific math goals

[01:30:00]
and I do worry sometimes on us not looking at how the students with disabilities are meeting their math goals because we're worried about like are they progressing on here because being flat is not necessarily a bad thing for our students if we're seeing that they all have these IEPs behind it and are we making progress on those individual goals the fact that Mr Sanchez is at the table very excited to be here tonight is speaking to how as a system were aligning the accountability because as you've heard his role has been supervising principals it's still is supervising principals but we've seen as a district there was a disconnect between leading the work of the school and I think board member Jackson has asked this in a question one time that made me think like wait or we

[01:31:00]
these conversations really do help us and like how are we really focused on our strategies and so the accountability now with Mr Sanchez being able to coach principals specific to what the goals are really helps he walks the halls of these schools in the classrooms every day he can identify we have two middle school principals here will one who has been moved into a assistant superintendent position who have both made incredible gains at their school and to us it's like we need to celebrate them and hear what are those stories and nobody knows those stories more besides them and their teachers then Mr Sanchez and the supervisors of these principles and that's really where we're digging into the accountability and the celebrations of what's happening in schools thank you thank you for that we've had a chance to go through and have every board member asked me

[01:32:00]
broadly to see if there are any other board members or if there are any board members who have any additional smart questions for the administration I do remember to make it it's a follow-up to the explanation you just provided superintendent Blakey what doesn't mean no growth her IEP and so help us understand that as a help us understand that and when I say us me in communion with constituents so for our students with disabilities if they have an IEP that I'm looking at Ms Reiser in the hopes that maybe she'll look up and say like thank you

[01:33:00]
if they have an IEP that has specific goals for Math and what their progress are and what their accommodations are to meet their goals in math they might not have a goal that is saying that they have to be at 20.4% proficient their goal might be not even on this or it might be that their goal is to get to 3% proficiency no not unless you feel like you need to and then I'll get really scared that I'm answering it wrong just kidding but so the progress towards the goals for the students with disabilities who have a math exceptionality those IEPs are really what's measuring their progress we're looking at this as a quart of students Behind These numbers are individuals but that's why this data is really like a larger data set where we're looking at students holistically

[01:34:00]
classroom teacher would look at this data much differently they're going to look at just their class how is Gabriella progressing is this progress for her based on where I know she needs to be where is this is very high level data where we're looking is the system as a whole moving forward so knowing that then how what information do we need them to to be able to ask better questions about our special Edge are our children with disabilities population because that gets more nuanced so because yes Behind these children with disabilities they several of them many of them have a disability in math and so it is like hearing it down it makes it a little bit

[01:35:00]
difficult to really look at the numbers if you're going to look at just like math we see the same thing with reading with students with disability because for some of our students that is measuring what their disability is it so again like what's the approach that makes it more I'm just trying to be more effective about how we ask questions about children with disabilities I would say that from from my vantage point it's why if we're looking at the data as a whole that the goals were made with the groups all in one group so if we look at it and we pull them out then that's going to give us very different goals to look at that's where you would look at students with disabilities as a different goal per that subgroup

[01:36:00]
then if you're looking at as a whole because the idea of behind this wouldn't because these goals were developed with all of the groups together as a subset if you pull them out then it really students with disabilities needs its own way of looking at the data not if you're looking at this is looking at it very high level broadly with all the groups together precisely but but we do we need to do justice to that population in our conversations here and so what is again what is going to be the approach to to better monitor students with disabilities and and you don't have to answer that now but I think that's a critical question

[01:37:00]
I just want to clarify that the purpose of our monitoring conversations is to focus on the overall performance of the school system and so granted obviously students with disabilities are part of that system it's important to understand how they're progressing but we have to make sure that we are staying at the high strategic level and not diving into specific instructional shifts pedagogical shifts pedagogical methods selection of materials any of those types of things as it relates to that or data so that said I think this would be a good question to ask our coach if we had one around how do we ask questions about particular student groups but since we don't for now I think that's something for all of us to help think through how do we make sure that we're getting to that level of understanding for that specific student group give them that it is part of the Aussie Martinez population as we are trying to stay at the Strategic level focused on overall system performance I don't dis

[01:38:00]
agree with you but I think we need to have an understanding about how we're missing information so that we can ask I want to ask strategic questions about that population just because we disaggregate does not mean that we don't have strategic questions about the disaggregated populations so that's all I'm asking for remember Jackson so if I may I was going to say that same thing I wasn't going to use this big of words as you said like pedagogical and stuff like that but what I was going to was going to say is I think we we are needing to make sure that we stay out of governance level I agree that you want to ask strategic questions but I think some of those questions that have been elucidated today could be asked in technical questions now that you know that there are potential subgroups within special education but again those are very specific to IEPs

[01:39:00]
that is like in the weeds down under the ground that probably also has legal barriers around it as to how much we are allowed to know so I think if in order to help you frame a strategic question those might be more technical or technical questions that can be asked beforehand once you receive that information that might help you to better frame your strategic question but we need to be very careful about giving advice or directing you know that the superintendent and her staff on how the information is provided to us thank you member Jackson so I'll turn to remember and then we'll go ahead and see if there are any other strategic questions so we can move on in the agenda I just want to clarify I think many times when we look at special education predominantly there are layers and I think

[01:40:00]
remember Dominguez was just asking a question on how that works I don't think she was stating a comment or trying to get into the weeds but I would think that also understanding special education would be helpful and how IPS work in the process and how that relates to goals and not only goals with an IEP but also our goals as a district so I think in clarifying that I would think I've never seen anybody do a presentation on special ed because I did want that earlier but I also know that it's it's entangled because there are misunderstandings about how it works and specifically when Gail Stewart made that comment it's a deeper issue that one I stated later on I will ask the question to but I think we don't know the layers of what goes into special ed and also what's required in an IEP and looking at curriculum and all of those things but I think they're just needs to be an understanding of it thank you thank you remember to worry too

[01:41:00]
are there any additional smart questions for the administration before I move on to accepting the report all right so I'd like to thank you board members for this productive conversation and also thank you to the administration for the report for your work on math Improvement and also for the continuous Improvement that has been shown in the reports it's been really fun to watch them get more in depth in details and tied I think to the work that the community is most interested in around goals math School in particular so now we need to vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report and as a point of clarity devoting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent sorry how to satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with their vision for them

[01:42:00]
in order to accept we must answer yes to the following questions when does the reality of the report does the reality of this report meet our vision for the goal two is their growth toward the vision three is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision if the answer to all three is yes then the board can accept the monitoring report confident that data is accurate and that the superintendent is performing at this point I believe we're ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report I will move that we accept the progress monitoring monitoring reports for insurance goals 2.1 and 2.2 math proficiency this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and a second can we please have a roll call Vote Yes Crystal yes yes yes yes no yes yes

[01:43:00]
Daniel Gonzalez yes and so that motion carries thank you again for the work our next item is a discussion on board time use evaluation so we are looking at our boards time use between the fourth quarter to which included the months of April May and June so during this 3 month period the board used 870 minutes of board authorized public meeting time of this time April was 328 minutes with 156 of that being coded a student outcomes focused and so for April the percentage of student outcomes Focus time was 48 percent so nearing that 50% in April so that was exciting may we had 214 total minutes if that slow it's because we canceled one of our meetings for graduation week of that 63 of those minutes were coded as student outcomes focused and so for May the percentage

[01:44:00]
29% in June we had 328 board public I'm sorry board authorized public meeting minutes 136 of those minutes for student outcomes focused for 41 percent this included in this ad to community outreach and engagement committee meetings that we're bored authorized and not required by law yes yes add hot committees so this included the ad hoc committee on the board guard rails the ad hoc committee on community engagement the ad hoc committee on new board member onboarding as well as the community engagement with the New Mexico United are there any questions about this data item 5.3

[01:45:00]
which is to consider adoption of the aps Board of Education student outcomes Focus governance self-evaluation for year 3/43 students focused governance again is a framework that is designed to drive the boards ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes this is the process that we're going to go through of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing behaviors with those that research shows are most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes our board has also adopted a policy for be on board accountability that says that our board will monitor its progress I'm sorry it's processed and performance by regularly conducting formative self-evaluations along with an annual summative self-evaluation using a research-based self-evaluation instrument

[01:46:00]
the board members have been asked to individually complete the self-evaluation form for our board actions from this last quarter board members have done this and have submitted their results to the board office for tonight's discussion so before we proceed are there any questions about the process to date all right then I will review the results for each of the six competencies of the student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation I'll share our Collective scores for each competency and then we'll go through and we'll have discussion so we received scores from four board members and the total Rangers or the range that we had for this quarter was 57 to 58 so this is the closest we've been in alignment the smallest Range the smallest that we've had so I'm excited about that because I think maybe it saves time on the recalibration but we'll see across each competency there were four where members were all agreed and so there was only one area of describe and see that will dive into

[01:47:00]
I'm going to go through the first area is Vision in goals collectively board members rated us as having achieved a 35 so 35 is the consensus on the number of points and focus for that values and guardrails collectively board members rated us is having achieved a 10 so 10 is the consensus number for points for values and guard rails for monitoring an accountability again collectively board members rated us as having achieved a 10 as the consensus on the number of points and focus level so 10 for monitoring an accountability for communication and collaboration collectively board members rated us as having achieved a one as the consensus score as a consensus number of points and focus level so we won for communication and collaboration and then under unity and trust this is the area where there was some disagreement individually board members rated us as having achieved either a one or a zero with the consensus being as a one as a number of points

[01:48:00]
Focus level so we will see one for Unity and trust but I will also open up this one for anyone who had evidence for supporting your position of a score other than one on unity and Trust on poor attendance for this quarter and so if I'm understanding the criteria that we're evaluating ourselves or for Unity and Trust the First Column says we're not outcome not student outcomes focused we get a 0 if the following any of the following are true the board is not adopted goals adopted policies board members serve on committees formed by the superintendent staff without approval

[01:49:00]
no items from the not student outcome Focus column which we got through the zero comma and the first one is attendance at all regularly scheduled board meetings was over 80% during the previous three month period which it was not and so I think that we stay at 0.00 are their responses to that again on that like I would question if the leave of absence from board member astorga is being considered cuz that was something that was I I don't hold that against us but I don't know what

[01:50:00]
billboard fills with that so that's why I rated it the way I did because I didn't yes ok Google on and again this is for us to determine and for us to reach consensus on so we can say it's 0 because we didn't have 80% or we can say we had one member on maternity leave and so that doesn't count and so we had 80% so just open it up to the group to see how people want to clarify that how folks feel thank you member benefits for the clarification I have a follow-up question regarding the the leave and just to be very clear I'm not picking on anyone board member but I do understand that that leave was requested and I'm assuming granted but during that period this remember did attend one meeting so

[01:51:00]
so she wasn't able to request to leave cuz it doesn't exist because we're not paid Personnel okay and so she indicated that these were the meetings that she was going to miss and this is how she's going to participate and we said great so there's no formal leap so again it is there's no policy on it there's no State policy she's not so that is we use the term leave very Loosely right now I understand that and I don't think that that's the question here I think it's was I mean should we because the person did attend one meeting which I would think kind of breaks up the I'm in which she was out you know do we give credit to it or not it's just I'm curious about are we going to keep kind of moving the

[01:52:00]
I don't think we should see this I'm sorry may I remember Dominguez go ahead I don't see this as a punitive vote it's just it's a statement of fact that we didn't have 80% and it's it's all it's for good reason but the final result is that we don't have 80% and that's not a negative for anyone that's just the way it fell this time around I'm sure it'll pick up next time and I understand and I have no problem my explanation was that that's the reason why I gave it

[01:53:00]
at least the one but I fully understand what you're saying and keeping just keep being consistent and accurate what it actually States I understand I'll just speak as a woman as a mom as a working mom as an all-female board and as a board that has our own authority to determine how we handle maternity leave since it's not something that's available to our board members I think the flexibility the grace the acknowledgment that yes women give birth and need to go and do that away from public life and away from the diet is important for us to acknowledge and you know in 2025 the fact that you can be an elected member and not have an opportunity to have formal leave as you know I think problematic and if anyone from the legislature is

[01:54:00]
we're at and given the very unique circumstances of that the absence that we had from members in particular I just that's why I escorted as I felt like maternity wasn't something that we would count so to speak as an absence so sharing my perspective we've heard from Members Dominguez top Romero and benavidez it looks like remember telling you wants to get in and so I'll open it up to number to Maria if you would like to speak up as well and remember Jackson if there's anything like to share and then we can decide on this one and move on I think based on evaluation it I think we have to just State the truth you know we did she wasn't here but I'm not trying to also ding her for anything but it's just part of what our evaluation is stating right now and I don't think we should

[01:55:00]
go on predictions or what ifs I just think that we have to just date what is the truth and formalize it and we need to go on thank you do you remember tomorrow is there anything else you wanted to contribute I think that a gosh I hate having this conversation with her not here even if she's listening I mean I think when you're on maternity leave when you're out it's it's just different I understand the words I was comfortable with her being out and then judging it based on based on sex you know 6 out of 5 out of 6 were here or out of six were here I'm comfortable leaving it as a one because

[01:56:00]
being a young mom have any young baby at home you just never know are you going to be able to show up or are you not and so I think the fact that she said she would be out and was able to pop in when she could is a testament to her commitment to her elected office and I appreciate that she shows up when she can and I'm comfortable leaving it out of one but I'll go with consensus right thank you remember Jackson this is one where I'm not sure that we do have consensus so we're kind of going between a 0 and a one if I were to count it does seem as the we potentially have four who thinks it's the one and zero who thinks it should I'm sorry three members who think it would be the zero and so with that in mind and acknowledging of the scores that were submitted so we had four scores submitted of the four that were submitted three people ranked

[01:57:00]
there's a wine and one person ranked it as a zero so it was a one as consensus in what was submitted so I propose that we move ahead with the one for Unity and Trust remember going to be sure I'm totally fine with that I think that it's very important that we stay true to the data into the facts and I also would say that in the event this happens again that we understand the criteria I did not realize that as a board we were supposed to essentially we were aboard of 6 not 7:00 bring this time and so had I known that I might have scored differently thank you remember I just want to clarify I know that the you know the scores were submitted but I also just want to stay at that there was a consensus here permanently not based on what was written prior to that we need to also reflect that those who did State the zero but also that

[01:58:00]
doing this in public and we're not just the public doesn't have can't review those scores that were submitted to you so I think that clarifying that and not initiating that based on those prior scores that that is the settle settle or Bill to why we're putting one I'm just trying to the Pryor when you got the comments from other board members prior to this that when that response was given in and it was given off the diets I think that now that we are currently bringing this up to vote that that should be the vote and not was what was given prior to this meeting so we will move ahead with a consensus of one for Unity and Trust for continuous Improvement individually or sorry collectively board members rated us as having achieved a one as the consensus on the number of points in Focus levels

[01:59:00]
and so across all of the criteria that gives us a total of 58 from the last quarter now we need to set our goal for the next quarter and I'd like to hear from members of the board what you believe is possible by our next self-evaluation in the next quarter so who would like to share their thoughts first I don't mind thank you so even reflecting back up from our last quarter scores versus this quarter we stayed exactly the same we were consistent we had a next quarter goal of 72 anticipated for this particular evaluation which we fell short so I would like us to still stay on track of what we aimed for at our last quarter to still be 72 as a

[02:00:00]
not being Google because there are just read it there's one that we could actually take up significant points fairly easy communication and collaboration would go to a 5 if we limit board meeting number in like wow I think 722 other suggestions for the next quarter will we be basing our attendance on a board of six or seven that's up for us to discuss but I will say the maternity leave for remember Astoria returning virtual in July and then in person in August so

[02:01:00]
anticipating having her here for the next time going forward and just to be clear I'm not picking on one board member I just want to know what the criteria is that we're measuring thank you thank you any other reactions to the proposed 72 as a goal for the next quarter remember Jackson I'm thinking if I'm counting this went through we'll have July August September okay well then nevermind I was if we were going to October I was going to say we might be able to jump to 20 with the monitoring accountability because we will have done the annual superintendent evaluation but I guess that cuz that's enough for so next time we'll jump to 20 and what I'm sorry what Focus level was that so under monitoring and accountability we would move from approaching to meeting but

[02:02:00]
because we will not have been able to stay we did the most recent annual superintendent evaluation okay in which case our goal would be a 62 for the next quarter so how do people feel about that sorry I'm sorry if I summarize we would stay as a 35 on vision and goals for values and guardrails were at 10 and we would stay at 10:45 and we would stay at 10 for the reason the Debbie Downer I'm sorry Courtney Jackson just mentioned or communication and collaboration and we had thought that we would gain points for limiting our

[02:03:00]
meetings and numbers that would move us up to five do we think we are going to be able to limit the number of board meetings and the length so not have any board meetings over 3 hours in July August and September we can try tonight but I don't think we're on track for that darn we're not moving then so that's fine so we would put that up I'm sorry goal for the next quarter as things solid at 58 I am seeing nodding okay all right so at this time I'm sorry goal for next quarter is 58 so this time I'll entertain a motion and consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation and so the motion should say I move we accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 58 points on the student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation

[02:04:00]
I move we expect our quarterly self-evaluation score of 58 points on the student outcomes Focus governance self-evaluation instrument this is board member Jackson thank you to have a second this is emotion and a second any additional discussion all right yes Courtney period on the evaluation of the

[02:05:00]
give me a student outcomes Focus governance vendor in preparation for establishing criteria for a new sorry new vendor so I want to acknowledge that part of this process is has already taken place offline members were received a survey asking for them for their feedback on the previous vendor and services and that feedback was provided to all of the members and so members have had an opportunity to review that feedback to review the summary of board member survey responses and so now have an opportunity to discuss the themes implications Reflections and takeaways there was a request from board members to have time to reflect on what other said so we've had others answers in our inboxes for two weeks so we've had ample time to reflect on what others have said and so we'll just go down the line and allow everyone an opportunity to share any other reflection or thoughts on services from the previous

[02:06:00]
I want to remind us that we are talking about the services that we received we're talking about the vendor and the contractor not about the individual so the purpose of this exercise is not to evaluate a staff person of another organization is simply to share feedback and evaluation around the services that we received and the purpose of this is to be forward focused future Focus so we can use those inside that week from that process to be able to determine criteria to evaluate a new vendor for coaching support for the board and so to enable this process to go smoothly I'm going to ask that each member spend just two minutes sharing their Reflections their feedback their observations they're takeaways their themes their applications about the previous vendor and so Mr Gonzalez are you able to show a timer should I just run one from up here

[02:07:00]
Christian Gonzalez I can do a 2-minute timer excellent thank you and so Mr Gonzalez when you have that ready then we will take you in and as I said we'll just go down the line and so I'll start with member Dominguez so I'll just know that first beginning with the contract contracts impact the work of the board or governance team must be approved in public and must have a start and end time period any extensions must be approved in public meeting by the entire board and so in terms of process we need to honor that and that was a takeaway from the workshops

[02:08:00]
I attended this last week in Cloudcroft at the Leadership Retreat sponsored by the New Mexico School Board Association and those were led by lawyers to law firms that work that are listed as vendors here so take away from that contracts must have an intermediate markers or moments to reevaluate and reflect on the work completed up to that point to rethink the path ahead to adjust deliverables all must happen in a public meeting finally I think the vendor fails terribly on bringing consensus and unity and Trust to this board they did a great job at getting a

[02:09:00]
with progress monitoring and that work is up to us to do not anybody else and we're doing it the vendors were never intended to go on and on and on indefinitely secondly I would argue that the vendors did harm between bored relationships and certainly with the community so I think we need to consider all that thank you my experience with working with our previous or current vendor was actually favorable I felt like they were always accessible to answer any questions that I had whether it was direct coaching during an actual board meeting or follow up

[02:10:00]
information that we needed outside of board meetings they always made themselves available to do extra training and if there was any type of confusion or we needed clarification as to what direction we were going to ensure that we were keeping the main thing the main thing which is student outcomes because prior to us bringing on this vendor we were very very distracted we would get involved in a lot of conversations that were things that we had no business making decisions on and we spent a lot of our time like a hamster wheel we worked our tail off but we got nowhere and bringing this this particular vendor on I really felt like it gave us a sense of direction and guidance and it kept us focused on the hard part of that is that would all so kept us accountable and it kept us accountable for some bad behaviors that we had in the past or bad habits that helped us that derailed us from making their

[02:11:00]
so it wasn't comfortable at times to be able to have to be called out on you know making sure we're doing what would what it is we are called to do but overall my experience was very very favorable I enjoyed working with them I enjoyed having an expert on our team I love that they had also had experience working with large school districts like ours because that is something we had to take into consideration and being able to make the right decisions and I think they were always available to train and retrain to the point where I didn't want to retrain anymore because I felt like I was not using my time wisely and I had already had those trainings but again that's that's me thank you thank you thank you thank you remember benavidez thank you for the castle great City schools and the coaching provided the pros for me great training I really enjoyed it they encouraged self-reflection which I appreciated and

[02:12:00]
some of the the demands for self-reflection were very heavy-handed to the point that it seemed almost insulting to the people in the training there was a lack of transparency where the contract is concerned and overall I feel like there was a failure to encourage a culture of teamwork and instead encourage a culture of of kind of a dividing conquer and finally I asked for data for other school districts using the sfg and great City Schools coaches to to compare it to to our results see if this is a model that doesn't in fact work and it was never provided and so that's the big point of contention for me but it was a positive experience but I understand now we're ready to move on so thank you

[02:13:00]
thank you remember benavidez remember Jackson thank you I agree with some of the statements I really appreciated that they were always available and were flexible with their time I did spend a fun Friday evening over a glass of wine and zoom with some of our coaches from Council of great City Schools just so that I could better understand the process and to to help get better for my own skills habits and mindsets to make sure that I was focusing on what I needed to be focusing on so I really appreciated that and I appreciated the responsiveness as well I could always reach out and get a response phone call and I think most importantly for me what they helped to provide to follow up with what board member tapioca Romero was saying I think that they absolutely brought us a Clarity to our work they helped us to

[02:14:00]
this on what was really the work of the board and why we're here why APS exists why school boards exist and so they brought Clarity I believe that they brought us a consistency I think it was challenging but I'm not here to have my ego stroked I'm here to make sure that the work that I am doing from the diet and when I'm out in the community is what is focusing on our students and I think that they helped us to maintain a focus and I think that they if today's progress monitoring report is any indication of it as well as the progress monitoring report that we were supposed to hear on June 18th but I think we'll hear in the future it is delivering results for our students and so having that Focus covering consistency having challenging yet

[02:15:00]
coaching conversations is what is it it's about the translation from what I have to do into what is working for our students and that is meeting our goals thank you remember Jackson Remember to maruto when I first came on I wrote the book right on their behalf and found throughout my duration of working with the council great City schools that they lacked the deliverables within that book and it was sorry to see that so many things were not addressed especially when it came to our frustrations he did lack creating Unity on this board and said it was more dividing the coaches for me did not work I know that Ashley tried really hard to get me on board but her examples were just not good enough okay I'm sorry so

[02:16:00]
then also didn't like that their lack of trying to include tribes they didn't follow through on that and specifically so that was a big misnomer for me also when I asked questions about the audit on special education that was never addressed by the council Mr crabill's oh sorry the director and those who were involved sometimes when you require personal engagement that was never followed through I also felt that there was confusion when it came to community engagement and also student Focus governance that we have one idea but it was never seriously addressed so I only took one class and it was on tactical and strategic questions other than that I felt that I am many times because of not including tribes I just

[02:17:00]
felt like I was not included that's it thank you remember to worry too remember a story about are you in a place where you can answer this question yes thank you I'll just Echo what a lot of you have already said the flexibility of the availability of the coaches I also really enjoyed the trainings I did wish that they were a little bit longer and not so stuck on the time constraint that we have as board members so that we can get more in-depth conversations in those trainings but yeah I think that I had a really great experience with with the coaches the only thing that I would want a little bit more from a coach and I'll get in this when we talked about the RFP is I had a question throughout my time as a newborn member about advocating for my constituents in this model that I thought was always kind of just dismissed or or on between

[02:18:00]
this conversation of like owners versus the managers so just driving into that a little bit more and and helping guide me on that I also just want to acknowledge something that like my constituents have been telling me which I agree with is that this vendor is very corporate and a corporate model so something that a lot of us are not used to so that also caused a little bit of you know difference in how I related to the vendor because I do come from a different style of working some more community-based versus more corporate base so that was challenging for me but the overall experience was positive thank you member historica so I will go next and say I think the thing that I appreciated most about our previous vendor was their flexibility and time just the availability I think

[02:19:00]
the fact that we were able to have a coach observe our meetings even the ones that ran late and long and be available for live coaching to send emails and texts during the meetings to support all of us I found really helpful so just that availability I think was really important the responsiveness and just flexibility with time is also important as board members we have some of us have other jobs and makes it difficult to be available for meetings during the day and so I found the coaches that we worked with the previous vendor to be available and had a flexible schedule I really appreciated that our previous vendor had a strong understanding and a clear grass of the definition of student outcomes Focus governance a clear understanding of the research behind student outcomes focused governance a clear understanding of the research behind what makes school boards affective and what gets in the way but also connections to other

[02:20:00]
school boards Urban school boards large District school boards all across the country to be able to share models and examples but also to make connections so I was able to connect to my peers across the country to variety of different points either as a policy chair as a member or as the board chair to get advice and feedback from people in the same position who are also doing student outcomes Focus governance and able to speak to how they were addressing challenges so those connections that are previous vendor brought were very helpful I also really appreciate the direct and honest feedback offered by all of our coaches even when I didn't run a receive it because it did push me to change my behavior all right so with that we will go ahead and move forward to our next agenda item which is agenda

[02:21:00]

but I really appreciated all those kids are on either ability or standard so it's one of those things that very how many are on the standard or some of these holes may work and the abilities at 10 minutes since our break would you like to get started again I believe we are ready to get started Augusta do you still logged in okay great thank you

[02:33:00]
what time is agenda item 5.5 which is a discussion to establish criteria for a new vendor to provide services to support the boards implementation of the student outcomes focused governance for this area of the discussion from sorry for this component of the agenda we're going to use a process called nominal group technique which is just a fancy way of saying a process for group facilitated consensus building I know many of us have had an opportunity to reflect on criteria to think of what we want and we've also some of us have heard from our constituents and so this is an opportunity we've had some time to reflect we've had some pre-work where members were asked to spend some time thinking about what are the criteria that you would like to include in the request for proposals for a new vendor to support the boards implementation of our government and small model student outcomes focused so you had an opportunity to think of that and so I'm going to walk us through the process here so if you have no notes

[02:34:00]
this is the time to get those out the process is going to be the will go down the line and we'll have each member State one criteria one area that they think is important to be included in the request for proposals member benavidez is going to act as our scribe and so if you're wondering why there's been this chart up behind us for the whole meeting that is why so she's going to capture people's suggestions and so we'll do three full rounds so everyone will have an opportunity to share three ideas and then we will pause and we will check only for clarification it's not an opportunity to argue or debate or dialogue or discuss the idea is it's an opportunity to seek clarification it's all an opportunity at that point to potentially consolidate so we may see I think that idea number one and we should probably number them and I did a number eight seem very similar

[02:35:00]
can we consolidate them if both members agree will consolidate them similar how we did superintendent it's the exact same process that we used to develop the job description for our superintendent search process exact same thing and so then after that once we have the ideas we'll go back through and we will allow board members for votes and so you'll have four choices on the list that you can identify member benefits acting as our scribe will put marks for those votes and then we'll see essentially what are the top agreed upon criteria that we want for the RFP for our vendor I'm going to go ahead and start with member of store with this one because I know she has other priorities this evening and so remember Astoria if you can go ahead and share with the board now I'm thinking I'm wondering if we should do your top three or go through

[02:36:00]
how much time do you think you have with us if I can just give my all my three that would be great okay is that okay with others if we kind of modify the process a little bit for that okay remember the story is going to give her top three criteria perfect thank you so much first I just wanted to acknowledge some of the conversations and questions that I've been hearing from the community so there is a question about why we need coaches and this whole process and it does stem from many organizations and companies being tied to privatization of Education in a guys to better our schools or improving test scores so I just wanted to respond to that and say that my reasoning for supporting coaching is because I don't see it as a negative word meaning more members need coaching I see it more as a mentorship or a guidance so just as I've had Community mentors and teachers have learning coaches it's there's a space for improvement and guidance always another concern I've heard is hi to the privatization of Education issue

[02:37:00]
answer the question around why do we rely so much on standardized test scores so I want to just assure my constituents that I have always been opposed to standardized test scores as the only measure of success because of the historical Foundation being tied to Old IQ tests which have been used to keep people of color out of higher education and towards military or work and I wanted to remind community that the goals we have our ensuring our students are meeting reading and math proficiency which means an order to see Improvement in those outcomes we are using the testing to stay on target but that could be something that maybe superintendent in her team can change but we use the state and federal mandated testing so that's just an important thing that I feel like was needed to say during this process that I've been getting from constituents and my three recommendations are first to hire a local organization either a Statewide or Regional one because East Coast bass organizations don't fully understand or culture as

[02:38:00]
sitting at the state sitting on tribal land as well as our multiple languages that are within our constitution as a state or on my second recommendation is an organization that has background and working with school boards and school districts with an intentional framework to do better for our students of color so plus I know this is kind of throwing a shot in the dark but for me A Plus would be if they are based on an anti-racist or decolonial framework my third recommendation is an organization that has a strategy around what it looks like for school board members to be active advocates in their for their constituents in collaboration with the superintendent and their team so a local organization an organization that has background in working intentionally to better outcomes for students of color and an organization that has a strategy on what it means to be an active Advocate thank you thank you thank you remember estraga

[02:39:00]
flip chart hopefully you can see it or able to stick around enough to express your four votes but if not we know that you have other things you need to deal with so thank you for that so I'll go ahead and start at the end of the dice to my right with member Dominguez if you can share one of your criteria the process from beginning to end has got to be transparent and so I want to know I want the board to have membership on the committee in the creation of a rubric building applicants the scoring all that I want all of them transparent

[02:40:00]
and I'm sorry it's not just the board for a governance team and so I think we need to be sure that we function is of evidence team and all that process thank you member number thank you so I'm looking for someone who has systems thinking they're familiar how to work with the large district there are high level coach they must be able to see across all departments initiatives board priorities and Community needs they can help the board recognize how decisions can rip across the entire school and some of the implications yes thank you among staff and with our budget and outcomes overall and just being able to guide us cohesively so

[02:41:00]
and share it afterwards remember Jackson okay so my top is

[02:42:00]
also experience with us s o f g so do I just say that okay all right because I didn't know if it was already on the board if I needed to go to my son but yes experience with you remember don't worry the coach able to see our needs and provide the training necessary the necessary training to pull us all together and and keep us on board all right and my top

[02:43:00]
is documented positive results from previous sfg worker who has proof that they have been effectively thank you yes we need somebody who is going to improve Community slash family engagement with our most vulnerable targeted

[02:44:00]
populations are the disaggregated data thank you with courage if that makes sense that they can remain neutral but not passive they can still challenge us and allow us to think differently period

[02:45:00]
member Jackson my second is experience with large Urban school districts similar to hours APS is a big fish in New Mexico Pond and our challenges are different than other are challenges in our opportunities are different than the other school districts in New Mexico so we need somebody who can bring us similar experience from other larger Urban school districts thank you remember to worry too much thank you

[02:46:00]
I would say availability and it would be like the main thing that you can write but flexible schedule including out of regular work hours but just availability that matches ours that's perfect yet so I'm just checking in so if we get that already

[02:47:00]
Patriots ethical practices understands and consistently applies coaching ethics and standards thank you and emotional intelligence like ensuring that we can navigate interpersonal tensions and how can we still maintain trust while always focusing on student outcomes improving students thank you remember benavidez third is experience with large districts remember Jackson my third is a proven proven

[02:48:00]
proven improvements in student outcomes so inability to prove that student outcomes Focus governance actually leads to improved student outcomes because in the end it really is our fundamental responsibility to the students in the families of the district to improve student outcomes and that's what we're here for thank you remember tell you the code to give us well helps us to strengthen our ability to have student outcome Focus governance but sometimes I think that that could be the key point but just to bring that along and to remember that we are different and what are strengths as a different community board and School District

[02:49:00]
what do you mean by different may I ask I'm sorry what do you mean by different okay our languages are cultural are population are demographics yeah yeah diversity cultural in there okay and so my third is but they have tools and templates already created models to a templates to provide that we can use and adapt

[02:50:00]
so everyone has had a chance to go through with their three top ideas there has been some duplication which is good and so I'm going to we're going to go now and I'm going to ask well I'm going to try to read them out so we can all hear them and then we're going to go back through the line and we're going to have I'm sorry we're not going to go back through line we're going to have the conversation on clarification now and consolidation okay so the first thing we had is that they that we hire someone local that they have a background in Dei support to support our diverse students and they have a strategy related to active advocacy next we have a transparent process and the prince family

[02:51:00]
but they can improve family and Community engagement and Outreach to vulnerable populations including the disaggregated populations ethical practices and standards systems thinking large District experience cohesive guidance and coaching neutrality neutral with courage political and emotional intelligence or they can maintain trust they have experience with sosg they have a culture of teamwork and they have large District experience they have experience with sfg they have experience with large urban districts and they have proven improvement with sfg outcomes a coach who can assess our needs and provide training that encourages engagement team building and mentoring celebrating diversity culture strength along with the SOS

[02:52:00]
documented positive results with s o f g availability and flexibility and that they possess tools and templates as models that we can use so are there any clarifying questions around anything that's up here and the floor is just opened for that I just wanted you on I forgot to put on there I'm just understand I think we don't do that enough OK Google are there clarifying questions around what's up here remember Dominguez not a clarifying question but clarifying statement or reiterating that this person has got to have some street cred with

[02:53:00]
parents period I just want to clarify that we're not advocating for any particular criteria right now because we do want to have a quality of voice across all seven of us so all of us have had an opportunity to express what are top criteria are we are working to clarify and see if there's any questions around anything or misunderstanding so okay I have a question about member no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no okay

[02:54:00]
I'm sorry coach who can assess our needs and provide training that encourages engagement so what would you mean by who can assess our needs I think many times especially if you're looking at somebody to coach you got to see the strengths and you go to also see the weaknesses in a board and how do you pull that all together I like that Clarity OK Google and then pull it all together strengths and weaknesses other clarifying questions about

[02:55:00]
if you can call out what you see as the duplications if it's okay to consolidate experience with sosg like that is awesome and benavidez and mine was documented results but I think someone said so if culturally culturally different but we're not changing just to consolidate the ones that are the same and so so Jackson and benavidez both have

[02:56:00]
experience with sfg we can consolidate that into one is that okay with Jackson and Benavides okay so we can cross off one of the experiences with Sophie up here so that when we vote we're voting only on the one are there other things that are repeated what we need to keep one of the experiences up their large District experience was shared by popular popular and benavidez and Jackson experience with urban districts are we comfortable consolidating experience with large / urban districts okay we'll consolidate that one we can cross off the other two

[02:57:00]
are there any other things that were repeated improvement with somg and documentation and so that's me and Jackson so would you be okay consolidating those into one okay so we will consolidate that so we'll cross off one of those documented positive results with sosg holiday experience so there's a difference between experience and then positive results with you can have experience and not have positive results remember top your mirror are there any others that are I'm trying to culture was huge Martinez Yazzie culture culturally relevant sfg celebrate diversity

[02:58:00]
diversity

[02:59:00]
but we're not we're not deliberating we're just talking about whether we can imagine cultural diversity and Martinez Jazzy background in and culture and culture diversity consolidation and awareness of Martinez and cultural of the community and the culture of our community okay and so we can cross off the duplication that's up there and then is there any other duplic

[03:00:00]
we have this for a coach can assess bring some providing training that encourages engagement I said something about like leading with courage neutrality with courage and I don't know if that's will you suggested that so you can weigh in as to whether so I can signal what's happening next so we're just consolidating so that we don't so to speak so if there's experience with USG and experience with people don't vote on one or the other and then it divides it so now we have it up here as once we're going to take everything else that is also appearing once up there and move it over here so if there's anything that is like two similar that it's going to get split up with our votes and then not make it through because we all agree on it so much that's what I'm trying to figure out if there's anything

[03:01:00]
would you two be comfortable with consolidating yours in a coach who brings a culture of teamwork and emotional intelligence so it's coach who can who brings a culture of teamwork and political and emotional intelligence okay I think that's all that are super similar but does anyone think there are any others that are so similar but they need to be Consolidated I'm concerned about Community engagement I think that's got to be we've had two weeks since I would argue so it is community engagement appearing multiple times on this list and we need to consolidate it into one is what I'm asking okay okay so if it's only one that's fine it's still going to make it to our list

[03:02:00]
okay so now remember benavidez is going to transfer the remaining ones that didn't get crossed out or already added onto this name list so hire someone local but she's checking strategy on active advocacy what does that mean that was number Astoria model so someone who understands the role of advocacy or I don't know

[03:03:00]
transparent process improve family / community outreach with a focus on vulnerable populations including our disaggregated Martinez Jersey population

[03:04:00]
next is systems thinking for hours and hours systems thinking cohesive guidance and coaching sorry coaching availability / flexibility and they

[03:05:00]
best tools / templates that we can use all right so the next stage in this process is now that everyone can see everything that is up here we are going to go through and each member is going to have essentially for hash marks and we're going to share them out loud for the purpose of transparency instead of having people just go through and do their hash marks and so we'll go ahead and start I think member store is gone is that correctly are you able to offer your Four Tops across the list that we have on the screen

[03:06:00]
remember Dominguez I will turn to your top four votes on the list that's on the screen I need clarification is do we have Dei and anti-racism under the same thing no one said anti-racism so it's not on the list so you want to play some cards

[03:07:00]
well remember Dominguez is reading the member top of your mirror are you ready okay go ahead and say yours out loud and then member Benavides you can pick them off so if she experienced experience with a large Urban District documented positive results with s o f g systems thinking thank you remember Dominguez are you ready to do your top four sorry yeah four transparency teamwork improve family and community outreach focus on vulnerable populations

[03:08:00]
clarification on what we captured as strategy on active advocacy yes so for that I go back to how we can advocate for our constituents as elected officials so what does that look like how are we actively advocating or representing our community as elected officials thank you all right so that was the fourth vote for

[03:09:00]
member benavidez if you can hash mark yours and share them and I'll share them into the mic sfg experience experience with the larger Urban District culture of teamwork political and emotional intelligence experience experience with larger urban districts documented positive results with sosg and availability and flexibility thank you remember don't worry you can share your top four four processes and standards

[03:10:00]
process of transparent process background and Martinez and then the first one period Thank you period documented positive results availability and flexibility and experience with large urban districts do you want to share your top four yes thank you I'll do the DIY one

[03:11:00]
the advocacy yes transparent process and availability flexibility for sorry so sfg experience experience with large urban districts those are the top two and then we have several that were three vote Getters so we can if we can Mark those ones that was documented positive results

[03:12:00]
transparent process availability and flexibility and so let's go ahead and include the two vote gutters in the RFP as well if that works with people so those are the criteria that we have overall everything that has two hash marks or more does that work all right thank you very much you are awesome and for supporting us through that process our next item is to consider approval of amendments to the students focused governance implementation timeline

[03:13:00]
can I ask a question yes no we need a motion to consider this agenda item and then we'll go into are you asking about this okay I'm sorry yes clarifying about this so what we put red check marks were saying that is automatically being included in the RFP or we having any additional discussion on any of these so these are the things that will be included so we're looking for a fun sorry a vendor who can provide this stuff okay and then our people will have like a scoring system so based on how many points they get on that because okay so when will that happen and will it be a full board discussion about the RFP we had agreed that the RFP will be issued on July 18th so this is the full board discussion about the RFP okay so I'm going to propose the

[03:14:00]
we wait the background in Dei or or I want to wait culturally anything that is culturally sensitive to this community and I share that perspective the purpose of this protocol that was to make sure that no single one of us had a was able to express a dominant view over the others and so that's why we voted and so what Rose to the top Rose to the top and so we'll include all of these in there we'll ask the perspective applicants to demonstrate how they need these criteria and then we'll evaluate them against it we're not going to there's not waiting of any particular one higher than the other because that would give unfair advantage or preference toward one board member versus others I guess I'm concerned that the previous vendor that was exactly

[03:15:00]
and so we have our criteria removing forward with that in our RFP we've established the process and so our next item is to consider approval of amendments to students focused governments implementation timeline and so for this one is their emotion and a second to consider this agenda item I move we approve amendments to the student outcomes Focus governance implementation that we consider approval of amendments to the student outcomes Focus governance implementation timeline this is board member going to be just thank you do we have any proposed amendments to the student outcomes focused governance implementation timeline

[03:16:00]
I have a list remember to make us go ahead so first top row column with the with the title owner I believe it's the board who should be the owner again in an effort to promote transparency and full board participation it has to be the full board

[03:17:00]
my understanding of proposed implementation of proposed changes to the implementation calendar is proposed amendments to the work that we're going to do so the activities that are listed under description these are the things that we would hire a coach to help us do so that's what we're coming to the meeting with suggestions about the format of the calendar I'm sorry of the timeline calendar document we can certainly discuss and debate we can remove owner we could do whatever but the purpose of this agenda item is to discuss changes to the specific activities in the timeline starting with page three that's where we're at in the timeline you've already completed everything else prior to that we're not looking at the completed a time when we have the discussion in June the discussion was what will the coach help us implement the response was what we've app

[03:18:00]
reply to put in our implementation calendar there was discussion around what we need we ought to be able to change the calendar and so this is the current calendar so this is the opportunity to change it to propose amendments okay so I'm just going to throw up the ideas and you can decide whether or not it fits what you're proposing at this moment I'd like to add tracking numbers and I'd like to see an addition of is this a 2-year calendar so

[03:19:00]
when is September 2021 so what we had previously done is we had considered a proposed calendar with the council great City schools that extended into 2028 the board decided not to continue that work with the council great City schools and so what were left with is our current implementation calendar as previously approved so this is what the work we are currently doing okay so the amendment that I'm proposing is that we add tracking another message has proposed an amendment to track board member time I also want to offer the clarification that the items that are in here are things that we have already decided as a board to do through policy and our government

[03:20:00]
manual so the policy diet 50% of our time monthly check-ins with the board all of these things are already integrated elsewhere in the governance manual so we can certainly add something that says the coach will support the board and developing a process to track board member time and you're proposing that we would do that by when can we get started I mean we're I understand that this is the Council of great City Schools timeline I guess I'm suggesting that this is our timeline it is not the great City so timeline that we vote on wherever where do we see tracking stuff time up here

[03:21:00]
I mean we could start that we could start tracking board time in a month or two but this is supposed to your proposing that we add in September a deliverable that we are establishing a process with our coach to track board member time to the pirate motion and then we'll move on to the next proposed amendment or let me ask it this way so that kind of a suggestion and another suggestion would have been reflected two years cycle to show Transitions and plans for continuity of work every cycle

[03:22:00]
those sorts of ideas are not within the parameters of what you're looking for I don't want to waste time on suggesting the way I understand this is where is left for the next 3 months 2 months 2 months we have left on this calendar if you want to make any changes left to the remaining two months because this is already been approved that is correct okay so at the end of two months will we revisit this and have an opportunity to to add that's a separate agenda that's the purpose of the new coaching contract

[03:23:00]
so when we get a new coach we will revisit the implementation timeline that was the original plan so I'm looking back at the Board of Education meeting minutes that we just approved from June 4th in the discussion on this topic so it does read that there is interest in revising the implementation calendar I guess so if you would end if if we've only got a couple more months so if there are no proposed amendments we can you asked for this to be brought up so she was on your request to be able to offer any edits and changes she's literally doing what you've been asking for months so much I think there's well come on words but she's actually honoring your request I'm sorry you

[03:24:00]
I'm a bit confused about exactly what you're at when you asked for amendments I'm thinking it's a revision of what we're going to call and implementation timeline and I thought that would be appropriate before we got a coach so that we put out the vision I can write this up for a different time to save time we can certainly do that so the conversation that we had on June 4th was that we were considering working with the great City schools in the process of their contract which ended on June 30th and how they had and this implementation calendar was going to end on September 2025

[03:25:00]
they had proposed as a part of their renewed contract a new implementation calendar that extended into September actually I don't know if the month but I extended into 2028 because it carried us through the process of resetting new 5-year goals so that failed or didn't get considered and so we're left with no new approved implementation calendar so that implementation calendar in front of us is the calendar that we voted on so remember talk yet Romero is correct that you expressed a desire to have a board conversation on the current implementation calendar because that was not the posted agenda item in the June 4th meeting we had to put it on a future agenda so this is it and the material said this is our opportunity to offer amendments to the current calendar so I guess I wasn't thinking about I was talking about globally unemployment calendar not necessarily

[03:26:00]
give me the current I'd like to see an expression and so we don't need to I don't need to add anything to the current I want a revision of an implementation timeline that reflects more the work that needed as I'm proposing it so I don't need to make amendments Global so we have emotion on a tape on the table Dr Albright can you remind me who made the motion in the second motion okay so at this point we can repeal that motion and then do a motion to postpone this agenda item or that's an ore or we can move ahead with the conversation to propose amendment

[03:27:00]
amendments and we don't have any amendments so to the people who made the Amendments would you want to repeal or change I'm sorry the motion would you want to repeal or change your motion I'm happy to withdraw the motion motion maker okay so if we withdraw the motion to consider approval of amendments to the implementation calendar is there a new motion I will move to postpone approval of amendments to the student outcomes Focus governments implementation timeline until a time in the future thank you we have a motion and a second the motion from remember Jackson to postpone approval of

[03:28:00]
implementation timeline to a time in the future and a second from Member benavidez any additional discussion all right Dr Albright can we have a roll call please both in a Dominguez yes crystals 6:00 6.1 through 6.17 I move that we approved agenda items 6.1 through 6 Point 17 this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and

[03:29:00]
Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please in the Dominguez yes Crystal of the recusal consent agenda which is agenda item 7.1 is there a motion and a second for that I moved to prove the recusal consent agenda this is member Jackson this is Crystal a second are you having a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please Courtney Jackson yes no the store so that motion carries the next item on our agenda is agenda item 8.1 consider approval of revisions to

[03:30:00]
directions 4404 of the aps Board of Education governance manual so for this one we have Miss Martinez I'm sorry I looked at you and I said your name out loud for this one we have available to presenter answer questions from modrall Sperling and is there a motion and a second to consider approval of the revision to section for D4 of the aps Board of Education governance manual point of clarification will there be a discussion we do motion and second first and then we moved to discussion okay I moved to approve revisions to section 44 of the aps Board of Education governance manuals his member Jackson this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and a second is there any discussion yes thank you member Domingos so first I'd like to understand who proposed the this revision but also

[03:31:00]
8.2 so this was proposed in collaboration between me and Mr Melendez and so it was suggested by Mr Melendez as a opportunity to clarify the policy by striking one sentence and proposed to move forward on the consent agenda as a simple change and and what is the purpose behind it to clarify the language okay so I want to point out I'm going to read from the aps Board of Education governance manual section J or section 4J board policy scope and development first paragraph second sentence the board May develop review a majority vote of

[03:32:00]
the members if that majority vote was taken in the case of these two amendments that through polling or surveying but I don't think so right I'm not hearing that so I want to make sure I'm not assuming if not the board tonight then must discuss the merits of the revisions first then perhaps suggest further amendments and vote whether or not to send the suggested amendments to the policy committee for a first meeting and reading the process says that after the first reading and discussion and possible amendments the policy committee will make the new policy available for a 30-day public review and comment and I want to say the first paragraph that introduces the section title first meeting to ensure the policies are

[03:33:00]
the board will adhere to the following meeting sequence in considering adopting And I stress proposed new policies or policy amendments item two under first meeting says once reviewed by the policy committee the proposed new policy will make will be made available for public review and comment for 30 days or until the next regularly scheduled policy committee meeting the public comment period will provide an opportunity for formal public feedback to inform potential changes to the proposed policy and so I just want to point out that in a week and a half ago on July 7th we had a policy committee meeting and I was informed ahead of time

[03:34:00]
by staff policy analyst that I could not introduce policy a draft of free policies because it had to come to this body the full board for a majority vote to proceed with the development of new policy but according to this language it also applies to a review or a revision of current policies so I'm suggesting that we're getting ahead of ourselves we need to slow down and approve according to the policy the governance manual approve by majority vote that these revisions both 8.1 and 8.2

[03:35:00]
being proceed to the policy committee for a first meeting read thank you member Dominguez are there any responses to that or other questions so my understanding is that this is being revised as a simple strike because there was uncertainty among all some board members as to what this policy meant and this is not a new policy this is an amendment to a policy and if you read further down within the board governance manual it says under second meeting number three an amendment will not

[03:36:00]
choir that the policy go through an additional reading unless the policy committee chair or board president determines that the amendment needs further study and that an additional reading would be desirable this is a simple Amendment meant to clarify language this is this is this should be just a simple yes or no so that we can move on and start talking about student outcomes you remember Jackson any other comments or questions I have a comment remember don't worry just to clarify what board member Jackson stated she said some members so I don't know how the sum or who that was I know I wasn't part of that so I don't know if the sum means the executive committee that

[03:37:00]
not some members made the decision so I was clear that this decision was made between me and Council and he cancel proposed the language so there was no discussion with the executive committee or anyone else it was proposed Language by counsel to strike a sentence in the consent agenda to clarify period so I do want to I'm sorry guys so board member from the paragraph on the second meeting but we haven't even been through the first meeting and so I'm going to go back to the introductory paragraph

[03:38:00]
the board member Dominguez we all have the government's manual in front of us again just to reiterate the process is the Amendments do not have to go through the full board it's similar to the amendment that we're about to make in the other one it's was intended to be on the consent agenda intended to improve clarify processes in our governance manual not intended to be an in-depth conversation so it was removed from consent so we can have a conversation you've stated what your question and concern are and I hear you based on my interpretation the staffs interpretation and councils interpretation this is not the type of amendment that needs to go through three reads so if there is agreement that is the type of amendment that needs to go through three reads then we will not approve it here and we will send it to the policy committee or determine how it gets addressed otherwise so I'm confused

[03:39:00]
because we do have a governance manual that is very clear the board May develop review and revise any government's policy established by the board through a majority vote of the members that's what we're doing but where where is the 30-day public input if we're skipping a new policy I don't then we need we need to review or we need to revise the governor's manual to say that but that's not what the governance manual says and it seems so I'm I'm struck what's the work around that's being accomplished here because I'm that is not what is written in

[03:40:00]
thank you are there any additional questions or discussion all right so we do have emotion and a second I mean we'll move to and you have that documented so we'll go ahead and move to a roll call on this agenda item Josefina Dominguez no just to help you yes other than you do this yes Courtney Jackson yes Ronaldo's yes

[03:41:00]
our next agenda item is to consider approval of revisions to section 4 M8 of the Board of Education governance manual we have available to answer questions Jessica Martinez our policy analyst as well as Dr Christy Albright the coordinator of board Services is there a motion and a second to consider approval of this agenda item I move we approve revision to section 4 and 8 of the aps Board of Education governance manuals is member Jackson this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and a second is there any discussion or questions

[03:42:00]
yeah Courtney Jackson yes Ronaldo no vanilla store again Gonzalez yes we will move on to the next item on our agenda which is discussion items and so for this we have an update from the new board member onboarding ad hoc committee this committee is vice president and secretary Janelle Astoria and so our presenter for this agenda item is membership okay thank you so you all should have received a proposed APS school board member onboarding training this is was developed between myself and board member of storegga and is meant to be the onboarding training that new board members will receive after they are elected in November

[03:43:00]
so the time frame for this is you know essentially November 5th I think elections are November 4th November 5th and January 1st so what this is meant to address our concerns that we heard over the past couple of years about maybe incomplete onboarding and some statements about what may be like a wish we were in wish we was included kind of thing so I will not read through this with the assumption that everybody already has but just to give a top-level understanding the first portion of it is is pretty brief it is a kind of a re-introduction and a red discussion of student outcomes Focus governance the Assumption here is that any new board members have already

[03:44:00]
attended both the community training being held on July 30th at 5:30 p.m. in the John Milne boardroom Noah and that they have also attended the candidate training that will be held on August 12th at 5:00 p.m. in the John Milne Community boardroom so that they have already have a deep understanding of that then we will move on and to why governance matters and this kind of goes to what board members store go was saying earlier about kind of an understanding of what the difference is between governance and management and what are what are roles are as far as do we do we get into the Weeds on things or do we kind of stay top-level so an in-depth discussion of that including our roles and responsibilities then we go to a

[03:45:00]
45 minutes where we really try to dive into the manuals and materials and the calendars and the tools that we use on a daily basis including the governance manual the implementation timeline what the difference is between interim goals and guardrails how legal considerations who who who who talks to miss Marty and and how do we bring things up so a real in-depth discussion about that then we moved to APS board member 101 which is you know introduction to to diligent what is let's talk what is our community engagement calendar orientation and important dates and timelines then we go to a wrap up and next steps and then conclude with some action items including for them to review the calendars and the manuals there's also an opportunity which I skipped was for all of the cabinet members to have

[03:46:00]
I have an opportunity to get in front of the new board members to give them an overview of what their departments do and including a frequently asked questions to school so that is kind of an overview and we are we or I am happy to accept acept accept suggestions revisions or take questions thank you very much for your work on the committee on behalf of the full board Dr all right did we receive any proposed amendments changes suggestions in the Q&A period related to this without looking them up I don't remember there being any of them so we didn't have any suggestions submitted in advance but we have had additional time to look through

[03:47:00]
Bradley is there any reactions feedback or suggestions that you'd like to offer to the committee and this is just a discussion item so we won't be voting on this number period how much time we need to take to do all of this second is I just feel it needs more practical to where its I see everything as a guidance and a guideline I just feel that there needs to be more input about I know there's what what's the success stories or whatever about board members sharing their stories I think that there needs to be something in there that they recognize

[03:48:00]
I work and what have been some positives or just to cite what is the bored what do we do what are some of the expectations we didn't recognize when we first came on the other thing is I know where that they at least review a board meeting and understand the process and how that works many times they may see it but they don't see it from the outside about what we really do in the board meeting and some discussions because I know you have Robert's Rules and orders in there but I think insane a board meeting and understanding the process but I also think with our goals and guard rails also mentioning how each department has furthered taking those goals and guard rails and into putting them in every Department that they recognize how important this is as they're moving forward because it's connected to everything

[03:49:00]
so I think the community engagement piece really needs to be identified more I know we do have the engagement versus Outreach events showing it and their responsibilities for attending those engagements and some of the prior work that goes into those because I don't think that stressed enough about how much work goes into contacts and information and all of those particulars we do I'm trying to prepare for events because it's a lot of time and I don't think that's understood a lot but I think the work and then how does that work whether you're working or if you're at home yeah it's just a matter of how you're going to dedicate that time anyway that's all I need to say thank you member any other suggestions yes remember me

[03:50:00]
on your last page important dates and requirements you have the first bullet nmsba training first week of December I suggest adding February law conference spring Regional Conference or meeting July Leadership Retreat fall Regional Conference and I think that's it so just instead of just the the first training like flush out the whole calendar like a Year's worth of events question okay I'll go after you okay so I was calculating the amount of

[03:51:00]
that was given to each section for the onboarding and it looks like it's about you know close to 3 hours but in 15 minutes 25 minutes 30 minute intervals and this is a lot of information for new board members to get and I don't know if that's enough time and I'm not saying it should be a three-day training but I think that you know 15 minutes for governance in versus management roles and responsibilities 15 minutes is nothing so I think maybe we should expand that a little bit if possible thank you I'll just offer that was going to be my feedback as well I actually wasn't expecting to have a flow of time with specific minute increments so my suggestion was going to be like just cut those because this is a list of the content that we need and then we figure out how foreign follows function so this is the content we need then we figure out how to schedule it or

[03:52:00]
the state statute for those training requirements that they are what 10 hours for the first year and then 5 proceeding afterwards that that is noted that they do have requirements that they have to that they're obligated to get done and yeah and that will also be presented at the candidate board training as well so it'll hopefully be the second time that that's heard any additional questions or recommendations I just have a comment that I think it's very comprehensive yes thank you so the charge to this ad hoc committee was to

[03:53:00]
hear this recommendation so you do have some feedback and so we will not dissolve the committee yet until you've integrated the feedback but as I said this is not an action item it's discussion so the committee will go and integrate that feedback and then work with board services to carry forward and then the committee will be dissolved so we'll move on to agenda item 10 which is the president's report so we'll start with public forum although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that you were heard and that the administration and the board are working together on resolutions some of the issues that we heard tonight were regarding Community engagement Children's Health and well-being as well as the RFP process I'd also like to speak now and briefly address some recent concerns that were raised by a fellow board member regarding the role of actions of the executive committee and the board president so there was an assertion that we acted outside the authority granted by the aps governance manual and that

[03:54:00]
has been taken by the executive committee has been fully aligned with the responsibilities outlined in the manual including coordination of board operations agenda setting and the handling of routine matters that do not require board action these functions are not only permitted they are essential to ensuring that this board spends its valuable time where it matters most which is monitoring student outcomes in line with board guard real number two there have been no changes made to board policy no overreach into superintendent responsibilities and not decisions made outside of the governance framework what has occurred is routine governance things like clarifying communication strategies reviewing poster design talking about fonts and colors and accuracy and ensuring that board resources board resources are used both equitably and responsibly just a reminder to that we as a board adopted the student outcomes focused governance model together and with that it's a commitment to stay focused on students together

[03:55:00]
all of us to continue honoring that commitment to student outcomes by working through the appropriate channels respecting the roles that each that we've agreed to as a board and staying grounded in our shared mission to serve the students and families of APs that concludes the president's report and the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday August 6th 2025 at 5 p.m. here in Dallas and Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live stream to aps.com edu our next agenda item you're not done guys is to consider approval for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the public meetings act to discuss strategy for collective bargaining negotiations as allowed under Section 10-15-19 is there a motion and a second to convenient to Executive session for us to convenient to Executive session thank you sir our second we have a motion from evertop and a second from remember benavidez
