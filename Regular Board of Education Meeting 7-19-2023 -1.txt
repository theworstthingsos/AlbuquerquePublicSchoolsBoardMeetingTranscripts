Your Service Center thank you is here to assist you Mr Gonzalez maybe have our first Speaker first and only speaker tonight is in person and it is Laura fashion you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking into the microphone all right thank you my name is Laura fashion I have a daughter who is a rising senior at Albuquerque High she attended both Coronado Elementary School in Washington Middle School I'm speaking today against making Coronado K through 8 school and instead of asking you to put those resources into the existing Middle School by lingual programs including the program at Washington my daughter did well at Coronado and we were lucky that it was close to our home and we could get her to school there but when she was in 5th grade she told my husband and me that she was not sure she wanted to continue in the bilingual program in middle school but we insisted Washington Middle School

[00:06:00]
who is our neighborhood School in the bilingual program there was a big reason we wanted our daughter to go Washington changed our daughter's view of her bilingual education and made her proud of her ability to speak Spanish she started feeling at ease speaking at it speaking it and she and her friends even spoke it outside the classroom the principal at Coronado when my daughter was there always said that the ideal bilingual program would have close to 50% native Spanish speakers and 50% native English speakers because kids learn from each other Washington came closer to having that mix and really made a big difference in my daughter for my daughter she has told me that the strongest relationships that she's had with teachers was with her bilinguals teachers at Washington if you make Coronado a magnet school for middle school as well as Elementary School you will suck even more resources and students and violin teachers away from Washington the kids that have Spanish speaking parents at home need the bilingual program at Washington in the kids like my daughter who have English speaking parents at home also

[00:07:00]
I need a bilingual program like the one at Washington my daughter just scored a five on her AP Spanish exam she expects to receive the bilingual seal on her diploma when she graduates and she hopes to study abroad during college in a Spanish-speaking country Washington was key to her success thank you thank you ma'am and remember that completes public forum for this evening thank you so much too our speaker who came tonight for taking time to come here and share your thoughts on that appreciate you you being here tonight so we're going to move on with our agenda his public forum is an opportunity for us to listen to you okay so before we move on its like our first item is going to be about students focused governance and I just want to say something to the board members before we get started really excited about our agenda tonight because on the student outcomes Focus governance one of the goals that we have for ourselves is to have about 50% of our conversation focused

[00:08:00]
I'm really proud of us for getting us to this point to where we are so our next item for discussion is consideration for approval of the monitoring calendar for student outcomes goals and guardrails and this is going to be Dr Bowman and Chris West I believe you're going to present the monitoring calendar so I think before we get to the presentation on this what I'd like to do is like do I have a motion for this and second we'll go into discussion afterwards or do we want to just wait to for the presentation first motion to accept the calendar and guard rails

[00:09:00]
all right so before we do that let's go ahead and have our presentation really quickly cuz I know that it was sent off to all of us and I don't know if there's any discussion does anyone have any questions for our presenters or presenters is there anything else you want to stay so I guess it's just really briefly what the goal here was to produce kind of a rotating calendar that we could follow for 5 years or just like every year it's the same where we will do goals in a particular order and then we have the interims and I know that's kind of our best shot at it and all this our goal is to you know start and then learn if we need to make changes is there any discussion or questions just to clarifying question and it's kind of log

[00:10:00]
call like who owns it where does it live and I asked that because the monitoring guidance says that it should include all board trainings and board Community listening sessions so as we're going to nmsba or to continue listening sessions is that like Miss King emails Dr Bowman and he puts it on there like how does that logistically happen I mean that's a great question I'm not quite sure what the responses to that because we've just got calendar Dr Bowman do you have some think that to that well let me try to answer a little bit of that and then doctor Bowman will clean up what I say but when our first iteration of this really was just the monetary and it was nothing more than this goal this month this gold this month we met with Ashley went over the she coached in to adding more columns okay so what I believe is that we can add those trainings into either we had another column or we figure out a place inside one of the existing columns to add those trainings she would like to see all of that in there and so we weren't able to add that

[00:11:00]
add those sort of things you could add my evaluation day so you can add all those sort of things that you like in there this was what Dr Bowman and his team could control and then miss King did actually go in and add quite a bit she did a lot of work on it and it looked a lot better so happy to add more as requested and I would assume then that it's probably going to rest with us in the board office because this is a calendar that if there's if there's changes that are communicated across the Departments or cross everyone for sure it's got arrested in the board office so that we know those dates and we can we can keep those we can keep at least the information about that but it seems like it's got to live in lots of different places but at the end of the day it should have liked its final point of contact with the board office so that we could just make sure that we can always go back and just make sure that the calendar is that we're all looking at the same one and I'm

[00:12:00]
cabinet so there's an opportunity for her to always There's an opportunity for communication at that point to bring it up it's not like Miss King is separated from the senior cabinet level so thanks for that that was a I think superintendent you absolutely got it and thanks for asking that logistic question and board member board president this in my head this was the boards office and of course myself and and Chris have access to the board office so we can provide her back that way and then it's the board would like to add things to it is very available thanks and I also understand that on a continuous quality improvement cycle that there's an opportunity to always look at so

[00:13:00]
for what we have but some things could change I mean things could to get disrupted some way we don't know or there's a need to change that but what we have right now and this is really helpful for the community is to see like when is that going to be coming up and when is it going to be discussed or that guardrail because that might be it not not might be but it will be an opportunity for Community that's interested in that particular report or that particular outcome that we're looking at to either just to look at it to watch our calendar to watch the board meeting and even before the board meeting to just look at the particular monitoring Port so I do want to say to the board tonight is just practice so you didn't get the monitoring report ahead of time on purpose because we want it to have that first look at it all together as a district and and we'll talk about that when we get to that to that point because that's actually our next item but

[00:14:00]
what we have now before us is just we've got a motion and we've got a second to approve this calendar go ahead board member I just have a quick question when you decided which goal to put in September and October and November and January how did you come to that decision was it based on when you received data for each I'm just making that assumption president was only cover one goal per month right and then in order to do that we made sure that the data would be available so we will see the data that will be presenting to you some of it will come in early or time and turns out of our operational work but we'll bring it to you all at one time so that way like I will tell you that I had one and two together so math and early literacy for the guys that we received that would be a very lengthy board

[00:15:00]
and all the things that were doing to make sure that our students are going through 888 and being proficient in math so that they were split up together and then they have been shared with folks internally so that they also know kind of like I did try to make sure there was a Cadence okay thank you I just want to say thank you cuz I know that it was a lot to figure out how to pull that and then you know also put it into a Cadence over five years and you know I appreciate your patience with us too cuz I know we had to we're kind of pressing on it but I know we also had to wait for how things are going to work with the with you guys in terms of operation so I really appreciate the work that you've done and also just the guidance that you were willing to listen to I know

[00:16:00]
I know she provided some guidance as we were moving along with that so that we could make sure that we got to this point so next time board members when we evaluate ourselves we get to check this off on our evaluation that we got it done so lots of good things that are happening there so hopefully we didn't stress you guys out too much and I'm looking forward to it so thank you so much all right you want to add or trainings that's what it says in the document is there anything okay not a problem is there anything else you what we have not added Community listening session well and we're going to talk about that because that would be the community engagement committee once we have all that then we can add things absolutely okay thank you

[00:17:00]
so we could get those pieces in so we can communicate it with the District staff and what's happening once we have the community engagement listing sessions and a plan set up for that will certainly add that into their but I also get the impression from sosg anyway is that everything that we're looking at is a continuous quality improvement we have to be willing to take a look at things and adjust ourselves as we're going along it's not like this is it and it's all you know it can be a little bit mushy on purpose because we want to to be able to sort of add and remove things as we know things can come up I mean we're all human this is a district but for the most part we at least have some things that we know are set in stone things that we can follow and it gives a good Cadence it'll help us as board members too because we'll all be prepared ahead of time

[00:18:00]
Applebee's prepared ahead of time knowing when that particular girl is going to come up because everybody I'm sure is assigned to a particular goal or guardrail and so knowing when you have to be ready if November is your month you'll be ready for November or whatever as we go through the hole through the whole process that's absolutely what's happening so now that we have this calendar there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are going to be changing what they're doing to make sure that we are able to meet the presentation of the internal monitoring and just to foreshadow the next month we already know that it is has a lot of room to improve looking for that but we even with the room to improve there's this calendar and the The Guidance with the presentations of the girls in the worlds a lot of folks inside the district are now like they know when they're timelines are in their kind of backwards

[00:19:00]
and getting that stuff in place and another thing sessions are also important too but we didn't have that information and we don't have that yet because that's on us on the board the board's responsible for the community listening sessions and so we we don't have those done it but we will have a plan pretty soon coming forward with that and then also I do know that one of the other plans with this is that this calendar will also be part of our website so there's an opportunity for it to be up there as well so that people can see what what the calendar is as we're moving forward that's the guidance that we're getting all so is just to make it available but with that also knowing that it's probably going to have to be as it's being adjusted or there's being updates just like any website I think we do that all the time with things that just need to be updated or amended so all right any other discussions

[00:20:00]
hey Google Erica yes Danielle Gonzales Robert Peterson yes Crystal all right so our next item practice progress monitoring so we're going to take a stab at this and this is her first practice session with a real guardrail that we have before we get started I just want to remind the board that it's going to be important for us to be kind of in this good mindset of we're all learning at the same time so there's there's not going to be anybody's going to be perfect at this we're not going to be perfect at it and our district team is definitely prepared to know that they're not going to be perfect at this either and so hopefully through tonight what we you know what we can get a sign of a

[00:21:00]
even take back and forth with each other so that we can make this process really valuable the next time we go around because guess what even the next go-around is not going to be perfect we're still going to be in the loop of continuous quality improvement and so when we come back and visit this goal this guard rail again you know several months from now there's probably going to be room for improvement again and I I would guarantee that what the team is looking for is opportunities and ways to enhance this report also want to remind everybody that the importance of this report to is not just for us it's all for the community so when we're looking at this and we're developing these reports and we're putting these out we need to make sure that it's all so something that the community can read and understand so I think Ashley is with us I don't actually if you want to have any opening other comments here or things that we need to say but we're ready to get started and Ashley

[00:22:00]
pause with Council great City Schools is going to lead us through our process and just you know the context again this is one of those pieces it's the next step in the student outcomes Focus governance it's actually the most important step I wouldn't say it's the most important I think there's everything can be the most important thing but this is the one where we actually hold our accountability in terms of looking at the things that we said we would do and then taking that step to look in and review the outcomes in terms of the progress we're making on a particular guard rail or goal so Ashley I will turn it over to you first because I think we were going to start with you and you're going to facilitate us through the process yeah so first of all congratulations to this entire governing team for adopting your monitoring calendar and officially tonight you were beginning to implement your Cadence of accountability and that's all

[00:23:00]
that's what we call progress monitoring it is it is truly an ongoing cycle of accountability both for from the board to the superintendent but also from the board to the community as you know the reason school boards exist is to represent the vision and values of the community you did that by adopting the goals in the guard rails and now you're going on to the next phase by actually monitoring progress toward achieving those those those priorities so whenever a board begins to implement a progress monitoring process it's really important for us to go through a few Cycles just having what we call practice monitoring sessions so these are low risk low risk opportunities to have conversations and it is really an iterative process

[00:24:00]
which has been identified a few times already tonight this is all about continuous Improvement tonight's conversation is going to be clunky it's going to be messy you're not going to get all the questions quite right and so that is expected and so I want to go ahead and just put that out there that this is all about practicing and and bringing along Grace and as you practice what monitoring actually looks like so in as I mentioned in an email that I sent to you all previously these practice sessions are all about collaboration and continuous Improvement this is a chance for the board to learn what to look for in an effective monitoring report and it's an opportunity for the staff to learn from the board what they're looking for as they continue with monitoring what is presented tonight

[00:25:00]
it is simply a place to start the conversation and to really set expectations around how this document can live and grow and be the most informative for you and your community each month so please be vocal about what you need to see to best inform you along the way this is as Yolanda mentioned this is as much for you all as it is for the people who maybe watching it at home or who may be curious 3 months down the road what's the board doing on this they can actually come back and watch this session and actually learn that information so it is really important for the board to spend the majority of their time focusing on strategy related questions we will do that so the product kind of the the order that things will go in tonight we will first actually

[00:26:00]
look at the report together we will talk about about the report and ensure that it has all of the elements that are needed for a high-quality gold monitoring report then we will turn it over to Dr Bowman and his team as they talked about what the report actually says they'll give a full presentation of the report and then next will open the floor for questions from board members and we're really going to interrogate those questions so you'll ask it a question and then we'll stop and we will actually I will ask you a couple of questions about the what you just asked and so along the lines of is this a technical question is this a tactical question is this a strategic question and is this actually getting to the root of what you're trying to understand and so that's that's really what this entire process is about and then finally we will talk about

[00:27:00]
the process of actually accepting the report when the conversation is over so tonight you're not actually going to be accepting anything cuz this is just a practice session but in the future you will actually be accepting the monitoring reports so we will actually talk about what that will look like as well so without if there are any other questions before we move on and look at the report I will open the door for them are there any questions going forward I think we're good Ashley I think everybody's we're all prepared we're ready okay great so before the president before the presentation begins board chair it's important for you to ask the question of your colleagues does anyone have evidence that this report does not meet the four qualifications that are outlined in the guidance document that you were

[00:28:00]
the goal that is being monitored at both the goal and the answer from goal does it clearly show the data that's being monitored does it have the superintendents interpretation of what the data says so is it on track off track approaching focus and then if it is off track or approaching is there evidence that supports the superintendent's interpretation into plan for how to get you back on track with the directions to go so I will turn it over to you president and let you know that question does anyone have any evidence of this report not meeting those four key criteria I can't remember them off the top of my head I'm trying to get my page called up but does anyone have any and it's important actually because

[00:29:00]
we all just got the report so it's really difficult for us to be in that mode immediately I mean so take your time should we just go like one question at a time so if we say does it clearly show what's being monitored the goal interpretation yeah go through one question at a time so first of all does it show does it clearly show which goal and

[00:30:00]
consider as a wraparound that I think that's a qualifying question because if the interim right now is the number of school and our community based wrap around support it all schools when maintain or increase from 373.59 funded nurses and counselors in May 2023 to May 2026 yeah so right now the question on the floor is simply is are the elements literally on the report so for for the first question is the goal or guard real parents I think that it's pretty clear it's their the guardrail is at the top of the page and then for each of the different interim guard rails they are written down as well so so yes it would be the next question is does it clearly show the data that's being monitored

[00:31:00]
hey it maybe does because looking at my effective gold monitoring sheet it says that it's supposed to show data for the three previous reporting periods and it does not unless I'm missing something but I'm not seeing I see I definitely see data and I see even where data points are missing the reason why they're missing but it does not clearly show data yeah that's actually an excellent question of board member Jackson so for the one where data exists it does clearly show that data and for the two were the data hasn't been collected yet it provides an explanation of why it's not there and a plan for how for when that data can be expected and how it will be reported

[00:32:00]
practice report that is sufficient you know if you get 6 months down the road and you still don't have data then I would I would maybe lean into the question a little bit harder but for the purpose of tonight's conversation that's actually exactly where I would expect to be now it does you brought up a good point that there it is missing the previous year's information perhaps that would be a question to direct to the the administration team right now or after we've answered the four yeah right now when can we expect to have data from the previous year three period

[00:33:00]
I think I like I'm looking to interim Garfield 1.2 where it says the data point will be available once we analyze the data collected from the schools because right now there's an ex so when can we anticipate that that data point will be available so you're asking for interim guardrail 1.122 not necessarily on 1.1% on 1.1 we don't have previous data either correct okay yeah one so the the two that 1.2 and 1.3 don't have data yet so this is just looking at in terms interim guard rail 1.1 and so does the does the data exist that could be one question or if it's not there when can we expect to have it so I think we're going to focus just on one point one and you're asking for the three previous periods I think we didn't

[00:34:00]
include it because we thought this was the first time and we just didn't include it we can certainly include it next time and so we've learned something tonight so the other two collection points with we collect that data will be able to plug those numbers in I think we anticipate September or October on those data points being available to us if I remember correctly you can correct me if I'm wrong but those are that's not what she asked you specifically asked what about the three data points at that time we just didn't put them in we can get those that actually on our monitoring calendar for July it says that we are measuring 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 so it might be looking at all three of those were not just looking at one point one for tonight right now in the conversation we're just looking at one point oh okay so we're focusing on the one

[00:35:00]
1.1 because it's the only one that has data 1.2 1.3 don't have data yet okay and they do tell us why I mean and also just kind of tell on ourselves again before we even get started too much which is that we've been advised that in our future monitoring report should have only one kind of this the conversation about 1.1 or 1.2 or 1.2 which are we talking about in the future we will have one for document and then we can talk about it Ashley do you want to do you want me to move to the next or

[00:36:00]
anyone else have another question on this particular so we know we don't have the previous data it is available learning moment teachable moment all of us were you know they just were all learning so but we know that that data is available so this might go to to Ashley so we have the monitoring can't calendar that says in July we're going to do guard rail one which we are and then it does have and then I know Dr Bowman kind of explain about the interim guard rails so if we are monitoring in July and this is just a practice monitoring system okay I have a question about the does it clearly show the target reporting periods annual targets and deadlines targets

[00:37:00]
I'm not sure that there's targets or well period will increase from $373.59 but it doesn't say to what by when and what not working for me another question which I had emails in advance so the guardrail is the superintendent will not allow the district operate with inequitable distribution of school or Community Based resources so we don't want to be inequitable based on our student population but if you increase resources at every school or

[00:38:00]
previously existed however that is and so I think to me it seems in order to ensure Equity you need to reallocate some resource you may need to be allocate some resources so it may mean that some schools based on the student population May indeed lose a resource so I can answer that question Madam chair and hold on hold on one second I'm going to I'm going to step in that is an excellent question board member Gonzalez I want you to hold it until after the presentation has been done but I'd like for you to I would like for you to ask that question again afterwards but right now we're just just understanding whether the data is there or not okay

[00:39:00]
the the next question is does it show the superintendent's interpretation of the data so is it on track off track or approaching says it's on track because we don't have two data points to show if it's on track we just have one data point right now so I see your evaluation is there superintendent that it is on track but I guess this goes back to the number two is the date is not there

[00:40:00]
the guardrail is to maintain the 373.59 and they're at 373 you know 0.59 I guess I'm just trying to play Both Sides here so is it on track because it is on that level which they said they would maintain I mean because I understand board member Gonzales is question because I have a lot of questions too but just on the Merit of what they said is it on that I mean we might find out later that it's not because we have to ask them questions if I could put president okay we won't know until we get to the next appointment

[00:41:00]
we can't we can't we can't start where we weren't all right it's got to start where we are now okay so hence there won't be any interpretation is that correct if there's a if there's a baseline there is if that's what we're establishing we should not expect an interpretation so right now the question is is it present and there is an interpretation present the now the I would so will save the questions about the interpretation for after the presentation has been given but there is literally an interpretation whether or not you agree with the interpretation or there's evidence of interpretation is a different story but there is literally is there

[00:42:00]
and it's and for all of them it's showing on track so that kind of leaves the 4th the 4th question about an Evidence and a plan if you're off track it kind of with that that's really an unnecessary question okay so let me make sure so on track so we have we have all of the things we've all the questions and does it have an interpretation of the data and so does it have the data is the answer is generally no for for that one my so this is an opportunity to talk about what happens in real life when you actually begin real monitoring you will be receiving

[00:43:00]
this report well in advance you received the report well in advance so that you can one look at look at it and ask questions beforehand really those Technical and tactical questions that help you understand how something was measured how something was done who was measured asking those questions in advance is it's going to help the staff be able to flush out what is actually being presented in the report and I did lie before the in the future when you receive the reports in advance you can actually raise those questions beforehand before you get to the board meeting and the monitoring session and you can say okay I see this data but it's not entirely clear for me and so you can really begin that iterative process of improving the report from the moment that you receive it and that actually positions you and

[00:44:00]
you have to be able to continue the conversation in the board meeting with everything present okay so I think we can move on to the presentation of this particular monitoring reporting this way okay well let me step back from the reason we started that way is because those questions would have come to you before you got here we would have asked those three questions and we would have shot out and said it doesn't it seems to be missing some data or whatever and then you all would have had an opportunity to respond get

[00:45:00]
back and then come back tonight and we would start we would start from there so we're not starting from there so it's a little bit wonky so go ahead and go you're on for president will not allow the district to operate with an equitable distribution of school and their support systems for internal 1.1 we probably have to find the number of school and her community based around support at all schools in Maine or increase from 37.59 funded nurses and counselors

[00:46:00]
play 2023 to May 2026 and our first presentation of data what we're showing here is we do have a bar chart but does show a breakdown of our number of nurse ft by that when you full-time equivalent nurses so do remember that we have some nurses that announcers that might not be a full one as in that they have a full-time position with the school or they may be spread out among multiple School site locations so while it may look weird to see something like two 4 2 2. 0 9 9

[00:47:00]
09 answer ft which is gives us our total for that Baseline of 373.59 as part of this guard rail we are and I have my wonderful colleague with me Dr Muir who is going to talk about specifically talk about three things for each guardrail and by this I mean the interim government excuse me and we're going to say what is going well followed by what is not going well and then we're excited to talk about what we're going to do in our next steps so at this point I would like to give conversation so Madam president members of the board superintendent Elder I'm going to take you through the three interim guard rails in those questions so the first question was what is going well so for the interim 1.1 which is the number of nurses and counseling FTE what is going well

[00:48:00]
right now in the district and is 100% of our schools have a nurse or a counselor allocation it may not be a full-time it's dependent but they all have one at least one some have more than one School nurses are assigned to schools via a nursing Equity model and which is responsive to the health and wellness needs of each student so even though you may have a small number of students in a school they may be allocated to 1. 0

[00:49:00]
players on a ratio so we look at the number of students per counselor and allocate that way but then it's also added in if an equity model to look at the needs at each specific school so again A small school may have a full-time counselor whereby the student numbers they would only necessarily be allocated 0.5 or and so we look at both the ratio and that Equity model for the allocation of how we do counseling and nursing nursing is not 100% it's it is 100% based on a medical model we're canceling does look at a ratio plus an equity model and how they are set in the schools some other things are going well APS requires nursing and counseling services in all schools so we we do require that it is there that you must have nursing and you must have counseling so we do not have any school

[00:50:00]
without those Services present in our schools nurses and counselors are provided professional development based on current best practices and state and National standards so they are giving multiple professional developments throughout the school year not just the one PD that happens at the beginning of the school year and it's based on what do they need to know a good example is the pandemic we did a lot of training with both nurses and counselors after the after we came back in person so that they could deal with the needs of the students that may have Arisen because of them being virtually for a year so that's just an example of the kinds of things and we looked at Best Practices looked at the national standards and they are giving those kinds of training throughout the school year okay so I'm going to move down to 1.22%

[00:51:00]
do you have access to Social and emotional programming and some of the things that are going well there the district does have a robust data system that allows staff to access students their targeted populations and their levels of attendance so they can look at those for early warning systems and those types of things so this guard will must have this messed up yeah I was going to say that paragraph above is 1.221 so I'm going to switch over which is on the next page to 1.3 the SEL programs in the districts are making it difficult we have I'm going to the wrong thing sorry I must not have a space in between here so if you go to what's 1.00 I apologize districts are for 1.2 in the SEL information

[00:52:00]
and we do have a core team that is comprised of multiple departments that's looking at SEL and how we can move that dial and as a reminder in a planning year so we're looking at those types of things the schools have taken a lot of initiative to implement and trained staff in SEL programs the core team we were awarded a Kellogg Grant so we're going to be able to do some things with the with the core team and with the schools will be looking at visiting places that are doing really good things around seal and doing some site visits and figuring out how we can take that information back to APS for going to be looking at a Pilot or looking at 12:00 in a cluster of schools to see over the five years of that will make a difference if they're using the same program Elementary

[00:53:00]
the same type of culture and programming that they're coming to on Panorama is coming on board and that's going well right now we're working on on bringing them on board so we'll have some real-time data that we can utilize with them in 1.3 and that's the guardrail around average daily attendance rates of the Aussie Martinez decision and plus the African-American students who have been identified as chronically absent by September 30th will increase by 5% points by the end of each year so things that are going well right now the district does have a robust data system so we're very fortunate that we collect all of that data we still contract so average daily attendance have established attendance teams so every school in our district has an attendance team that works on Sundays the district

[00:54:00]
has host a tenants conferences and I believe we just had one recently so we do attendance conferences throughout the year for our schools and and that's going really well we partner with many many outside agencies to and groups to do that schools have been trained and received coaching around attendance best practices all schools develop and Implement an annual attendance plan that is a had requirement and we review those plans and before they're submitted health and wellness and sat team supports students with the tenants challenges some of our counselors are implementing attendance interventions they chose specific students that they target with attendance problems multiple School staff including the nurses counselors the attendance team members are all trained and how to access the data that they need so that they can Target and look at root causes for the right children to help them with their

[00:55:00]
needs and the district does has an attendance core team so we have a core team that's working on this also at the district level to look at how what's going on what do we need to do what supports the schools needs and how are we going to help them with this and in New Mexico we do have a very comprehensive attendance law that does provide a lot of direction for us and so we're we're very fortunate to have the attendance for Success after a lot of Direction and put in some of those requirements that I mentioned earlier like having attendance teams having attendance plans it's all part of the law but in our school district we make sure that that happens so those are all things that are going really well so then what is not going so well there are some things that aren't going well and I missed these two they didn't get on here right so 1.1 is the first

[00:56:00]
add a bullet 1.2 is a second and 1.3 is the third set of bullets there so there's a shortage for 1.1 of nurses and counselors It's a national shortage that's not going well and we sow and then another thing is nursing and counselors are not part of the funding formula and so APS is made the decision that we're going to fund them in the way the only thing that state law says is that we have to have them but it doesn't say how many we have to have that type of thing so they're not part of the funding formula and because of that 50% we are using some soft money to fund nurses and counselors that's going okay but it's soft funding so for example 50% of all of our nurses are funded off to softening so we if we didn't have the soft funding we would lose half of our nurses in the district for 1

[00:57:00]
there are too many SEL programs out there it's a scattergram right now and it becomes very difficult that doesn't mean they're not going well in the schools but it becomes difficult from the district level to support them all we don't have somebody assigned every SEL program that every school has decided to use not enough of or staff awareness I'm sorry and the district level staff that can support SEL some of them are part of the Ursa Cliff so that's something that it's fine this year but it could be a future problem as we lose some support staff in 1.3 for 10 minutes there is inconsistency and teachers and substitutes logging attendance daily and so when that happens we don't get the right number and we can't get the right students so we have to know who's there and who's not there to to do that not enough staff

[00:58:00]
are aware of community resources that are out there so when they identify root causes for attendance they may not know where to refer and so that's that's not going great right now not all School attendance teams are fully functional or me consistently every school has one but not everyone is fully functional and not everyone has a consistent time that they meet and School attendance plans are not always aligned to the mlss and or 90-day plan so other plans in the school they should be aligning their attendance plans to those also so what are our next steps look very closely especially at what's not going well as we identified where we need to go and what our next steps are so when one point one we are we are making request to continue

[00:59:00]
do you support a funding so we may be coming in front of you if we hit a cliff of some kind to say how do we continue this funding so that we don't drop the number of nurses that we already have the number of counselors that we already have and to continue that that become that is a priority for the district to continue the stuff to eat that we have advocating at the state to fund and promote grow your own programs it's a problem that we don't have enough nurses and counselors out there and we're robbing Peter to pay Paul and nursing because especially nursing they work in the hospitals they can work in outside agencies so and we compete with other school districts also for nursing and counseling we have lots of neighboring school districts so we need to grow your own program so that's something that we can look forward to to maybe advocated the state level to do some grow your own programs like we do

[01:00:00]
how do we do that we want to continue to ramp up our recruitment efforts and so some of the examples of that would be be present at all the aps job fairs and make sure that we're there and make sure that they know that nursing and counseling is going to be there at those job fairs that it's not just other staff in the district that we're looking for but we're also looking for those staff too they actually got a new nurse at our last job period teaching a class of 2012 students that are in the field of might be an area that they might want to come so she's teaching a class at UNM and promoting counseling to students that are going into the counseling field we are going

[01:01:00]
to be designing and distributing recruitment brochures that are very specific to these job rules so it's not just recruiting people to come to APS but what does it mean to be a school nurse what does it mean to be a school counselor and my why might you want to do that we're going to continue we do have some internship programs for nurses and counselors and we're going to continue those programs and so and probably try to ramp them up work with some other universities that are training nurses and counselors because even though they might go to New Mexico Highlands and not the Albuquerque the student might live in Albuquerque been so to set up with those kinds of schools to say you can come to your internship here in Albuquerque and see what it's like in 1.22 I mentioned that we got the Kellogg Grant we're going to start planning and

[01:02:00]
in other school districts not just in the state but one or two out of state and then looking at those best practices and bringing it back and saying how can we Implement what others are doing that's working the SEL core team will continue to meet regularly throughout the planning year right now we're meeting weekly so we meet every week to plan and to to figure out where we need to go we will be presenting recommendations to the board around funding and SEL for years to through five years we get a clip on some staffing and determine what SEO programs can be supported and how to articulate them K-12 so we've done some surveys already of principals what's out there and we're going to look at all of the scattergram of SEL programs and figure out what can we support from the district level and communicate that out

[01:03:00]
1.3 and attendance we're going to produce the 88 data at the end of September because right now we don't have that that will be account at the end of September and then the attendance quarantine is also going to continue to meet on a regular basis to look at that data figure out where we need to go we're going to continue attendance best practice trainings and look to the Future to make sure that they're there is a 100% alignment to our guard rails for in those trainings so that we can move move those rails forward goals develop into disseminate information for teachers and substitutes on the importance of logging daily attendance so I'm not sure that everybody understands how important it is and what that means and it's not just about collecting data so we're going to be developing some information and

[01:04:00]
sometimes they think they don't have to take attendance so we need to get that information out to them to implement regular follow-ups on student attendance success plans so part of what those attendance teams do is they look at the students that are chronically absent they put them on Student Success plans but what hasn't happened on a regular basis is okay I put you know Chris West on an attendance plan but I never went back to check to see how it's doing so we want to have some follow-up and Implement that this year so that they'll actually do some some regular follow-up and it will be part of the planning process that when I put Chris on the plan I know in at this time I need to be following up looking at his data and maybe talking to Chris again and say what's working what's not working and how can we continue to support you to be in school meetings with attendance mlss and accountability departments to

[01:05:00]
find school plans and processes so we want to make sure that schools understand that they should be aligning those processes and their plans so if they have an attendance for Success plan it shouldn't just be a standalone plan how does that relate to some of the other things and the other plans that you're doing in your school so those are the answers to those questions and we will stand for questions so I think what we were going to do Ashley was just kind of bounced through some questions but we wanted to do this very succinctly so that we just each got a turn but we didn't everybody take like you're not going to ask all 600 questions you might have asked like one at a time so that we can go and actually I'm just going to allow you to facilitate this process for us

[01:06:00]
that works so because this is the first time that you all have seen this report and heard this presentation it is expected that you may have some questions that are technical or tactical nature to be clear for any I know that you all have read the read the guidance but for anyone else who is watching or who is president tonight and Technical questions are those kinds of questions that are seek to understand what the measurement process is how something was measured who was who was measured how the measurement was done and tactical questions are questions that seek to understand how are by who something is done and then strategic questions are going to be the ones that really seem to understand how something aligns with the goal or the guard rail

[01:07:00]
what is the information what did we learn from this data how how does this data inform us of what the root causes that is that that needs to drive Improvement in the district so before we get into the questions that are of strategic nature I want to give everyone an opportunity to ask some of those more technical or technical questions and I know we had a few come up even before the the presentation began so now is the appropriate time to ask those and so the way we're going to do this how do you ask your question and then I will repeat it to you to make sure that everyone hears it correctly and we will identify this tactical or Technical and then turn it over to the administration to answer the question so this first and I think we're going to do on this one too is going to go like we're going to give

[01:08:00]
everybody a turn so we're not going to ask like a bunch of questions from one board member just like a key burning question so who wants to go first I can go okay Crystal it's just like I guess tactical and it's and I should know this but what are some funds thank you for the question is what are soft funds so you mentioned that that is a tactical question that is absolutely a tactical question and it's a really important question to ask before the monitoring session or in this case right now because while many of the board members may know what what are those of us watching at home may not know so it's great to ask that question so turn it over to Dr Bowman

[01:09:00]
Grant funds so money that isn't part of the operational budget okay thank you help you with this process moving forward you're asking me know I'm asking the staff so having the question we have a tendency to get into and we drop a lot of acronyms that people don't know or we use terms that we're very comfortable with

[01:10:00]
we're going to have to be a little more cautious and a little bit more alert I think in terms of preparing these documents and then try to read those for that but that lends it attached and then I think the Community member saying soft buns they might not know what that means either so I think really being conscientious of you know a new a Community member who's interested out there reading this or answer the same with the acronym of mlss thank you next time do you want to know what is MLS we actually have presented on MLS multi layer systems of support

[01:11:00]
interventions for students who are struggling with reading particularly okay will you be MTL SS and then they dropped the TV period

[01:12:00]
number of incarcerated parents what what kinds of things come into play in determining the number of counselors needed okay before they answer the question we're going to we're going to interrogate it real quick so the question that I have is this isn't exactly how you stated it what is the formula for determining the need for counselors can you restate the section or the last part that you asked about that part number for Peterson I'm not sure I need I'm not sure which actually dropped some ideas or

[01:13:00]
SES programs or SES have an impact on the community so she was giving examples curious if they're in the factor or not yeah so that's exactly why I asked the question so asking so it's important to be clear about it's important to ensure that your questions are clear so when it is human nature to want to say and and for example and but it's really important to to be clear with a question so can you explain further the formula for determining the need of counselors and then follow up to that or you could add on and including how different tiers of student groups intervention services that students receive my factor into that

[01:14:00]
so basically being more succinct in the question which is something I also struggle with so we're all dealing with Grace here and please define SES good thank you very much and I don't have that in front of me but we can provide that for you the exact but things like health and wellness team visits what those visits are for we look at the how many suicide ideations crisis responses that happened at the school those types of things are in there we also look at whether or not

[01:15:00]
there's a high number of students that have been referred for Behavioral reasons interventions that have that are happening with students so there are multiple things that go into that I don't have the formula in front of me so I can't give you the exact formula but we can provide that for you so if that question if we had not been a practice that question were asked before we would have had that right we can only look at the data that we have so we may not know the number of incarcerated parents those kinds of things to include into that that's not into the school district so we're looking at the internal School data that we have around the students that we serve as we place the the counseling

[01:16:00]
have I have a question for Ashley so if this had been asked ahead of time as it hopefully will be going forward then if there's a follow-up question that also can be asked in that pre-meeting time frame yes yes so the the pre-meeting time frame really is an opportunity for board members to ask these Technical and Technical questions in advance for that specific person or purpose and also all of the questions that are posed in advance of the board meeting so generally there's a deadline for when those are submitted and then all of the responses come back and then you may have a couple of other follow-ups which is acceptable but ideally all of the questions that are asked in their responses are would be posted with the report when the agenda when the final

[01:17:00]
what's the agenda is posted three days before the board meeting it's going to take a little while to get there before y'all can actually Implement that kind of process but that is the overall vision and that actually is a more transparent process for your community as well okay can we move along just a quick clarification social emotional support services

[01:18:00]
attitudes logging attendance daily so I want to what is what is causing the inconsistency of teachers and substitutes logging attendance daily is that is that correct yes okay so that actually would be a strategic question and that is the reason that would be a strategic question is it is seeking to understand what what we learned from the information so what what have we learned from this data collection process and what does the data tell you so that's an excellent question but I'm going to ask you to hold it until the next the next round we're asking smart questions

[01:19:00]
do you have another question you want to ask that's technical or tactical or you want us to just go ahead OK Google and I think this is a tactical question but I could be wrong Ashley he'll tell me if I am so I would just ask when you who and how did you gather this this data that you have presented to us who gathered it and how was it gathered it so mine would be like if somebody's gone how are they going to know what to do when he's supposed to be doing this yes so that's an excellent example of a technical question

[01:20:00]
it was technical not tactical that's why I was wrong so go ahead I think you can go ahead now so sorry strategic analysis department is responsible for collecting the interim guardrail as well as internal data that is not if it is not something that we already have access to either through an assessment that's administered or through student information system so we made the request of Dr mirror of office so the person who is the executive director of that work and who oversees the nurses is the person who would be asked for those those accounts and then we put them into our presentations

[01:21:00]
I think I have lots of strategic question so I'm trying to change one into a technical or tactical and I think my question is okay how how are you how are how is the effectiveness of the multitude of SEL programs measured so that is another excellent example

[01:22:00]
of a technical question that you're seeking to understand how measurement is how something is measured Ashley hang on a second question was really around how was the test that there was a multitude of SEL programs right so that's how I heard the question not the effectiveness but how did you come up with the termination that there's a multitude of SEL programs thank you so how did you determine that there is a multitude of SEO that so I actually am going to push back and say that that also is a strategic question because it even though it is asking about the measurement of you know what what we'll call it a technical question we'll go ahead and let it let the answer cuz you said that panorama

[01:23:00]
is more the data collection so how does it go to the question was how is the multitude of SEL programs measured so Madam chair and member Jackson we just did a survey of all principles and ask them what SEO programs they're using and buy that survey we've we realize that there are multiple programs in our schools and some schools are using more than one that they didn't just adopt a single program and so there are multiple programs out there so that's how we make that determination and how is their effectiveness being measured but I think that will be the Strategic question

[01:24:00]
I have to come back to you cuz I need to go back over here this way so I'm going to go to board member Gonzalez first in your technical question or technical why are we measuring only nurses and counselors as measures of district and community base wraparound Sports how did we get to that okay so why are we only measuring and nurses so why are those the only two things that we are measuring can you read can you reset the second part that was it okay okay perfect is that tactical tactical I think it's tactical that's kind of Falls between between the two I would I would probably call that

[01:25:00]
mental health providers in our schools

[01:26:00]
continue to try to increase them but if there's a shortage then we can't do anything about that this is the one area where we do have some control over both nurses and counselors provide wraparound services for our students and it is the one area that we can either maintain and or increase in our school so that was why we chose that measure for this interim guardrail may also add I think we also have internet on them tonight so as far as the whole garden that includes attendance and so I'm just I think that's part of the answer me about

[01:27:00]
this is the first time we're hearing that also so then when we left left the last meeting it was still broadly wraparound supports will maintain or increase so I hear the answer and I understand that it seems to me that there are other things within our control that are wrap around supports are part of a system of support for kids Behavioral Health Specialists restorative practice staff that's focused on that ROTC programs we talked about arts and Fine Arts so just sort of the whole system I would say is what I have in mind and wanting to make sure that it wasn't inequitable across the district as we thought about a guardrail and so that's sort of leads to my previous question to which I won't ask right now just about the equity issues but we'll get to that this is actually the this is the right time to ask that question as well for bumpkins

[01:28:00]
how is it Equitable if we're increasing or maintaining at all schools with the question like all and Equity aren't the same so I've been thinking about that and it's a good question I appreciate it one of the things I think it's important to remember is so this data has existed right we know how many counselors we have we know how many nurses we have and if I had gone to Chris last year and ask her can you give me that number she probably could have after a few minutes and ask him that question they probably could have given it to me after a few minutes as well but as leadership of the district we haven't really looked at that and really thought about it we did make a commitment and it's been a commitment for quite a while and we maintain that because we really do believe

[01:29:00]
it's it's vital to have counselors and nurses for our kids what I think this does and this may be one of those guardrails that sort of develops as we go through the year one of the things that board member Peterson will tell you is that some schools may have a counselor throughout the year but it may not be the same counselor throughout the year and I think what will happen is we begin to we're not allowed to break this down for purposes of this report but if we start to see variations in the number if it starts to change I think that leads us to ask where is it changing and do we have areas that are seeing a harder time maintaining that stuffing and I think just anecdotally I would tell you we do and so we need to start thinking about how to do that and I acknowledge this may not be you know the finals you guys move forward with this in the future but I think when we first started thinking about things we could actually measure

[01:30:00]
and things that we could actually talk about and then I think it generates and you're proving this point tonight it generates a further conversation around the guardrail that gets into the I think the more deeper information that lies behind it so I know that's sort of a wishy-washy answer but I I think that it it it it it's something that's got will now talk about it where is I think we talked about it but maybe not in a consistent fashion over the overtime so I wanted to make sure that there wasn't anything to add the no one wanted to add anything to that but before you move on I want to lift up what was just said so

[01:31:00]
and one of the things that he said is really important is it a lot of important things that there's one specific thing and that is that board member because you have asked this question in this board meeting tonight now the staff is going to go back and talk about it and they're going to have dialogue around it and it's probably going to have an impact on how they manage the district moving forward that at its very core is why these progress monitoring sessions are so important and why we really encourage everyone to engage and ask questions during during these questions during these sessions and again that's an excellent question and I would also expect that they're probably will be the there will be some Genesis to this interim as well moving forward

[01:32:00]
board member Dominguez I'm coming back to you cuz I still haven't asked mine but do you want me to go okay I think my tactical question that I would have asked if I had a chance to write this in is there a chart that outlines the formula determined for each school and how the allocation was made you know for the school so that we could see what the allocation is for each school okay so the question is does a chart exist that can break down the allocation by campus that accurate you know for the nursing and for the counseling and so that is an excellent question and that is absolutely

[01:33:00]
appropriate to ask before the session and ideally it could lead to some deeper deeper data in future reports as well okay and if that had been asked to ahead of time we would have given you that so that does exist and we can provide that and I have one more time is there a does it show by I mean what I'm interested in is I know we've got an allocation but I'm curious about that allocation against actual vacancy like did we fill all those allocations Ashley is that so that's a great tactical question and

[01:34:00]
do we have do we have where there are vacancies have we allocated the resources to fill vacancies and what vacancies still exist is that accurate yeah I'm curious about the vacancy where those vacancies so Madam president and I'm going to knock on wood as of right this minute locations are full we have filled all of them we still have a few counseling vacancies that were that we need to fill it's a interesting question because it would be a real time question because we could open the doors on the 3rd and have someone retire or decide to quit and then we have a vacancy so but at any given time we can give you that data on how many vacancies we have

[01:35:00]
but I'm going to add a little bit to that that we do have now processes for substitutes for nurses and counselors so when we have vacancies we can at least make sure the services are there OK Google how much and for how long is that money waiting for Ashley I did not hear the question

[01:36:00]
with regard to the bullet under 1.1 guardrail 1.1 what is going well you've reported that we haven't Kellogg Grant to support the work how much is that catalog Grant and for how long is it do we have it up something that you did hear that is actually a best practice you actually reference a piece of data in the in the report and I know others have done that as well but I didn't I didn't look it up at the time but you actually are pointing to a specific place in the report saying here you reference this catalog Grant how how much is that grant for and how long will it exist that is

[01:37:00]
excellent example of a technical question A Plus members of the board the Kellogg Grant is for I would have been better if this was ahead of time I think it's $250,000 but it's over three years so one of the reasons to implement it to so we'll have that transition time of looking at transitioning from one school to the other so it's through the Education Foundation this grant came to us it's started

[01:38:00]
search for 3 years okay great so everyone's had a chance Ashley does I guess I could ask does anybody else have a burning question that they didn't ask or want to ask on this report because we're going to go to strategic questions next or did you feel like we answered we got to them it's really how is equity defined in measured because we don't want things to be inevitably distributed we've talked about the formula that was a little bit of member Peterson's question we've talked about student groups we've talked about campuses so I'm just curious from the administration's perspective when when you see inequitable distribute distribution how are you defining Equitable or inequitable

[01:39:00]
different ways but we have to look at equity in terms of sort of the Martinez decision and the boards looking at plus African-American students so and when we were looking at services and Equitable Services because that's what this is about is are we giving students the Equitable Services we're looking at

[01:40:00]
so why I said we don't just do a ratio model for example with the nurses and counselors that we have to look at that it's placed where the need is and not just where you know we have 200 200 students and so they only get a 0.5 that may not be what happens because we have to look at the other issues of those particular students so it's very much student-driven in terms of the need not staff driven but student-driven what are the needs of the students for nursing for counseling and how do we distribute those base on models that are Equitable and so we're looking at those kinds of things when we're looking at the attendance is identified as chronically they never come off of that their chronically absent for the rest

[01:41:00]
we have to do some things about that but we're never going to know whether it improved so that doesn't help us in terms of understanding the equity of the interventions that are that we utilize for those students so we have to look at a different data set which is average daily attendance so we can make improvements in a student's average daily attendance so if they're improving then we can go back and look and say are the interventions that we're doing working if they're not improving are the interventions that we've put in not working and we can go back so it's based on student-driven and is it Equitable or not and by looking at average daily attendance were actually going to be targeting those students that are identified in the Martinez plus African-American students very specifically to make sure that we are providing Equitable Services to them I don't know if superintendent Elder wanted to add

[01:42:00]
educational Equity or specifically talking about procedures systems behaviors resources for sure and how that impacts students learning so in this particular case when you're talking about Equity you're looking at a resource and it's sloppy I think the factory is interesting because you talked about what sort of internal data the district collects you know we know how many referrals are made for example to outside vendors for help and mental health that could be a component of the fact that you know there's a tremendous increase and

[01:43:00]
Wellness room up there in response to some pretty important data that's how I would look at that in terms of how we Define it we need to be real clear what we're talking about are we talking about a resource we talked about a process we talked about a system in this case we're talking about a resource thank you so I'm not sure where this is how do we take into account for instance the impact of gun violence at West Mesa for allocation of those resources and how can

[01:44:00]
play make judgments or decisions as other other issues of their concerns arise I'm not sure where that falls in the hierarchy of the the definition of questions so that would be that would be a question and it definitely has one that should be asked beforehand and I would be kind of be careful with that one just because the report doesn't actually early what I remember from it it doesn't actually mention anything about West Mesa doesn't identify that is a root cause so it would be careful about asking it in a board meeting but it absolutely is something that should that could and

[01:45:00]
so it could have an impact on the factory but it also could have an impact on the type of outside resources that are that become available so we know that in case of West Mesa we partnered with the city on their program for violence prevention and that was in direct response to what was occurring out there and then we do have to look at the data because the reality is that gun violence is everywhere across the city it's not located it's not just one school's problem it's everybody's problem and there are other schools that maybe not had the severity of issues but it may have had more issues so I think that applies as well I do have one question I know mine is purely

[01:46:00]
wake me up at 7 and it says the SEL cor team will meet regular during the planning year can you provide information on who's on the core team and how are they selected so I'm assuming yeah she didn't jump in so I can hear it down with a team that was already in place around looking at SEL and they were identified level at this point so it's Department staff that are all part of their job description is to do some work around SEL so and I if it was asked to had a time it could provide you the list of everyone that's on that team I don't just wait a few people on that team our Behavior support specialist are

[01:47:00]
order that their resource teachers there are department chair leads that are on that group office of equity multiple multiple departments across the district and sappers also part of that team because we're looking at a lot of data and we want to make sure that our interpretation of the data is correct the way that we're collecting data is is sound so right now we're in the data collection part of the planning but multiple people and as we move forward if more individuals are identified that we need this person on the team then we add them to the team and so it's it's probably about 15 20 people right now okay how many people are on this team all right remember strategic are we on strategic

[01:48:00]
yes not yet but we can we can transition if you're ready I think we're done with some technical question so I think let's move on to so Ashley do you want to start first give us some guidance on how we asked these questions or what do you want us to do yeah let me give you a little bit of guidance first so so in questions that are asked in a progress monitoring session we actually don't just encourage words to make sure that their questions are strategic but we actually encourage you to ask questions that are smart so just like you know of a smart goal smart questions also stand for something so that is a strategic that means that they understand how something aligns the goals and guardrails understanding the data not how the data was taken or collected but actually understanding what the data says what we learn from the data

[01:49:00]
measure Focus so does the question reference specific metrics data information that is included in the report or presentation does the ask this is is the question asked oriented so that means is it open-ended and asked and a good faith versus yes no question or one that is asked and I know that this board would never do this but asked in a way that is that could be interpreted as confrontational or accusatory it's really important that open-ended questions really keep a productive conversation going and focused on Improvement the art is results focused so asking actually asking a question versus sharing opinions board members have lots of opportunities to share

[01:50:00]
your opinions this progress monitoring session is not one of them at the purpose of this conversation is really to understand just what the data says about the current reality for students in this moment in time this isn't the time for pontificating or grandstanding it's really about continuous Improvement and how do we move the district forward and on that note I'll remind you that of our saying what happens in the boardroom will be seen in the classroom so question is really should be asked Focus the same way that you would expect a teacher to ask questions of their students and then finally time focused so specifically questions that are focused on the past what we know that the data says that has already happened versus asking questions that are future focused which can really get in the

[01:51:00]
get into a territory of offering advice or sharing opinions and that we recommend asking questions that are smart in nature really allows you to focus your time together in your board meeting on having a productive strategic Focus conversation that is going to actually move the needle along and set expectations for the district and really Center accountability for what has happened today versus you know what what are we doing telling the district what to do you know those are those are all things that you have the board really in these opportunities should be focused on understanding the data and gleaning what we can learn from it or understanding what we can leave from it so with that who has the first

[01:52:00]
we need to increase the number of people going into the nursing and counseling ranks and I know that was like a concern across the country that you pointed out on the documents so when you're looking at that which strategy do you think has worked to help increase those that are joining the ranks so you know and

[01:53:00]
nursing and counseling I don't know if that's smart enough so we're going to unpack it a little bit so the question is I'm looking at the FTE graph is great job you you reference data in the report which strategy supports the need that has been communicated to increase in these areas is that accurate okay so that is an excellent question and that does qualify as a smart question means all of the all of the criteria good job my one piece of coaching is that stop yourself and when you when you find yourself like qualifying the question asked the question because you said that we need to know these things

[01:54:00]
and then you finish the question this is where you know writing down a few questions before the before the meeting and during the report or the presentation can be really helpful because it helps you ensure that your questions are the most distinct but that was a great job Peggy it's a bee question I know I'll give you a B+ thank you I would have given you any money on if you look at the where are we going the next steps I would say that the things that we have so far seen the best results for are under the bullet that they continue in wrap up recruitment efforts so we've had success at the aps job fairs and in participating in those we've had a lot of success with our senior

[01:55:00]
working teaching a class at UNM because we've gotten more students that might have gone a different route in counseling and not into school counseling now looking at school counseling is a viable option for them and the internships we've got more and more students take doing internships with our nurses and our counselors and our schools and I truly believe that when they can get into a school and see what it's like working with children not just in a hospital in the ER room that we get more passionate employees that they say this is what I want I really like this and we have actually hired some of those interns this year thank you I'll move this way board member

[01:56:00]
I want to get an A+ but I'll just go for it okay so based on the fact that from the report 50% of all School nurses are funded by Soft funds or grants and also based on the fact that funding is not assured for School nurses and counselors how is using the the number of nursing counselors FTE is a consistent measurement for the next few years okay so I'm going to try to repeat this so it's on the report

[01:57:00]
it shows that 50% of all nurses are funded by grants so understanding this information how can we ensure that those ftes are funded for the next two years is that is that accurate or did I miss States based on the fact that 50% of nurses are funded by grants and that the funding is not assured how is using the number of nursing counselors FTE a consistent measurement for the next few years okay so really how is this going to be a consistent measurement for the next few years so

[01:58:00]
this is so good job identifying data or referencing data from the report and asked you if it isn't asked question it is a question asking good faith versus sharing an opinion it is definitely so actually question I actually think that it's probably more of a technical question in nature just because it's you're trying to understand the the measurements so if we're going if this is something that we're going to measure how is it going to be sustainable and it's also a forward-facing question so that's asking about what we're going to do versus what has been done so those are just like the two two things two areas for improvement that said

[01:59:00]
let them answer it so I got to be plus the president of the court of a member Jackson members of the board in terms of the nursing part of the reason that soft funding was used instead of just grant although it's identified as a grant in APS the money that is used to fund the 50% of nurses is the school-based Medicaid Program the good news about that is it's not just a grant that we apply for and then get that is money that we generate and we are so that money is generated every year and the nurses actually help us generate that funding and so that's money that we get it's a reimbursement of services that we render so the Medicaid funding is

[02:00:00]
probably of all of the and I'm going to are quote soft funding that we have in the district the most stable so it's not a like five year Grant it's not it doesn't look like it's going away again because at the same thing can happen with operational funds it is dependent on legislators this is Congress that we're talking about that makes some determinations around Medicaid funding but we generate those funds we have gotten into a very good position in APS for actually seeing increases in that money not decreases and we do have a required and I'm going to use the wrong turn because I'm not a physical person we have to have a reserve and so even if the money went away and two years we still have a reserve for a year that we could then look at how else might we find those positions so there's a required reserve on that funding so that funding source is

[02:01:00]
best stable as operational funding is for us thank you ok Google and so my question would be what strategies are most efficient and effective in doing that and how do you know I guess the equity

[02:02:00]
prioritizing based on Equity what strategies would contribute to a focus on Equity so that is an excellent smart question Danielle what strategies will focus on Equity I would encourage you to because I understand literally isn't there in the report but being able to reference and say here in the report it says x y z what strategies help us informed inform that so great job so competitive oh my gosh this group okay

[02:03:00]
strategic question for 100 points here here we go for an A+ All right a member Gonzales and members of the board as when we have that data we will be looking at what programs are out there which schools are doing them whether their school or not whether they're just in certain classrooms that are happening and we've done the survey now we haven't been able to analyze it yet it just happened last week so we're looking at that date and we're doing something around that so I just want to let you know where we are with that but we will be looking at that we do know that there are schools that have identified that they have done none that they have not identified any strategies and then we will be looking at where are those schools are the population of those students the end and where they sit so

[02:04:00]
we may have a school that is not doing any SEL strategies but also don't have a lot of behavior issues and other things going on at that school so it's going to take some deeper talking to the staff at that school figuring out what it is so that we can distribute our resources our training we have a lot of training resource at the district level right now for multiple programs not every program but for programs at schools have identified and where do we structure those those programs and right now potentially so this is my hypothetical answer to your hypothetical question we will be looking at schools that aren't doing anything and how do we get them to a point where they start to identify what they can do working with their eyes how do we Implement some SEL strategies in our schools so that they're because there is nothing land or formal that's happening at school

[02:05:00]
that doesn't mean that teachers aren't doing anything but it's just not a planned or a formal strategy around SEL and and so how do we help to move those schools forward so that there is something that is formal intentional and can be measured so bored Gonzalez again I like to build just a little bit so it's a difficult question you ask there's two elements to it you asked about budgeting and equity and the budgeting aspect is that we will have to look at the training resources that we have and we'll have to start looking at how do we apply those I don't think one of the things I watch Richard and his team do a few years ago was beginning to limit the amount of technology and what exactly it is we can support

[02:06:00]
we can have schools that say they're doing seal right now and I believe they are I've seen evidence of that but it's hit-and-miss and we are now in the process of trying to design a program that will last a lot longer now to get in the equity issue I think that may be a little Nuance that we're not prepared to answer at this time because we don't really know what you asked earlier how do you measure equity and how do you define equity and I was talking about the resources and environment so forth I think we have to get this thing in place and then we can begin to try to figure out what the measurements are for the for what you're describing as far as moving that the other thing is we're at a point right now in Albuquerque and I think is a country the need for social emotional Services is everywhere and so it's going to be there are some people are definitely struggling I drive into certain parts of town I get it it's worse but there's Parts Town

[02:07:00]
and so I think initially our Focus needs to be on let's get this program in place and and funded and trained properly and then we can begin to look at those nuances that I think your question is is leaning towards I think it's really great for a long-term strategic question as far as how do you see his plane out in the future but I don't I doubt we could really offer your answer your Equity question right now okay so mine is in relation to 1.1 when we talked about like specifically to the number of nurses and knowing that were we met the threshold we have 100% of our schools I'm struggling with the part of knowing trying to figure out how this is challenging for us and how this goal will be able to really

[02:08:00]
tell us to measure it over 5 years knowing we naturally have met that without putting some of these other systems into place is that strategic enough so that's actually a technical question but I want to but it's also a good time wants to hear that President this is a critical I think area for us to make sure that we minimally maintain what we have I can tell you that APS does a better job than most school districts even Across the Nation in terms of our

[02:09:00]
and if you look at the state we have schools that don't have a school nurse and they use Department of Health Resources so they don't even have a school nurse assigned at that school so there's no one there at all so these are critical data points and as we move forward and I'm going to use nursing as the example and we if students were seeing an high increase in asthmatic students and that has to do with a lot of environmental factors that we don't have control over so that means that we have to figure out how we work with those students assist those students there some students that cannot administer their own asthma medications are either too young or don't have the skill set for it nurses are critical if this number increases and continues to increase with there may be a need to have more nurses in our schools we will not be able to

[02:10:00]
and so to have this as a guardrail for wraparound Services looking at the numbers that we have and saying that we're going to minimally maintain them we probably will be needing to increase them over the next five years and so that is going to be a critical point that we're going to have to look at in our planning and implementation and how we make that happen and and to not let those numbers drop we can't let them drive and we may need to increase them as we move forward so I'm not sure if I've answered your question completely but that's why we've chosen this as this because it is the one area that we do have some control I think preaching to the choir when I say that we need more counselors in our schools and right now just maintaining that number is

[02:11:00]
a critical step in the right direction okay I want to lift up something real question because it's something that wasn't clear for you and I imagine that it probably wasn't clear for a lot of people if I had to if I had to guess but it's this is an example of where maintaining a maintaining a critical element of the school district's program can that in and of itself can be a challenge and that is important to ensure that the overall guard rail is still being honored so this one so this Cardwell pertains to equity maintaining the Staffing ratios and the

[02:12:00]
no services that those two those two levers yes nurses and counselors maintaining that is is in one part of challenging the organization and total with all of the interim guard house so I want to lift up just that how important that question that you asked just was and that was a wonderful response Dr Muir you get an A plus two it wasn't it wasn't smart but you get an A+ for a great a great time so I'm going to get an incomplete I already know or maybe it'll be past

[02:13:00]
yes or something but I guess it's more of a process question cuz as I look at strategic questions it's really based on looking at where we were and where we where we got into and what facilitated that progress and since we don't have for good reason we're just starting this is not at all a criticism we don't have the data to be able to so I'm going to beg off of my strategic questioning because I realized a request I come up with really is either tactical or technical question so I'll do better than the next time for asking the head of time but I'm going to go ahead and ask as sort of a process

[02:14:00]
they're the values they're the things that are important to us but at the same time we really are looking at it in terms of what most impact student outcomes and what doesn't so when we look at Equity it's really when we look at these Equity issues it's not just how do how do we meet everyone's needs how are we being strategic in focusing those needs or focusing our resources to meet those needs in the way that most impact students and I'm not saying this to to Dev

[02:15:00]
the importance of serve those big picture values that are Incorporated in the guard rails and I'm racing it more as in my example is for instance we have been pretty strategic and where Community Schools are placed because we know that there are certain places where if we don't look at putting resources in an equitable way students are not going to have the same outcomes that students in another situation would not be as impacted by does that make sense so I guess my question is when we look at when we look at the start Rail and start talking about Equity how are we going to start measuring

[02:16:00]
that deeper level of how we make choices about resources that really Alters outcomes in a way that that's meaningful so this is service but you are actually not far off from having asked a really great us so you phrase it kind of forward-looking how are we going to start I would encourage you to focus on what the data what the data says so

[02:17:00]
instead rephrasing think of ways that you can rephrase it to Center what the what has been learned from the information that's been gathered so far so as I look at the data and total from this from this report what what can that actually what have you learned about about how this from the data to inform the process moving forward or two and to inform your decision making moving forward so we're looking backwards we're focusing on what was learned but how how will those learnings allow you to change change your decision making process is that is that a fair statement does it get to the heart of what you're trying to understand I think so so

[02:18:00]
it might be so what have we learned about the impact on student outcomes by using the allocation formula for counselors would that I mean I could go on and I'm trying to perfect we have limited resources

[02:19:00]
we have limited amounts of money in the number of people that we can place at places all right and when you guys took on this new form of governance you identified elements that you felt were important and the reality is as we begin to look at the social emotional services and the type of sports we provide for kids the resources are going to get really tight at some point and we may have to wait some fairly difficult decisions and it'll have to be based on the goals that you all have established and what you have valued as a board and what we even so we can look at part of the difficulty of coming

[02:20:00]
the school that's really in a lot of pain and we have a couple of we have additional counselors there and those kids perform badly now are we going to say they perform badly because we had additional counselors there so you got to be real careful with Richard always gets on me about causation and correlation so and I want these days will understand it but I would say your question again it asks for something that I don't think tonight we're prepared to answer it's something we can certainly think about and we can have a conversation around but it's about equity and resources it's not just the immediate what's your asking is are the counselors and nurses the only valuable resource there or is there more to it and I got to tell you this is what we've chosen to look at and that's where we're going to talk about in terms of this type of report that's what we can do but you're going big picture and that's good we need to have that bigger picture but we are going to bring you at some point budgets or

[02:21:00]
direction that is going to be hard for people but that's a really good thing you're not going to be able to fund anymore that's right but we've got it we believe this is the way to go based off what the goals have been established and really appreciate that because it is nuanced and it is complex and it's not that's why that's why I'm really struggling with the guard rails in a way because they are not always easy quantifiable and I when I look at this it seems like a lot of the effort went into how do we how do we want to play something that's not necessarily for relationship

[02:22:00]
all you can do is answer right now what's before us that helps me rain in this question I hope you and me both so with regard to the portion of this report dedicated to next steps 1.1 the third bullet point the connection to UNM as a means of promoting School counseling Choice my question is with regard to

[02:23:00]
what are the plans to systematize that partnership with UNM to work towards this pipeline or counseling students to come on board that is that okay so with regard to the portion of the report dedicated to next steps specifically the connection to UNM what are the plans to systematize that strategy is that correctly okay so that is that would so that is a forward facing question but other

[02:24:00]
yay thank you thank you card of a member Dominguez members of the board we are working not only with UNM this this was used as an example of some of the things that we're doing but we're working with all of the universities that train counselors in the state of New Mexico and the heads of those departments in those two to get information to their students about School counseling because as I said before there's many paths that you can go you can go and get a license that allows you to open up your own business or work for a clinic we want those people that are trained in counseling to come to APS and work with our students as school

[02:25:00]
and so we're putting together information for all of them so that they can share with their students about the benefits of School counseling and offering our assistance to we're fortunate as I said that right now our senior director teaches a class but in those universities we don't do guest speaking come and talk to their students and opening up those internship programs to them so that they're not just doing internships clinical internships are doing internships in our schools as part of their internship rotations so that's as forward thinking that we're trying to send it thank you Google so that we can move it forward and have those have those processes in place that will continue even if our senior director of county is no longer teaching a class their number

[02:26:00]
little surprised that Dr Muir didn't mention but we have mou with those institutions she is the queen of the mou so we have a little star Define what we can do and what they can do thank you so thank you for that yeah okay that's okay I'm having a hard time too kind of struggling with my question and it really is around the counseling side of it so and it's it's

[02:27:00]
I'm trying to figure this out so like I'm trying to think how I want to say this because we say so what we've got these number of counselors and we've got this FTE allocation and we have people working in the district so what counseling strategies are working with students and how do we know that they're working with students so do we have data that helps us with that so is there I'm trying to think of like sort of the strategy around counseling so we're we're deploying it but I'm curious about what's working well with students yeah so that is actually one of the recommended questions that boards asked during every

[02:28:00]
progress monitoring session and I didn't even tell you you did a job the question which so from from this information what have we learned about which strategies are working that's like nuts to both like at the end of the day why this conversation has happened so great job I got a name plus two resume the American School counseling Association standards for our counselors and so all of our trainings everything that we do with counselors are based on that and best practices and what's happening with in New Mexico and also within Albuquerque Public Schools our counselors are required to keep data

[02:29:00]
so we look at that this year so forward-looking we're going to be asking them to log interventions that they're doing where they have not done that before and so they will be logging the interventions and then doing some follow-up again as I mentioned even with the attendance we're going to be following up on interventions this year that's a big strategy that we're moving forward with because just putting an intervention in place does not guarantee that it worked or helped and so if the student is still struggling then why what happened there's so there's no it's a secondary root cause analysis on what's going on maybe they were not able to get to the supports that they were referred to or maybe they got to the supports and it's not working and they need additional support so maybe there's family supports that need to happen so we're going to be collecting a lot more information this year about what counselors are doing and how effective it is

[02:30:00]
with our students especially around the SEL side of things cuz you do know our school counselors also do the academic side and so we're going to be looking very much at the supports that they're doing around that and making sure that everything that happens is truly aligned with the American School Counselors Association standards because those are the best practices and I just want to add again school counselors do a tremendous job I respect them deeply but they don't do therapeutic services and so I think a lot of times you ask about what counseling strategies are working there's an idea at least in the perception of the public that were you know keeping kids from doing things they wouldn't you shouldn't do and we do but we do that mostly through referral to the outside resources so there's been question what's the effect in this that well there's areas of that we can't measure you know you can't measure if a kid didn't hurt themselves right and there's some questions there that are confidential

[02:31:00]
but that's a big chunk of what our school counselors do to make sure all their kids get registered and get registered properly so they can get on that graduation track and they do a lot more than that I'm not at all that but I think it would help for us as we get into talk about what's you know effectiveness of counseling and what might work we kind of Define what they really do and make sure we're talking about the same thing and not not getting confused on therapeutic services I agree with you on that for sure it's like I understand that referral but I I am grateful to hear that the forward of how do we check up on referral and it's only as good as it can be right I mean but I understand that but if we don't check up on it we didn't know either

[02:32:00]
I appreciate that all right I was the last question asker on strategic any other strategic burning questions from the group from this practice session is taking a deep breath OK Google partnership with higher ed institutions is there a strategy to

[02:33:00]
to feed minorities minority counselors into these counseling and I don't know what I'm struggling with is how I mean if you don't throw the idea out there then it never gets talked about that I don't know how much control we have over that but so board member so is there I have a question for you is there any reference to that strategy that would feed to feed

[02:34:00]
counselors that identify as members of minority groups into the into the work pool start again so is so you mentioned a possible strategy of I think hiring more hiring more counselors who are identified from specific minority groups is that accurate yeah like Martinez yeah so is that reference in the in the report is there any mention of that as a potential strategy in the report no okay so this is actually an instance and I'm sorry that I'm going to make you a little bit of hope that is actually not related to I mean

[02:35:00]
it could be related it could be a strategy that could be implemented but it's not one that was specifically mentioned as one that they're going to use so it actually is not appropriate to ask that question in this in this at this time because in the because is the important is the important thing to understand it can be interpreted as here is a strategy that you need to consider it could be interpreted as giving advice and and that's not that's not what the progress monitoring session for so that said if you would like to respond so what I was going to say is that's not actually something we're measuring in this particular but what I want to point out is if you'd come to if you come to the job fairs what you'll find is

[02:36:00]
times we have institutions like UNM there that for example the last job fair Mr turkson had UNM there from the American Indian Institute and they were laying out a program of study for students who were seeking Masters or doctoral programs that they were Native American then they had access to scholarship money and I mean it was really cool to have them there so there is a move by our human resources department at least the job fairs where we have some control over who's who who can have access to that it is upon those institutions to create those those cancels and social workers and so forth for us okay are there

[02:37:00]
are there any further questions I think we've wrapped it up okay so moving forward and when you start doing real monitoring and not just practice monitoring sessions and when you start doing real monitoring sessions at the conclusion of the monitoring session the board will actually vote on whether or not to accept the monitoring report so when you're voting to accept the monitoring report you are not voting to approve strategies you're not voting whether or not you agree with the strategies you are simply voting to accept the report and that vote is essentially a thumbs up saying we had this conversation and it was an effective one so with that we're not even going to I'm not even going to pull you all but I do want to just take a moment to answer any questions that you may have about this Pro

[02:38:00]
and what it may look like moving forward I love how intentional it was I mean we really had to be thoughtful and guided by questions that you provide so I just want to thank you very kindly and generously handled all of us with our questions but it's probably hard to be the first one to go so thank you for doing that any other comments I'll just double on that to express appreciation are doing on this and I hope that the low stakes environment here low stakes

[02:39:00]
as we all collectively learn together and move forward with the continuous Improvement in mind so I just want to express appreciation to you and your teams in particular if you could relay that from the board and I hope you didn't feel that we were being confrontational and Ashley I'll probably touch base with you on my own on this one because I guess for me I'm just like thinking you know as we finish this practice and the question that comes up in my

[02:40:00]
what does it have been an acceptable report you know because we do have some things that were missing but I'm I thinking for myself I wouldn't have said no table come back and then we could add some more you know bring it back but not just say a flat-out no I mean because I guess if we say no there's no opportunity to bring it back correct so actually that's not well so yes and yes so this so it's not really even productive to say like was this an effective report was this not an effective report because it was always going to be a practice report it was always going to be kind of messy the process was always going to be kind of clunky and it was always going to be imperfect from the start so you know with that with that understanding you know it was it was never going to be an effective report but it was a very good rapport

[02:41:00]
so it was a very good effort and the conversation was really really great for me to observe and experience and I can say that it far exceeded any expectations that I had I am deeply appreciative of you all and the way that you showed up both to the administration and to the board I want to answer your question though about what happens next so if the board says this this is an ineffective report it's not going to work for us the proper the proper thing to do in most cases is to actually table the report and say come back next time probably at the next meeting but a very soon meeting and give us an additional information the the key is to the extent possible to keep the conversation going to vote to decline a report Al

[02:42:00]
whether or not accept a report is pretty clear referendum on the superintendent the job at the superintendent is doing and that's never a situation we want to be in and especially if the board hasn't you know beforehand you know there should be a lot of discussion between the board and the superintendent before the monitoring session before the board meeting even starts to work through some of those issues to make sure that you can be set up for Success during the monitoring session so so that's my yes and definitely don't want to don't want to say no to the report except for instances where it is a necessity where the board really feels like there's a performance issue at all means keep the conversation going when it all okay

[02:43:00]
all right okay well thanks Dr Muir Chris Weston Dr Bowman for your time here tonight and really appreciate you guys sticking it through this with us so we're going to move on to our next agenda item yay I know okay so our next agenda item is is a community listening session on goals guard rails and superintendent search and this is just this is a discussion I just a discussion item for me I just want to remind the board that you know and what I liked about the student outcomes focused governance is that the function of the board is obviously to represent the vision of values of the community and the way that we do that is by getting out into the community listening to the community and doing this engagement piece the next

[02:44:00]
strategies of the next pieces for us around s o f g is really making sure that we have this effective Community engagement that's going to be going on on an ongoing basis because that's really going to set us up for True transformation as a social worker this is the part that really just makes my heart just like it's great because I know that with authentic Community engagement you can have real true change and that's the goal that we're trying to get to next and that's to really complete this piece so that we can invite the community build the trust with the community give them the tools that they also need to be engaged with us authentically and to be prepared to to really give us feedback and information that we need so that we can be making sure that when we're on the diet that we're actually we're absolutely representing what it is that they that they're telling us and that work we're carrying that vision and we're carrying their values so

[02:45:00]
what I'm going to do is we're going to be appointing a community engagement ad hoc committee I've asked board members Dominguez Gonzalez and Jackson to be on this committee and the purpose of this committee is we have to come up with at a minimum a 2-year plan it could be very high level that just talks about when we're going to go out and we're going to actually do these Community listening sessions or how our community engagement is going to look but we also have to create and develop the standard process for those sessions and how we want them to occur and that's important because what we're doing is we're kind of solidifying what community engagement looks like and when we go out to do those listening sessions what are the expectations for us as board members also and how we engage in that so this is the committee's going to be charged with planning follow-up events to the last Fall's listening session

[02:46:00]
to let the public know more about our goals or guard rails and our monitoring process and with the help of the administration weaving in information on how the Strategic plan will help achieve the goals we're also going to be using these Community listening sessions in this community engagement piece to also seek input on characteristics for our next superintendent and so for the community that's really important so we want to make sure that we have enough time and we have enough opportunities for that so obviously for the first I would say for at least from now to the to the end of the year is really looking at that baking in that process but also just looking forward and thinking about Community engagement as kind of a tradition I want to say or an Institutional institutionalized approach that the boards going to take from this point forward so I just wanted to say that does anyone have any questions or discuss

[02:47:00]
and I like that because I know as a board member who's been here for a while I would have appreciated that because we didn't have that kind of a process before so I really I think it'll be great even for potential board members that are coming in to to know that this is this is our board work and this is how it's done and these are the this is us moving forward and how it's being done okay so our next item is on the superintendent search and so what I'm asking for tonight is consideration for approval of issuance of the request for proposals for the superintendent search and recruitment firm this is a discussion action and I do want to say is that I've asked for the board vote on the issue of the RFP for superintendent search for

[02:48:00]
not because it's because approval is required I'm doing it because it's not we don't we don't have to approve this but I've asked for this because I want all board members to have an opportunity to participate in the search Recruitment and hiring a superintendent and so when we were developing the RFP was very intentional and getting it out to everyone so that we're all we're all in agreement we're all looking at that and we're all our voices in their collectively for this for the search so I just want to thank the board members who submitted suggestions for the scope of work and evaluation criteria for the search firm we're asking a lot from this search firm everything from helping us to determine the superintendent characteristics and qualifications and aligned with our goals and guardrails to seeing and recruiting these candidates and engaging the public in the process the plan is to begin advertising the RFP for the search for next week so with our approval

[02:49:00]
but it's ready to go and we're going to give the the prospective firms about 3 weeks to submit their proposals then there's going to be an evaluation team made up of the boards executive committee members of staff and we're probably going to have a public member and there as well we haven't determined who that's going to be yet you've got some ideas I had thought I haven't asked this individual but I had thought about there is an individual that sits on our audit committee who's got an extensive background in RFP and proposals I thought she might be a good addition to that I'd be happy to reach out to her that Sarah Brownstein who sits on the on a she's our public member on audit committee I've sat on many proposal committees with her and so I thought she might be a good member to ask and see if she's available and then that the review the proposals will come back before the entire board for contract approval

[02:50:00]
and again bringing an RFP before the board is not required at the cost is less than 250 which it will be $250,000 however I just want board members to have a say in this important contract so so that's where we are there and I will entertain a motion on that or have any other questions that folks might have I will move for consideration for approval of issuance of request for proposals for superintendent search and recruitment does it matter if it's a discussion on the agenda not actually I'm on the wrong

[02:51:00]
yes Yolanda Monterey Cordova yes okay so one of the last things I have here is I've got a president's report cuz we've got a lot of different things going on so what is around the school board candidate orientation and committee meetings and we're planning a school board candidate orientation on Wednesday August 9th at 5 p.m. it's going to be here in the delayo Martin conference room and this is going to be an opportunity for anyone interested in running for school board to find out more about what it means to be a school board member for Albuquerque Public Schools and and I'm just going to say this it also could be open to the public who wants to just come in and listen to what is it that school board members are responsible for doing so we're going to provide information on student outcomes Focus governance the code of conduct meeting dates legal responsibilities and the like so it's really just to give a general orientation to what is

[02:52:00]

[02:53:00]
just reviewing and really looking intently at what we're doing why we're doing it and what are we supposed to be doing so we're going to take a look at that some appointing another ad hoc committee which is going to be made up of me Danielle board member Gonzalez and board member Tapia Romero I've actually asked her to head to committee since she's the finance chair and so she'll work with us to to do this we're all going to ask King Johanna Kings going to be on that with us our CFO renette Apodaca our policy analyst Jessica Martinez and our attorney so that we can just look real succinctly at the policy and all of the requirements for those and what we're going to be looking at is what items should be discussed and deliberated what can be approved on a consent agenda during regular board meetings and what can be handled administratively so I'm hoping that with

[02:54:00]
I anticipate we don't need to have a long drawn-out process I'm thinking no more than three meetings I'm thinking 3 to 4 meeting we should be able to hammer this one out rather quickly so that's my report on that does anyone have any questions for me on that know that's a good all right now announcement of upcoming board meetings the next Board of Education meeting will be held on August 2nd 2023 at 5 p.m. and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on July 26th 2023 at 5:30 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee meeting both will be held here in the John Miller Community boardroom of the Allison Bruce King educational complex and live stream at aps.com edu so our next item is consideration for the Board of Education to convene an executive session is authorized by the public meetings act section 10-15
