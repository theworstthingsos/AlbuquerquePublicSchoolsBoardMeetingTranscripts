[00:02:00]
Board of Education meetings in person at the Alice and Bruce King educational complex here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or watch us on live stream on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel our first item is adoption of the April 19th 2023 Board of Education meeting agenda and approval of the April 5th 2023 Board of Education meeting minutes and the March 29th 2023 special Board of Education meeting minutes I would like to move to amend the April 19th 2023 Board of Education meeting agenda to move item 9 considered to Executive session to write after public forum and then in addition I would like to move for approval of the April 5th 2023 Board of Education meeting minutes and the March 29th 2023 special Board of Education meeting

[00:03:00]
the second marrow call please discussion okay I'm sorry I just asked why because we have various staff and community members that are here for other items on the agenda and putting it first makes people wait who may not be able to wait we're going to be moving into executive session and we don't anticipate it's going to be a really long executive session because it's just simply a quick review and an overview of next steps so the attorney that we have that's going to be working with this is coming in from Santa Fe and rather than having him wait for the entirety of the meeting which could cost us some additional funds we thought we'd put it up at the front so that we could do it quickly okay makes perfect sense I know once we said money I know that was an important part of it so and so

[00:04:00]
I have a roll call please tell me another Eragon yes Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes Crystal yes okay so our next item is public forum and secretary Jackson's going to leave instructions and we'll start with public forum okay so welcome to our public forum guests when you signed up to speak you were asked to review the rules and expectations which are presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that are agendas specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order in which they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the

[00:05:00]
phone in the center aisle at the back of the room when their name is called online guests will stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak when it is your time you will be escorted into the main meeting space please turn on your audio and video once you're speaking time is up you'll be ushered back into the waiting room when you are finished speaking you may choose to leave the meeting and watch it on live stream we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are fewer than 22 speakers so you will each have two minutes to address the board please be concise and try not to repeat what others have said tonight there are four speakers one time is up you will be directed to complete your sentences quickly so that others can speak you may not yield your unused time to another speaker if we don't get to all the speakers or you feel you were unable to convey your message you may email board Ed at aps.com

[00:06:00]
in addition for those of you who are here tonight a representative from our service center right back there is here to assist you so Mr Gonzales will you please introduce our speakers thank you board member Jackson we did have one last entry so they'll be five public forum setups tonight the first one is Lynn Anton then you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking thank yous student outcome goals and guardrails I found some things that I take issue with to name a few you have two goals that refer to Yazzie Martinez decision and this does not take into account all students in APS are Educators to focus on only a certain students and not others because that's the way it seems to be worded and it's implied as

[00:07:00]
guardrails why are they all stated in the negative each guard will start starts with the superintendent will not did anyone suggest writing this in the positive such as the superintendent will or Educators and that's really not how we are right things so I have an issue with that speaking of guardrails and I see that they have them posted in here will not allow the district to operate with an equitable distribution of school and or community base wrap around and support systems so that's a very lofty goal however how is this feasible for an example will every school have a school-based health center if not how is it determined which school is deemed worthy of a school-based Health Center and how is it even possible with shortages and health and mental health services and those professionals

[00:08:00]
Lenoir City and in our state so consider those things as well next year Roosevelt Middle School is going to start moving on to something else at 7:30 what other middle schools are starting at 9:15 for one thing that option wasn't even discussed last at your last meeting the 9:15 option so I think that took a lot of Staff members and families by surprise so now Roosevelt is not getting the same opportunity or Advantage as other middle school students and this is due to a bus issue can this be fixed okay I just want to my last thing was about Louise Elementary School being closed I was at elementary school closed in May of 2016 and I can speak from experience don't say you have a year to close up and then change it to oops sorry you won't be back next year period

[00:09:00]

[00:12:00]
about her school and everything so but I just came back on behalf of our school to continue to hold accountability the way I hold myself accountable to my job my the families and the students that I work for that's why I'm here and I'm just reminding you guys we also we need to remind ourselves to be accountable on one of the issues that we're fighting in at West Mesa High School which is the gun on campuses that's the whole issue right in the past couple of months we see some slow progression yes yay but we want to see your presence and I know I attended so different many meetings in our school district and a lot of these leaders that put on these meetings like we invite the school board we invite these leadership but they don't show up okay and a lot of that feedback that we get from our students is like I told you they don't care cuz are you still want to see or leaders in the front and reminding them hey we're here we hear you and reading some of these goals it's like

[00:13:00]
we got to get on those goals up there you know having a voice including our parents and our students and your presence will lead you to that goal right so we would love to see you we have many rallies and all these meetings that are coming up when you see that in your email please even 5 minutes of your time would be great just to and steal that faith and that morale back in our school amongst her students so that's why I'm here again thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Theresa Wilkinson I'm sorry I will get that to him you have two minutes my name is Theresa again I am a teacher at West Mesa High School and I'm just

[00:14:00]
thoughts on a few things so actually now is a group that's organized at West Mesa we talked about and eliminating guns and weapons on West Mesa campus we are in the process of maybe organizing yes organizing a rally March against guns on school campus which I'm going to touch on in a little bit we are looking at making our student handbook more friendly so students know what expectations are held of them at our school and what potential consequences there may be that are going to align with the new APS handbook that's coming up we did a student survey which I need to email to you all and I will there were total of 386 responses we close that yesterday which is 23% of the student body 1,642 students that took that serving there's a lot of very insightful comments on that we are we made a motion to distribute a staff survey immediately and I'll be sending emails out tomorrow

[00:15:00]
the whole reason that we do this is for students right and that's constantly what the messages like we're doing this for students so you know I was hoping to come here with Flyers to invite you all personally to this rally that we were organizing on May 4th due to scheduling conflicts and this I don't I think it's fear I really do think it's fear I think that there's things that have happened at West Mesa like they're continues to be guns that are brought to campus there was a student that was shot just last year and this is stealing issue and the fact that there's so much fear around addressing this issue that constantly gets tagged as being too political right guns is just a political issue so if you're organizing a rally around this and really needs to be touched around delicately I understand that right but I think the majority of the people that are working on this issue have like really pure intention

[00:16:00]
of making sure that school is safer students safe for stock say for community members and really engages the community's voice and coming up with a solution to this issue like I'm constantly hearing well what's the end goal what's the end goal is no guns on campus right now I need to wrap it up with one very quick sentence and I understand that that's a huge issue but if we can continue to happen thank you thank you our next speaker is Carrie Jordan off two minutes once you begin speaking good evening I'm speaking today regarding the changes to about times for APS schools that were announced yesterday at current medical and educ

[00:17:00]
turn on guidelines I support the later science Back start times for adolescents so obviously it upset me to see that both my children's East Mountain schools a Montoya Elementary and Roosevelt Middle School will actually start a half an hour earlier than their current start times even more alarming was to discover that Roosevelt Middle School is the sole middle facility which will deviate from the recommended best practices for developing brains and instead have their belly full one hour and 45 minutes earlier than any other Middle School in the district it appears to selectively timing issue in our area is being based on prioritizing Manzano high school students later start time at the expense of the quote sleep patterns in brain development of a belt middle school students middle school students focused deeply on the American government but how can we expect our children to become good citizens engaged in the future of democracy when are APS leadership

[00:18:00]
play it's open meetings and makes arbitrary decisions against science for some of us without transparency waiting until the final months of the school year to address an issue this important to the entire family scheduling is unacceptable when alternative enrollment applications have been finite since February additionally making the schools that are exception to the later start time at an East Mountain location sets up an increased likelihood of more to our snow delays which are largely based on whether the county has plowed the farthest stops on on our rural route a later start sets up greater chances for Success on so many levels the parents and community of Roosevelt Middle School respectfully request a meeting this month with our APS board member misdemeanors and APS task force representative a bus company representative specifically familiar with East Mountain routes students and families from all of our schools Roosevelt a Montoya

[00:19:00]
antonito Manzano so that they can all attend and that are questions and concerns can be addressed and we can figure out a solution together until next school year and entire year of community meetings open forums and inclusive discussions are needed in order to implement changes that will deeply affect our children are in our community day our community's daily life thank you thank you and board members that concludes public forum thank you thank you very much to all the speakers that came tonight I do want to just make a couple of statements on there for for Miss Anton if you'd like to get some more information on sfg let's set up some time you and I can talk about that and I can give you some ideas of why it's worded the way that it's worded and we can talk about that for sure I want to say thanks to

[00:20:00]
this man for the military connected families shout out that is great because we do do truly appreciate our children that are military connected and yes there's ongoing safety concerns and there was a demonstration out there tonight the district continues to address safety and in terms of calendars yes some start times and some issues we know that it's been a really difficult time for everyone so we can probably there's a call out for a discussion with board members but it's I just want to just have everybody understand that is really difficult because the changes came down from Santa Fe at a very late time to us as well because everything just got signed into law if you will around the changes in the things that we had to do so we're doing the best that we can but we as board members are definitely interested in meeting with our constituents and West Mesa when there's things that are going on the best way to get

[00:21:00]
aps.edu because if there's our events or things that are going on if you send it out to their they let us know and we can work from that but I haven't I haven't seen anything on my calendar but I would be interested in knowing when those events are all right so we'll be moving right along so what we're going to do now let me cuz you guys are shifting me out here so we're going to my next item is I have to go to my consideration for approval to adjourn to Executive session pursuant to the open meetings act and MSA 1978 section 10 15182 for the purpose of discussing a limited Personnel matter regarding the superintendent's contract do I have a motion on this I moved to Executive session pursuant to the open meetings act and Missy 1978 section 10 Dash 15 dash 1 H2 for the purpose of discussing
