[00:03:00]
yes yes did you say me I didn't hear that yes yes the next item is to consider approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on January 15th 2025 can I have emotion and a second I need to prove the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on January 15th 2025 this is board member Jackson thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please Crystal the instructions for public forum thank you welcome to our public forum guest when you

[00:04:00]
expectations which are presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agenda specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers you'll each have two minutes to speak otherwise you will have one minute tonight we have 24 speakers which means you have one minute to speak once your time is up you will be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message you may email board Ed at aps.com we have received many emails already in addition for those of you here tonight and representative from our service center is here to assist you Mr Gonzalez please introduce the speakers

[00:05:00]
thank you board member our first speaker and I'll be I'm going to try to call 2 in a row so our first speaker is around here followed by Daniel Tafoya Mr Mary at 1 minute once you begin speaking board my name is Ron Muir I was in 9th grade health educator and APS for 34 years I'm here to ask you to reconsider your vote to remove 9th grade health education on January 15th 2025

[00:06:00]
many of you on the board in the past few weeks have met with health Educators and health professionals in your town meetings and we thank you for that you've been updated informed and factual information regarding the difference between 8 and 9/8 Health standards once again I respectfully ask each of you on the board please bring batter up and vote against keeping nice or moving 9th grade down to 8th grade it's an injustice thank you very much thank you next speaker is Daniel Toyo followed by Vince case my name is Daniel I would like to discuss retaliation I told my story a couple months ago another substitute teacher was let go after report two weeks ago was found pictures taken of her falling asleep but for medication bottle by her side

[00:07:00]
turn on the floor again they were told to the principal nothing was done I'm getting upset that every time people report to APS APS police cover stuff up a police report done inappropriate dates wrong information left out again nothing was done higher management emailing saying oh it's inappropriate for her to get involved find out if she's their boss but if that people are reporting stuff that are giving to you guys and take it seriously to protect our students and protect the staff members thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Vince case followed by Dr Christine Miller good evening I'm Vince case and Environmental Education resource teacher at the aps Sandy Mountain Natural History Center in co-founding member of the aps Outdoor Learning team I'm happy to introduce

[00:08:00]
is there a positive impacts of Outdoor Learning on our APS students Outdoor Learning is a pedagogical approach to teaching and learning that provides place-based engaging Innovative culturally relevant and student-centered learning activities that can happen on or very near all school campuses research demonstrates The Outdoor Learning impact student achievement in math science Humanities creative problem-solving Cooperative skill development and health and wellness all third graders participate in an academic field experience at Los Padilla's Wildlife Sanctuary all fourth graders participate in the reverse ours field program with the Water Utility Authority and all 5th graders attend their College field program at the aps at 7:00 p.m. many APS students from over 90 School actively participate in school Gardens in numerous others participate in on campus Outdoor Learning opportunities over the past over the next few meetings including tonight you may hear Outdoor Learning stories from children teachers their parents and community members of the powerful impact this kind of learning has on them as human beings thank you very much thank you Mr Case next speaker is

[00:09:00]
Dr Muir followed by Modesto Hernandez Dr Mario have one minute good evening board I'm here again to respectfully ask you to bring health education graduation requirement back up to a vote and make it back into 9th grade I have received and reviewed the results of the graduation requirements survey and the question do you feel the New Mexico high school health standards should be part of APs Middle School course content did not produce valid or reliable results validated is accurate data reliable data refuse to data that can be trusted and you can make decisions with the question was confusing and did not explain that it would mean how fast would no longer be taught as required course in high school many comments from the questions the questions that it was confusing and of the strongly agree and a Greek question's 400 people and over 2000 people said it should be in both

[00:10:00]
middle and high school so they did not understand what they were being asked by that you as board members are charged with making potions that affect APS students based on valid and reliable data the day this did not happen please bring the health that requirement back to a vote and vote to keep health education graduation requirement in the high school thank you our next speaker is Modesto Hernandez followed by Ana Sanchez good evening board members my name is Modesto principal at Washington Middle School we are unique school because we have professional development slash collaboration embedded within our school day our instructional coach is able to meet with core contents teachers three times a week for 47 minutes during the school day in order to provide PD and collaborate with their teachers and support her students learning goals we believe that this is due to the unique embedded collaboration within the school day that our school

[00:11:00]
has been able to move from CSI to a traditional status based on the data from the Department of Education another reason contributing to increased academic progress that our school we believe is the social emotional social cultural and literacy initiatives we have embedded within our curriculum structures will have a second piece to this so you guys can get the data that we were going to present but thank you very much for your continued support of our work thank you next speaker is almost Sanchez followed by Annette youngren one minute good morning board members my name is Ana Sanchez I am the proud principal at Tony hillerman Middle School gothunder we are here today to show you some great things that are happening at Tony hillerman you'll be hearing a little bit from my 8th grade teacher who teaches not only regular and honors algebra and some of my students this evening some of you have the opportunity to view their projects that they worked very hard on it was like

[00:12:00]
play Capstone project that took them most of the semester to complete we are very proud that they had the opportunity to invite members from our community as well as teachers from other schools as well as people from the district we could not have done this or have that event without the support of the curriculum and instruction department and we are just very proud of the work the hard work that our students are doing thank you for your time tonight thank you ma'am our next speaker is Annette youngren followed by Marina you have one minute once you begin speaking hello my name is Annette youngren and I'm at 8th grade math teacher algebra one at Tony hillerman middle school thank you for the opportunity to for my students to present their work tonight it started as a project back in December kind of feeling in thinking they would work on just for me up their knowledge of linear equations and my students

[00:13:00]
just went above and beyond my wildest expectations so I came up with an idea for this math in and graphing Fair my principal said yes I talked to APS curriculum and instruction they said yes my students were judged by all kinds of folks they were nervous but they were so so proud of their work and I'm so proud of the work that they did they persevered they push themselves beyond anything that I think they could have even dreamed they could have done so thank you for the opportunity for them to be here tonight thank you thank you for next speaker is Marina Casanova you have one minute when you begin speaking good evening board members my name is Mariana and I'm the instructional coach at Washington Middle School this is a follow-up speech to my school principal Modesto Hernandez who spoke earlier Washington Middle

[00:14:00]
who is committed to APS phone number to by ensuring students receive grade level math instruction using just-in-time learning by analyzing data from illustrative math i-Ready IXL as well as student and teacher feedback while analyzing data and having curriculum and form conversations we noticed that our students were not fully engaging with the lawsuit of math curriculum which led to a variety of behavior and academics struggles within our math classroom based on that data and in collaboration with our Math teachers we decided to focus on training our Math teachers to incorporate math station work into their classroom with the support of APs District math resource personnel and with my support instructional coach Washington Middle School historical data from Mathis shows the students in Martinez population have steadily increased in their math scores in the year 2223 there was a 3.2 per cent increase in the 23

[00:15:00]
24 there was a 1.8 percent increase we're hoping that the math station work will support student growth and achievement thank you for your continued support at this work thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Annette Mayer and that are you there are you there are you there I saw you on muted okay I'm going to go to our next speaker hello my name is Ian I am

[00:16:00]
play comments for reference the data discussion from the last meeting in the superintendent report any questions from the board it was acknowledged that while other students are big improvements black students fell behind personally I was not impressed by the answers about the data point I appreciate that APS is working to support all marginalized groups of students who believe that more targeted action is necessary I believe the aps should draft and Implement an action plan on how to close this Gap and support black students more intentionally like a representation curriculum diversity in library books canceling Norms professional development disciplinary practices hiring parental and family engagement talk to Peds black Education Act team talk to black employees at APS could even focus groups of students and figure out what challenges and barriers they face I just want to remind everyone that these students from the data set last meeting are in first and second grade we have a chance to close that Gap by the time they graduate in the mid-2030s so please draft a plan thank you

[00:17:00]
thank you sir our next speaker is I believe it's to see Eduardo station Duarte I'm sorry you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you for having me my name is Stacia Duarte and the principal at Ernie Pyle middle school and I'm here to share some of the work that we are doing to meet go to and increasing efficiency for our students and Ernie Pyle so we have a focus of school white focus on academic vocabulary we're all over our teachers have had two days of training and coaching for implementing research highly effective vocabulary instruction and all of our classroom School way we have had training on structured collaborative conversations so we're working on getting our kids more engaged by talking about problem solving and solving problem together collaboratively that is implemented at least once per week in all of our classrooms across our campus we also been working closely with the district resource teachers have been coaching our teachers and working with them to create your own plans that focus on ensuring students are getting grade level instruction and our

[00:18:00]
anything on the standards of mathematical practice and high-level questioning also we have a focus on number talks and we have daily IXL construction for about 15 minutes every day and we have monthly family math night so we're engaging our families and students and doing math problem solving together which is been a big success we had 179 students at our families not people not students not families at our last event so thank you very much for your time thank you our next speaker is Laura Valdez hi you have one minute once you begin speaking you good evening board members my name is Miss Laura Valdez and I am an assistant principal at Van Buren Middle School Van Buren Middle School is initiating really concrete steps moving forward with go to this evening I'm going to speak just a little about that and the time I have I believe one of our Math teachers will be following

[00:19:00]
virtually so at Van Buren we are very committed to our goal to go to in math proficiency here's a couple of ways that we are addressing we are going to be aligning our strategies with just in time learning we're going to look at addressing our skill gaps as they arise so it's a very not spontaneous but a very in the moment consistent practice we are also looking at our very in-depth individualized instruction and we have our data-driven instruction which does in every direction we are hoping for a positive impact on our students and thank you for this opportunity good evening thank you I don't speak speaker is on Zoom Jessica thank you can you hear me yes ma'am

[00:20:00]
speaking sorry good evening board members my name is Jessica viento Mackie I'm the Prince the principal at Harrison Middle School at our school we are committed to APS school too by ensuring students receiving grade level math instruction while utilizing differentiation strategies are math department has been working with several District coaches and our sites instructional coach to incorporate these strategies we are already seeing the impact with 21% of our Martinez students testing proficient on their middle of your i-Ready math assessment you will hear further what we're working on with my assistant principal coming up soon and we thank you for your support and with this work and I hope you have a great evening thank you ma'am or Nick's speakers speaking

[00:21:00]
good evening members of the board and superintendent Blakey my name is Janessa McKillip and I'm a math teacher at Van Buren Middle School I wanted to briefly share how we're strengthening math instruction for our students this year our team has been working closely with District support to unpack math standards ensuring that all teachers have a deep understanding of what students need to know and be able to do we are also in the process of developing common formative assessments allowing us to measure student progress consistently across classrooms with the status we're driving our instruction intentionally identifying Trends adjusting our teaching strategies and implementing targeted interventions to support all Learners this process ensures that every student receives the support they need to grow and succeed in math looking at middle of your IXL data 59% of our students have already made one

[00:22:00]
more years of growth with 9% of those students making two or more years of growth we know that this growth will only continue for the remainder of the Year thank you for your time and continued support of our students thank you our next speaker is also on Zoom Tessie Francis period

[00:23:00]
the material to access the material at grade level this approach has helped our students grow in confidence in math proficiency thank you for your continued support thank you okay next speaker we're going to try again another you there yes I am one minute thank you

[00:24:00]
wiggle where students are focused on Improvement in math fluency students in all grades are committed to mastering their math facts in one minute our teachers collaborate regularly in our math department has been able to receive assistance on building thinking classrooms and Mathematics with the support of the curriculum instruction support teachers this intervention approach alongside the school-wide commitment to our wiggle has helped our students grow in confidence and math proficiency this year thank you for your continued support in this work thank you our next speaker is in person Amelia Robertson followed by Mary Walker Rivera Amelia Robertson

[00:25:00]
school board members and APS superintendent thank you for being here tonight I'm an EA and special education in a severe needs classroom in an APS Elementary School and my name is Mary Walker Herrera the book detrans tells about a daughter who suffered from deep depression and was going through medical gender transition but committed suicide at 19 years old by line in front of a train this is part of the coroner's report which reads located just east of her torso was a kidney and located a few feet south west of her torso just south of the north side of train tracks were multiple pieces of brain matter and unknown piece of one of her organs of skull and other human debris lgbtq plus young people are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers the Trevor Project estimates that more than 1.8 million lgbtq plus young people

[00:26:00]
seriously considered suicide each year in the United States and at least one attempt suicide every 45 seconds as school board members would you prevent this from happening in our community thank you for being here tonight and listening thank you our next speaker is in person Garen hochstetler followed by Madeline link now leaving now Garen you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you board members my name is Karen Hostetler representing myself I'm here today to encourage this board of education to continue providing Albuquerque's young people with an exclusive learning environment and to continue teaching accurate American history I know a recent executive orders trying to scare schools by threatening Federal funding ignore it fight it call the bluff go without those funds necessary but don't give in don't try to compromise if you stand up for students and stand up for Education most of us will back you up I can tell you that it won't stop

[00:27:00]
add Ginger kids and teens and you know that's true but we're not going to sacrifice the safety and respect of any of our young people because some adults want to play harmful politics with them we're drawing the line to protect trans kids and for teaching about race in history look I'm a white guy who was once a white kid reading books and listening in class about the messy history of our nation I never felt lumped in with prejudice people are blind I felt proud of the people who resisted I felt that motivated to continue their legacy of identifying and fighting and Justice today let's keep making this next year students proud together thank you thank you our next speaker is Madeline I'm sorry McAllister followed by Dr cinello Madeline you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening my name is Madeline and I'm a student at Harrison Middle School one of the only six grade students in Albuquerque Public Schools that is able to experience this type of learning these field trips are very beneficial in many ways like this it gives me something

[00:28:00]
look forward to during the school week it also gets me out of the classroom and lets me get a chance to go outside and learn about lots of different things it helps me with my mental health also because if I'm not having the greatest day I get to go to the boys get and get out and relax and take a breath of fresh air we learn about animals habitats nature in the environment all sorts of things it's also fun with Mr Woods being our teacher he always answers my questions and teaches me lots of new things while we were in the classroom he shows his cool experiments I always enjoy being in his class I'm very thankful for the way Mr was teaching us and all so taking us on the trip to the bus schedule

[00:29:00]
President's Day which happens to be Abraham Lincoln's birthday I'd like to remind us his quote we the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the man who pervert the Constitution he issued immense the Emancipation Proclamation and passed the 13th Amendment which abolish slavery and that includes human sex slavery the New Mexico constitutional Preamble begins with we the people of New Mexico grateful to almighty God for the blessings of liberty in order to secure the advantages of a state government do ordain and establish this constitution that said remember you're out of office section 2254 educational policy protecting children from indoctrination with gender etiology Senate 258 human sexuality education would require that sex education be taught in middle school instead of high school not being teaching about translate this is

[00:30:00]
so thank you and God bless you thank you sir our next speaker is Mr Adam Woods followed by Katy Perry have one minute sir hi folks my name is Adam Woods I am a science educator at Harrison Middle School you just heard from one of my students up here about her testimony about the merits of Outdoor Learning I'm going to share just a few more things that my students have shared with me and other observations that I've made about changes in my school and my students since implementing an outdoor learning program at Harrison I've seen increase engagement attendance has gone up student morale has gone up we've had reduced violence on campus period

[00:31:00]
continue to provide this type of learning for these students and I hope to have your support in doing that thank you thank you sir by next speaker is Katy Perry followed by Matthew Casey you have one minute once you begin speaking hi my name is Katy Perry for this project I learned a lot more about making equations for shapes and lines this project also help me understand my potential as a student and what I can do my teacher also help me understand my teacher also her help and encouragement push me to make my project better and understand my potential as a student

[00:32:00]
I really appreciate the opportunity to show my work and talk to you guys about what I learned and what I did thank you thank you man and our last speaker is Matthew Casey is Casey have one minute once you begin speaking good evening my name is Matthew Casey and I'm a student at 2000 Middle School in 8th grade and I'm going to also my math teacher I was also I also participated in the same project as Katie and I was really proud with my work at the end was younger and continue to push me until to make my work better keep telling me to not give up and really helped me be the best person I could during this project during this project I learned that I could use a graphing calculator for more than just math and to make art and it was probably one of my favorite projects I've done throughout School in general and I appreciate the opportunity to be able to come here and show my board to people and talk to you guys thank you

[00:33:00]
thank you sir and that completes public forum and thank you thank you president Gonzalez all right so tonight we will be monitoring interim goals 2.1 and 2.2 measuring math proficiency before we begin we need to confirm that our monitoring report is

[00:34:00]
I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report has been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests otherwise okay seen seen none we will move forward since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails those questions must be smart meeting they must be strategic measure Focus

[00:35:00]
ask oriented results-driven and time bound and as a reminder I would just like to remind board members that we need to be sure that we are asking questions that are based only on the information that is presented to us in the document if there are questions that we have outside of the document then we can use the request for information process that we are in the process of establishing so I will just be making sure that the questions that we ask tonight are based on information that is presented before us so with that I'm going to start my ride and I will go with board member tapioca Romero you got it thank you remember Jackson and I will start off with when I was reading the report initially I had a question at the first part of it and I highlighted

[00:36:00]
you're anticipating what is coming up next and you're already problem solving and I just I need to acknowledge that so great job this was probably one of my favorite reports that I read obviously it shows progress and it shows growth and I loved the intentionality behind the statements but I want to ask more behind the attachment and the teacher toolkit if you don't mind so can you tell me a little bit more about the strategy behind the tool and how does it impact individual teachers at individual Schools Board member 30 nodding like you're like yes so the

[00:37:00]
oh you just gave is an exact example of student outcomes Focus governance and us actually taking a look at middle of your data and realizing that where we're at right now yes we're seeing growth but we want more growth we want students farthest away from opportunity to have the same growth as all other students and in looking at the data we knew that it was imperative the way that we're going to improve student outcomes is the through line between our board goal down to assistant superintendents assistant superintendents down to the principal down to the teacher and then down to our end user to the student we have to impact the daily experience of all of our students insurance that we provide high-quality instruction at grade level providing differentiation for all of our focus group students with Justin Time learning and that students have access to high-quality instructional material at grade level

[00:38:00]
and the teacher toolkit was developed in response to the data and where we're at we still see some stagnation for some student groups which makes us believe that in doing a root cause analysis that the data is telling us that the interventions that are provided and instruction they're still variability so we can scale best practices across every school we're going to compound that increase in student performance and how we do this is ensuring that all teachers and principals have at their fingertips all the readily available resources curriculum strategies so we thought okay what can we do to ensure that this knowledge this opportunity knowledge is available so we developed What's called the m o y teacher toolkit I sent out an email on Friday last week that went to all middle school principals they forward

[00:39:00]
email to all middle school middle school math teachers this toolkit is a comprehensive list when we think about looking at data at the district we look at data district-wide we look at school data we look at classroom data what we what we're doing at schools is taking it further we look at District data School data classroom data and individual student data this toolkit really supports teachers and looking at individual student data by identifying skill gaps where are students what are the skill gaps what we saw our students specifically in both 6 and 7th grade gaps in Geometry so this will provide teachers the ability to log into the teacher Resource page which has our APS units of study you can then take a look at a coherence map so when you look at a 7th grade or sixth grade math standard it can go into directions

[00:40:00]
standards that grade level it can go to the left on the coherence map identifying skill gaps that students need to be able to access grade level content it also goes the opposite direction which shows you when you learn these skills and you'll be able to access Knowledge and Skills in compounding grades so we're really getting intentional of how we are looking at data but really trying to ensure that we get it down to the end user the student and that interventions are provided for our focus group students fabulous I love hearing how your like you said the word I think three times very intentional about what we're doing and not just look surface level but we're going down to see how we can address the issue so great job thank you guys okay board member

[00:41:00]
thank you thank you all for being here this evening and thank you for providing a wonderful report it's always nice to get good news and as I did last time I hope they're listening 6 and 7th graders good job keep it up keep making progress I know you're out there we appreciate you and I know it's not easy to do this work so my question is can you get to it so it looks like both groups are having issues with geometry and I feel their pain so what changes are enhancements can be made to the sixth and seventh grade math curriculum what's strategies do you have to better address the gaps in Geometry skills and if you get give us for everybody here a little more context about that would be fantastic thank you support member benefits board members superintendent Dr Blakey thank you for the question so what's interesting about when we look at geometry that specific skill

[00:42:00]
they talked about the importance of numeracy and literacy and what we see in the data is that our students are actually having gaps and learning at the elementary grade levels when it comes to Geometry so we're thinking of this not just in one single point in time coherence and a comprehensive way of doing business it's going to take all hands on deck to improve math proficiency for the students of Albuquerque Public Schools I don't want to get too far off the question but I do want to take a moment just to think I'm from Tony hillerman also Ana Sanchez the principal and the students that presented tonight I didn't want it to get away from me and then just gratitude for all of our teachers students and families that have chosen Albuquerque Public Schools and also want to support Improvement in math proficiency but going back to Geometry specifically

[00:43:00]
knowing that that's a skill Gap that would be an example of accessing the teacher toolkit specifically taking a look at the grade level standards and then identifying those skill gaps for geometry one of the examples I have is like surface area I'm also fractions being able to progress through geometry and knowing fractions but specifically using manipulatives to learn geometry so we look at multimodal and differentiated instruction actually having teachers use tangible of visuals manipulatives that they can actually use this representation for their students so that's another area that were strategically working on is providing really concrete math tasks that provide rigor and relevance to students that they cannot just learn math with learn it through its fluency and conceptual understanding one last thing that we're doing is that were providing opportun

[00:44:00]
to be able to speak listen and explain what they know about math what you saw outside of the boardroom in room which makes me really proud is when we have students actually talk about what makes them happy and proud at school and we create environments and conditions that actually make students happy and proud it really improves do not come so specifically to Geometry once again using multimodal differentiated instruction using manipulatives where students can have Hands-On learning I'm looking at skill Gap specifically identifying the grade level standard and then providing just in time learning for those students okay thank you so much I'm actually going to go online president Gonzalez are you ready to go next

[00:45:00]
I am ready to go next so I do have a question but I also have a follow-up question to the Q&A so looking at the first question you in a document which was essentially around typical growth for 6th grade math morning to Iran and so the chart on page 3.22 is the 4.2% points is an increase in the number of students who are honorable so not necessarily but increased from

[00:46:00]
I'm going to kind of give them the opportunity to see if they did you guys hear the question or do you want to repeat it back okay can you just repeat your question just one more time so in the technical and Technical question number two points the percentage of students who are on or about grade level for the increase in terms of grade level

[00:47:00]
.2 I just want to clarify that and then follow up board member Gonzalez members of the board Dr Blakey to your question you are correct the 4% of students are now on or above grade level our focus group students and I'd like to expand a little bit about typical growth and stretch growth just because how important it is for us to have consistency I talked about variability instruction and grade level standards in order to achieve students from going from one grade below grade level or two grade levels below where they're at students have to for two consecutive years meet their stretch growth goals within the i-Ready diagnostic so that means for two consecutive years they have to go past typical growth typical growth is

[00:48:00]
on Norm reference as a mean nationally so that's what's measured typically when students are provided instruction they will meet that typical growth we as a district have to go above and beyond for two consecutive years for all of our students are two years behind that's hence why we have an adjustment and we're challenging the system by having a teacher middle of your toolkit we do not have a day that can pass where students are not in a classroom in the ideal state of learning that is at grade level that has an environment where students that have skill gaps are provided differentiation so that they can access grade level contents so it's imperative that we have high quantities of high quality instruction every minute of every day and all of our classrooms

[00:49:00]
thank you so we have 4.2% more of the targeted student groups who are on grade level than were at the beginning of the year and we know what is the typical growth stretch for those students can you share then what was the delta or the group between I think it's more complicated than that what you're asking I'm trying to understand how what I read the report for 4.2 points we've increased 4.2% points is what the report said so it's not necessarily Boi is 4.2 what I just heard was the 4.2 is just being

[00:50:00]
and so my question is but the link that you sent show the charts and then there was a link below to curriculum Associates website to further explain what is typical growth stretch Road and according to their site typical growth for 6th grade math is 20 points so what I'm trying to understand is typical growth for sixth graders and I ready and what's the difference between Gonzalez Chris West is at the table so all your questions there's too many

[00:51:00]
doctors around here let me do my best here so there's a couple things going on here so what we're saying in the goal is that like like Mr Garcia said that the percentage of students who are on grade level did increase from beginning to the middle of year by 4.2% points what you're talking about board member Gonzalez is when we look at it when you hear the phrase typical growth or stretch growth in the world of irony typical growth is saying let's listen to the test as a sixth grader and I got 200 points I don't know what the right numbers are real numbers I got 465 so I'm not on grade level if you use that chart we provided because it says that I'm basically doing equivalently to have a

[00:52:00]
at the end of the year so every student they is the 50% tile of those kids so 50 kids that are somewhere to Chris that scored that way just based on my beginning of your score this is what I'll have at the end of the year so the goal there is that in order to that Chris becomes green or becomes on grade level I have to actually exceed that typical growth so that I move and out of my one grade level below category I need to do better so I think what you're asking for member Gonzalez and we can if we can provide you with data or to the board excuse me that shows what is that growth look like across our students like what's the average growth that we're seeing in those student groups is that correct so

[00:53:00]
I think what this is probably simpler than all she's asking is how much did the Ozzie Martinez students grow from beginning of the year to middle of the year so in terms of grade level 4.2% of them increased as in they were not on grade level for and now they are a great levels were looking at 465 and if we were just attracted to what's the average growth that we're seeing is I believe that she's taking her head yes we're more than happy to provide that's just something I had in my on my phone so president Gonzalez it sounds like the answer to your specific question maybe is is not

[00:54:00]
so I feel like we're celebrating the growth but we actually don't know how good that makes sense to hear the question

[00:55:00]
I'm trying to find protocol but also enter technical questions yes so I would say on the country it is a celebration because what we're looking for there is we're trying to move them onto a trajectory of being on grade level and the way that the internal assessments work is telling us that 4.2% more of the students are now on trajectory to be on grade level than they were before and with the idea the way that because I already is Criterion Bass by that it's all the standards that we expected to help students know and demonstrate that they can do and in this case 6 and 7th grade how many of those are they able to demonstrate and deal with the idea that as the year progresses more of them will be able to demonstrate that knowledge so when we use it for Progress monitoring we need to see that number go up every year and in order for us to have better end of your outcomes measured by the MMS to say

[00:56:00]
the state Summit of assessment we need to see more growth happen so our goal is always to see when we look from Boi to Moi we want to see it can we get more than 4.2% points cuz we know we're doing that we're doing something different that will then lead to continued growth as they move from the beginning to the end of year which is also telling us that they're mastering the standards that they'll need to be able to answer the questions on the final test so that makes it is a measure of success but we're also acknowledging that we're saying that we want to get kids all kids to grow across those levels so the reason why we're talking about trash typical growth and stretch growth is saying that we want all students to move on to grade level and that's where we use that with our conversations inside of the schools and I play planes teaching learning to see what are we doing and that's where we talked about accelerated learning and really like stretch clothes for us is a measure of accelerated learning like are we doing more

[00:57:00]
so what is a strategy that we deployed that didn't work given the data on page 3112

[00:58:00]
a strategy you deployed that did not work on page 3463506 were seen variation in student outcomes so even though it's a focus of ours and we're trying to scale best practices any one of anytime you see a skill Gap in variation you can question the

[00:59:00]
Dior the consistency of instruction and the use of high-quality instructional materials at grade level so that's one example of a strategy that we're using that still needs refinement and a broader understanding hence why we scale the teacher toolkit in those resources thank you remember you so much for all of your work it was it's always hard for me to find strategic questions after reading your reports so that's good and my question actually goes off of this is question as well so in both 2.1 and 2.2 we see a projected increase in proficiency but not enough to reach our goal of 22.6% and 19% and you did mention that there is a gap in Geometry for students

[01:00:00]
so what are some of the setbacks or barriers that students are facing in geometry and I know you touched on this a little bit when it comes to like Elementary School and how the toolkit can assess those gaps so if you can just give me some more answers on that board member store the members of the board doctor Blakey thank you for your question so specifically for barriers for geometry and students in 6th grade some examples of surface area volume spatial reasoning and graphing points fundamental math skills persistent from elementary schools particularly infractions and proportional reasoning the pandemics lasting effects still disruptive student learning and consistently have some effects on math instructions and then again the need for more targeted differentiation strategies for students

[01:01:00]
disabilities in English language Learners to improve specifically growth for geometry skills a couple of examples as a math person so I really like math and I really like middle school so this is my favorite person geometry is actually the most language-based part of math and so what Mr Garcia was alluding to as well is that you see more language in terms in Geometry then you do in other math concepts like algebra so the English language Learners particularly usually do struggle with geometry concepts as part of the language based part of geometry and so we have to be more strategic and how we're teaching geometry because of

[01:02:00]
the heaviness of the language behind geometry and general with geometric terms and yes I was leaning towards is in elementary school in order to get sixth graders on track do we have to work more on language development or like what type of those setbacks are we seeing in order to make sure that students are understanding like service area thank you for that I'd like to just mention something about specifically and with a specifically what they call mlrs which is the use of language routines within the classroom so when we talked about elevating instructional math practices specifically providing students the opportunity to speak listen and engage with others in collab

[01:03:00]
in how to solve math problems but both by explaining to others by being able to listen to others and give them feedback of how they are understanding math is an example but really geometry is an opportunity for us to build on students language acquisition in addition to student teachers intentionally identifying language objectives within their lesson planning and Alignment to the standards being taught thank you I wanted to add on just something that we found out in our analysis you know looking especially since geometry showed up as a an area that we need to work on and to Dr blakey's point about it being so language rich in our units of study geometry is also our first unit of the Year for all grade levels so when we think about helping students see their mouths identity and sort of

[01:04:00]
to the practices that Mr Garcia was referencing I think we probably need to revisit that sequencing this is the time when students are getting to know their teacher they're building their relationships they are doing these math routines right the teacher is teaching them how to talk about math which is a really key part of the curriculum but I'm not sure geometry is the best place to start with that and it's it's a hypothesis but I really want to explore that it was we continue in this work like because it is so language rich like what what might be a better place to start particularly is where building relationship identity and sensible belongings in the classroom it's hard not to suggest things but that was a great yes yes and then just one more follow up since we are since it was brought up about the English language Learners I know that we have some

[01:05:00]
grocery classes that are offered in Spanish does that start at 6:30 or is that different across the board member store members of the board doctor Blakey we have dual language opportunities for students beginning in kindergarten all the way to 12th grade so we do celebrate the Dual language students to be able to acquire content in two languages which is important that we are fateful to program Fidelity in terms of making sure that we execute programs with proper sequence from here to here so does that include like sixth grade geometry in Spanish that students may be able to thank you ok Google

[01:06:00]
this conversation to me sounds a lot like rude analysis and I would love to see this happen in reports so I think one of my questions was about why do we have two evidence and plan or evidence and the very last section of your page and it wasn't I wasn't being snarky I was like there was a strategy right if there's a strategy that's connecting 678.000

[01:07:00]
miss that so if we could have more of this in the reports that would be wonderful of the progress monitoring reports is that the root cause analysis analysis section is included when we're off track and so when we are off track you would see a section that has more of a root cause analysis now this team because they're overachievers they did do a root cause analysis anyway on the growth but it's not included in the report because the the report was on track so you don't see the you know work that they did in discussing the root cause analysis particularly in this report because it was on track so there's not a root cause analysis section where there is a root cause analysis

[01:08:00]
Melissa section that is required in any report that's off track correct but I mean we end up getting it anyway because it's part of your work it's part of the vision and that I appreciate that we're not satisfied with typical growth that we're going for stretch growth and I think that's important for the public to know so much but I'm just checking in what's the root cause of stagnation in 2021 and 2023 scores

[01:09:00]
data on on 2.1.1 the 2223 I believe so there was one year that 2021 through 23 there's there's a it's 12.4 mid-year and then there's a jump but I don't want to get to the gym for historical knowledge yes but really analyzing the data that's in 2024 2025 because these are sixth graders each year they're different sets of students so if students are coming in at 5. 7 4 4

[01:10:00]
beginning of your for the 6th graders that were in 6th grade that year the 6th graders this year are at 9.1% when they came into 6th grade as their Boi but because it's a different subset of students each year for the test that are not really comparable in that way as far as where the growth is on the test okay so it's just in terms of guidance for us these are all different cohorts so really to analyze the data for the board you're really looking at is their growth from Boa

[01:11:00]
question

[01:12:00]
was clarified that we can but that's not a that there's no way to know the root cause for the stagnation in 21 323 is that correct because the purpose of this report because we just analysed 2024 to 20 251 increase in middle of the Year 2023 to 2024

[01:13:00]
2024 to my 2025 but I don't want to waste time on question mark

[01:14:00]
okay so what caused the 1.2 Point declined in Moi scores from 2023 to 2024 to this year 202425 inconsistent instructional delivery or targeted schools challenges and scaling differentiation strategies for students for this from proficiency potential scheduling conflicts with limited professional development time or teacher collaboration so some schools have built it in and found a way to have that PLC time work teachers can really dig deep into the data assessment and the strategies being

[01:15:00]
and then again just continued struggles in Geometry we have compounded over multiple grade levels thank you what conversations are being had now about addressing what you just identity was alluding to as well as we did actually have more collaboration time last year for elementary and middle schools it was a little bit of a chaotic calendar but they did have professional development time built-in and this year they don't have that so we have lost the collaboration

[01:16:00]
so we are working on how we can schedule more collaboration time for Middle School in elementary school teachers to have particularly to make sure that they're able to have that collaboration time because the teachers do have less collaboration time so as the team was discussing you know the data being at the student level and teachers being able to really get their hands into house students individually are doing they need time to be able to do that and this year we've really struggled with Middle School in elementary teachers having time so part of our Middle School redesign work as well as looking at how we can open up more time for Middle School teachers particularly to have time for collaboration okay and so how do we help with that

[01:17:00]
I think you'll see maybe some of it in the budget would be kind of where you would be able to see how the board could help is in how we're allocating funds to make sure that teachers have time so particularly in looking at Middle School scheduling if you look at the budget you would see that we would need to increase funding for some of our middle schools to be able to allow for the collaboration for example that Miss Hernandez from Washington was speaking about she's done that with some creative scheduling but she needs a little bit more FTE to be able to do it for her whole school so you would as a board you would be able to see to help us with it and how we prioritize the budget for this upcoming next school year for advocating what day does supports the discuss

[01:18:00]
in key observations by Focus Group particularly regarding the impact of culturally responsive practices and targeted interventions for example we recognize that there is a constant in the evening in regards to African American students and really working to ensure that there is space to ensure a sense of belonging that will begin to support a student's ability to persevere

[01:19:00]
in mathematics for example and one of the specific strategies that we're using is taking the lessons learned from our high schools in regards to the space being our black student unions and taking that model to our middle schools it is a beginning where are Equity department is working to take that pathway if you will from our high schools and bringing it down to our middle school so there's space for students to identify their space just students to persevere to have an adult a trusted adult to be able to be mentored by and to work with another example for that student group on the direction of our superintendent is really working intentionally and strategically to recruit and retain African-American teachers and we have had

[01:20:00]
Mr Carothers from our Equity Department begin the process of recruiting teachers as some historically black colleges and universities that work is in its infancy and we look forward in the next couple of years to see what fruits will come from that labor but it is a good intentional step to really work to provide space and this is one example there's others and I want to just say one thing about this specific report and I cannot tell you that I want to capitalize on what are superintendent said we did a root cause analysis on this one and many ways this report there was a lot of Labor that went into it because we needed to understand how we can ensure achievement and student outcomes and every one of our schools and every one of our math classrooms so this

[01:21:00]
we dug deep in the data we dug deep in the student data to really look and see what are the gaps what are the skill gaps what is the strategy is the strategy we presented last time working how do we adjust you're going to see adjustments in this report based on the last one because we recognized that we need to be specific and intentional and I just really want to commend the team for the hard work that went into this report I think Mr Garcia may have additional information information I have some notes what I call stories from the data highlighting some different things different schools did but specifically Native American students break barriers at Tony hillerman Middle School 24 native

[01:22:00]
American 7th grade students reflecting the highest Improvement rate for any focus group at the school this progress resulted from sheltered instruction and data-informed planning combined with increased professional development for teachers on culturally relevant practices why this matters the growth emphasizes the impact of combining culturally responsive teaching with academic rigor offering a potential model for replication across other schools and what I want to say is on my notes I have highlighting success but something that in my leadership role right now when I was getting prepared for this meeting I was feeling a little bit nervous and I have to shift my mindset from being nervous to really saying what a privilege I have to be in a position like this to be able to have such a profound impact on the outcomes of students

[01:23:00]
student outcomes don't change until adult behaviors change as we were preparing for this report as I Was preparing some goal 3 data I was looking at in relation to graduation rates and knowing that Algebra 1 is a is a is a course that can either have a profound impact on a student being successful in high school and graduating or not and I think wow so passionate about go to and this privilege that I have is I have the opportunity to speak in front of Educators and when I speak about go to specifically and the connection to College and Career Readiness and this actually being a deciding factor whether a student has a wife After High School that diploma what it means what I know is that if you have a high school diploma over 40

[01:24:00]
close to 38000 more than of than someone who doesn't have a diploma what I know is that if you don't have a high school diploma it also the life expectancy is 9 years maybe 9 years shorter than someone who has a high school diploma so when I talked about stretch growth and having two years two consecutive years of our students having high quality instruction at grade level we don't have time to wait and what what I believe is that no we're not satisfied we're not celebrating I want to see 100% of students proficient I want to go above our goals because of what I just talked about when I talk about this in front of Educators in our community I have not met one person who doesn't want to walk arms as a community and reach this goal so I'm calling to action everybody in

[01:25:00]
Albuquerque Albuquerque Public Schools that if we collectively lock arms all hands on deck contribute to this goal we can meet and exceed our goal because we know the importance of it but I do want to say that I do want to give us permission along the way when we do see celebration I talked to students out in front of the board meeting and part of their presentations were what made him happy and proud and those little celebrations for our students and teachers go a long way so anytime the smallest of improvements we're going to I'm going to encourage us to embrace those so that we can compound those small celebrations to meet 8th grade math for efficiency for all students I love that answer your stories from the data we need to hear them too because we're removed

[01:26:00]
Native Americans at Tony hillerman is that correct I mean give me that information because I want to share it out in the community I mean that's that's huge so I appreciate your ball call it pragmatic passion because you're right it's a muted celebration however I think it's critical 24% is not so scary

[01:27:00]
go a long way for a black students it matters so thank you thank you for the report okay I wish that I had a chance to ask my question before Mr Garcia gave his mic drop moment because now I kind of feel like I'm the fly in the ice cream so I'm the worm in the tequila like I so I'm kind of sorry that I have to do this but it is my job to be skeptical and critical so when I look at page 3 but when I look at both graphs I noticed in this kind of Harkens back to my discussion from last time with the literacy goal the slopes of the curve last with gold won the slope of the curve was increasing and when I just visually look at these

[01:28:00]
it seems as though the slope of the curve for 2425 is decreasing and it like it's not as steep right here's my math it's not as steep it's a little bit I also noticed that we are just barely to the end of your goal right the end of your goal for the the point that I'm looking at is 19.6 and we're gosh my eyeballs 19.99 and we got to 19.65% are you that the strategies that you have implemented implemented with this report which I noticed there are new strategies that are different from

[01:29:00]
the last report so how confident are you that the strategies from from this report are going to impact that slope of the curve so that we're not just barely getting to it to reference our discussions we're not just meeting the target we're stretching so you've talked a little bit about the toolkit but I would be interested to know of the other strategies that you have listed what is your confidence level that they are going to the system and then I will have a follow-up I know board member Jackson or Dr Blakey specifically your analysis of the data I think we have similar thoughts analysis to try to ship

[01:30:00]
response to the data in real time and a couple of things that were implementing is having assistant superintendent Christopher Sanchez is it all Middle School staff meetings to go over District goals and go to specifically with the middle schools also talked about District level math data their actual School level math data to talk about the goal to strategic plan and the focus areas to really encourage Math teachers to also use the resources available to them like the math Resource page in additional principal Leadership Academy where we're working right now this was launched in January or secondary principles or actually in cohorts working specifically on their professional development in alignment to the Strategic plan

[01:31:00]
can I talked about earlier in order to improve student outcomes and that daily experience in the ideal state of learning and really supporting teachers and their pedagogy and practice but specifically principles and understanding all of the standards all of the curriculum the the aps units of study all of those things themselves so that they can support teachers in that so we have a Mad Dash to the end of your testing and like I said it's all hands on deck if you want to thank you mister and thank you for the question board member Jackson is different about these strategies and why I have confidence is that they are in the school so one thing that I think maybe just something

[01:32:00]
we're very big district and so getting these specific PDS getting what is just in time for Teacher support for principal support is a challenge because we're big and we've tried some sort of really broad strategies but I don't think we've been experiencing the success that we could buy going directly into the school so when the assistant superintendent goes to the staff meetings and says hey I want to make sure you are aware of this like let's talk a little bit about the data not as a your bad or this is wrong but rather is like did you know and started to the toolkit going directly to the teacher the next step is a weekly Cadence of follow-up make you got this big tool kit well let's look at the units of study let's look at the resource page let's look at thinking classrooms so on a regular schedule we're just really send

[01:33:00]
sing the resources directly to the people who need them and so I feel confident because we're getting into the classroom and in the conversations that the associates and I have we're often that's sort of our whoa like like we can do this work but how do we make sure it gets to the classroom and so this strategy is our attempt to indeed do that and I'm cautiously confident and I would say board member Jackson and members of the board that I am confident in it because we have become much more intentional and consistent in the language that we use amongst from the district to the classroom in ways that I don't think it's been before where it's from the district conversations to the classroom that people know that we're focused on middle school math and looking at the specific students and the growth and so the more cohesive that we are strategically about

[01:34:00]
play you can feel it in the schools in the classroom and so it's not like a flavor of the day that oh well but next year we're going to have a totally different goal so the more that we're able to articulate that from the district to the classroom there is a sense of ownership amongst the schools that this is what they're working on and I think that I personally go to classrooms the teacher to hear from hillerman I've been and she's a middle school math teacher so when I did a middle school visit I've gone into the middle school math classrooms myself to see what's happening and sometimes I'll come back and tell the team that was great or you should go check this customer so I I think that you know that just sets the like Vision in to reality in the classroom that everybody knows that this is what's expected in that we're keeping the growth the same because I think people wait for a shift in well we

[01:35:00]
has been very good at being clear with the principles and the teachers that this is the work that we're doing so that actually leads perfectly into my follow-up is these new strategies I'm going to assume our reaction to the data that you were saying yes okay so how how are you going to drive accountability towards this new reaction that you're having reaction to this data how are you going to drive accountability I think I'm looking at because I feel like he was going to see what he jumped for them and some of the work that missed talked about with Mr Sanchez who's in the back room

[01:36:00]
Mr Sanchez is the supervisor of the principals for middle school and that's why I say that is not because he works extremely hard but that that connection to this is were inspecting what we expect with the schools and so from the curriculum team to the principal supervisor to the accountability of the principal of the supervisor going to staff meetings there's a sense of accountability on the principal has very much increased because of the involvement of the assistant superintendents in this work coupled with that we also have the 90 day plans which are looked at with goals on so the 90-day plan gold teams at the school are now intentionally looking at these goals to make sure that as they do their 90 Day plans were not all over the place with schools

[01:37:00]
from the district teams in the accountability that were doing from the supervisor of the principals to the classroom walkthroughs through the guardrails where we're looking at specifically our priority and emerging schools and what curriculum were using in the classroom and being really intentional babe I mean last question is there anything that you really want to highlight that was not highlighted through our questioning that I think would be good response to your question of accountability these schools are translated into what is called a scorecard every school has a scorecard and based on the goals we have their individual data we have their individual

[01:38:00]
Target and based on the work of supper Mr West and his team they are populated with their stretch goals so every school has the same tool that Mr Sanchez uses with them to facilitate the conversation not once a year not twice a year not three times a year but several times a year along the lines of these goals so the thing is the thing the conversation is the same the tools are the same regardless of level regardless of school regardless of principal supervisor we have the same principle leadership tool and the same scorecards differentiated Bike level for obvious reasons but that is a tool that is driving to accountability very specifically with the very specific School level data

[01:39:00]
to ensure common language and common expectation thank you Doctor Gonzalez Gonzalez okay all right so I would like to thank board members for this very productive conversation now we must vote on whether or not we will accept the monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and that we now have a deeper understanding of how the current reality first students lines up with our vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions I'll ask them individually does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal is their growth towards the vision

[01:40:00]
and is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward division all right so the answer to all three sorry I didn't even look at the okay if the answer to the answer to all of these is yes so the board can accept the monitoring report confident that data is accurate and the superintendent is performing so at this point I will turn it back over to our board president Jackson at this point we will entertain a vote to accept this monitoring report please I moved to accept the progress monitoring reports for interim goals 2.1 and 2.2 math proficiency this is number Jackson this is supposed to thank you we have a motion in a second can we have a roll call vote please yes

[01:41:00]
Benavides to Dallas to Savannah Dominguez yes yes yes yes so the motion carries thank you again superintendent and the team the next item on our agenda is to consider approval of Grant budget adjustments we have as presenters brunette Opa Locka Chief finance officer and Rosalinda Montoya executive director of budget and strategic planning can I have a motion and a second for consideration of approval of the grant budget adjustments I moved to approve the grant budget adjustments this is member Jackson second this is board member benefits thank you we have a motion and a second is there any discussion or questions

[01:42:00]
Josefina Dominguez yes or Ajax yes thank you we'll move on to are the motion carries we will move on to our next agenda item which is agenda item 7.1 where board Secretary of store will outline her plans for representing District 1 during her temporary absent absence excuse me are presenter is board secretary Janella story I'll turn it over to you thank you president Gonzalez so as many of my board members know I will be on leave pretty soon so I just wanted to lay out my plan on when I would be in person virtual and when I will not be available so the next important thing that I will be at is our February 28th training for USG I also have my district event this Saturday February 22nd which I will be at obviously during the week of the 24th so next

[01:43:00]
make my plan is to start adding automatic responses to my email and make sure that all questions that I get as a board member is I guess moved to board Services I also have planned to train the next person that is doing the time use evaluation so I will get with that person and make sure that they are all cut up on time use I have a couple of community meetings as well that I will be wrapping up before my leave and I also have to send some notices to committees about my leave as well we also have a plan for me to do electronic signatures as secretary as needed if there's anything that comes up on that plan on that side so that is all happening next week I do have an in-person event that I will be attending on March 14th at Rio Grande High School which is a trades event that we're partnering with the plumbers Union Local 412 which is really exciting

[01:44:00]
on my plan is to be completely out March through May so no virtual no emails no nothing like that and then coming back June virtually and catching up on everything that I've missed so June and July will be virtual and then August I plan to be fully in person and back and things so that's my plan but is there any questions or concerns about any of any of that I appreciate it yeah I'm excited to community members if there is anything that you need I would just say to reach out to board Services they are happy to be of service to you all and I I know that they will answer the way I would answer so I feel good about

[01:45:00]
I'm leaving things to me a couple of months and if there's anything that I can do with my time that it's still here just please send me an email or a text or anything and let me know so I'll pass it back to you president Gonzalez great thank you secretary and congratulations again we will move on to the next item on our agenda which is agenda item number 8 the president's report so first regarding public forum although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that you were heard and that we're working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that we heard about tonight were regarding Outdoor Learning health education goal to Tony hillerman Middle School fair and also heard about goals 1.1 and goals 1.2 protecting transgender students Children's Health and well-being and inclusive policies as far as our upcoming meetings February 26th is our next finance committee meeting our next board

[01:46:00]
meeting will be March 5th and during this meeting we will have a budget presentation and will also nominate an adult who has contributed to enhancing student achievement at the district level for a New Mexico School boards Association award we will also have consent items from the February 3rd policy committee and February 26th finance committee the March 19th regular board of education has been canceled due to spring break but we will have a finance committee meeting on March 26th moving on to agenda item number 9 our next item is to consider approval for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section 10 dash 15182 for the purpose of discussing a limited Personnel matter regarding the superintendent's evaluation we have emotion and a second please consider approval for the Board of Education to be in executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section 10 Dash 152 for the purpose of discussing a limited person
