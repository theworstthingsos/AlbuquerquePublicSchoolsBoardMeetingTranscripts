[00:09:00]
yes Madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder hello I'm Melissa Arellano senior director for mlss and I can answer that question currently APS has zero mlss coaches be hired this school year 2324 because it did have MLS coaches for 2324 so will they be hard sometime this year school year yes okay but you don't know you don't have no idea exactly how many there will be or wherever you will approve for okay for positions know I was thinking the gallery any other questions would be

[00:10:00]
are we going to be able to find them I'm very hopeful that will be able to find them so we hope to post those as soon as possible will that funding carry over into something else if we are unable to fully higher so right now it is specifically for the fiscal year 24 so I don't know if it would carry over into next year it is short-term funding at this time but we do have 35 schools who have shown interest in MLS coaching and these coaches can also help provide professional development to all schools for mlss right now we have two sad liaison whose primary focus is sat they do train on mlss but again we have 0 MLS has coaches so we're looking forward to the support thank you

[00:17:00]
I know it's going to be put to very good use by those two schools and is very much appreciated I agree thank you and for that I will move for approval of the gifts grants and donations of more than $5,000 I will second thank you Miss King Mobile Alabama next item for consideration and action is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars this is for Life accidental death and dismemberment insurance and long-term disability and oh goodness why do I struggle every month on your name Chancellor I was just like okay you have the phone yes I'm so sorry

[00:18:00]
what's the temperature members of the board superintendent Elder I'm requesting consideration of approval for the purchase of purchase of Life accidental death and dismemberment insurance and long-term disability insurance this is using a state of New Mexico RFP through iMac which is a Consortium of different agencies we work with and we have two vendors one is Hartford Hartford and the other one is standard the budget is estimated at 15 million + 49664096000766 for 40 year contract and with that I'm happy to answer any questions thank you any questions so the only thing I mean I had most of the answer but we have seagull Consulting and our portion was the 17,000 so every time we're doing this every year paying that about 17,000

[00:19:00]
agencies and it is a fee for the consultant to do that it's a one-time fee okay thank you thank you any additional questions if not I have emotions that equals or exceeds Turner 50,000 dollars live accidental death and dismemberment insurance and long-term disability insurance I will thank you very much for consideration is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals are exceeds

[00:20:00]
I am requesting consideration of approval for the purchase of copier leases for the graphics and copy print shops the vendor is 0x it's using a state procurement Microsoft okay I am requesting approval for the Microsoft licensing and support services this is using a CD the contractor is as vendor is CDW using an e and i Cooperative agreement the estimated cost of 6 million dollars for five year contract utilizing Capital funds I'm happy to answer any questions thank you any questions I mean I know you answered already my question about how it has gone up so much and I'm still confused about

[00:21:00]
about the answer I know everything's just more expensive but this was kind of really considerably more expensive and I know you talked about how just how difficult it is and how complex it is and so that really accounts for that like almost $60,000 increase right after yeah Dr Bowman he just said yes yes yes yes yes yes that's fine that's fine I mean it's okay you can talk to me and it'll be like yes I know it is just just more everything's just more expensive and I can't I get that I just thought if we have less students and we have you would think less licenses less staff that that would make up but I guess it didn't obviously no just say no

[00:22:00]
Rising faster than our staff were declining and and you know maybe in a couple years this will be a little different as the SR dollars kind of like I mean I can't tell the future but that's where we're at right now thank you thank you any other questions if not maybe $250,000 for Microsoft licensing and support services also second level Gonzalez yes Robert Peterson yes Courtney Jackson yes but still talking about yes thank you Doctor Bowman our next item for consideration and action is the approval of August 2023 cash disbursements and you can make continue OK back up approval of District

[00:23:00]
just for expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 copier leases for graphics copy and print shops thank you madam members of the board superintendent Elder on requesting consideration of approval for the purchase of copiers a copier lease for the graphics copy and print shops the vendor is Xerox it's using a state procurement price agreement the estimated total is 2.2 million over 5 years utilizing Enterprise funds that I'm happy to answer any questions thank you any questions I know this is similar to last year okay have not met I have a motion please move her approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for copiers for graphics copy and print shops thank you memorable Peterson yes

[00:25:00]
I'm happy to say that I have the ERS team with us live today and they will be doing the presentation today thank you I will turn it over to them thank you thank you madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder were really excited to get a chance to share some of the key findings from our diagnostic work go to the next slide please try not to have to go back and forth too much on our next slide we have the objective of our time so we had a chance to share some context for this work for you all in June and his son was able to share an update to you all in August so you have a little context for this work already we'll spend a couple minutes for Miller's in with what the objectives and purpose of this assessment was and then we'll spend most of the time that we have with you all sharing some of those key findings

[00:26:00]
Diagnostic and give an opportunity for you all to ask questions so on our next side we have again reminder of the process so we are partnered with APS to connect a resource use assessment this is intended to inform some of the decision-making that APS will be thinking about through the design phase so again this is the assessment that we're going to be sharing today is just this phase one where we're looking at current state assessment of resources and some of the enabling conditions that are important to be thinking about and as the district shifts to a student named funny model on the next slide we shared this with you all in August as well we are asking ourselves as question about how SBB actually fits into a theory of change one of you in June asked a great question you asked how does SBB can you point to system to move to SBB and seeing improvements and outcomes and the

[00:27:00]
so much of the impact that SBB has is dependent on the decisions that districts make in terms of how the funny model is constructed so how much students receive what's what schools and rules govern those resources but also the system conditions so we think about the supports the processes the flexibility that are inherent in the system that allow school systems and schools to make different resource choices that then in turn create different and improved student experiences and so our assessment is both trying to explore opportunities for APS to think about what the changes in the funding model might need to look like but also ways in which the system conditions may need to be explored to ensure that the changes to those funding actually result in changes to experience and

[00:28:00]
we spoke with a number of stakeholder groups including cabinet District staff principles members of the Union to try to understand like what was the current impression and understanding of where there might be opportunities both in this how much and also how well for the district to do things differently and this input gave us really valuable Direction on where we should focus our efforts and our deep Dives in our Diagnostic and so a lot of what you'll see in our in our findings as we share out of Guided by some of these these conversations and early perspectives that we were able to hear from books so on the next side with stakeholder input we sort of begin our diagnostic grounded in these five these five principles

[00:29:00]
are these come from our experience and and research at DRS having done this type of work with a number of different districts to think about what needs to look different as we potentially Explorer a shift in funding model you know what a ship to student based budgeting or other shift in the funny model we're sort of looking and seeing across these five principles where might they be opportunities so in the foundational element of are there enough resources to meet the Baseline experiences that we think all students should have our resources need driven meaning are they distributed based off of this June populations that are for this from opportunity and that we're trying to get additional resources for is it transparent to all stakeholders involved and easily understood on what governs who gets what amount of funding at which schools is it flexible is it enable resources to be used differently in ways that principles have the flexibility to use resources you know at school campuses grounded in their understanding of student need and lastly is a predictable and sustainable is it bolstered against some of the

[00:30:00]
execute on a consistent strategy across the financial picture on the next slide as we share these diagnostic findings with you all and start to you know test what we've seen there was a set of questions that will need to answer that APS will need to answer as it thinks about a potential shift and its funding model and so across each of these you'll hear us talking about what extent are we seeing resources already be needing major event where are their resources or constraints that are that are flexible or not and we'll do our best throughout the next couple of headers or tags you might have seen those in the pre-read where we talked about this is giving contacts on foundational this is giving contact driven so well your best to signal to you all how we're talking about the principles as we go all right so let's start in on the next slide here we started our diagnostic by looking at operating dollars in the district so we excluded things like Capital expenses or debt

[00:31:00]
yes and you can read a bit more in the appendix about some of that methodology but we wanted to look at understand how resources and the typical pre-k-12 operating services are are sort of playing out in the district at the end of the day it's the stuff in that orange bar the general education opportunity or resources that perhaps the most opportunity to think about doing things differently and so that's where we're really dig into throughout the rest of the presentation but there were a couple of other places you know you'll see that in those colored boxes where we did look into a little bit a little bit further and I want to say a little bit about before we move into that orange the first was on District management you know you can sort of think about is the district overhead the things like HR little services this is typically not a big opportunity for other systems that we work with and that's especially here in Albuquerque where we see about 4% of the total operating budget or going towards that District management which is actually a fair bit lower than some of our Pure districts that we worked with

[00:32:00]
the other opportunity that we dug into was a special education English language Learners spending this is a big area of spend for Albuquerque Public Schools particularly compared to other systems what we found was a big reason for this is just that Albuquerque Public Schools serves more students that are identified as a special education and some of its peers some of its peer districts and so given the complexity of special education services and regulations and and federal laws governing IEP and other regulated services like this is probably not an opportunity that is worth investigating alone and we know that in the Strategic plan there are already calls for additional focus and thinking about special education services so we didn't go too deep here but really sort of focus and we're going to go next which is this Orange Park all right so in thinking about general education School base resources within this category we're going to ask three questions which you know we hope by the end we sort of

[00:33:00]
the first is how much of these resources of this 509 million are currently fixed driven by Statute and policy compliance how much are non-fixed meaning potentially available for more flexibility and how does spending vary across schools what are the major drivers of variations on the next slide so we're going to build up here so I'll work with our folks in the back here to build up the animation but let's start exactly where we are which is thinking about the different components of this 500996 different categories of spending that we're going to sort of build up so if you could just click once for us the first is policy compliance which is this 267 million which we've calculated based off of policy compliance with minimum minimum Staffing requirements teacher time usage for teachers and Educational Systems governed by Statue and so with that

[00:34:00]
accounting for about half of the resources of this 5009 that sort of telling us that already a lot of our resources are locked up just by needing to have the right number of teachers at educational assistance as governed by Statute more perfect the next category here are the Baseline positions these are the positions that are determined by District allocation policies and so in thinking about positions like principles nurses guidance counselors that sort of what what is what is set here and that's another 88 million and the last category in this green are you utilities which is what it takes to power schools and keep them in schools and that's another 26 million one more click for us all together that's 75% of resources we can sort of lump together in this fix category all right let's go once more perfect the next set of blue or what we're starting to call a bit more non-fixed the first are these centrally managed resources that are experienced at schools

[00:35:00]
relax things like instructional materials substitute compensation things that are often managed centrally but you know our experienced at schools the second Club here are Title 1 and at-risk resources which we pulled out because we know they are already need driven Title 1 allocated by poverty at schools and at risk allocated by a combination of different student factors including poverty English learner mobility and so that's another 32 million and then very conveniently in the same dollar amount one more click is all other remaining resources at schools which is also 32 million dollars and so that's things like stipends and differentials any additional Staffing on any of the positions we just talked about in green that are above the minimums and really all other dollars that are remaining on school budgets and that's what we're calling this is the remaining 25% I want to say here that like this is not a perfect categorization of fixed we know that there are there are things that could live in either category between how we've categorize them

[00:36:00]
but what this tells us is that direction as we as we go in and understand where the resources are playing out it seems like around 75 percent of resources are going to be constrained given current policies and so as we think about doing things in a more nature of the way without some of those underlying changes it's really got to be thinking about how some of these races are any resources are used as opposed to you know finding a big pot that can be allocated differently great so let's go to the next slide here as you may have read in the pre-reading we use a very specific coding methodology in our work that we do across all the districts that we work with in order to be able to create these Benchmark comparisons for other districts that we've worked with around 40 or so now in the years that we've been doing this work we selected a list of nine districts that are listed out of the appendix we picked districts that are similar in size similar in demographic profile to the extent that we could in order to create

[00:37:00]
just to give us a litmus test of where Albuquerque is a little bit different than his peers as a starting point for for a deeper dive and not to say that other districts are doing the best practices not so what we did here was we looked at all of those positions that fall under the fixed resources so that's those those green bars that we've seen on the previous slide and we look at spending on these positions as a percentage of budget we see that there are three positions that are a little bit more Republicans more than peers so we can animate in the next couple of calls here one more actually perfect on nurses and guidance counselors we do that APS spends more a little bit more than its peers and within teachers it's worth noting that Albuquerque does have a higher proportion of special education teachers compared to peers but general education Staffing looks very comparable across

[00:38:00]
here for the flexibility sorry for instructional materials we see slightly more spending compared to peers but in terms of like how flexible are those and how does that really impact student experience is a potential place to to get to but you know is is really starting to help us think about now where is their variation and how some of these resources are being spent we could actually go now back to get us where we are all right so I want to talk a little bit about now School level variation so it's not just walked us through with some

[00:39:00]
what are some of the major drivers of variation in school-based we're really going to make you earn it here can you actually go to forward and I'm going to come back to the slide that's on the screen yes thank you so much so why are we looking at variation in school-based resources just to set contacts you know variation can be good we want to see resources differentiated based on strategy and student need so if you click one more you'll see some examples there so obviously students have additional learning needs we want to be able to provide additional resources to to those if there's particular strategies or initiatives that the district is prioritizing we would want to see resources targeted to those so that variation is good and we want to see to what extent the the system is able to prioritize some of those resources in service of those needs but we also want to look at areas where that variation may be unintentional it may not be driven directly by strategy and need

[00:40:00]
some examples of those include things like school size it includes things like they can see it and how vacancies may play out differently at different schools or just that some schools have we're not as teachers and so the teacher cost is lower and those are things that we don't necessarily want to see because they create variation that actually isn't what we aspire to see in a system so we're going to be looking at some of the major drivers of variation across schools and we're going to be looking for to what extent do we see some of that intentional variation and to what extent do we see some of that unintentional so I promise this is our last backwards map if you go back to that slide two back yes thank you so much the first thing we want to look at is spending by school level and so what we see on the side here is we've broken down those those fixed and those non-fiction Resources by school level and what you'll notice is that elementary schools have a higher

[00:41:00]
and the major driver of that is those additional costs of fixed resources so you'll notice that on average in elementary schools APS spends about $6,600 on those fixed resources at elementary school that cost is about 5,300 and then 4900 at middle and high and there's some reasons that that would make sense class size ratios or smaller at elementary and so it's not it's not a typical to see that Trend we did know that that is higher than we sometimes see and other systems on the non-fiction resources we don't see much difference between school level here and so what that means is that overall you'll see lower spending in middle and high relative to the to the elementary spending we're going to dive into on the next slide how those fixed resources actually play out according to size to if you go two more and I promise the rest of this

[00:42:00]
is linear great thank you so this crap your looks at school spending on those fixed resources so those same set of resources that the system needs just to comply with those statutory and Baseline resources and what we've done is we've broken them out by school level so elementary middle and high and then my school size so each bar you see for elementary for example represents one quartile of schools so the smallest elementary schools in your system are in that first bar and you'll see that the spending is much higher on those fixed resources that a school in the largest quartile schools greater than 434 and that difference if you click one more you'll see the the size difference on the chart is about 30% and so if you just click one more so we do see a sort of size premium when we look at those fix spending resources I'm sorry that the size of the school is 30%

[00:43:00]
the smallest schools in elementary school is a 30% increase in per people spend and you'll see in middle schools in 18% increase and in high school tonight percentage and you can see at the bottom there we have the ranges of sizes so you'll notice that at the bottom smallest elementary schools range between 144 students and 257 largest schools are any school above 434 students and so why does this matter in the context of SBB well two things are relevant here the first is small schools require more fixed resources on a poor people basis and the more of those resources that are then in those fixed that fix category resources inherently means fewer resources that you're able to then distribute in different ways differentiated on student need so we're going to look at this with two School

[00:44:00]
schools in APS one school a is a larger elementary school so it's in that 4th quarter tile and school B is in a is in that first quartile so it's a smaller school at 229% poverty as measured by direct search because we know that that also impacts funding and we'll look at that a little bit more in a second but we will notice here is you can see the total dollar per pupil at each School schools be has more overall resources in the school and if you look at that next row where we have the dollar per pupil a fixed resources you'll also notice that school bends significantly more about 36% in this example on those fixed resources then that larger school and you may remember most of those fixed resources are people

[00:45:00]
your assistant principals and so that does translate into more people in those smaller schools on a person basis and you might ask yourself May often times people do is in smaller class sizes is it more people a good thing if you click the next box here one of the key sort of takeaways of this is that yes smaller class sizes can be good more resources in schools can be good but particularly in smaller schools those resources don't tend to be matched to wear that the need is so you know an example I'll give is this school may have greater needs in second grade literacy but actually the the more the teachers that they have that create the smaller classes are in 5th grade and so there's teachers tend to be sort of fixed and locked up in ways that don't necessarily support strategy the other thing that plays out particularly in smaller schools is that well there are more overall or there's more teachers and

[00:46:00]
having to take on multiple roles they have fewer opportunities to collaborate they're planning all the content lessons instead of just a few it also means that the school is often able to provide the same level of programming and so it's challenging when more of your resources are going towards smaller schools but often not in ways that are actually creating and improved experience in those schools and so that's something that's important to take into consideration both in terms of you know spb design but also just the broader sort of strategy can you tell what percentage calculator in our conversations with the working group we use a cutoff

[00:47:00]
IRS in terms of what we Define as small as under $350 students and the reason we do that is that we see a pretty significant cost curve increase at that cut off when we use that definition APS says about 53% of its elementary schools in that small threshold and I don't have off the time I had with the middle 46% at the secondary level and that is larger than we see in other systems comparatively thank you okay I'm going to transition into now looking at the set of non-fiction resources so we spend some time looking at the green bar in detail now we're going to transition into looking at what some of those cost structures in those non-fiction resources so that blue bar you go to the next slide you may remember that about a quarter of those nonfiction resources that Hassan had shared our title and at risk resources and so we would expect a pretty tight relationship on

[00:48:00]
proportion of direct certification or in the or in the at-risk resources on a multitude of factors that includes those poverty metrics and we do see that tight relationship it is worth noting if you click the call out box next but there is still variation on that lines that variation can exist for a lot of reasons size is you know a factor that plays into title on at risk as well and some of those schools at the bottom there underneath the trend line are some of your larger secondary schools some of the schools that the top above that line are some of your smaller elementary schools and it can also play out because of differences in what schools are able to spend with those resources if some schools have a lot of vacancies and you might see you might see different there but by and large we see a pretty tight connection between those resources and the proportion of poverty in schools which tells us that those resources are largely being

[00:49:00]
there's other resources outside of those title and at risk resources such as Central and managed resources and anything that would exist in schools above those minimum mandates after we adjust for title on that risk what we know is that poverty levels still significant driver of those non-fixed resources particularly in elementary school and so we're using this same quartile contract here but now we're looking at ranges of poverty so schools in the lowest poverty quartile are the ones on the left they on average sea an additional $900 per people in those non-fiction resources after accounting for title and at rest a high poverty schools greater than 50% or see summer on average of around 1900 dollars per people

[00:50:00]
and so there is a relationship of poverty when we look at those nonfiction resources we don't see that as much in middle and high so we don't focus in as much there but we do see that relationship pretty strongly in those remaining resources so to summarize we saw a relationship between size and fixed resources were small elementary schools receiving more resources we all know see this relationship between poverty or high poverty schools are receiving proportionally more resources we also know that an APS that most of your highest poverty schools tend to be smaller and so when we put all those factors together if you go to the next side is our final data slide here and you'll see that high small hypethetic elementary schools end up with significantly more people resources that other elementary schools so you'll see the 11,100 is the average per pupil now looking at all resources so that orange bars coming back comp

[00:51:00]
go to a small low poverty Elementary School that might only see on average about 8300 per people so there are some big differences in the spending both on size and poverty and as a system that's Desiring to push resources to those higher need schools there is a mechanism now where resources are being allocated more towards those hiring at schools but we also noticed that some other higher poverty schools are not necessarily receiving those same level of resources so I'm going to talk in a second about what this what some of these findings meant for us or might mean for APS as they as you all move into the design phase of this so I'm happy to pause for any questions or we can hold those let's let's hold the questions okay so I'm going to close this out with some areas for exploration

[00:52:00]
so again as we look ahead to the design phase and if you go to the next slide percentage shared those key design questions for consideration a line to those funding principles so the first question within foundational is about you know defining that minimum set of resources and this analysis points to a couple areas of exploration that we would advise APS to be thinking about if you click the next bar here you'll see a few of those areas include thinking about those Baseline allocations and potentially exploring changes to those Baseline allocations that are not driven by Statue or policy in order to align more closely potentially with what the district wants to see all schools have as those minimums that have resources that may mean free up some resources that means spending more but that would be an area for deeper exploration the other would be to think about how to optimize spend in those smaller schools either by revisiting allocations potentially

[00:53:00]
sharing resources differently than it does today since as we know if a lot of your resources are tied up in those fixed resources it means that you have fewer opportunities to really be need driven with those and longer term that may also mean thinking about what the sort of configuration and portfolio of the schools look like that's obviously a decision that will happen regardless of whether the system moves to SBB but we'll be an important consideration within need driven again our question here is about what the set of resources that the system can allocate based on me can look like a couple opportunities for exploration there so if you'll click again one of those could include targeting additional resources to some of those higher poverty schools that we don't see experiencing that same level of resource infusion particularly some of your larger schools and it could also I think regardless of how the district chooses to allocate based on need variation will exist

[00:54:00]
and I think looking for ways to mitigate some of those unintended variation that will ensure that the way that you allocate dollars actually matches the way that schools and students end up experiencing those dollars and the last category under flexibility again our key question here is about how resources how School leaders and you know with the support of central office and other stakeholders can use resources more flexibly in order to meet the particular needs of that school so some opportunities to explore there would be what what of those existing resources that are already in school today could be used in more flexible or different ways to create some of those student experiences and also looking for some opportunities where there might be an opportunity to increase just the transparency of how those Central only managed resources flow to schools but also potentially how they're used and what decisions School leaders have at those so I'll close by sharing by passing off to renette just to come back to the process here but then I know

[00:55:00]
go to the next song OK Google Staff the working group in cabinet and superintendent Elder we approached this work intentionally to start with a diagnostic so we would know where to prioritize as we go into the design phase as we transition into that we hope to keep our partnership with Ernest and we want to support two pieces the first one is to model different scenarios for how funding could look different across schools with students budgeting the second

[00:56:00]
is to identify a set of changes to the system and we might be able to Pilot a small amount of school and then late spring we would scale the funding model to see how we could actually use the district wide and also to consider other changes for 2425 school year if I look at some of the items that yours pointed out for us you know and budget it made us very happy to see that 4% of our budget was only for administration I know a lot of times you know people think we're top heavy but you know we really are because we're even lower than some of our peers I was so happy to see that we are investing in counselors and nurses I know that's a really important for the student outcomes and then I was really happy to see that are

[00:57:00]
are at risk and Title 1 is going to students based on poverty and need so I think that we are setting in our base right now towards what we are trying to accomplish with the Bulls guard rails and strategic plan so we stand for question right thank you and this is a fantastic presentation it really even helped me understand things in a greater light and to really understand how things were being done and I appreciate you already starting to make some moves and adjustments to what needs to be done in the future so we will open it up to the board I will start over to my left with board member Peterson and we'll just go down for any questions that we have related to the presentation thank you I'll just have one technical question now and then maybe I'll have other questions after other people disgust so I'm looking at the

[00:58:00]
what are people expenditure did you account for special ed like looking at the slide on page 17 with the scatter graph how did you account for special ed students so all of the resources that we looked at starting with the fix those orange bars and excluded special education resources since we know that drives a lot of the funding variations in school so we didn't include those in any of those looks okay thank you to the time table that you just presented and so if we go through all of the up to Facebook for it would cause it would be a little bit over a half million dollars would be the total cost is that correct locations with the IRS but in some of the preliminary Hotel

[00:59:00]
and then we don't know what the cost for phase 3 and phase 4 are quite yet not at this time okay so I mean the question that I have is we kind of have to where is that money coming is that coming from the finance department is that coming from your budget or is that money to pay for this coming from the first place so then the question that I would have been ultimately I just want to know how I explained to text pairs with the return you know the ROI would be resulting from this expenditure so I know that you said that we can't really tell about like student outcomes because that would be a great return on investment if we could do that but since we really can't then what do we tell them

[01:00:00]
whoever I don't I don't know who that or promise of the doctor but as you know when we look at our strategic plan our goals and guard rails it all has different pieces that kind of interact and of course resources is one of the pieces so we have to start somewhere and buy trying to allocate the funds to the students that show those needs period there's not a lot of money that's actually

[01:01:00]
flexible in in the grand scheme of things you're talking about a very small amount of money which I think people were surprised by I think the public might be surprised by that that I think they have the vision that there's large pots of money that we can just dip into and spread around and the reality is that the money comes to us from the state quite often it's already spent it's tied into salary it's tied into programmatic spending is trying to you know whether we're buying instructional materials or feminine hygiene products or whatever we're required by legislation to buy it it's really tight so one of the things we had not done in APS for is just sort of review of of our finances and you know what we may find out is there's just not a lot of money that we can spread around differently but unless we have this type of review we can't make the type of decisions that we're being asked to make and I do have to answer to the board and say we at least looked at this and this is what we've cut we're coming back with if if we spend this money and we're able to

[01:02:00]
figure out ways to flow more funds to schools in a more pointed way instead of just well these schools need this to exist so let's give them this we may find out that we already do a pretty good job that might then maybe that's worth finding out we may also find this money that we can Flex a little bit differently and using different ways to flow to the schools that was the whole point of the project this is step one and we'll discuss Step 2 we may you don't like to hear this we may not do it I don't know but we'll find out if we can or not so that's right now I think that was the goal that was what the board asked from us and that's and we were excited to do the work it's you know so it's interesting for us it's it's good information to have a way I think that I've always wanted to go so I have a lot of other questions that fellow board members go but before just so you kind of have this and maybe

[01:03:00]
answer this right away is when you were looking at the largest and highest poverty schools and I think it was $8,600 and then the smaller High poverty schools was $11,100 correct so what I would like to know and I don't know if you looked at this is how are the student outcomes though in the small high poverty schools as compared to the larger high poverty schools having been a teacher the smaller class I have I can do a whole lot more when I have less students with them so I just wondered if that had if that's something that you looked at or not so we did look at some individual schools and sort of try to compare at an individual level mostly for me with those with the cabinet members in our working group and I think what you what we notice Stephen in pulling a couple of those individual schools is that the

[01:04:00]
small high poverty schools that are really struggling and they're also smaller low poverty schools that are struggling and vice versa you see some schools that are really doing well and so I think you know our take on that is comes back to this being both about how much you fund schools and how well they're able to use those resources but I think that is to the extent that we looked at sort of outcomes we did it in that sort of case study approach thank you thank you board member Jackson okay so this actually kind of goes to what we were just talking about so on page 10 and you mentioned that so the the district the 88 million is like District allocated sorry is money allocated through District

[01:05:00]
and then you and I wrote it down they are this money is constrained given current policies so my question that naturally becomes can the board change some of those policies to loosen up some of that some of those fixed resources so that the the non fixed and fixed percentage kind of changes and I don't know if anybody like I can start a software I think that is sort of the open question when we dig into how spending in that bucket of 88 million pairs to other systems we really only found different places on you know three positions that we call that being guidance counselors and nurses but I think that is the open of the open opportunities that just named at the end of thinking about what are those allocation rules are there opportunities to ship that or change that alarm to strategy and and outcome that the district

[01:06:00]
so I think the short answer is yes there are opportunities to make changes to those and when we look and see how it compares to other ear districts we aren't really seeing it be a huge opportunity in comparison but in theory yes those are sort of open for districts to establish their rules for board member Jackson if I might just be you might want to direct us on that but I want you to look at the categories you're talking about the category is your counselors Librarians nurses one of the reasons that the numbers are actually to the Plus on nurses and guidance counselors is the National Organization for those groups Center ratio how many and we've actually done a good job of trying to keep to that ratio and that's why we have as many counselors as we do

[01:07:00]
that's why we have nurses in every school so we can monkey with that but what it would mean is there would be some schools then who would have less of what I think are fairly key positions but that's kind of what we're talking about and and in terms of I think that's why they sort of put it in that fixed spending because it's it's a tricky one when you look at the specific categories you're discussing so is it just Staffing is that what that 888 but yes I agree with you but I am just kind of you know hypothesizing you have to wonder like is there are there some departments that are maybe overstaffed that we can look at reducing are there programs that maybe aren't offering a benefits to directly to the student not come

[01:08:00]
and I'm not asking you to answer this question now and again it's just are there ways that some of those those funds can be loosened up and I do remember I think it was I don't know how many couple months ago or we did ask is there a program audit going on like are we actually looking at at like a full-scale program audit and I would think to your point maybe we're doing everything great and all of the funding is exactly how we need it to be but maybe also there are some programs that are out there that are not directly tied to student outcomes that need to go away so that's just meant that I don't disagree with that point we might have to look at some programs what I was mentioning was just a lot of these fixed costs are almost always tied to salary and specifically we made decisions to sort of balance out counselors we need to kind of balance out the number of nurses and it was tied to population if you want to look at a different

[01:09:00]
as far as what that means for certain schools programming is a little different and I think maybe that money it appears somewhere else in these calculations yeah anything that's in schools would show up in the blue bars in that okay so everything that's green is Staffing or utilities okay all right page 11 what does swd stand for disability again just this is something that I already know I'm happy to see that it is I am a former PTA president of

[01:10:00]
High School from a school a and I know that our funding was lower than other schools which resulted in us having to go out to the parents to get money but it's just fascinating to me to have it you could feel it it's fascinating to be able to see it proven here and that's probably that's not my question I got to find my question well okay I think I'll move on to that the final thing and this is maybe not a question I'm just making a statement I appreciate seeing that the poverty being pulled out is the need I agree with that but I would also say is that poverty isn't the only need that we need to address and on the opposite poverty is a need absolutely and there are funding sources that address that but there is also a need

[01:11:00]
for gifted education there is also a need for items that he'll hit goal 3 there's also a need for acceleration so as we move forward I don't want us to get caught up in the needs that are obvious right obviously I mean our goals are are directed at those we have to balance it with the needs of again every student in those schools because my guess is those School a schools probably have a higher level of I shouldn't say that there are going to be kids in every school that also have a gift have that need and it needs to be addressed so I think I only asked one question I want to start by just expressing

[01:12:00]
pressing appreciation to miss abalaka on the team for engaging in this effort and this diagnostic providing this information so that we can have more informed decisions going forward I think my questions are probably more for superintendent Elder than the folks at the table but you can certainly come in if you wish one thing I'm thinking about is we do currently have essentially an adequacy lawsuit the Martinez Jazzy lawsuit which found that we're not providing adequate resources nor we effectively spending those resources across the state when it comes to 4 targeted at risk groups so it seems to me that in order for a district like APS to be able to respond adequately to that lawsuit we need Clarity around how we're spending money for those student groups so I know we're able to look at students with disabilities English Learners and low-income students the fourth group named in the lawsuit is Native American students what do we know about how we're allocating resources to

[01:13:00]
I don't think that was part of the study so I don't know that we have specific details to that in our sapper group I don't think it's something we've looked at it's something we could it's well I think so but you're just giving me a really dirty look but it's hard because how do you ascertain okay here comes this dollar I don't know what it went to you know what I mean I mean we can look at I don't know it would be very difficult we have programs in some schools for example for Native American students and we have those mostly in schools that have larger Native American population so we do things for the Native American populations under the guidance of our Indian education department and we could look at that spin but just in terms of

[01:14:00]
additional dollars I don't know how you break it out and say these dollars I think what we could do is look at similar to how we looked at poverty and you know look at trend lines between you know poverty percentages and spending percentages you can do that by race and we've done that and other context I think often in the context of an SBB decision we don't see many systems allocating dollars directly for students based on Identity or race but you know I think that's why we focus more on some of those levers that we often see those driven tours from a data perspective we could we don't have any program that says only this child or this type of child can come in right I mean you want to take a Native American culture and Native American language class anybody can we have Native American Studies classes at the middle schools that I worked at and

[01:15:00]
the majority of students were Native American but they didn't have to be solely Native American something really tricky there I don't know if the lawsuit essentially requires us to look at those four student groups and to look at how we're spending and what we're spending for the student groups it seems that we can't meet the Mandate of the lawsuit without that data so it's a question it's for ways that we might be able to at least respond to that maybe having eventually some baseline data and then being able to track over time my second question is similarly related because we have the state lawsuit and a lot of this policy is actually determined by the state in terms of teachers salaries classes a whole host of things going to question for the district I pulled out the legislative agenda the draft one that we have and there's nothing on here about funding so I'm curious what are your thoughts about like sharing some of the data with the

[01:16:00]
play legislature or some of the folks in charge of making decisions to illuminate further for them how much the district's hands are tied in terms of non fixed so I will say I told this to ERS I'll happily tell it to you as well I was happy with some of the data that was found here because it proved a few things the other way it showed that yeah our hands are tied in a great great many ways and I've heard a lot of people say we got all this new money and I said right we got all the money but we showed you guys back in I think August because they spent it all and and that's been our response and I think what we saw from the state and is that their Martinez was to raise salary if you don't have qualified teachers in the classroom but that can't be the only solution that that's not it so this is

[01:17:00]
useful data in terms of yes we have money but when you look at the big picture we only have the small percentage that has any flexibility and I have no issue with sharing some of this information I'm sure quite frankly they're probably very interested in it thank you ok Google I didn't fully realize that the smaller the school to higher the costs like that was like to see that big of a difference you know was just it was interesting you know or even I think there was a term you said where it doesn't always support the strategy you know behind it and I was just like oh my gosh you know so even if we're getting some nuggets throughout this time of using your services I really think that's it's going to be beneficial in the long run and really helped guide our team to make the decisions of what's going to be

[01:18:00]
the most impactful according to our goals you know and I think it was just like you said it like it's just solidifies the information that maybe we wondered and now we know it's more factual based just a hunch so thank you on that I want to go back to board member Peterson did you have additional questions just a couple of really I am curious about instructional materials and I think he's sort of addressed it but I'm not sure I'm clear where do instructional materials sit in this in this list as a combination of either instructional materials that are essentially managed School resources or all remaining resources that show up on school budgets and again it's pretty small amount compared to human beings

[01:19:00]
Revelations about budget that I've seen and I've seen quite a few of them so I really appreciate that I think even with this it is definitely food for thought it's not necessarily dictating what we go I mean it's really all it does is give us more Vision into the complexity of it all and I think of small schools you know and and it would be easy to say happy birthday to size but there are some value judgments that go along with it and some both of my community that is very restricted with

[01:20:00]
transportation and so it makes sense on the one hand to double the size of the school but it makes very makes that school very inaccessible to the large portion of that community and so it's it is information we absolutely have to have it doesn't necessarily dictate our path forward and sorry I just really appreciate the information oh and one other thing I I just have to respond to if we are if we are adequately identifying gifted students the percentage of gifted students should be the same in every single one of our schools and when they're not and when they're not receiving Services it's because we are not adequately identifying them not because they're not there any other questions just just a couple I just want to

[01:21:00]
say what member Jackson said is that if we're going to base things on need Student needs and strategies that we we need to look not only at like gifted programs in schools just they should be everywhere they should just be at certain schools mental health programs industry certification so it's kind of all those those are needs and it just isn't just poverty or you know e l l etcetera so there's lots of up so I agree with member Jackson another thing in this might go to to superintendent Elder we're serving the needs of the students and we're looking at school size obviously we're looking at vacancies right we're looking at teacher experience and that kind of maybe lowers the cost I would want to and I think it's already there and I don't know if you looked at it but I'm pretty sure it's there and Dr Bowman and superintendent and Elder can save it is is it in with each of the school

[01:22:00]
it says what experience the teachers have at the school because I would want to know if some of that teacher experience at schools that have more poverty or is it less poverty or remember I believe you probably have to step up and I believe that we did do such a study where we looked at tier one tier two and two or three I don't think we broke it down by years of experience we just looked at the tears and we chatted him out and we did see quite a spread their you know it started on the school but you know the one of the things that has been good is that we've had some financing to help with national board certification and that hasn't been limited to just any any school that's been spread across the district I don't know what those percentages are but I believe we have a visualization somewhere I don't know but we could but there is a breakdown and and I think that had some play here I do and I believe you guys might want to speak to that but

[01:23:00]
I don't know how significant it is in in the overall picture but it again salary is the number one thing that ties are spent the salaries are number one spent so that everything left is what goes everything else okay and then when it comes to if you continue through the next three phases we are obviously you know focused on student outcomes doing right by all of our all of our students so what kind of accountability is there on your part to like kind of make sure that that's something that we're doing and that the student base budgeting really is going to move toward improve student outcomes and I just don't know what kind of accountability there is on your part I don't know if this will directly into your question but I was thinking back to what you were mentioning earlier too about what metrics can the district use to to communicate

[01:24:00]
to stakeholders to the community how this is moving and we have seen in our work we've worked with districts to create some metrics of what we want to be true at the end of certain phases so for example in a design phase we may say we want to see the you know percent of dollars that go out on needs increase from next to why we want to see these sorts of schools experience this thing that they didn't have before and so I think as part of that design phase we would encourage and want to develop some of those metrics both you know as shared accountability for the work but I also think it's an important messaging good for your community to know exactly so I don't know if that's fully answered it it's in the next phase and so that's something that I think would be important to have but thank you so much for your presentation I mean there was so much information in there and I really do appreciate it thank you thank you any other questions so thank you thank you so much for your
