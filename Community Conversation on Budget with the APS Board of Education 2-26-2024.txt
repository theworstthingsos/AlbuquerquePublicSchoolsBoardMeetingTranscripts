smart goals they mean es for specific students identified in Yazi Martinez plus African-Americans their measurable proficiency rates credits evidence-based measures attainable evidence-based online tools results focused monthly progress monitoring sessions if you haven't tuned in those are pretty I invite you to do so results

federal grants

[00:08:00]
State Appropriations we sell General obligation bonds direct Levy's Mill levies impact 8 funds which are payments in Lubbock Texas and other governments in the form of Grants will get some strings and what do I mean by that is that these phones are earmarked for specific purposes and APS must use the funds as earmarked or is identified so something to remember is that it is very

[00:09:00]
whether it be payroll and the proper way to report payroll taxes or accounting and the proper way to book expenditures or resources for General accepting accounting principles or even awarding a vendor contract because we have to make sure that we use the funds for the specific purpose honoring the aps guard rails supporting the Strategic plan so I'm going to give you a couple of examples Sol transportation we can use transportation for students to and from

[00:12:00]
in the state and the state uses the state Equalization guarantee formula for the second amount of money that a state guarantees to a district so we can provide Educational Services to students are ours are custodians Securities 90% is we also have other factors that affect the budget external factors that are not in our control one of them is enrollment you know it's no secret that enrollment has been decreasing at APS

[00:13:00]

[00:14:00]

[00:15:00]
and we also must maintain a 5% fund balance that is the minimum amount that we have to maintain so you can see with all of these specific earmarks and purposes and minimum balance an external factors it's a complicated budget so I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to the budget Queen's management

[00:16:00]
is a 2.2 billion dollar budget but next year is going to go down because of those Esser funds that will be going away so I have a breakdown that's up there right now that kind of shows how that 1.9 billion the types of funds that it is we're going to have 904.6 million + 473.7 in capital funds 2345 191 million for Debt Service 44.8 million for Food Services 20.99 million for transportation 18.9 million for activity funds 8.74 Enterprise funds 2.5

[00:17:00]
.3 million for instructional materials we had a fun that was dedicated strictly to instructional materials this is just the remainder of that right now it has moved into operational fun so the most of the instructional materials is within that operational funds that first 904.006 million so I'm going to speak a little bit about what all those different funds are so begin with operational expenses everything from employees salaries and benefits it pays for utilities and it pays for $142 schools and 8 and other APS building

[00:18:00]
Equalization guarantee and 98% of those funds that we use for operational comes from the state so next is the capital funds so like we're not mentioned also voters approved property taxes to pay for new construction Renovations repairs and Technology by law these fun cannot be used to cover operational costs like teachers salaries or benefits next is Grants APS receives federal state city and private grants that have specialized uses they sometimes allow payment of salaries and benefits but are specific to each grant grant have expiration dates like that we just spoke about it was two

[00:19:00]
242 million that we had been able to use in the last few years that were our covid relief funds and those are due to expire at the end of this fiscal year so that's why you see that main difference of the budget going down is mostly because of the federal funds that are going away then we have Food Services of course Food Services is operated under a federally funded national school lunch at Child Nutrition Act and the National School breakfast and then Transportation the state provides funding for transportation and contractors to provide school bus transportation for students that's pretty self-explanatory as is instructional materials the state provides

[00:20:00]
looking for textbooks and other instructional materials These funds are in the operational budget and one big thing that's I think is very important to note is 80% of our budget goes to schools so and I have a graph here that kind of breaks down these these proportions so 66% the largest in that lighter blue of APs budget goes directly to the classroom paying for teacher and educational assistance salaries and benefits the next Orange Park is goes to counselors the 11% goes to counselors nurses and health assistance and this is the breakdown of the operational funds just to reiterate that part it's it's

[00:21:00]
just the operational funds portion you'll see the first three the direct instruction student support and instructional support make up that 80% that I spoke about of the operational budget so what is direct instruction is the teachers educational assistance and professional development needed student support or again the counselors nurses occupational therapists audiologists speech therapist and health assistance and then instructional support in the gray the four percent are that goes to Librarians media specialist and Library assistance then the point five is Central Administration that that is the superintendent associate superintendents and the aps Board of Education offices then that 6%

[00:22:00]
that school administration that includes principals and assistant principals at all schools so then that 3% is the central services and what Central Services is is human resources Information Technology accounting budgeting accounts payable purchasing and grants and and then the 11% that final little piece of the pie is to maintenance and operations and this is for Building Maintenance and that completes the breakdown of the budget and kind of exactly where it goes to and now I'll send it back on over to Ronettes

[00:23:00]
if you get a chance to pick up this pamphlet I don't know if you've seen them before but there is a really informative page in here about the budget and it breaks down the resources and how they're used we also have this information on our budget website so if you're ever curious this is this is a very good document and as you can imagine so we actually have a exercise that we want all of you to participate in and it kind of shows you

[00:24:00]
we work with two different Consultants one of them is Edward nomics and they are a finance education and we went through their classes and were able to get a certificate on school finance and then we also work with IRS which is educational resource strategies and they help us to see the best way that we can hear more about them and the work they're doing as they're wrapping up so you'll hear more about them in April and May but they have a similar a game that you can exercise you to get

issues and I'm not sure how many issues they solve by throwing money and where does the money go and how does it how is it used in a way that helps in that produces results

[00:55:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:56:00]
just like these other people are saying but what is the relationship how is that working between APS and the legislature in the State Board and how do you get some clarity about how APS is working

the 242 million that's expiring this year the student enrollment decline inflation and then of course the restricted funds of capital funds Federal money Transportation buses but this next one I think will answer some of your questions and we're not at the point where we have already built the budget just so you know that's why this is the start of the budget we just had the legislative session and and so that is kind of like what guides us right what increases are we having we're getting a 3% increase in this meeting was really meant to take some of your input to help us with that planning and of course we thought that by giving you the different types of funding and all that kind of stuff that would be able to help you give some

[01:00:00]
formative you know input or whatever but I know a lot of you already know a lot of this but we have to assume that there is all all types of individuals here right some that know the budget is very well they know the funding they know restricted funding operational all the different types of funding for the budgets but a lot of people are new to this and we want to make sure we hope everyone understand so our budget calendar we are just finishing the legislative session right so that's all that we know that is firm for the budget right at this moment and so now in March we actually we send out we send out budget templates to all the schools and the principals right now are working on their budgets for their individual schools there's $142 schools so it's a lot of stuff that we have already sent out and

[01:01:00]
get all of those together start to see what that dollar amount is and it's going to be we assume about 80% of our budget will be taken up there in March on March 1st for all the Departments we will send out those same templates for the Departments to build their budgets that you know like all the ones I mentioned HR we have to build a budget all the department areas will be doing that then we get received that back so then I put all those two together and then I will have a budget right we'll see do we have any money to play with if we do what is the input we've received what are then we start doing kind of what you did in the game kind of seeing

[01:02:00]
all schools they will give us their priorities and they will differ I will let you know they will all be different and so we have to we have a budget steering committee that is not just myself I don't make all these decisions by myself or my team we have a committee that kind of will go over all this stuff and helps us really you know everybody kind of says why programs because I'm not an expert in program I'm numbers person but we have tons of very smart individual that know their area just as well as I know budgeting and so we all get together and we come up with the budget and so it is very important to that you guys do give feedback

[01:03:00]
on this budget and that's why we were hoping that this game would be interesting but so in our for FY 2525 and Beyond we will be sure that we aligned to the boards goals we will be honoring the guardrails and also supporting the Strategic plan that you guys have probably already saw with some of the board members on the merging stronger North Star of course student outcomes and we actually part of the Strategic plan because we're doing lots of things to educate ourselves and do the best that we can so we're looking at a budget methodology to be more like student outcomes and so that's one of things and it is part of the Strategic plan

[01:04:00]
and then just as a reminder that we are aligning the budget to the goals this was this current budgets alignment cuz we haven't like I said we haven't received anything back yet from the department and the schools so this alignment is for this current year and this is the percentages that the principles in this percentage to the goals so when you said when you said that locations by enrollment

[01:05:00]
priorities of how they're going to use that childhood number one we have all the additional funds that those go to additional stuff I'm just speaking about the foundational operational funds so there is

[01:06:00]
like on top of on top of there's additional funding for you know different like said there's the special education funds there's the at-risk you know and then there's for you know English Learners lots of different funding that gets on top it's ok Google

[01:07:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:08:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:09:00]
it's good that you that you bring it to our attention so that way we can find the proper funding that should be used in those instances because you know you were talking about like title one and and the instruments and they may or may not be able to use that say no but we can try to identify the funds I can I think and and this is definitely something that I will mention at the beginning of the next meeting

[01:10:00]
officials in APS again to get those priorities to make sure we aligned to the goals in the guard rails so this is the place that we are able to get that feedback and I really encourage all of you to watch our board meetings to participate in our board meetings as we go forward because we will be reporting on the budget we will be showing with the actual numbers are and where the expenditures are going and what is going to be changing what is going to be increasing what is going to be decreasing but without getting those final numbers right now and we want to give you the actual so please please start finalizing everything will be able to answer those questions but right now we do want to get your feedback

[01:11:00]
know what the priorities are for our parents and our community so please please give us that feedback so to follow up to those board members are currently in the morning at the point where you can answer this question from either these meetings or even this conversation

know that that is not something that the state does that some of the methodology that we have at 8:00 p.m. and then that's something definitely that that we will share and make sure it's on our website to show where we do have my statute like class sizes that we have to adhere to so there is exactly what you're talking about the methodology of class sizes and how many students and teacher ratio but one of the things that were looking at is the standard school and what I mean by the standard you have to have a certain amount for each school just to put the lights on you have to have that basic standard put the lights on and open for business we have to have a principal we have to have a secretary we have to
