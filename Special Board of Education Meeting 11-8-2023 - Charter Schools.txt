[00:05:00]
to include middle schools and we would strongly support a vote in favor of allowing East Mountain schools to become more more expansive to include middle schools we also know that survey that we have done indicate strong support for expansion of charter schools within New Mexico and we think that's consistent with that so with that I'll conclude my remarks and just thank you again very much for the opportunity to present comments thank you Mr would hi my name is Michael Wood and I have had the pleasure of working at Eastmont High School since 2009 is the music teacher for the record my daughter is a sixth grade student at Roosevelt Middle School in my classes I teach students how to write and record their own music we use the term Innovative as part of our mission statement MHS and the music program and body is what it means to create new ideas and experiences I don't say this slightly but for many of the students of the

[00:06:00]
program is become a life-changing realization create perform and release their own musical compositions the next step for us to grow would be to add to our music department faculty with other passionate teachers who can Inspire younger students to build their musical interests and abilities collaborating with a colleague that is just as excited about music production as I am means better educational experiences for these Mountain Community I asked that you all vote Yes to the emhs expansion proposal so we can continue innovating thank you thank you Miss parola good evening Madam president superintendent and members of the board my name is Julia and I'm here today on behalf of teach plus New Mexico I am also here as an educator and Community member of the East mountains East Mountain High School is an important part of our community they can continue to earn academic proficiency scores of other schools in the area and they give many families the option for their children to attend a proven high-quality School these families also want to

[00:07:00]
we know that when students have access to a high-quality education they will have more opportunities post-secondary East Mountain High School has proven that they can provide this for students and should have the opportunity to expand this model to younger students school choice is an essential part of improving New Mexico education our students and their families are extremely diverse and finding a school that fits their needs can be a challenge simply put schools like East Mountain High School allow more students to reach their potential as an educator Community member and on behalf of teach plus I am asking APS to approve East Mountains expansion to serve grade six through eight thank you for your time thank you Miss money hi good evening thank you my name is Jesse and I'm the mother of a third grade boy at Coral and I'd like to ask you to renew their Charter my son has grown academically socially and emotionally since transferring to Coral and I'm so grateful

children I've been in service to this community for over 30 years and I have not seen that data change much I will tell you who is moving the needle though if there is a magic formula or a special sauce I would say that East Mountain High School has found it our family has been very fortunate to have our kids there and we went through a devastating loss last spring we lost our son who was a senior and we also have an lgbtq student at the school and we would not have done well at a larger School in East Mountain High School repped their arms around us and it makes my heart Happy to think of a middle school developing on this campus it would impact thousands of families and children so thank you for listening to this proposal thank you the next speakers will be Joseph O'Brien Denise Lucas

for you for your time Miller melee thank you board members my name is a sophomore at East Mountain High School middle schoolers wanting to come to the school I'm the advocate for that makes East Mountain High School really initiative and is the wide variety of athletic and extra curricular activities I am highly involved in several of these activities and I feel that the opportunity to expand or extra curricular offerings to Middle Schools would greatly benefit our students as of now middle school students are not allowed to try or participate in high school sports they can do so at their home APS high school but charter schools are not allowed to take take this opportunity for granted for their own students for example we were not able to feel a full Girls JV soccer team if we did Middle School 8th grade students will be able to compete on our teams and help us create a full one our extra activities are very important for high school students and lots of students in these

[00:29:00]
do not have access to some of these programs and activities at East Mountain can offer for these reasons and many many more please consider the expansion of the wonderful East Mountain High School thank you very much thank you our next guest is Esmeralda Diaz good evening Madam chair and my name is Esmeralda and I currently am a senior center high with five colors graduation I went to Jackson Middle School then to Ms as my family Mutual to Charter School route for safety reasons why it's my family and I learned the culture was not a fit for me we learned about Sunday in the community and found my home in which I will graduate in 2024 the flexibility and schedule is super helpful to me and my goals and the teachers are more helpful and hold me accountable so I I believe I can do anything in their class

[00:34:00]
while a neighboring middle school has a 11-point gap between Hispanic and white students and a 26 point gap between why and economically disadvantaged students your strategic plan emerging stronger acknowledges the district's achievement Gap and your commitment to closing this Gap if you care about closing this Gap supporting East Mountain High School's expansion is an easy decision thank you thank you miss me good evening school board members as a parent and Foundation member of East Mountain High School I'm here in support of the emhs charter amendment to expand to 628 model I've had the pleasure of getting to know principal Smith and learning division he has first school a vision that bears great potential for our students in the future of our school district studies show this added model can provide a more cohesive academic

[00:38:00]
school for preschool through 5th grade and then we were looking for options when it came to middle school and we there weren't any options up here and then East Mountain so we ended up at a charter school in in Albuquerque so I have been working at a charter school for 10 years I'm currently a principal at another Charter School in town I know what the opportunities these schools offer for students I strongly support the expansion of East Mountain High School with a middle school I think it would be a great alternative for parents who want a smaller School experience high quality education opportunities to for call it for dual credit and everything later on in high school I really am excited to hear that this is a possibility and I hope you guys supported thank you thank you Mr Husband

[00:39:00]
good evening everyone Madam president steam members of the board thank you for allowing me to speak very briefly and full support of the middle school expansion with emhs here in the East mountains I'm the governing Council chair at Eastmont high school and I'm currently a professor of teacher preparation which I've been doing for about the past 15 years or so and the wonderful state of New Mexico and several years I've worked with leadership on the community of Eastmont High School I witnessed some of the most powerful learning opportunities as delivered by some of the most dedicated high-quality teachers as administered by just extraordinary leadership at Eastmont High School these very same teachers these leaders they'll be involved in this middle school expansion and with such a storied career and success there's just 0 doubt in my humble opinion that a middle school will prove to be so successful with high school in the East mountains so without hesitation I absolutely support

[00:40:00]
middle school expansion here up in the mountains with East Mountain High School and I certainly would greatly appreciate any consideration and approval by the board so thanks so much for the opportunity to speak this evening I know you're all very busy and thanks for your dedication and time thank you thank you our next speakers are in the room Carrie Jordan Angela lybarger David and Lily lyberger Marie Boothe Kerry Jordan hi I'm a parent of two happy and successful children at 8:12 and Roosevelt Middle School I was at the board meeting last year and pleased to see you approve increasing enrollment at East Mountain High I've been waiting to see a comprehensive impact study for the proposed Middle School though it was discussed as needed but to my knowledge there is not one been prepared there are so many core questions left in answered

[00:41:00]
what's notably with declining enrollment why does our community need another middle school and how will this affect Roosevelt our existing high-performing middle school that has been around for nearly 75 years we need real data first to know what this area really needs and to utilize our existing resources equitably and sensibly while the primary focus at Roosevelt is on academics are principal has been focused on making sure that our students develop social and emotional skills and tools to help them succeed for the past two years this is meant a focus on the acronym best Brave engaged stand up intonations I'm here today with these abilities in mind I heard through the proverbial Grapevine this vote is a done deal but without an appropriate study and careful consideration I sure hope it isn't let's not make a decision simply based on a school's desire to expand to have a feeder Middle School I'm asking the board to table consideration of this proposal tonight by the way my children

[00:42:00]
exemplary schools and teachers need continued support my son's engineering teacher just LED Roosevelt to sweep the Sandia National Labs electric car challenge winning every category my daughter's teacher was just named teacher of the year for agriculture in the classroom for Mexico farm and livestock Bureau I am sure you finish that are any decision on this on this middle school thank you thank you mister Barber hello my name is Angela library and I'm the current president of the parent packet Roosevelt I'm asking you not to approve the requested Charter for East Mountain to create a middle school by their own admission in the boards Q&A there has been no impact analysis completed concerning the negative impact Roosevelt and this should be required prior to anybody or any decision Roosevelt already provides high-quality well-rounded educational opportunities to students including band Orchestra and choir program

[00:43:00]
East Mountain does not provide we also provide transportation to all students allowing access to all students something else East Mountain does not provide providing the charter excuse me approving the charter would mean stripping yet another Middle School of its students teachers programs and funding leaving a situation of inequality for the students Left Behind The Very inequality that APS claims not to tolerate an education is exactly the inequality the school board would be supporting and perpetuating if you approve the requested Charter Amendment we do not need another Middle School 8 Miles up the road from Roosevelt students are seen supported encouraged prepared and cared for by our dedicated teachers for almost 74 years now and for anyone to insinuate otherwise is simply wrong and it's insulting to all public school teachers of which I am one thank you thank you Mr M

[00:44:00]
I Am David Adams I live in the Foothills near I-40 I have a 4 year old and a 7 year old daughter my 7 year old is in second grade as as parents my wife and I are looking at a variety of different schools in the area and the East Mountain High School is you know consistently shown that it's a high-performing Academic School I think I heard you know they won a blue ribbon award in the past I just read in the paper the other day that I believe they're had a 90% graduation rate we believe that schools like that should be rewarded for their academic excellence and in turn that rewards parents like me who are looking to make a choice I personally you know I'm not associated with any school or any organization I'm just a dad I love the idea of both awesome so would a middle school at East Mountain High School for me to have the choice to look at both of those I think would be an

[00:45:00]
Choice an opportunity for dads thank you very much thank you Miss lybarger hello my name is Lily lybarger and I go to East Mountain High School and for middle school I went to Roseville where I received a high-quality education and was provided with the resources needed as a special education student from what I learned at Roosevelt I've been able to move on to Eastmont and continue to have straight A's the number one reason my family was its location and the number one reason why my family almost didn't she was the lack of developed a fine arts program something Roseville has been able to achieve and deliverance education but East Mountain so far left in order to continue with this balance outside programs some of which cost upwards of 800 dollars I started working a job in order to obtain what my school lacks to provide my concern is that this will be the same story with the middle school with students not being provided the well-rounded education that should be made available for any family of any socio-economic

[00:46:00]
at Roosevelt as well as many as many others have received the tools necessary for a balanced education I would like to see East Mound move its focus towards growing and expanding from being a great school to an even better one at the already existing High School level continuing to build the foundation created by Roosevelt Middle School please vote against East Mountain Middle School level thank you thank you Miss Booth hello my name is Marie Boothe and I am a current science teacher at East Mountain and also a parents I love working at the school and I have felt so supported by our Administration as well as other fellow teachers one of my greatest Endeavors has been to actually start a robotics program here at East Mountain and this initiative was completely driven by student interest I have no background in robotics and this has been able to extend our reach in community not just

[00:47:00]
set our school but also to our greater Community part of our robotics is that we raise all the money so that students have the opportunity to get great stem opportunities without the cost to their families we currently build at Manzano High School where we have built a community and our students act as mentors and help the rookie teams there at Manzano high school and additionally we are working with other New Mexico teams for robotics to bring first robotics here to New Mexico so that other students have the opportunity for developing their careers in stem considering the amendment to include grade 6 through 12 we're not just extending our Charter work extending the opportunities fostering collaboration and strengthening our commitment to education Innovation and Community with this expansion we will Empower even more young minds to become the problem solvers creators and Leaders of Tomorrow thank you thank you our next two

excuse me three speakers are in the room Chandra McCray Adeline knee and Steven Eaton hi my name is Chandra McCray I'm a CPA for the Albuquerque Charter Academy I want to say thank you to the board and also to the Charter office for how much support that they give to her school and how much time that you've dedicated to the Charter Schools over the last year or so I am speaking and support for the renewal of our Charter I have the board member I'm continually impressed when I come to the board meeting and I hear from our executive leadership team how much they put the kids first so they've truly developed a program that Embraces the kids where they're at and is trying to help them do credit recovery so that they can graduate and they can do it on their own time frame so

[00:49:00]
open entry open exit I really am proud to be a part of their their vision and how they're trying to impact New Mexico as a whole because as we graduate more students than that means they can be productive systems in New Mexico and raise the bar overall thank you thank you miss me thank you madam president and board members I stand before you today a proud alumni high school and I'm here to express my fervent support for the idea of opening a middle school my passion for this initiative stems from the deep belief in the transformative power of education and the incredible potential that exists within our community as president of the New Mexico speech and debate Association I have dedicated myself to expanding speech and debate programs across the middle schools in New Mexico but the single greatest challenge we face is maintaining students engagement during the transition from Middleton High School opening a middle school will allow us to foster a sense of community

[00:50:00]
and continuity will be creating a nurturing environment that ensures students remain excited as they move through the educational system I urge all of us to come together today and support the opening of a middle school admhs a decision that will shape the future of our institution and the lives of countless students who will benefit from the nurturing of their potential we cannot wait to invest in our future at the time is now thank you thank you Mr Eaton thank you my name is Steven Eaton of a student at Albuquerque Charter Academy and I'm here to speak on behalf of renewing their Charter I want to talk to you about the experience that I've had my son is a student with disabilities and he has struggled in the system it wasn't until we

Albuquerque Charter Academy that he's been able to succeed at school at all and at the high school level it has been and I'm and I wanted to come and tell you that it's been a profound experience for my family and for my son the school has provided services for him that we haven't been able to find at a number of other schools that we've tried in the aps system before we got to the school he's already 19 years old but for the first time he is attending classes he has near perfect attendance he has an a average after attending now he's in his second year at Albuquerque Charter Academy that is a contrast to his experience before this where he had been unable to acquire even a single credit at the prior to schools that he went to mister can you please finish your thoughts

[00:56:00]
state representative from District 22 which comprises much of the East mountains and of subsequently retired from that service while there I was on both the house education committee and the House Appropriations and finance committees while serving in the legislature I was also a teacher at East Mountain High School but I retired from that too but I gained a unique perspective of what makes our students successful like other speaking tonight I also had two children that graduated from EHS again my teaching career at Hayes Middle School in APS most of our students were not successful in school and frankly struggled at learning life lessons why parents were not involved in their education and their kids and the kids didn't see any relevance High School doesn't have that concerned parents are encouraged to be involved in many ways at the school and the teachers providing lessons that make each subject to the students at a time when educational

[00:57:00]
lastly after retiring from the legislature I was also able to serve on the Bernalillo County Commission and was thankful to see the support by the planning department of putting expansion of East Mountain facilities in their master plan thank you for your time this evening and I asked for your support of this amendment to East Mountain High School's chartres chartres on behalf of the children and families thank you thank you board members that concludes public forum thank you I just want to say first of all thank you to all of the community that was quite a range of of discussion and I really appreciate you all being able to come here tonight we don't have a dialogue with you but we did that mean that will help us inform us as we're going through the rest of the agenda so we're going to start with the first item which is the discussion to consider approval of the amendment to the contract for East Mountain High and our presenters are doctor Escobedo senior director of APs

[00:58:00]
school team and Trey Smith the executive director of Eastmont high so we'll just open is there anything else that you want to open up or state before we I asked for questions on the dice board and Charter education of the amendment to the contract for East Mountain High School the amendment would allow them to serve grade 6 through 12 currently the school serves Grade 9 through 12 the change would take place in the 2026 27 school year state law requires that the approval of the amendment must be made by both parties

[00:59:00]
neither party disagrees with the result that they may appeal to the secretary we did have a review team review the schools middle school expansion plan including curriculum We performed a site visit and the review team is recommending approval of the amendment and I have Trey Smith executive director of the school here with me tonight thank you we are again not only does he have the highest attendance is I've taken over this position as Dr Escobedo mentioned last Friday morning and I wholeheartedly agree with her assessment and that's why we wanted to do this process right and do this process

[01:00:00]
not rushed and you certainly can't accuse this board of being rushed and not this issue either our governing board pass this Charter Amendment over a year ago and in that time members of the aps Charter office and the aps curriculum team have visited our campus to study the issue and discuss the details our faculty have had more time to discuss Visions for departments and our foundation has been researching the financing options this is already been a multi-year process and after its past tonight we are still probably another three years out from seeing this as an actual reality at this rate Albuquerque will see a new In and Out Burger before the middle school program and I know that that's not quick enough for the families of the East Mountain Area who would like to see this option now but it's being done at the right place to make sure that it's done right and I'm looking forward to finally moving on after this evening now when I put myself in your shoes I realize you have two different roles this evening first

[01:01:00]
charter school authorizer and we know that decision-making for authorizers is based upon making sure that charter schools are making adequate progress on student performance and we know that's not an issue here since the MHS has the highest graduation rate of any school in the area and is right to the top Charter School by Niche but it's also important to remember that we achieve at that level despite the fact that our incoming ninth graders come from wildly different middle school expectations multiple Charters multiple private schools multiple homeschools tonight is not about one Middle School it's about the 28 different middle schools that we are attempting to align with since we are not currently providing this option the families of the East mountains are creating their own options so we look forward to operating an Innovative 638 pathway directions

[01:02:00]
high expectations trusting relationships High School mentorship environmental stewardship and top-notch extracurriculars now in your other role as the aps board I sympathize with your ambitious goals that you have outlined that are on the wall over there and we believe our school and this amendment are in direct support of every single one of these goals and I would like to organize the rest of my comments around each of those goals your first goal is related to literacy specifically third grade does not go that far it is noteworthy that the emhs ELA proficiency rate was 73% and Not only was that one of the highest in the state when you look at just the performance of only Hispanic students at emhs we were at 63% while the state average was just 28 your second goal of increasing math Proficiency in 8th grade has a direct relation to this Charter

[01:03:00]
more than 25% higher than the national average the score is still remain impressive when you examine our Yazi Martinez subgroups as well amhs Hispanic students for example score nearly triple the Statewide average on math proficiency with this amendment passed tonight we can serve in a leadership capacity for schools that are trying to raise 8th grade math scores for your third goal of postsecondary Readiness emhs is already exceeding this goal with over 70% of graduating seniors completing college-level courses amassing over 540 college credit hours just within the last class of 2023 with a 6384 school we can open up more flexibility at the Junior and senior levels so that our students can now take even more college courses we are directly aligned here as well

[01:04:00]
Integrity collaboration curiosity and reflection we teach required courses in the 9th and 12th grade years that are formed entirely around these values and we've developed tools for measuring and assessing students capabilities for these critical social emotional skills with our Charter Amendment we will now be teaching intentional seminar classes at the sixth seventh and eighth grades directly related to those core values so our Charter Amendment meets the qualifications required by authorizers and direct support of all four of your major goals in the end I feel for the families of our communities get exhausted from constantly searching for the right fit for their children my three year old son Xavier Smith had to be put in a lottery waiting list last spring just to figure out a preschool to get into for this fall and I understand that anxiety that families have put their names on all of these

[01:05:00]
I feel like I have a moral obligation to do everything I can to expand our reach to meet the demand of our community and make sure any student who wants access to a high-quality education can receive it I'm very grateful for all the support given to our school by all the members of the aps staff who have met with us and I look forward to continue partnering with the district and all of you and making this a reality thank you for your time thank you so I'll just I'll open it up for questions from the board members why don't I start down on to my roommate you have any questions no I don't have any questions related to what was discussed because I believe I they have proved above and beyond what makes East Mountain eligible

[01:06:00]
send to a middle school program looking at the stats you always hear numbers don't lie and when you remove the emotion out of it versus what you think is best and you stick to the facts these are commendable I'll be honest we can learn something from you you're doing phenomenal work you hear the tremendous support throughout the community and to put it bluntly because that's always my style we would be dumb to not approve you like we have to remember why we're here and it's to put children first that is the ultimate reason why every single one of us was elected and if we can make decisions knowing that it's about our students and what's best for them we can't go wrong so I commend you these are incredible results of what you're producing within your schools like Bravo to your staff to your teams to your family I wish more of our APS schools could resemble the

[01:07:00]
type of statistics and I would say keep doing what you're doing you have my full support and I'm honored to know that we have a school like that within our community thank you board member Gonzalez I also don't have questions I appreciate all of the background information that was provided to the q&as as well as in our reading packet as well as your overviews and most importantly I think the voices of the community who came out tonight but also who came out in our inboxes so it's clear to me that there's support for this expansion amongst the community and I think for me it's about reminding myself that we are responsible for educating our communities children and that is to me much more important than what type of school they go to and so for that reason I'm also in support but also don't have questions thank you for remember Jackson when we did public forum we asked not to repeat but I'm going to take my privilege and repeat

[01:08:00]
I am completely in support of what you have done it is quite extraordinary that based on our inboxes based on the stories here tonight based on the highest attendance rate in the state based on the highest graduation rate in the state I mean I have so many notes of of all of the incredible opportunities you have provided to our students and they are all our students they are all APS students and our responsibility is to improve student outcomes are that is the only job of the school board is to improve those and quite frankly we have a executive director sitting in front of us along with the community in the boardroom in our inboxes and probably listening online who are

[01:09:00]
begging us to help they want to help us they want to improve our goals they want to add to the aps excellence and I quite frankly cannot even understand why this is even a question we should be saying thank you and yes and so I think if I will reserve my right to maybe Circle back around but I am 100% of this and thank you for being willing to to help to help because our students are students need it we need to improve our outcomes and I'm just appreciative of everything you've done thank you board member Peterson well it is a question because the part of the community that seems to be completely overlooked is the community that's out of Roosevelt Middle School in the concern of that community of what

[01:10:00]
East Mountain high can do again without any kind of impact statement I look at your numbers yes they are wonderful you have 1/3 of the economically stressed families you have about for APS numbers you have about half of the students with disabilities and as far as I can tell you might have one or two English language Learners so if you just aggregate the outcomes for students in virtually any other high school they are comparable if you just Aggregate and look at the success rate of these what these families come with is the lack of the economic stress the advantage is that this community can afford and when you look at the

[01:11:00]
back of the gap between the identified students in areas in Martinez groups and the students that are not in those groups you look at the combination of economically disadvantaged students and lo and behold what it does show is that when students are in more integrated and balanced communities both economically ethnically linguistically basically everyone does better but by doing this in East it makes it even more stressful than the family that are at Roosevelt and I feel strongly I mean it is an absolute slap in the face to insinuate

[01:12:00]
is absolutely committed to Innovation to serving their students needs to finding ways to engage students and that is shown Again by the success that Roosevelt so I can't support this thank you for remember Peterson thank you I just want to say just what what a great Testament to what all kids are capable of doing and I see this not about expanding enrollment but about doing alright bye bye bye more students I don't know why anyone would want this continuity and these opportunities for more students it's stunning to me that numbers wouldn't want to prove this I mean you

[01:13:00]
have 90% of the students over 90% of the students that are from the from the neighborhood I mean your graduation rate over the last 6 years average over 90% And you already spoke to you know your Ela scores and your math scores even for our you know Hispanic children so to me I am totally supportive of this absolutely phenomenal school we should be we should be proud and I am I am honored to to move for approval of the amendment to the contract for East Mountain High School but we do have a motion in a second motion was made by the secondary Jackson so go ahead board member Dominguez so

[01:14:00]
I certainly understand the pride that I've heard tonight coming from parents from East Mountain High School I can completely sympathize with that and but again that's not the issue we had two other parents speak with great pride of the library and Miss Jordan and what they lifted up for consideration to listen to all parents I agree that all the children are not identical in their needs for a quality education

[01:15:00]
I agree that more choices allow students and their parents to find what works best for their individual student and as a board member I must apply that thinking to 70,000 students 54,000 of those students have incredibly and that's who we're talking about here APS has 30 or so Charters that try to meet that balance that need and East Mountain High School you stand as an example and I will also say there's room for growth and I won't repeat what

[01:16:00]
and

[01:17:00]
will undoubtedly further strain the facility that you current use for your gym classes and that is a facility that is designed for the entire Community I would ask why not use let's see I believe I got a number of 12 to 20 million dollars that it will take to expand into a middle school why don't you use that money for the current needs that your high school is currently showing I want to Circle back and for

[01:18:00]
I'm having a hard time looking at my notes barely see but I'm doing my best period And I want to stress public resources that are limited and public resources that must be shared equitably this boy talks about that word a whole lot but this is the moment when we have to ask ourselves are we actually means that sacred little extra money go to areas schools programs that serve a higher number of students and guard rails

[01:19:00]
economically disadvantaged students English Learners special education students with disabilities and Native American students I understand that East Mountain has those populations however you also have incredible advantages you're only three I mean how many high schools do we have wouldn't they love to be at 300 and I believe 766 380 so with those sorts of numbers absolutely you should be doing as well as you are in the scheme of things you want this expansion and we'll find Marriott Resort that we have limited resources

[01:20:00]
and that we must use those limited resources on those with the highest need and your project does not meet that requirement not by my understanding the state may be a wash with money for now but we are a wash with needs children's needs children who is East Mountain High School is not required by law to serve the way APS is required to serve and so I hope you understand after listening to the library's and Miss Jordan that Roosevelt Middle School will suffer and those kids will suffer as a result of

[01:21:00]
expansion and so for that reason I cannot and will not support this measure thank you for remembering to Mingus home it's always the last person to speak here I just want to say there's a couple of things it's really clear that schools are becoming more than a place to serve our children academically I mean I think what I've heard just broadly from everybody even in the public forum around the tremendous need that is out there where we're talking about you know children that are on track and children that are not on track and disadvantaged and those that have access and those that don't and Mr Smith I really appreciate one of the things that you notice is that I was board members we have a really difficult task because

[01:22:00]
our task is not just looking at the goals in the guard rails on those things but the other big task that we have to is really around resource allocation and making sure that what we're doing is responsible in terms of how we're doing this one of the things that is constantly in our ear I don't know if the gentleman from the Chamber of Commerce is here but what is constantly in our ear as well as the district has to write size we have you know dwindling population and we have to write size so right sizing for me we're not going to right size our way out of anything and we're not going to expand we're not going to you know we're not going to whittle we're not so the questions are really around how are we going to do things that we can meet the needs of like all of these children and all of these different ways and how do we how do we pull those resources so that their

[01:23:00]
doing everything everybody wants them to do I wish that in public education I've been a public administrator all my life and I wish in any kind of public administrative work that I've done that we could truly individualize and fully fund it to the level and the expectations that our communities have and public education is really stressed I mean I think we're in a we're in a better position obviously with some of the funding that we've had but there is still this tremendous need to you know to stylize idealize individualized make it all work for everybody and it makes it really hard so when I'm thinking of this issue the thing that comes to my mind when I think of neighborhood schools I think of a community that's together right and the East mountains seems to be a community that is pretty together I mean there's a lot of individuals that live there that know their community and support their community

[01:24:00]
schools that are in their neighborhood and one of those neighborhood schools happens to be Roosevelt Middle School as well so we've got our elementary schools we've got the middle school and now we've got this Fabulous High School which makes a lot of sense to me because I know for those families in that area prior to having that in order to go to high school had to go over the mountain you know through the woods to Grandmother's house we go when the snow came it was terrible and I and I just remember those days when I was growing up in listening to that so East Mountain High actually developed I think as a result of just a lot of that stress it's very stressful and so what I've always valued about the community to is how cohesive the community is but what I'm missing for me I guess is that I'm struggling with this lack of cohesion around our Middle School

[01:25:00]
stop the cohesion around our elementary school because nobody's talking about you know abandoning our elementary school it's wonderful and it's doing its things that it needs to do and actually when I hear today that you know Roosevelt is also doing some pretty amazing things as well it's not it's not as horrible I guess I mean there are some things that you know continuous Improvement is something we all are striving for and should you know believe in and continue to to understand and so what I worry about Mr Smith is that as we go through time and let's just say that population's continue to to to to to say or it's going to get bigger I'm I would hope I would love for it to get bigger that's you know I'm always Pollyanna and that's okay but I'm also worried about the populations continue to dwindle and what I worry about is that we will impact the cohesion of this East Mountain Community because we're not going to have

[01:26:00]
a viable middle school for these other kids who are not part of your community and they're going to have to go over the mountain across the woods to Grandmother's house to be able to to have access to something and and so that's the part that's just weighing heavy on my brain cuz I worry about that we're we're in the middle right now is a district having to look at that and it's our middle schools where we seem to be struggling a little bit with with size and it matters when it gets too small for some of our middle schools because if it gets too small we also can't continue to support it the only question that I have Dr Jessica can you help remind me how many students are we talking about that would be part of that so you're going to start not till like 2:27 but how many students would it start with the idea is a you start with the sixth grade class about 100 students that's a lot

[01:27:00]
question about the demographics in that area in terms of population growth in that area what are we what are we looking at its population growth do we know by any chance I don't know off hand I don't know if Mr Smith might know that as far as like the bills that are out in the East mountains that was part of a lot of the research that are there in the population of our neck of these mountains kind of the frost Mountain Valley area is booming there was definitely a dwindling kind of the in the early 2010s with this first floated and but recently home Builder ship home by in the area is really taking off so the population is actually increase in our area which is from the same thing so off of North 14 San Antonio is pretty much at capacity

[01:28:00]
okay where there is more room at a Montoya and Roosevelt and what's our population at Roosevelt right now Roosevelt around 300 students and our capacity at Roosevelt is like for about 700 7557 okay and so we haven't really seen the population growth there then in the middle school because we're also seeing the kids in your area going somewhere else is what's happening that's what I would have my assumption is just that if you're saying the growth is big but they're not coming to Roosevelt they're going somewhere else the population at Roosevelt has stayed pretty steady pretty consistent I was at Roosevelt about 15 years ago and not

[01:29:00]
and it was it was around the same amount so it's a pretty stable I think there was a private school that's expanded to since then but it Roosevelt itself hasn't seen a change in numbers and so the majority of our students for Roosevelt to are also coming from this East Mountain Community but also from 29078 South 14 and the South East Mountains feeds to Roosevelt and then San Antonio which serves the North 14th the students tend to either go to East Mountain or

[01:30:00]
2 months I know they're still zoned for months out of high school right because East Mountain is also got a waiting list for your high school yeah so so obviously it's it's still small enough that we still have the majority of your families are having to even go over the mountain over across the woods to to get to to another High School option okay so when I'm thinking about my decision and when I'm thinking about what I need to think about what's weighing heavy on me is that whole notion around how do we take into consideration this call for us to also right size and when I think of right sizing or and everybody's they write about this all the time and when I think about right-sizing I think about it not just in in the context of the schools that we operate but also the schools or the public Chargers that we

[01:31:00]
so it's like looking at all of that and looking at a finite number of students and how are we how are we looking at the resources and the infrastructure that we need to support that number of students whether they're in an APS infrastructure structure building or a charter facility because they're all facilities nonetheless and all that money flows through us because that's the other big responsibility we have it flows through us we you know we get it out there and we're our goal is around that guard rail around you know making sure that we're doing things equitably right that we're not we're not doing one over the other and so so those are the kinds of things that I think about I think it's I think it's wonderful to have a small school that you have I think the the value of what I heard tonight from all of our charter schools in the in the public forum was the importance of

[01:32:00]
needs in different places there are students that are coming over and that's the place where we can build that uniqueness and I love that we have as many charter schools that we have I think we need to I think we have enough to to Really sort of meet that demand and do what we need to do that's the that's the part of the flexibility that I think makes it makes it wonderful for those families who are looking for something that's different than an option that works for them I'm always heartbroken when there are wait lists because there are weightless even within our make that schools right I mean I've had a stepdaughter who wanted to try to get into a program I couldn't eat either so like you just having to get on that weightless and kind of hope and pray and so so we know that families are looking for options and different ways to to sort of customize their educational experience for their children and so that those are the only things I don't know what my decision is like right

[01:33:00]
and I don't mean I don't even expect you to like respond back to me on this it's just that I just want you to know that's where I rest right at this minute because I struggle with that I do have some concerns around the the note that we got from commissioner or leave us because as a public entity also with Public Schools I don't want to have an unintended consequence back to the county that we're all sort of like did we do something that also was an unintended consequence it's not going to be that we're happening another public entity in some way too how do we know what do we need to do to address that and so I don't know if you have a response to that with love okay I think it's important to know about the history of the Burnley County development of that area so that entire area was a gift of the Rodger Cox Corporation in the mid-90s both the school and the community center and

[01:34:00]
so the Rodger Cox folks donated to the county and the school and in 2005 the county and the school together did a joint Capital ask of the legislature to get a gym built and ever since we have had really good amazing Partnerships with both with the county with legal mou and a joint agreement but simply put the gym at Vista Grande doesn't exist without the school we maintain constant contact with Bernalillo County planning office the Parks and Recreation Department and and they included each other on all of our projects the Vista Grande Community Center expansion is already part of the County's master plan it's called the document you go to the master plan website for the county and it's there that's been in the work for years in fact I was just invited as a community partner by the planning office of Bernalillo County to be at the October 4th planning department Community input session where the county planners

[01:35:00]
find their intentions with the Vista Grande expansion in fact the county also went to the legislature last session and they received 500,000 to design and plan the expansion of Vista Grande Community Center it's already in the works and so like the one letter we received is just one elected official who's new to the area that doesn't really understand the history that's been involved with that County process so the 500,000 is for the design so the money still needs to be raised actually for the construction of it that's right and that's where it is it is a lengthy process because the County's on the school to use its relationship with the Rodger Cox folks to get an additional like hopeful like donation of land it is a year multi-year project so it is a high demand center it's great but it's because that population around North 14 is exploding and that's why they have a high demand there and it sounds like you said that as well exploding population you've got a community center that obvious

[01:36:00]
play needs to be utilized by the community right and so it sounds like it's it's taken up by the school at this time with just the the demand that you have because of the number of students is that how it's utilized pretty much and that's that's like you know if you've ever experienced the wrath of pickle Ballers I might have to go and give you the Wrath then I'm a pickle ballerina and that is kind of something that the staff does a really good job of communicating about saying this is the long-standing mou legal agreement we've had with the school and the county for years and we do the best to accommodate as many as we can but I also just thought it was inappropriate to tie anything happening at Vista Grande to this amendment just because we're financing this ourselves we're not doing anything related to our expansion is not

[01:37:00]
and so that utilization with Peak would go up as a result because there would be more students but again we're not looking until three more years from now too so and your first class in 2627 would be 100 sixth graders okay all right thank you any other questions or comments Danielle Gonzalez 100%

Charter renewal with the term of 5 years the contract and performance framework for the Albuquerque Charter Academy school violated a material violation of their contract if they fail to make substantial progress towards a team in baseball minimum education standards they fail to meet generally accepted standards of physical

[01:39:00]
and they have two missions specific goals one around measuring strong relationships and the other is measuring the number of students of Scholars that graduate on track and Eric both has a quick statement for you tonight and I'm the executive director at Albuquerque Charter Academy this is our 20th year as a school my 20th year working at the school and our 20th years of partnership with Albuquerque Public Schools we are a Dropout prevention in our community over the last 20 years we have graduated over 2000 students who otherwise would have been dropouts we are successful in reaching our students that have not been successful anywhere for example 15 to 20% of our Scholars enroll with us already off track to graduation

[01:40:00]
contract graduation when we get them done we are leaders in the trauma response at school and movement we adopted this groundbreaking model in 2016 are approaches to Taylor our services to the needs of every student and family who rules with us we do this providing we do this by providing wraparound services including daycare Family Social Work mental health counseling and intensive transition counseling in addition to our academic skill development teachers counselors and administrators from all over APS including mckinney-vento staff refers to us Google have no hope for success and we find a way to reach them not a competitor with APS we help by providing intensive services that are not simply available to people in the community who just felt hopeless and that is our mission to help the students who don't have a home a place they don't fit in and so we find the

[01:41:00]
resources and the staff to make that successful for them our mission and our school has been the life of our Founders and our next generation of staff is deeply passionate about our mission and we look forward to serving our community for decades to come as a source of Hope for families who have been hopeless thank you to your service as a board to our community as we are all working for our students thank you I'll open it up for discussion anyone have any comments to make promise speak tonight remind me why I'm proud to serve here on the board like your family's hearing that they had the hope and almost no other program was there to support them not because they didn't want to they just couldn't and to see that you all bridge that Gap

[01:42:00]
I'm just seeing the Gratitude and the gratefulness that some of these families Express tonight aligns with our goals and guardrails of what why we do what we do but you took it a step further when we said this is more than academics like you literally saved lives and again I will commend you for that and thank you for what you do for our students any other comments and performance framework for Albuquerque Charter Academy any other discussion have a call please take me to Erica yeah right congratulations our next item is considered approval of

[01:43:00]
Charlie know what the term of 5 years contact the performance framework for the coral Community Charter School Madam president of members of the board and Dr Blakey next we have of the renewal for Coral Community Charter School the review team is recommending a 5-year renewal for Coral community and the proficiency goals meet our Collective Community goals their mission specific goals around closing the gender achievement Gap and measuring the student social emotional indicators in their personal education plans and Lori Bachman is here and she's the executive director good evening Madam president and members of the board thank you for considering our second application with APS I have the distinct honor of leading a wonderful group of dedicated Educators that serve pre-k through 5th grade in the International District we serve approximately 250 students currently Student Success is

[01:44:00]
part of all of our decisions what we hope to do is to prevent hopelessness prevent disengagement as early as Pre-K and I hope that came through and some of our family comments we are Dynamic when it comes to supporting our students and families we get to know them at registration and we make it a practice of our leadership to make changes as soon as possible based on ever-changing student needs I like to just a little bit if I may we have a spotlight School designation and on the recently released statistics coming out of the state where 22% higher in reading the state 20% higher in mass and 35% higher in science and we do this through our four pillars that are part of our mission the first one is that we look at

[01:45:00]
brain development research and we have two overarching strategies that we feel support students one of those is structure and one is connection and we trained staff on other strategies that fall under those categories the second part of our mission is quality instruction we're strong on teacher support we analyze data regularly and again we make changes based on ever-changing student needs and our student population the third part of our pillar is individualization every single student has a tailored plan for learning some of our students are in academic groups with their academic peers not necessarily their age group peers all of the day or part of the day we have social emotional and academic goals in every single student education plan and our families are involved in the development and monitoring of their goals

[01:46:00]
we usually have 95% or above attendance from our families at these personal education plan meetings three times a year and then our last pillar is family and Community involvement the authentic involvement of our parents in their students education plan it happens three times a year and then throughout is needed and our connection with our families begins at registration we also bring in adults who are role models in our community who reflect our student population to learn about what is possible outside of Elementary and outside of high school and we utilize our community as well we use utilize the parks and we teach how to be a good Community member right in our neighborhood like we've had a positive impact on our little block there just because we have a school there thank you

[01:47:00]
any discussion questions go ahead board member Peterson I'll go ahead I'm not going to post the the reauthorization of this I think my biggest concern regarding East Mountain expansion is the impact on clearly the Communist part of the community that we're not listening to and that's the community at Roosevelt because you already exist I you know your stable force in the community to have concerns when we talked about right size looking at schools that have less than $250 students and start discussing their viability I do have concerns about the role that Charters play this is my community

[01:48:00]
number of economically disadvantaged students is about half of what it is in the general community and other schools around it Whittier Emerson La Mesa where it is clearly 100% economically stressed families so I just I think when we start looking at what we do is a district and our responsibility it's serving all students that it is absolutely critical to keep in mind that schools like Coral Community Charter are not doing magic that there is a reason why with there's a reason why outcomes look the way they do and there's a reason why outcomes with the way they do it some other schools so again I'm not going to post this because I think it's just

[01:49:00]
table for us and we certainly don't want to turn away and disrupt families that are already there but as we look forward as a district in what we need to do to serve our community I hope that we do not use what's happening at Coral is a reason to criticize condemned chastise and belittle the good work that's going on at other schools at 5:00 when we talked about school size and so you know for the I know for the district is like some of our schools are very small just our regular public schools and there's there's value to that sometimes and sometimes there's not because our resource allocation probably is very similar to what you struggle with too being small right because there's only so many things you can do with that

[01:50:00]
you certainly have a little bit more flexibility in terms of just the structure of how you can structure your day so that is more of a commentary for the the newspaper and for the community out there that you know is really also thinking about you know why doesn't the district you know close some of its smaller schools good question you just gave us a full description of what you do and and the fact is most likely you have the success you have because you have a plan and you're working that plan and your plan involves the four pillars and as you were talking about the four pillars I was struck by how closely they align to four

[01:51:00]
the age group that you're dealing with but you are working through a very systemic structured plan that you have for these students and it's working and APS just recently developed a strategic plan and I hope that as we develop as we work through our strategic plan we as a large district will be able to see the same successes that you have but I think that you need to be celebrated for having a vision for working your mission and for being dedicated to your plan I love that you are focusing on family involvement and family engagement that is another thing it's one of our guardrails we are also trying to create more family engagement and involvement and so I just

[01:52:00]
kudos to you I think the sprinkles on top of the cupcake that you have presented to us where the adorable kids that came to speak in favor of what they of what they have accomplished and how they have grown at your school and so I would like to move for approval of your charger renewal with the term of 5 years contract and performance framework for Coral Community Charter School and all second this is Peggy any other comments discussions and pleasure of visiting Coral elementary school and I got to see some things in action I had children do presentation and they were all very cute and very well prepared and they all seem very happy as

[01:53:00]
did the the staff and so I want to make it clear that yes it's a it's a great functioning school I also had the pleasure of watching the staff manage a child who was having some difficulty and and they they did beautifully they were helping the parents she didn't want to leave school a great song and you know I just want to Circle back that it was one child I tried taking off these glasses

[01:54:00]
they are 13.6% of their population is special period so all I ask

[01:55:00]
is that you work on improving the demographics and and sharing sharing the love sharing the the successes so that's it all right I think we have a motion and a second any other buying any other discussion I will call for the vote Pamela Eragon yes Danielle Gonzales congratulations on your chart is the renewal what the term of 5 years contract and performance framework for Gilbert Arizona Charter High School and Madam president

[01:56:00]
Senna Charter High School the renewal team is recommending a 5 year renewal for the school and the schools proficiency goals meet our community goals and the school's Mission specific goals are around on track graduation and measuring accelerated learning and have the pleasure to introduce Jen prices she is the executive director here with me to make it too comma and thank you to my family for being with us today again my name is Jen and I get to be the new executive director and principal at Gilbert San Antonio high school going into my second year going into its 20th year of operation it is an honor to carry their tradition of accelerated learning amongst students who learn differently and who have been unsuccessful in larger schools earning up to eight credits a year or Blended Blended learning model serves 15

[01:57:00]
students for 6.5 hours a day three classes are live direct instruction with small group and intervention and accelerated learning and the other two class periods are facilitated Credit Recovery intervention with the with a similar facilitated accelerated model in those core classes we enhance the PS portfolio of schools by providing a small school environment with 360° support through our strong daily advocacy model that prepares students for school to careers including space to earn work service in dual credit with support we have a flexible schedule with an early and late start time and students starting as really as early as 10 have the opportunity to go to work or CNN through our dual Credit in school to careers track in advocacy freshman center is where the soft skills habits of mine Etc to be coming College and Career ready and individualized

[01:58:00]
our students are special in many ways 22% of our population of the English language Learners that you saw with Antoine tonight 32% of our special education students 39 percent of students report mckinney-vento eligible 27 of those have been identified through our APS partnership and approximately 40% of our students have or are currently involved with CYFD custody or juvenile probation our program works particularly well with these kids because it allows them to be seen in a smaller School setting with high accountability and individualized attention and a strong personal advocacy model embedded in our school days 100% of students report that they have a connection with at least one trusted in the building where the only small Charter in our area concentrating on serving what we call Our Promise population rather than the population of Albuquerque community

[01:59:00]
we recognize we have a long way to go as we did achieve 4% growth in math Proficiency in the prior year and 7% growth Proficiency in English we are currently not far behind in both state and APS scores in the 11th grade composite averages in both math and Ela taking a look at our mission specific goals in your executive summary what has what what I would like highlighted is that we have met or exceeded both of those missions specific goals in all four years the first one seven we know that 75% or more of our students effectively graduate on track measured by the number of credits as they enter their first year at Center high again we exceeded that goal for years of the current Charter School number two to our accelerated learning students per year each year of our Charter as students begin to reach their junior credit classification

[02:00:00]
there is a miscellaneous School identified in our prior performance framework that hasn't been included but I definitely want the goal out there that students will have the success and dual credit courses passed as measured by students earning as a Seer better at completion of the course we're currently working to meet that goal as we are just below that Benchmark graduation in our last year of our current Charter we graduated 115 and 6 year graduates from whom will not get full credit in the new New Mexico this is accountability accountability model in addition in the last year of our Charter term five early graduates who had at least four credit score credit to include our fourth year math requirement of dual credit financial literacy was CNM that said considering that the shared accountability model with New Mexico we still perform alongside many of those

[02:01:00]
local high schools that we get students from where our mission exists and is the line to our mission we know that when a student starts with us 88% of the time they graduate with us I am super excited about the growth and it should direct tree that has happened over the course of that of that Charter and years to come listen to One success stories I believe to my course the charter leader is where it's at I'd like to highlight two additional examples in addition to the ones you saw tonight one grad this past year was our only summer Grand was an emancipated use working full-time while living with grandparents and is now in line to be a regional manager with Hobby Lobby in our own community in addition our first bilingual still recipient is working and managing her parents restaurant while attending UNM first generation college student with enough dual credit to enter into unm's pre-law program her sister who's also attending a high set it back that's so cool

[02:02:00]
she has a college student and the senior in high school at the same time I hope I can do that we have met or working to meet all the goals and standards set forth in our current car in our current are excuse me in our Charter contract and performance framework I'm thrilled and honored for send a hi to be considered for Renewal so we can continue our accelerated model in grades 9 to 12 in a community where we know 88% of our graduates who are going to graduate on track or early with a meaningful plan to accomplish their goals if you are ready I'll take any questions you may have thank you so much I'll open it up for questions anyone have any questions or comments or three authors of students who are benefiting from the setting

[02:03:00]
I just every time we look at a school like yours to me it's a challenge because when I look at Freedom High School on Wheels I know that when we really dedicate our focus on supporting students with similar kinds of struggles we do a good job with an IPS and so long term I would like to see more of an effort within APS not to be little the work that you're doing but just the objective reality is that we have more resources and and supports that we can pull in throughout the district and so I think it would be best to really look as we have these conversations about downsizing or right size and that we really think about our facilities and what we could be doing to better serve the students that

[02:04:00]
but it's it's the challenge to all of us not not to you I know and I know that you're in an area where there isn't that kind of an alternative so I mean they tend to exist a lot in my area but I know out in your area that's you know it's a special place in it you know definitely I wish we didn't need it as a district right you know I mean I really wish we did not need that kind of resource and that all of our students were you know thriving in our traditional schools and everything was working for them and you know it met all their needs I wish that's my greatest wish but we do know that we have some of these students that really require that specialization and something that's unique to the situation that there in so we've had it forever had it when I was in high school there was always a separate there's always alternative schools and ways that we could support student

[02:05:00]
that had difficulty and needed Credit Recovery or needed assistance with a smaller School sizes and such so I really appreciate the work that you're doing go ahead thank you I have a question following number Peterson's comments it's a question for Dr Blakey it seems a lot of the conversation tonight has focused on right sizing and sort of big picture even in the context of Charter expansions whether those are expanding to middle school or expanding my time and so I'm just curious because there's so much mention of right size what's the status of the right sizing work and when my board anticipate an update on that and how are these issues playing into those rights and conversations so the superintendent can give the board either formally or in the weekly riding however he communicates with all of you on the updates for right side to give you an update the biggest

[02:06:00]
part of it without going too far into it right now is that there is going to be a voice of the community survey that's being conducted by the office of innovation that should go out in the beginning of December and so that will also address kind of what you're asking about to as far as in what are the needs in the community we did a voice of the community several years ago but there's been so much shift on what the priorities are and what are kids are needing that that is going to be done again now it's been probably seven or eight years I'm looking at Escondido because I think he was part of it before so the office of innovation will be putting that out in the upcoming weeks early December it seems appropriate to because the population is also changed within that 78 year span too so the needs probably have shifted significantly and so understanding resource allocation as a result of that

[02:07:00]
will be really helpful but yeah I agree that's a great question and I think we're all looking for that because even our small I know it's hard to be a small Charter too I mean it's hard to be a small charger the money is not is not there and so we've heard that also as a concern so kudos to you for figuring it out how to remain small because what I hear from you too is that there is value in that small list there's no desire to want to be more expensive because you because you've got a specialized

[02:08:00]
Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson yes Crystal Tapia Romeo yes that's enough right we've come to the end of our meeting so the next Board of Education meeting will be November 15th 2023 at 5 p.m. and a special Board of Education meeting November 29th 2023 at 5:15 p.m. we're immediately following the finance committee meeting will be held at the Allison Bruce King educational complex here at 6400 Boulevard Uptown Boulevard and live streamed on aps.com edu and with that we are Jordan thank you ladies and gentlemen for coming tonight and spending your evening with us got out and record time two hours
