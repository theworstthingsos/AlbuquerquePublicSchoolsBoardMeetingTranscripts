[00:03:00] October 15th 2025 Board of Education meeting agenda like to remind board members that for APS Board of Education governance manual you can request an item be removed from the consent agenda before the meeting agenda is posted but not during the meeting we have a motion and a second I moved to adopt the October 15th 2025 Board of Education meeting agenda Dominguez this is member Romero second thank you can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes our next time can you please share the instructions for public forum yes thank you president Gonzalez Welcome to our public forum guess when you sign up to speak you were asked to review rules and expectations which are presiding officer will enforce then New Mexico
[00:04:00] open meetings act requires that our agenda specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up for their in-person or virtual those with you there tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers you will have two minutes to speak otherwise you will have one minute tonight we have nine speakers once your time is up you'll be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel on able to convey your message you might email board Ed at APS dot edu in addition for those of you here tonight a representative from our service center is there to assist you Mr Gonzalez please introduce the speakers thank you secretary astorga our first Speaker tonight is Jerome at home followed by Catherine Lynn
[00:05:00] you have two minutes once you begin speaking my name is Jerome teacher at El Dorado High School and came here to read this morning period the importance of these classes that's evident in the movie to the academy model where we put an emphasis on Career Readiness but
[00:06:00] play CTE classes required funding and there's more than million dollars available to APS this school year through the Perkins Grant we're well past the money when the money was anticipated and APS needs to expedite These funds let's make sure the money is available and we can continue to equip students for College and Career Success by offering Hands-On learning in real world experiences across a wide range of Pathways thank you in our next speaker is Catherine followed by Karina hello my name is Katherine Lin I am the culinary arts teacher teacher at Heritage Academy I'm here today to talk to you about the Perkins Grant the Perkins grant that APS has used for a number of years is valuable it provides crucial funds for CT classes throughout the district
[00:07:00] as with any Grand though there are uncertainties grants themselves can disappear and the process for obtaining them can be difficult as we are seeing this year my colleagues and I would like the district to consider shifting more APS money to the hardware that these classes require this would not only reinforce the district's commitment but we reduce Reliance on just one main source of funding not to be funny but we do not want to put all of our eggs in one basket we hope remains that this money will be available in 2026 we're already on the other side of fall break going forward we would be wise to dedicate the money we can control for the priorities we've identified and our students needs now on a personal level for my students I know that the grad money has helped with blessings for us to go to CNM they
[00:08:00] with buses to go to competition in Santa Fe I know this year we had to choose between ProStar and FCCLA because we could not compete with both the money directly affects the students in the classroom for groceries for for smallwares like pots and pans a trickle Heritage is 17 years old and we need those kind of equipment but we don't have money to do that I think our biggest fear here is that we're going to run out of money before the end of the year the kids take culinary arts to cook and if we don't have any money to buy groceries then we cannot give them the full experience thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Karina or visual stuff okay you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking once again you'll be followed by Jaden West go ahead right good evening my name is Karina Arby's Acosta
[00:09:00] I am a culinary teacher also known as more than likely it's like ProStar again and again our district seeks to emphasize Equity all of our students including general education and special populations deserve the same opportunities and support because they need to have access to every part of their potential we won't live up to that goal if we don't provide exposure to a variety of options that means of course dedicating resources money time and people to see classes that gives students a chance to explore various programs of study to let their interest shift and evolve to the love to and to love learning that's what Equity looks like make all options equally available we will achieve that in the best way by making CTE a priority of our district and that means insurance we obtained grant funding and dedicate District resources to these classes
[00:10:00] thank you our next speaker is Jaden West followed by Tom shoots you know 2 minutes once you begin speaking my name is Jayden Wesson I am a culinary arts teacher for Albuquerque High School again the goals of the Perkins Grant online precisely with the goals of our district every day that passes without funds being available is another day when it's harder to provide high-quality CTE for our students the grant is dedicated to Preparing students for high school Highway occupations this is exactly what the district emphasizes in its stated goal of equipping students for College and Career Success next is professional development for staff APS has a stated commitment to fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth among our Educators and staff the grant is also aimed at our
[00:11:00] history and business partners another use that syncs up precisely with abs is stated commitment to Community Based schools there's a million dollars worth of support for the priorities we have already identified the priorities that will serve our students and our community whatever work needs to be done to access these money is vital and we hope that work is completed soon our students deserve these opportunities we can and must do better thank you sir our next speaker is Tom shook followed by Janet Delgado Mr sugar good evening board my name is Tom shook I'm the director of education for the New Mexico Restaurant Association executive director of the hospitality industry Education Foundation and the state coordinator for the first star program The High School culinary arts program on behalf of the New Mexico Restaurant Association and the pro start educator
[00:12:00] I'm here to speak and support of the Educators request that they already designated Perkins funding be immediately released to their programs ProStar culinary arts program is a critical CTE and Workforce Development program giving students a direct pathway into the hospitality industry or to post-secondary education opportunities as we all know students who are part of CTE programs are much more likely to graduate and find employment than those who are not post art is National program students will complete the two year curriculum have the opportunity to step into supervisory positions in the hospitality industry right out of high school or receive post-secondary education credit at Hospitality culinary and hotel management programs it's concerning to me to learn that already secured Perkins funding for APS High School culinary programs is being held back
[00:13:00] these Educators cannot run their programs without it CTE classes don't function without supplies for classroom and lab work curriculum materials professional development opportunities for the Educators and competition catering events for the students it's our hope that this crucial funding will be released to the Educators in order to continue their amazing work with their students thank you thank you sir next speaker is Janet Delgado followed by Mary Walker Herrera good evening board members and Dr Gonzalez my name is Janet Delgado and I probably culinary arts teacher Rio Grande High School I also teach the agriculture nutrition program that I believe you heard about not too long ago in a board meeting that takes place all summer long so we keep our students engaged all year long
[00:14:00] you've heard a number of my colleagues emphasize the importance of getting CTE funding for CTE classes like mine I want to emphasize that you're absolutely right no one doubts the district's commitment to College and Career Readiness we share that commitment and we want to do the important work to meet our shared goals that can only happen with proper funding please do anything you can to make the Perkins funds available for these classes this year thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Mary Walker Herrera followed by Dr Camilo you have two minutes good evening Madam president school board members I'd like to read something entitled I have a dream I have a dream that New Mexico will be known for the people they vote for I have a dream that these officials will serve the people who voted for them
[00:15:00] I have a dream that both voted in officials and the people of New Mexico will take care of each other keep each other accountable I have a dream that families in New Mexico will be cultivated and nurtured just as we cultivate and nurture our famous Hatch Green Chile I have a dream that the children from these families growing up in New Mexico will be cherished and cared for as they will care for the Next Generation I have a dream that children in New Mexico will be different from the way they are treated in New Mexico today I have a dream that the children in New Mexico know that they can make a difference that they use wisdom to use their voice to make New Mexico a state of accountability I have a dream that their children's children will be even wiser I have a dream that the children in New Mexico will be educated with Parental Guidance and stilled from accountable New Mexicans I have a dream that the elected officials in the public education system will come from the children being educated
[00:16:00] I have a dream that those officials will be wiser and make themselves accountable to their voters much better than today I have a dream that one day the APS school board members will be held accountable for the office that they hold I have a dream that we the people will be accountable for the board members we vote for I have a dream that our children will be the next brilliant bright future voters generation families in New Mexico I have a dream that the children dream of a better New Mexico and I have a dream that God blesses New Mexico thank you thank you our next speaker is Dr Samoa followed by Janet Sayers you have two minutes period
[00:17:00] what's the level official and athlete most new Mexican agrees that girls and boys have the right to Single Sex about bathrooms locker rooms and sports at school for instance a poll by Independent Women's Network found that 91% of New Mexicans believe that K to 12 boys and girls bathroom should be separated the poll also found that 84% of new Mexican believe Sports should be separated by biological sex this is about school policy of concern in Albuquerque in Las Cruces good girls at risk two new laws that happen again sports teams that puts the girls that really 12 year old girl was pregnant girls can be severely injured when they are forced to play
[00:18:00] play sports against boys as in as an example high schooler Peyton McNabb in North Carolina suffered head and neck injuries after a transgender athlete Spike the volleyball into her face Peyton has suffered long-term effects from her injuries including paralysis and Pearle Vision learning disability constant headaches and depression and National Organization defending education has recently against CPS in lcps pictures of 1972 in equal protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution the lawsuit of violation of recent executive order is related to sex discrimination programs his lost city of lcps accounting 2:00 p.m.
[00:19:00] practices in order appropriate relief and quote let's use common sense would you want your you and your daughter to be in the same locker room bathroom and sports with trans identifying biological boys may God have mercy on APS and New Mexico thank you thank you our next speaker is Jenna says and you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president members of the board and staff and I do hope that as the board continues that we can solve some problems problem number one millions of dollars of recreation facilities sit locked up unused on weekends on holidays and during the summer so let's try to solve that problem how can the public go back to free 2018
[00:20:00] when they could be used problem number two there I am in the little bitty square and the giant timer that's what people see when they're watching you know live YouTube let's make this better the city in the county you all are APS is this big a city government let's make this better you can do it invest some money in that number three the reasonable news of expecting board members to have full-time jobs and to serve without any kind of individual support I would hope that over the next several years APS in the operating budget would look at how can there be AIDS whether it's 180 so that there could be more support to help
[00:21:00] 85 and Del Norte lost a member of his family and Alec Montoya the young man the Pediatric nurse that was killed in the tragic accident in front of you and him Hospital 2014 graduate of Del Norte he was on the wrestling team and so his loss affects the Del Norte family and I would just urge kindness and to each other as we enter the November 4th election I will be voting yes on the bond issue of 285 million whatever it is so thank you very much thank you very much
[00:22:00] next item is to consider acceptance of our progress monitoring report for goal to math proficiency are presenters are doctor Antonio Gonzalez as our Acting Superintendent Dr Randy Moore Deputy superintendent Chris Sanchez assistant superintendent and Sherry jet Chief academic officer I figured if I named a bunch of names some people would come up and Mr Christmas but before we begin we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report have been met but I'll open up the floor to anyone else who thinks we might be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests otherwise
[00:23:00] all right excellent since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have had the opportunity to ask questions that are Technical and tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted but the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals to the board schools those questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time out so let's get started we'll go ahead and start online number historical do you have a question I do thank you sorry I have a crying baby in the background
[00:24:00] so my question I'm in the questions that were submitted beforehand the answer for question two states that this progress is closely tied to Stronger use of high-quality instructional materials targeted teacher coaching cycles and more consistent subgroup monitoring through structured data routines but in the report under Middle School root cause analysis problem 1 it says the primary cause is a lack of instructional alignment and Fidelity to high quality instructional materials so can you explain how both are true and how we plan to solve the gaps president Gonzalez Gonzalez when we're looking at the root cause analysis we did not meet our projected outcome for our students who are
[00:25:00] identified as economically disadvantaged So within that root cause analysis that was the focus group that we were looking at within question two we were looking at what were the games for our El students or students with disabilities are Native American or African-American students so it's kind of it's yes it does sound like it is contradicting itself within that those two different questions or one was a question and one was the root cause but the root cause was in relation to our economically disadvantaged students just like I can follow up on that can you share a little bit more on the plan to replicate what you did with African-American students and economically disadvantaged students so that we can see that same increase
[00:26:00] yes member of the see that as a culturally responsive approach in the support of our African-American students in the games that they made what we are really trying to accomplish this school year is building coherence within all of our departments so as you're looking at the strategies that we're rolling out we're really wanting to break down silos so to speak and have our teaching and learning Department really work with our special ed department or else he department or Native American department or indigenous people's department and really start building this coherence so that as we are deploying resources to our schools specifically are priority and emerging schools it is a team approach and not a one-off approach
[00:27:00] economically disadvantaged what barriers might be contributing to the students following behind and specifically how will that be addressed word president Gonzalez members of the board and Dr Gonzalez thank you for the question board member Topia Romero when we look at the data particularly among our economically disadvantaged students one constant challenge VC is and so as we look at what are the barriers that are keeping our students from coming to schools one of the solutions is in our Student Success
[00:28:00] Sims work across the district and so in our priority schools we have devoted FTE to somebody who is actually looking at that attendance data but also looking at it and correlation with academic achievement behavior and then also our goal for skills habits and mindsets so we can get in front of potential challenges when we start to see a student is missing a lot of school the students acting out etcetera and so that role is specifically dedicated to working with the teachers to come up with those really sophisticated interventions that we know will help particularly the student population thank you can I ask one to so in relation to the attendance issue how long is it actually taking us to follow up closely with the family and ensure that we're keeping them we're getting them back on track thank you for that board member Topia Romero I would
[00:29:00] it's probably varies by school and the level of sophistication of their Student Success system at this time a relatively sophisticated system is within days of looking at our early warning reports and looking at the data that's telling us about the whole child but I you know I would be remiss if I didn't say that we have schools that are in the beginning stages of setting up that system but certainly when we look at our performance framework and how we've allocated resources towards that we do have an emphasis on priority schools that do serve a lot of our economically disadvantaged students thank you thank you thank you so you mentioned one of the system changes that you're working on is the the Student Success system particularly as it relates to Chronic absenteeism and so I'm wondering if there are other strategies that you're using to reach every Middle School
[00:30:00] and in particular what are you going to do to ensure that those strategies are reaching the highest concentration of our economically disadvantaged students for president economically disadvantaged students and we're looking specifically at our priority schools for example those priority schools have received funding practices are Student Success systems we have our community school coordinators schools that do have I'm speaking might make an assumption but have the highest
[00:31:00] was talking about having these extra allocations this human capital on the campus to support the schools in monitoring who are students are but also getting that information to the teachers so that we can see the results in the classroom so that is system is currently happening right now so to follow up to that we're almost to November and so they've been in school 4 months so what is the early feedback on whether or not those system changes are working for are they working as planned member Jackson thank you one of the things that myself
[00:32:00] this current school year we have been working directly with every single principal to ensure that there is a critical action within their 98 plans that reflects to work of the goal there is autonomy in there where the school every school is different so they are looking at their data differently to identify with that critic collection mean you might be students with disabilities it might be El students might be Native American students on where they feel they need to focus on their supports so we are currently coaching going in and coaching all of our principles number one to ensure is that critical action within their 98 plan what supports do they need from us so that we can then reach out to our teaching and learning departments and follow through with the strategies that are within the report from
[00:33:00] getting into the principles that they can get it to the teachers who are really working extremely hard but now with a through line of supports coming from the district all the way into classroom I'm assuming I know what the answer to this is but I have heard Dr Blakey say this several times that every student only gets that one year in school so I am going to assume that I know the answer but is there a sense of urgency in working through their through lines if and when concerns are brought up throughout the the actions that you have taken given that they only have one year to be in sixth grade when you're being 7th grade I'll give you a
[00:34:00] an example of about 3 hours ago I was talking to you one of our middle school principals and she was talking about supports for her Math teachers and they were struggling getting the support so I contacted her teaching and learning folks and said can you contact this principal because they gave me some concerns and there was that sense of urgency where that phone call was made directly to that principle to get in touch with that math department to offer those supports is happening like in real time so yes there is a sense of urgency thank you thank you remember to me thank you to count as my question because I want clarification off of what you just asked so when you say through line of support it implies the possibility of more support and I think your answer suggested that
[00:35:00] response to School site administrators and teachers needing support that we are here to help you with and ensuring that the principles are getting them coached by me so that they can then get them down into the teacher's hand so we can see it in the classrooms right but but they are getting an
[00:36:00] response okay just wanted to make sure that was that I understood that correctly so my question has to do with strategies and planned actions on page 9 of the goal to report but it's also related to page six the root cause analysis being the lack of instructional alignment of fidelity to high quality materials so here's my question how will you how will the superintendent and her staff and
[00:37:00] improve collaboration among between with Middle School teachers and on site administrators to affect change and what will be the feedback loop for those strategies a little bit earlier about their own PDP
[00:38:00] 90 day plan so as excuse me is I am working with principals coaching principles the conversation is now all around the 90-day plan and their own PDP which is another level of support in addition to that at our monthly principal meetings the principals are coming to these meetings with a problem with practice that they are creating and this problem of practice they are sitting with their colleagues and going through a consultancy protocol to look at different ways of approaching it refining it so that they can go back and make their leadership moves based on listening to me thank you for listening Gonzalez thank you for setting that up period
[00:39:00] the assistant superintendent does directly with the principal in terms of being the instructional leader and and helping hold the teacher accountable through coaching and support to make sure that we are providing standards-based instruction in our classrooms and I would say that's probably are very first strategy is to continue to focus on standards-based instruction at grade level in our classrooms and so with that we have done if you will a relaunch of our illustrative math I I in instructional material curriculum because we did see we felt like we looked at 3. 1 5
[00:40:00] teachers in the middle school department have come up with basically seven core strategies that were going to launch to our teaching and learning coaches who are in the schools to help really Define how math instruction in particular will look different and then how we can specifically support that so in relation to access to standards-based instruction if you remember from last year we talked about accelerated learning and that that emphasis on we want to make sure that every student has access to grade level materials and we're not actually dropping them down because we're worried about any gaps in their skills so we're looking at just in time intervention is one of those strategies so really thinking what's the prerequisite skill that we have to make sure kids know in order to be successful in this lesson if we need to spend 10 minutes on that prerequisite skills that's part of the shift in mouth and instructions so that where I really setting the students up to be successful in the rest of the the lesson and we're really leaving less
[00:41:00] and I think related to the question about collaboration it's a conversation Mr Sanchez and I have been having around what are the collaborative and professional development opportunities with Anna Middle School schedule and they vary honestly just depending on how the school is used its resources but once we understand better what those structures are so for example if a principal has been able to give a collaboration period to their teachers well that's one inroad right that's one way that we can begin working with teachers you may have heard of a principal's two for 20 every 20 days of principal gets two hours to work with their staff that's another inroad right and so once we understand best to structures and we can really lean into not just the work with the principal but the work directly with the teachers and I have a follow-up I appreciate your efforts to honor autonomy at the school site I think I mean we're all human
[00:42:00] and we are not robots so I take note of that and appreciation for it how you mentioned the resource teachers identifying 7 core strategies and so how were these strategies if at all Guided by a conversation with teachers how were they arrived at thank you for that question so we are leading into the expertise of our middle school math resource teacher who are also looking through an interdisciplinary lens because the content all needs to come together and we feel that's particularly important as we launch our Middle School redesign so these strategies have been we've been collecting them if you will over the last
[00:43:00] as we've looked at our successes in math classrooms across the district and sometimes when we come before you and we've talked about any of the goals we will tell you stories about this is what the school did in order to achieve that and so we've been studying that and really looking across for the themes that tell us what the best practices are that are going to be successful in our schools obviously with a lens towards that autonomy because we do know that every school Community is different so this is a compilation of you will of a Year's worth of research and what we see is being successful in our math classrooms thank you thank you thank you I appreciate the and I really appreciate the interdisciplinary lens particularly because I think I forget where cross-functional strategy design included Fine Arts and as an athlete and Fine Arts person
[00:44:00] those two are critical thank you thank you my question falls on page 7 problem 3 students lack Readiness and algebra and Gateway domains your route card States through causes a lack of foundational skills and conceptual understanding from prior grades students are not mastering pre-requisite Concepts and moving on and creating significant gaps in their knowledge so what I'm looking at here is special education and so since you're talking about foundational skills in Pryor grades and conceptual understanding so how does literacy proficiency impact the 3.8 math proficiency rate among children with disabilities and what integrated instructions are strategies can we use to strengthen them both foundational reading
[00:45:00] mathematical reasoning skills since we're looking at such a very low proficiency level for our kids with disabilities president Gonzalez memberito I'm going to address the part about how we can address really what is essentially the four domains of language and all instruction and then I'm going to ask about the impact of literacy on mathieux I'm not sure I can speak I think I could probably make something up and so you know one thing that we've really been talking about across cage 12 and across all disciplines is the idea that we are all language teachers and so we know how particularly important that is in mathematics as well so mathematics has a vocabulary all its own and our lesson should math curriculum is pretty text dance honestly
[00:46:00] and so providing students with those opportunities in Reading Writing speaking and listening are really a critical component of all of the classrooms and working particularly with our Language and Cultural Equity team really emphasizing again that we are all languages but I don't know how much more detail I can really provide you in this context
[00:47:00] but I would say some of the things that we see it's also it's it's also we tend to find that math is a little hard to teach and we tend to find out where is a district I believe that we have a lot of strong strategies in reading this really seen that in ourselves that we present to you with phone call 1.11
[00:48:00] for all of us to learn strategies and all of us to do it so that we're not just focusing on reading or focusing on that but I think I'm going a little bit away from your question no it answers it a little bit but I just have one more follow up because my concern here is these are 8th graders and they'll be going in tonight period And I only can tell you as an advocate and when I get called in at a 9th grade level and a parent finds out that one their child is not proficient in reading and then also finds out with a child with a disability that they're all not proficient in math I can't tell you what that does to them as a parent so I don't know how we can make this better but it's a serious concern as these kids are entering High School
[00:49:00] 4 years left to improve those skills so I would hope we would do it better and that's all I need to say thank you remember president Gonzalez memberito if I may I think there's something under the leadership of Dr Blakey that's worth mentioning in response to your point is that there's the belief that we do have the answers in the room and there's the belief that we have some strong practices that we need to lift up I would like to point out that overall we did make the strongest showing in on this specific assessment in mathematics overall up 2.3% points from last year but the power of this process is showing us that there's specific areas we need to work on special education economically disadvantages economically disadvantaged for example those are two areas we need to work on and through the leadership of Dr Blakey one of the things that I've been very impressed that I've seen her do is be bold enough to highlight
[00:50:00] the success of the schools that have made gains in these areas for example at the beginning of our principal meetings their physically called up and they are recognized and offered as examples to peers to their to their principal peers there's been some good work that's going on and let's talk about it in a very true data-driven way in a very honest way and there's been that recognition and there's nothing like getting a word of affirmation right but that's not the power of this process the powers what happens after the recognition that's when other principles go up to these principles and they asked tell me a little bit more show me and that's where invitations to schools and walk throughs go to where these principles are able to work with one another to learn in detail what are you doing for special education students I've seen it again in that area for example or economically disadvantaged students or show me how the student
[00:51:00] Port system process works at your school so I believe that this process has really led us to recognize through the data some of the schools that are doing good work and lift them up as an example for their peers to leverage and grow up on those good pieces of work because I think it also stated within some of your root causes that the lack of having the Equitable Deliverance of some of these materials and instruction is also a challenge yeah thank you thank you thank you president Gonzalez and good evening thank you for being here tonight so I'm just going to reference my question the answer and then give you my question for this evening so my question that I submitted was what factors contributed to the notable 9.5% increase for African-American students and can these practices be identified and scale the cross other groups to scale the practices the district is focusing on expanding coaching and modeling delivering differentiated supports for high needs schools
[00:52:00] functional strategies that better serve students with overlapping needs such as English Learners and students receiving special education services my question is can you expand on the cross functional strategies and development and provide a timeline for implementation so we have we have been working really hard to tighten up our work within all of our department so that we can really focus putting up our strategies into action at the school level so building this coherent so that we can start replicating things that are really working well
[00:53:00] and having a specific departments who are supporting schools with the culturally responsive instruction and really going in and helping schools number one identify who the students are what are the areas of focus that they need to really look at with these with our focus groups putting a plan in place but then it's not just relying on one Department it might be even Chris West Apartments so that they can actually put a true plan in place and support not only are African-American students or Native American students but all of the students as well okay so it sounds like it's already it's been developed and it's in implementation now if I'm understanding you it's kind of
[00:54:00] thank you thank you the great thing about going last is my question is usually get taken so I'm going to try I'm going to say this question the same way I had it written but I think it's very similar to remember to worry toes so essentially we know that math standards build upon each other and you all described in the report the scaffolding that's used to teach grade level content will also integrating where students are behind and so my question is where he does was focused specifically on students with disabilities mine is what strategies is the district bruising to improve vertical alignment to address the math gaps in elementary schools thank you for the question I was like oh Elementary but I can see why that's really important
[00:55:00] so as we we look at our elementary work in particular we are looking at numeracy even though go one is specifically about early literacy and so in relation to that and you'll probably hear more about it in in the next progress monitoring report we're really thoughtful about what are the priority standards that a student across the grade levels would need to master in order to experience success but that being said we do know that a shift occurs when students transition from 5th to sixth grade and how the math is approached maybe how it's taught and so with this Elementary focus on strong numeracy we're ensuring that they have those prerequisite skills in order to come in to in particular sixth grade with a really strong Foundation to build on that's helpful and I guess based on
[00:56:00] what you are currently seeing as the standards that are not being reached in the 7th and 8th grade assessment is that leading to any changes in coaching or instruction for elementary math so you do have the priority standards already identified for elementary math but are you making shifts based on where you're seeing standards not being met yes thank you for that clarification so it again particularly in the fourth and fifth grade when we hit those intermediate years this is where we're beginning to set that foundation for what's going to happen in this sixth grade and so the vertical articulation between the elementary and the middle school it's been an area of focus for many of our principals maybe Mr Sanchez can speak more specifically to it but the the sense that we certainly aren't looking down at her Elementary and saying you're not teaching them this you're not teaching them up but if you're not a middle school math teacher you may not know exactly what it is we're expecting the students to do and so those continued conversations
[00:57:00] particularly between a 5th and 6th grade teacher a really critical for ensuring that when our students transition into middle school they're coming in and they're confident and they're ready to be successful is to add a little bit to that one of the great things that's really taken off this year with Dr mellow and CAO jet as well as the assistant team is we are all in such close proximity to us and Dr Miller wine is really starting to stress since he's coming to we all have to support each other in order to support us so
[00:58:00] what each other's work is and supporting each other's work so that when we know that if our middle school kids can't read it's going to be a struggle on the math test we also know that you don't come to middle school to learn that you are a mathematician in middle school and those foundational skills are built in elementary so there's a lot of go back to that coherence word again we're really starting to build it within our team our leadership team so that we all know what we're doing in order to support the principles and then building that Foundation within the 140 principles ago we had every single princess thank you
[00:59:00] we can go back around open it up again so just remember do you have any additional questions I do not thank you thank you and then anyone else any additional questions yes yes yes remember Domingos go ahead I'm having a hard time deciding which one I'll continue with the the groups both English language Learners and I tried to do my homework about her yell and it gets it gets complicated right and I think it's the same situation with special ed so I just wanted to preface that for people who are listening that
[01:00:00] it's a complex issue this notion of assessment of the of these particular groups and and I think we see it in the results and that's not an excuse for the low very low results so the question is this what legally and ethically appropriate tools are available to accurately evaluate the growth of students with disabilities and Ale students and I guess I'm this question is informed by a story from a parent
[01:01:00] this kid wasn't performing in high school and yet 2 years after he left APS I mean just barely left graduated he's at Socorro the the school there and not all kids are going to fall and I category but we're not catching what they know to so it's I don't want to excuse the 95% of Ale and special ed kids who aren't for fishermen and I also want to capture this question about evaluating no I'm sorry do I need to ask a question
[01:02:00] phone number to Vegas so I just wanted to address some of you I'll try my best to address on your concerns about assessment so I think the important thing to remember about assessment is that this is one measure so when we're talking about this data point which for here we're using the NM mssa the New Mexico measures of Student Success in achievement so I think I do that just to see if I can do it this is so these are standards that were developed this is not this is not a national test this is not a Southwest test this is not a region of States this is a New Mexico so this test was developed by Mexico Educators so these are coming in room right now I'm not sure but my point is that education is appropriate items to determine whether iTunes knowing can do and they are based on the Mexico adopted standards that's one measuring which is awesome why we come to you with the I already
[01:03:00] across the United States and again that one if you want to think about until like passing Buster or passing a standard so that the Max Pro test the standard there was do New Mexico Educators do they feel that is measuring what they're asked to teach with I already there it's not only is it saying and there's some people here who might disagree with whether it's my dream what we have in Mexico States who are saying yes this test is covering what we expect our students to know and excuse me but let's also not forget the most important part in my opinion or something in the classroom it's the unit test it's the it's the collaborative
[01:04:00] what do they do with their peers it's all that learning that happens in my classroom and I don't mean that to diminish obviously that the test that that I'm responsible for nor any of the time we've been doing those tests but is the collaboration or excuse me it's the it's not one data point and like that's one of the biggest messages that we put I know that Mr Sanchez as well as is when we talked to schools or we can talk to each other it's like bring all the data points for it so I just want to assure you that it's not meant to diminish the students but I and it doesn't mean that there's not more Innovative things that we can be doing which I know what we talking to you about in the next presentation but not supposed to do that again but but you know there are some cats with using these new assessments and we're learning some of those but I just wanted to just not challenge you but just challenge the assumption that don't take this as one day to point it is one of the data points but I also think like
[01:05:00] will show me your lesson plan I'm going to come to a quick walk through on my phone to Observation site I think I'm on a little bit of a soapbox but I just wanted to show you that it's don't don't take this as the data point take it as one of the data points and I think someone who did badly on Saturday there were other ways of me to demonstrate what I could do but also those standardized tests also helped me once I got to be humble enough to realize I had some things I need to learn that I need to work on so I just think that there's one data point and I know this long answer but I hope that helps some yes but I think maybe I'm not articulating this idea appropriately
[01:06:00] these kids aren't empty vessels and so how do where are we assess what they do know in order to get them to this one tool or this other that we have two tools that we rely on and they're not doing well in either one of them and that doesn't have to be answered now but but that's my show up they know something all right well thank you to our presenters for this productive conversation and now we must vote on whether or not we are going to accept this progress monitoring report so as a point of clarity our vote is to accept the
[01:07:00] as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the administration and that we have a deeper understanding now of how the current reality for students lines up with our vision for them in order to accept this we must be able to answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal is their goal is their growth toward the vision and is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision I say yes no yes I don't know what that means and you do not think there's growth toward the vision I think we're in progress I heard there's a lot of you know establishing a system and and trying to figure it out and that's okay thank goodness we're doing that
[01:08:00] so the answer is yes no yes or it's not there yet for me so is the question is their growth well do you think know we did okay but otherwise the majority looks like the answer to all three is yes and so we can accept the monitoring report confident that the data is accurate and that the superintendent and team are performing at this point we are ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report I move that we accept the progress monitoring report for goal to math proficiency this is member Jackson and this is remember top your Romero second thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please no and that does not mean that you're not working hard at it just means that I what I said earlier
[01:09:00] Ronaldo tomatito restaurant yes yes and so the motion carries thank you for the presentation we will move on to our next item which is to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring reports for interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 focused on early literacy are presenters now include on each other's assistant superintendent for elementary schools as I stated we're ready to monitor interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 but before we begin as we did with the last report we just need to confirm that the report itself is complete so I do believe that all the criteria for connected for an effective report have been met but I will open up before for anyone who feels like the report maybe missing one of the required elements anyone have evidence that suggests the reports excellent since everyone agrees at the required
[01:10:00] elements are present we will open up the floor to our monitoring conversation as a reminder we've asked Technical and tactical questions in nature before tonight's meeting and those questions and their answers are posted online with the materials for the public to see each board member is again expected to ask one question at least during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the boards and guardrails and those questions must be smart so let's get started we'll go ahead and just reverse our order for this time and start to my left so we'll start with member benavidez and end with member Astoria and then we can go back around but remember you president Gonzalez and thank you all for being here again this evening my question is what targeted instructional strategies can or will be implemented across all K through three classrooms to close the 22 to 23% power rank gap between the Martinez Yazzie plus African-American students and their peers
[01:11:00] what president Gonzales 50 superintendent Dr Gonzales and board member benavidez we would like to talk about and explain the strategy within our elementary school commitment which does aligned with the three priority standards that have been identified through our teaching and learning department and resource teachers currently we have just rolled out and presented the strategies that are have been suggested for classroom teachers to start to inquire and test out and go through the process of professional development as well as observational feedback cycles and receiving feedback and coaching from principles as well as with assistant superintendents so this is one of the pivotal pieces that we can take a look at that where we can start the work and then we
[01:12:00] are confident that that will start to transfer over to 90 Day plans so that we can create more sophisticated systems and strategies of support for those instructional strategies that have been suggested thank you any follow-up member benefits at this time thank you thank you remember don't worry too I was trying to look for your roll out to parents and I know that many times I can't recall if it was during this time that you were looking at having a booklets for parents or the guideline for take home so they can use the Home Learning environments to help students and I wanted to know how those were going to be produced in other languages or are we adapting them or are subgroups of Martinez sinemasi
[01:13:00] right now we do have and we had last year when pagers that explained the standards that each grade level would be responsible for learning We are continuing to take a look at refining them just from feedback that we received to make sure that they are user-friendly to be able to explain and Implement in the home Albuquerque Public Schools also has a very amazing translation Department that we are able to turn in all of our work to be translated into all of the languages represented within our public school system so it does take a little bit of time however we do have those systems in place and family teacher conferences are coming up in November so we have a timeline that we are meeting so that we make sure that those materials are out at that time my second question to that was it's great for the pronounce to have that for families
[01:14:00] cannot speak English and I'm glad during parent-teacher conferences that discussion will be done and and whether they're home language or so I'm trying to figure out with how will you present that to them on a one-to-one basis teachers have access to translation services also and they can schedule ahead of time with a translator through Albuquerque Public School System that participates in the actual conference so they are able to translate into the family's home language and serves as an interpreter between the teacher and the family so that there is a discussion that continues at the level of understanding for both and usually we try to encourage teachers to schedule those out very early since we do have a large number and typically they are accommodated very well okay thank you thank you remember Dominguez I'm going to follow
[01:15:00] family engagement piece so what are the key gaps or students with disabilities and English language Learners and how might the district and the board engage families more meaningful and effectively to play an active role to help us address these gaps I am looking at Mr West too much to do that you know but what's coming to mine is several different layers of work that we're doing particularly through Dr Salazar's office with family engagement so I'm going to start with our community school impact coordinator and our community school council model that we
[01:16:00] community support and projects through the council but also a greater understanding of what the academic needs of the students are and so then when the community and the families can come together we can provide specific resources that help them support and thinking of what the kindergarten kindergarten priority standard is print concepts recognize a name all upper and lowercase letters this is a something we could make really accessible at home help our families and even our community to like to work on with their kindergarten students other layers certainly you know include the communication that the teacher has with the family the we can't ever over inside the importance of the teacher in the classroom because they're the ones who really know what the student can and cannot do whether however they're performing on a standardized assessment
[01:17:00] and so again through those those conferences those conversations being able to really pinpoint what those skill gaps are and leverage our resources to help the families really be partners and the academic achievement of the students are there what strategies are being discussed that are more communities to impact everything you just laid out I'm not sure I can speak to specific strategies this evening I'm going to think about that for a minute and also give it to you know I'm going back to the community school council as a really successful way of beginning to address this and so if let's say we come to the council and we say you know
[01:18:00] are kindergarteners are not able to identify their beginning letters then that is an opportunity for us as the Educators to provide our expertise around this is how we can help but then also think about how we develop resources and disseminate those resources throughout our communities so that really does become a community effort I know you have so let me clarify when I say community I'm like extending it to parents okay okay Salazar and the work in his Department's he has outlined school for benchmarks for each grade level similar to what teaching and learning has done with our Ela and her math standards so teachers and principals have access as well as families of benchmarks that are grade level should be hitting an example in kindergarten since around kindergarten with a letter recognition begins to talk about things they're working toward
[01:19:00] does he look for us to be able to strengthen and these are things that absolutely can transfer over to the the homepage to support in that work as well I've just been out in the community in the community and I'm hearing the need to my parents are all that is great in isolation right they're all at home alone but it I think it helps when they can connect somehow some way through the school is what I've heard from him or some parents specifically so just reporting back soon
[01:20:00] okay so when when I look at the data here and I'm particularly looking at next steps and which is on Just for goal one it's on page six one of the next steps under training and monitoring is ensure comprehensive training on interpreting Amira data what I noticed was that in Gold 1.1 with the new American the first data point that came in was below the goal on Google 1.2 the first American data that came in was above the goal so I am not making any sort of commentary on the required software that is needs to be used I'm not commenting on that my question is in regards to comprehensive training on interpreting the data
[01:21:00] do you believe that this tool is potentially better at capturing what students know and are able to do and what in particular what strategies are you going to use to ensure that the training on interpreting that data is sufficient enough to continue to improve the proficiency rates like we have seen recently but I can tell you something that is exciting about this assessment is that we didn't used to receive standard data along with the call the Scarborough Road which I learned really well thanks for my Harley's when we talked about phonological awareness vocabulary background knowledge to Cod
[01:22:00] high frequency words language comprehensive comprehensive Excuse Me overall Mastery structures and everything and we're cognition so why am I blasting all these words at you we didn't used to be able to measure all those things with our assessments that we had iStation didn't measure all those things they measured part of it and while this is a new tool one of the things that were very excited about at least I'm is that it also has standards level data so then when we say these are our priorities we actually can not look so in addition to Let's looking at and we present to you guys beginning middle and end of your data for our line graph but there's also something in between those data points with the progress monitoring that occurs inside that stuff remember their own assessments but there are we have more data that's actually aligning to the structured literacy work that's been going on our district so we were teaching I mean
[01:23:00] because of the collaboration that's going on between all the Departments we actually had we set aside time with the principals and we even had the Merit CEO come out and I'm not saying that as a plug for the company but I'm saying that because we actually like we're getting time to go through the data and we we done our best to do that kind of on a hotel but definitely like baseball offer it but now we're actually having dedicated time to sit down and go through the data so when we say to the principal we need
[01:24:00] give me a strong instructional leader is having that ability to look at the data and have those conversations with your staff they're getting support to do that now and I think that's something that we haven't done in a while I think it's very exciting and along with that one of the things I think about this test on getting a lot of notoriety whether good or bad is that we we've had on the ground teams we've had a lot of resources to go to the schools because the option of this assessment is very critical because it's going to pay off for all the pools ahead people need to have confidence in it but they also need to know how to use it because we can show all these line grass but the question is how do I connect it to my learning and I think that's what I'll say to my colleagues cuz I think that connects to the to the work that don't you Mr West I appreciate that and I I want to acknowledge that we are learning this
[01:25:00] so it's difficult to maybe interpret right now but I am appreciative of all of the guidance we've received and how we might begin to make sense and I would agree just knowing how those standards are being measured and having that metric to really truly understand where our skill gaps are is going to be a game-changer in my opinion the Strategic part of it is really in the data cycle that we're driving using the assessment and so certainly this is to Mr West Point this is one data point in many that we used to look at student performance particularly around early literacy and so getting that regular Cadence of data review not just a district level but in particular in the classroom level and so one of the layers of support in addition to the work of the assessment
[01:26:00] is through the work of our resource teachers and the training of our teaching and learning coaches who are ensuring they know how to access these platforms how to run the reports and how to make sense of the reports so that there is somebody on the campus he's able to work directly with the teachers to see what is the status telling us and then what are the just in time in time interventions that we're going to put in place in order to begin to close that skilled out that I always say is Mr West I just love it when you when you present because I think you always give me some extra information I wasn't aware that it had standards data with it and the first thing that I thought when you said that it's presenting standards I went straight to guard real three and so I'm appreciative that the
[01:27:00] are being interpreted systematically in the classroom so thank you for that I don't have a follow-up question I'm I'm I I hope that that by having this this tool that we will better be able to learn what our students know and are able to do and it sounds like that possibility is there thank you great thank you remember Jackson Remember thank you okay you guys answered everything so I'm trying to Pivot real quick over here because it was specifically you know wanting to know about how teachers are supported and you gave us all that info so when we think about I guess on a deeper level and how teachers are teaching are they teaching based on how trying to figure out a frame it appropriately
[01:28:00] are they teaching based towards with how the students are going to be tested or what is that looking like to ensure that we're actually training them and supporting them properly throughout does that make sense you guys made me pivot real quick board member Romero does make sense and I think that is really the beauty of Standards Base education it's it's really about setting we know what the bar is that students have to reach and it's our job in the classroom to make sure that the student both meets and or go on that bar and so you know when we think about how this assessment may drive the work we do it's a standard space assessment or classrooms are standards as well that is a very complex question and I think
[01:29:00] the way we start is first we create the conditions for teachers to be able to plan and collaborate the availability of data to be able to talk about what students do know and how do we move them from there to the next point and then also taking a look at our student groupings within you as a Martinez to figure out there could be they could be in multiple groupings and are we looking at all of our supports that could be in place for one student so it's it does take a lot of planning time and strategic planning time so that is something that principles are tasked with especially through our leadership tool and coaching with assistance superintendents but also principals and teachers have access to the walk through tool that we are utilizing in those have look for strategies that we can make sure that if they are planning for them are we seeing them and how effective are they so it is an ongoing process that needs to you know that has some checks and balances and it is something that is explicitly being talked about by
[01:30:00] thank you thank you I remember astorga thank you before I asked my question I just wanted to acknowledge the new line graphs on the desegregated data and I love it I love looking at those line graphs and not just the table so thank you for that addition my question is pretty specific so no pressure but the last report in February one of the plant actions was accelerated learning and using the just write Reader books and video lessons so my question is since there is no update on that specific program in this report I'm interested to know if that program has shifted because of a mirror and do you believe that the program may have contributed to the second graders 1% increase on the nearest assessment thank you
[01:31:00] what are the question board member astorga I'm going to I'm going to warn Mr West that maybe you can speak to if we know there was any correlation between just write reader and second grade so it's coming your way so just write reader as an initiative remains in our district last year we were fortunate enough to have some additional resources to begin to Pilot that and invest in it and what we see now is that because we were able to Pilot is that schools are beginning to use some of their own funding to invest in Just Right reader in addition working through our instructional materials Department thinking about now that we have this data where is that investment going to make the most different so you're not necessarily seeing it in the report not because it's gone away but because we haven't necessarily disaggregated where we would get our greatest return on
[01:32:00] so I would assume if that we would see the same effects here but I don't want to go on
[01:33:00] so in addition to the what the teacher sees they can also use the data that does come from the assessment the cater the I don't know they are they are they are appropriate to where the student is by that I mean it's not just appropriate as in this is where they are but it's there so they can grow so that they're being challenged and inappropriate way and I think that's something that we hadn't had before so we had we've been using this this tool which we purchased because it has evidence behind it but now we're actually able to again make sure that when we do take time away from instruction for assessment that we're doing something with it
[01:34:00] I was excited because I think that again to go to some of the earlier questions about at home these are books I can go home so then if the student is getting materials that are being kind of personalized or crafted to where they are in terms of their they were there on the road towards their journey to reading there again is another tool that's aligned so you think what I'm excited about is that all the things that we're talking about are all lining now so what the teacher evaluation with the construction that we should point out yes thank you I think that's kind of where my mind was going to is the alignment and I'm not sure how many students were using the video Lesson on the just right reader that is provided but I just thought it was a good kind of Segway into a mirror being online and just kind of
[01:35:00] a little bit but thank you thank you so my question is essentially About Time and Time use within the classroom so what strategies or systemic shifts are you employing from the district level regarding how time is spent or how you're directing how time is spent or how you're monitoring how time is spent indirect literacy instruction versus assessment and I'll say assessment inclusively formative interim and the summative assessments as well as reading instruction that's integrated across the curriculum and other activities so to simplify what is the district doing at the system level to make sure that we are that you all are monitoring to monitoring and providing guidance around time for literacy instruction
[01:36:00] the the answer really lies in the use of our high-quality instructional materials particularly around Sabbath and we're fortunate we have many layers of instructional materials to support our students but this is our Core Curriculum and so how we actually train our teachers to use a five-day reading routines through the service curriculum is a is a critical component of that time usage and that being said we know we have to set aside time for the assessments both in Mira and formative assessment and I believe Mr West can speak more specifically to the time use and like I mean they're not they're not assessing on the computer all day long we know that these are relatively quick assessments when they sit down for it and so really we're looking to the teacher to make those instructional decisions about how and when students are doing what so
[01:37:00] I don't think it's necessarily in a lesson plan like they all do this and they all do that and then we count up the minutes to see what they all did but we certainly work within a framework of we expect a certain number of minutes of ela and working with the principles to incorporate that time for Intervention which I think is 30 minutes for Amira a lot of this is really based in the teachers expertise of how they want to manage their classroom and in terms of how we monitor that think the structure literacy walk through tool that really impressed with I really got a good look at it today I was like this is really good how were beginning to break apart the expectations and really also help with the critical feedback that goes to the teacher about how they might make some of those instructional decisions that would be to a better benefit of the student
[01:38:00] Gonzalez that we do have guidelines within required amount of instructional minutes but what we do realize in our systems is that you know block scheduling creates some limits and we want to make sure that things are inclusive and integrated within our content areas and we know reading happens in every content area so how are we really pulling some of those strategies into outside of the 90 minute of ela required time also looking at our learning Labs as one of our strategies that we have outlined here and it's suggests or a pointed out that we have training around what a full week looks like within one of those content areas but you would also specifically asked systems we have our student information systems that helps build some of our Master scheduling and we're taking a look at those guidance pieces as well as assistant superintendent
[01:39:00] cancel them figuring out how to offer that information to principles to make sure that that gets out into their operations piece of their responsibilities great thank you for that we will go back around see if there's any additional questions just starting with member of story again online did you have any more questions related to interims 1.1 and 1.2 I do not thank you thank you and then any other follow-up questions or additional questions how do students get an opportunity to or teachers have to Educators provide an opportunity for serendipitous learning the joy of discovering right
[01:40:00] I mean and I'm thinking about Inez Elementary School in that I would hate to structure them so much that they're not doing the wonderful things they do there with good results so just curious about how that's built in to the structure and we know and encourage our teachers to incorporate their passions now that serendipitous type of learning also is a teacher expertise move they know in the moment oh there's a lesson here and being able to do that and I feel really confident in the teacher's expertise to recognize those moments
[01:41:00] take advantage of them in addition I miss Travis mentioned the learning Labs professional development and what that essentially does is it it's professional development on our Core Curriculum and it helps the teacher go through and identify exactly what you're talking about so rather than it being you know kind of turned to page whatever and do these things the teacher is taking the time to really think through oh this is the point where I would make a connection to what we talked about last week or what came up just sort of out of the blue but the kids were really interested in and to really make those thoughtful Connections in the lesson plan also and we've talked about this a little bit board members is our initiative of Genius hour within extending that
[01:42:00] out to our emerging schools as well within our performance framework really building on project-based learning integrating all of our content areas finding out student choice and passions as well and figuring out how to align it with our standards so that is something that we are actively working towards with principles with teachers and then also our teaching and learning Department with the resource teachers are really helping us outline some of that work so there are a lot of opportunities for that to extend and I think we will we will definitely keep an eye on genius hour and how that continues to evolve thank you great thank you any additional questions I have a comment if I may yes thank you remember this because of this question so thank you bye I just wanted to give a Kudos and shout out to whoever thought of bringing the character to life for the students
[01:43:00] that is an amazing replica of what it means to literally bring learning to life and have students be in that kind of energetic and and fun way of learning so round of applause for you all for that that was great thank you and thank you to the administration for that and for your presentation tonight and thank you board members for the questions and the productive conversation so now we will vote on whether or not we'll accept this monitoring report and again we are voting to accept the report is a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the administration and that we have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lines up with our vision for them so in order to accept the report we must answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal is their growth toward the vision in is there a strategy and plan to cause growth towards the vision
[01:44:00] yes yes yes yes yes all right then the board can accept the progress monitoring report confident that the data is accurate and that the superintendent is performing at this point we're ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report I moved to accept this monitoring report this is board member Dominguez thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes so that motion carries thank you again for the report and more importantly for all of the work you're doing to improve literacy in our district so we will move on to our next agenda item which is agenda item 5.3 a discussion on the timeline for the student outcomes
[01:45:00] Locust governance request for proposal process for this agenda item are presenters are Chief Financial Officer in Adrian Sanchez the executive director of procurement so just provide some background but you also have in the discussion memo for this agenda item so we began a process to see an external coach to support the board on coaching and professional development for student outcomes focused governance we ran through steps of that initial procurement process and have not completed the process and so APS Administration will share through some potential next steps for that process and then we're going to weigh in on what we think might be the next bus stop I just want to remind everyone that this is not a conversation about the contract about the proposal about the terms or any of that it is merely about the process and how
[01:46:00] can we move forward on next steps so anything related to anything that's not processed or that is related specifically to any of the proposals we will cut off that conversation so I will go ahead and turn it over to our presenters thank you president Gonzalez board members and Deputy superintendent Dr Gonzalez there are three options that were identified as next steps the first is to continue as planned and pick up basically where we left off with the RFP evaluation and review conduct interviews and score and then vote at an upcoming board meeting the second would be to pause the current RFP process and allow the new board members to
[01:47:00] can you and pick up the evaluations of the RFP score and vote on the current proposals with the existing RFP and the third option would be to start the entire process over which would include reissuing a new RFP and eliminating one that is in process great thank you and so just as additional contacts we've started the process and we got to the point of conducting interviews and then we got stuck with scheduling challenges so given those scheduling challenges which have not gone away just to keep that in mind as we wait for this one I will go ahead and just go through the line to get a quick perspective from each member on sort of option 123 so according to the bullets in the discussion memo memo so they're bulleted but we'll just call them one two and three and then we'll go ahead and open up the
[01:48:00] floor to discussion if there's significant Divergence in our opinions if there is significant conversions or consensus in our opinions will go ahead and accept that as a consensus and move forward all right so with that member historic are you able in a position to kick us off or do you just looks like you are so for the three options presented what is what's your preference would be three just as a new board member coming into something that was decided for me before I got on the board I think it would be a great opportunity for a new board members to have that opportunity to be in that process but I'm also torn because I know that it's difficult to be a new board member and jump into a new process so two and three I'm kind of like in the middle so I'm happy to discuss thank you remember
[01:49:00] thank you my recommendation would be number two just to pause the current process and let the new board thank you remember Jackson mine is also number two I have a question about any cost associated with number three and but so I think leaning towards to would go with three why don't we go ahead and answer that question if you could weigh in as to whether there would be any additional cost from the district associated with choosing option three right to the district attorney of putting something together and then we would have to
[01:50:00] advertise it again so the advertisement costs and then stop time okay so sorry so the additional in sorry sustained in a paused position does it just keeps it pause there's no additional cost with that thank you thank you I would say I strongly recommend that we go with option three start the whole process over which will include reissuing a new RFP I think a new board deserves the opportunity to take stock of their needs and light of our goals and guardrails and to decide what they need help with thank you
[01:51:00] I agree with number three being the best option because I think the new board makeup whatever that happens to be they deserve the chance to decide if this is necessary and if so how they're going to score the potential bidders in this process however I'm curious if we are if we were to decide to stop the progress we've already made what does that look like for the district for the ramifications it feels very odds actually so an example I have is July 1st 2023 there was a new agency the healthcare Authority
[01:52:00] put together at the state and there was some contracts that the Human Services have put an RFP well when they got the healthcare Authority they decided to cancel the RFP and start over so it is common thank you great thank you and I would prefer option to which makes us kind of preference for option three three preference for option two but sort of a halfway vote for option to so we'll eliminate option one as a plan and then just talk through so for the so I guess I'll remember who had kind of the hospital or option to and then just sort of open up more broadly to see how folks feel but just based on where we've landed on the additional information on potential costs and
[01:53:00] implications for the district based on this number so that has how are you feeling I think I'm leaning towards a number three just because I feel like similar to what has been said it's good for a new board to be able to choose the process that they're going to be discussing and being in that process so I think I'm leaning towards 3 thank you and so we do have a consensus for option three and so for those of us who are option two are you okay with you I'm okay with option to if that's where the majority of the board and thank you sorry I will go with the consensus all right so we have a consensus for options three sorry I was looking at my paper that had three hash browns next to number two so we will move ahead with starting the whole process over which will include
[01:54:00] and so is this is an administrative process we will defer all of that work to the administration and then we'll just provide updates to the new board on the timing and process all right thank you we will move on now to the next agenda item which is agenda item 5.4 board guardrail evaluation recommendations so this is in a sort of similar situation if you look at our discussion memo so just as a refresher we did establish a board guard rails evaluation ad hoc committee those members were member benavidez and they were charged with designing a board guard rails and interim card rails evaluation process and they also created a scoring tool to accompany the evaluation so they have completed their work on schedule and it was shared in the board material
[01:55:00] who is Jared in advance and so we basically have three options similarly for this again they're bulletin but we'll go ahead and do one two and three so I love again to hear from the board will go in reverse order this time starting at my life so we can start with member benavidez and end with member astorga so option one discuss whether to submit edits and move the item to a board vote and so if we do that we would be discussing the edits tonight option to discuss whether to submit it and then table it until the new board is sworn in and then we would give them an opportunity and we'd all to do further edits and we would vote or we can table the process until the new board is sworn in and then they would have the opportunity to weigh in collectively with the current board members who are the continuing board members rather on the board guard real evaluation process so one discuss that we submitted and we sort of continue with the process we go
[01:56:00] go forward with a vote on a subsequent board meeting we submit our edits but we table the vote until after January or we table the process and started over again after January so remember Benavides can you pick us up or thank you president Gonzalez and I want to acknowledge the work that went into this with my fellow board member to Mingus we worked very hard and we're very proud of the work however in the spirit of giving the new board whatever the makeup is the autonomy to make these decisions I think that it's only fair based on our last decision to go with auction 3 discussion and that's table the process until the new board is sworn in because I don't think that it makes sense to even discuss the work that's been done if we're not going to vote on it and accept it so options for me please thank you remember tomorrow
[01:57:00] comments that there was a lot of work that went into it I appreciate the work I appreciate the tool that was put together the evaluation and all of that I can tell that there was effort put into this so I appreciate that but I do agree that it should go to the new board green and I would add we don't have to completely throw away all of the work right so just I don't want to just wanted to clarify that point number three is fine with me right and so three with me as well and so for this one we will also table the process for now until a new board is sworn in but again appreciation to the members of that hot committee for that work and getting us started and a very productive conversation and how we evaluate our own board guard rails all right next to agenda items 6 which is to
[01:58:00] which is 6.1 - 6.16 so can I have a motion and a second for approval of the consent agenda this is member toppy Romero and I move for approval to accept the consent agenda from item 6.1 * 6.16 this is bored you remember where do you get 1 6
