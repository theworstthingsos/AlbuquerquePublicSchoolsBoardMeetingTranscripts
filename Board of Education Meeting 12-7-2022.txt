[00:11:00]
and I can tell you that in a meeting for the representative for district 7 Mr Scott Darnell actually admitted as much as that at 120 Minutes time he he said that there are four districts that have Hispanics populations of 40%

[00:12:00]
chairman of the of the company the representatives of district 7 particularly the the chairs they are delayed getting data that they did not accommodate people when they ask for more time more meetings or more data or that or whether or not the the they could be have more access to reading the data on the maps the population tables were totally ignored that's 331 300 111.006 with 50% Thank you sir thank you sir

[00:13:00]
appreciate it our next speaker is suha a mayor give me if I said that wrong you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking that works in 2008 when I found out how important to us to be counted that made me feel invisible and very sad I do not support the proposed registration we need that presentation of minority groups and our city and particular the Hispanic African and Middle East

[00:14:00]
play center in the International District and we must protect their presentation of this area and the redistricting process thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom it's Mr Joe Gallant Mr Galant are you there hello hello

[00:15:00]
somehow despite making up 45% of the population of the maps considered even have three out of the seven districts that a majority Hispanic in this process member is solely selected by the board influence maps and a separate Committee in which none of the members were answering to a third party furthermore this process did not allow for any member of the public to submit a map and despite ask for maps is ridiculous majority Hispanic population

[00:16:00]
Expedia you'll have 2 minutes once you begin speaking my name is Lisa and I am the President of the Bareilles neighborhood association of mother of three students and APS to have graduated as well as the aunt and cousin and friend of many teachers in marginalized communities I came to talk to you and ask you to treat the redistricting process with more equity and fairness as well as transparency I think that people who are represented in these districts deserve a chance to have more input

[00:17:00]
and I think that an independent commission is something that that should be prioritized I think that issues of equity that have long been neglected need to be treated in a very important and Central manner the Voting Rights Act and civil rights are you know egregiously mistreated and when we don't send her those voices that have the most needs clearly we have an account in ours and so those voices that we really should be prioritizing are ignored and neglected please Empower and lift up these families the students and teachers and administrators who do such good service in our schools

[00:18:00]
and please vote for map G I think that's the only one that treats this issue with the fairness that it deserves thank you ma'am Miss Tillman okay we'll go on our next speaker is on Zoom Rosalinda Dorado should be coming in the room now hello

[00:19:00]
so it's really sad when I'm seeing the results of the redistricting so I want to acknowledge first the maps today are results of months of work from the board but the maps that are being presented today do not reflect represent or much less include the current divisions of districts of our state based on the polling data much work conducted by the census by these communities are very much being left out if the federal state and the local level communities were working together to ensure that these Hispanic communities were not left out a better why can't our APS process also do the same we must make sure that our community are Hispanic communities who make up the 45% of the voting age population with APS be representative of these Maps

[00:20:00]
we want to make sure that 3 of The Districts that are being presented in these maps are majority Hispanic so this means that we need to make sure that the two maps the map is being considered with only two majority Hispanic is not the map because it does not represent all the work that are Hispanic communities doing the census also I want to ask do not delete the voting strength of these ethnic language or majority groups it is against our Voting Rights Act thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Diana Lucille's

[00:21:00]
Dana you there yes you have two minutes once you begin speaking Hombres Diana El Centro De directions 30345

[00:22:00]
hispanos gracias thank you our next speaker is Gail Stewart and I'm here to provide public comment to let the board know about Albuquerque Public Schools apparent failure to comply with State education regulation requiring the collection and Analysis of data on the use of physical restraint and seclusion against our students state regulations 6.11 Point 2.10 e 5 D of the New Mexico regulations required that during the

[00:23:00]
122 school year of the year just passed all schools in New Mexico conduct an annual review of that schools use of restraint and seclusion the specific language of the regulation says School shall conduct an annual review and Analysis of all incidents in which restraint or seclusion techniques were used including the number of incidents the type of incident Personnel involved the need for additional training and student demographics it does not appear that APS complied I have asked for public records from APS since August indicating that schools did this annual review what I was told is I'm quoting there are approximately 3,194 records that could be responsive to your request so what does tell me is there was never in analysis what the district has been sending me is individual records about

[00:24:00]
four pages at a time I think I've received 12 Pages since August with the district saying it's very hard to send me $3,000 pages but that is not what it was being asked for the district was asked for it's proof that schools did the analysis and so what I've learned is they didn't do the analysis and the district needs to understand that it's apparent that there were over $3,000 cases or incidents of restraint and seclusion last year of our students thank you very much for allowing me public comment thank you man next speaker is Patricia Wilson Patricia you have two minutes thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is Patricia Wilson

[00:25:00]
business owner landlord and neighborhood volunteers I have not been able to do a deep dive into the aps redistricting Maps as I've been immersed in the zoning code update process because I have not had sufficient time to review all the maps myself I am relying on the advice of my APS district for board member Barbara Peterson board member Peterson attends nearly every meeting of both the Victory Hills neighborhood association and the district 6 coal we trust her judgment and share her concerns about which appear to favor more affluent areas and areas where developers are looking to expand older less affluent parts of town are already overburdened with problems and according to miss Peterson of existing districts and provide better representation

[00:26:00]
I respectfully request you consider Maps g&h thank you very much for the opportunity to speak thank you ma'am our next speaker is Angela vigilator and has suggested that this seems to be the most people like me

[00:27:00]
and I want to make sure that my kids kids of color African-American black Native American etcetera Mexicanos tambien they get their did they get fair and equal opportunity and I believe that Barbara Peterson has selected what is the best for our students are kids of color will have the best chance at making it in school in APS thank you thank you ma'am or next speaker is in person Mr Franklin

[00:28:00]
Mr Elder for his visit to Montezuma Elementary School this afternoon I've been there for 13 years as an employee and it was a it was a great visit we have a very unique staff and population of students and I'm very proud to be a part of that Community what I've noticed about that Community however is that we don't only have a specific special education department that go beyond everyday educational assistance Administration and so forth to make sure that your students are safe at all times and I'm very proud of that I also recognize however that the behaviors within the regular red

[00:29:00]
of that school has gotten more and more difficult to manage and this is nobody's fault but however the administration portion of the school is the ones who are getting most of the of the the back of breaking work this could be solved however if you were to follow your policies and procedures when it comes to discipline and that doesn't only go for location number 315 but it goes for everybody and also I would like to shout out board member Peterson for her amazing work as she is the representative of that particular location for people of color specifically students of color is not always easy so I appreciate your work and your dedication to the Board of Education

[00:30:00]
thank you very much thank you sir our next speaker is on Zoom Mr Ian Johnson good evening APS board members thank you for your time and consideration tonight my name is Ian Johnson escudero and I'm the dean of students for grades K through 8 at El Camino Real Academy I'm here to speak on the behalf of renewing our Charter for the next 5 years I want you to speak briefly to you tonight about my unique perspective working with El Camino I began working there as a 5th grade general education instructor and then transitioned to become the dean of students for grades k through eight and then at the beginning of this past school year 2223 and rolled my 5 year old son as a student so I speak to you with the perspective of not only a teacher and not only of an administrator but that also of a parent and I wanted to speak to one of the strongest and most incredible qualities that El Camino has and it's the dedication to

[00:31:00]
community in a lot of ways it is like a large family like an extended family and you see the dedication and the care that the teachers have for the students and you see it daily not only in the instruction in the classrooms in the interactions between them but in the students themselves in their growth and their character and in the resilience particularly as we're going through the past few years with covid and coming out of it and the transitions that they have had to face and from out so again just with a perspective a unique perspective here because I have both been an employee as well as a parent I just wanted to let you know that I'll Camino Real is a very special place thank you again thank you sir our next speaker is Maureen Scotland

[00:36:00]
including cost drivers in education analyzing how policy affects resources strategically allocating resources to reach desired outcomes and communicating Finance strategies and decisions to audiences these skills will be valuable as the board moves forward to student outcomes governance and there has been great progress made these past few months on the boards work to build its goals and guard rails for the school system but I wanted to take a few moments tonight to share an update on our work with the tuned education Partners who we have partnered with support the development of the district strategic plan period

[00:45:00]
consideration for approval of the aps redistricting plan and this will be a discussion action wow this one just has me listed here has the has the piece to do this and so I know I mean I guess it's just let me hang on a second let me go to my bear with me cuz I'm using a new process I'm going through using a computer which is not the easiest thing I find to you I know it's not so I think where we are on this is that we have I know we've had some discussion on this and there was you know some other additional information that was given to us tonight through you know through public comments and where we are and what the what we have to do now is just have to review all of the details that we've had before us and what we don't have is what the decision is going to be I mean I think we've got the maps we've got discussion we've had lots of

[00:46:00]
items before us and I know that there's still some discussion from the team that and I'm just going to open it up for that so that we can just kind of go through the four Concepts and any comments that the members have and things that we ought to consider together as a group you know and I just want to say that all though we had an independent group work with us because it was an independent group that was representative of each of the districts ultimately that decision still comes back to us as a board we're responsible for the decision around how we redistrict our maps and so I really appreciate the the folks that worked on that and the recommendations that they gave to us but now it's time for us to to really just sort of take a look at that figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to move forward so I'm just going to open it up for discussion and is anyone have any who wants to start in terms of how we want to go with this we've got form

[00:47:00]
and we ultimately have to figure out how we're going to get through for maps because we have to make a decision on what it is that we're actually going to propose and what we're going to go forward with so I'll board member Gonzalez I have a question is the team from researching here as well to respond to questions yes Michael Sharp is here with us wonderful there were some contentions during the public comment as well as in a blast sent out by the ETF this afternoon claiming that the proposed Maps a few of the proposed Maps family the emails violate the Voting Rights Act wondering if you could respond to that whether there's any truth to that statement for president of the audience and those attending and so I think we did discuss this a little bit the last meeting with respect to the Voting Rights Act and the comments that we have heard are that due to the

[00:48:00]
Hispanic of the district as a whole that there should be three majority adult Hispanic districts and the plans that under consideration now that we've had two adult Hispanic majority districts and what was discussed last time is that when looking at the Voting Rights issues we can't just look at the Hispanic population and go by what we might consider is proportionality so you know if you have 45% then theoretically you might be able to have say three in Spanish districts on the proportionality issue that's not necessarily always the case that you can rearrange a public schools has actually almost 40% Hispanic population adult but there's no way to create even one adult Hispanic District just an interesting fact about the demographic distribution City of Albuquerque APS is little bit different and but

[00:49:00]
is it possible to create three but the question then becomes do you have to and that comes down to three basic factors and they're the jingles Factor so they basically say is the population Hispanic population large enough and compact enough such that you can create three adult Hispanic districts answers to that question is yes you can we shall not in the number of Concepts that have been presented the other one is they kind of go hand-in-hand but does the Hispanic population 10 is a block as a group does it for the Spanish candidates and and the other is is white called white black voting so does the the white population of vote for the white candidates and and does the really those two factors are it's almost like a crossover road to the Spanish population today

[00:50:00]
vote for Hispanic candidates or white candidates and crossover so we found in Albuquerque in general is that those last two prongs aren't necessarily meant there that has Albuquerque area has a history of voting in Hispanic Representatives all levels of government regardless of whether or not that district is expanding or not Hispanic and so do to that I think that the way that districts are drawn it's still I guess you're still not not splitting up the Hispanic areas to crack them so that so that you can only Alexa Hispanic districts and so I think given the factors of the history within the Albuquerque area and

[00:51:00]
the the population patterns in the voting patterns that that the four planes are Concepts you have you to GNH are are all sufficient with respect to the building Rights Act great thank you for that I don't have any other questions any other questions from some of the legal perspective that I've gotten a couple of points are that who is currently serving in representing the district does not necessarily

[00:52:00]
impact or mean that there should still not be majority districts and as I look I mean my first inclination is that none of the maps really serve that point the only one that did in the initial group of maps was map C and because it was so disruptive because it caused such a major upheaval of existing districts that I think the entire committee turned it down but we still haven't seen a map that actually in fact represents the community the way it should the three the emails

[00:53:00]
minority and low income voters into three districts it packs them into District 4 District 1 in District 5 in a way that is overwhelmingly different than the other Maps the other things that that map does and although I mean I think one of the things that I've been proud of for the aps board over all of these years is that we really have tried to be on partisan we are supposed to be non-partisan we are by Statute non-partisan and it's clear that the committee was part of that certain members of the committee who took over dominant voice on that committee had worked in the Martinez Administration have very political backgrounds and worked very hard to craft these Maps

[00:54:00]
you know the existing makeup of this board is that two of our members were elected with less than a minor then less than a majority district 7 and District 372 on the sport were elected with less than a majority and when you look at the makeup of the new maps it's clear that it's solidifies the that representation whether it's set individual or new individuals but still a community that's going to be reflective of certainty points the thing that most concerns me and has not been adequately addressed is the deviation of population it is solely to have the extremes that were in the emails

[00:55:00]
can only be explained by very intentional manipulation of population sizes based on speculation one speculation of growth that's going to that may or may not exist in the Northwest and possibly in the Northeast and total disregard of what we know is an underground in certain other neighborhoods especially the International District in the southwest Valley any District that has a high immigrant communities a large homeless Community there is going to be an underground in the email for the population deviation

[00:56:00]
on imaginary numbers the numbers that are on paper would cause less of a population deviation sorry I have serious concerns I think of all the maps that are on the table H is the most Fair the most just the most the map that most closely represents where we are is the community I'm not sure that any of them and I think one of the things that we've all learned through this process is there is no such thing as perfect as soon as you want and so I mean I'm not saying this to disregard the work that was done because I think it's really clear that as soon as you address one problem you create something else either in terms of minority representation

[00:57:00]
galatian deviation or respect for existing districts there is virtually no way to satisfy all three of those things at the same time and I think we've all recognized that but I do think that there's no way to look at the emails and not say that there is deliberate and intentional desire to over-represented districts in neighborhoods in the community into disregard and undervalue in deprived of adequate voice the people who are most marginalized with the most struggles in their communities

[00:58:00]
so just to just to confirm with research and pulling we are only allowed to use since this data when creating redistricting Maps is that correct that's correct okay and all of the other entities within the state of New Mexico starting with the state going to the city councilors going to Rio Rancho all of the other entities within the state that had to go through this red District 13 process they also were only allowed to use since the state is that correct that is correct okay so we can just pull numbers on on on on on on on that we think might be a possibility when creating a redistricting map is that correct I think that's correct and and just in terms of what's been mentioned before growth and Arizona growth but the numbers

[00:59:00]
I want to kind of go back and highlight one thing that you mentioned you said it is it is and if I'm putting words in your mouth please correct me but there is no way to create majority districts throughout the entire city base simply or within this District map they simply on the demographics of the city I'm not quite sure could you rephrase the question just want to make sure you know with the with the comments that have been brought up that there should be at least three there should potentially be seven that are all majority majority minority districts based on the population of the city is that possible to do you mentioned something about Rio Rancho doesn't even have that we're

[01:00:00]
it is possible to create three adult majority Hispanic districts and Rio Rancho it is not even possible to create one but not 7:00 that's correct OK Google so one other thing I want to point out are the numbers that we got were that the Hispanic population was around 47 percent is that correct right so that's the total population amongst the adult population it's closer to 45% I'm trying to get so if I look at each two so around 45% if I look at you too what I see is that we have a district one is 72% Hispanic

[01:01:00]
2 is 46.7% Hispanic District 3 is 47.2% Hispanic District 4 is getting close at 43.5% Hispanic District 5 has 71.2% Hispanic and then we have district 6 in district 7 with 33.2 and 26 percent Hispanic so it seems to me that we have four one two three we have two supermajorities and then we have three near me in those other three I think it's District 2 3 and 4 okay so five of

[01:02:00]
seven in the emails we have majority minority and four of the seven in the emaps we have a near majority and two of the seven of the emaps we have a supermajority correct okay and just to State one more time and I'm sorry if this is redundant but I feel it's so it's very important you do not believe that the emails violate the Voting Rights Act correct okay so I would like to move for approval of

[01:03:00]
might have had access to other political information and used it was there any way to discern that I have no idea I had no way to discern that right okay and then what constitutes a majority versus like what number constitutes a majority versus a plurality we have to look at 50% so anything under 50 is really I mean I guess we look at 50%

[01:04:00]
ethnic groups are are also being taken into account or examined and so I mean that's that's that's basically it above 50 below 50 is not and then you have to look at the other racial numbers to figure out what sort of plurality exists okay so if we follow that explanation just gave and be more accurate about the language there so we have board member are you looking at the Post Office Depot on

[01:05:00]
193 of our packet right so I see two supermajorities in District 1 and 5 and then is there another majority that I'm missing I believe that the only majority of the other two majority districts in terms of ethnicity and race would be District 67734 235

[01:06:00]
but we can't say that there are five Hispanic majority I mean if we follow your Immortal clarified definition of majority that's correct I want to reiterate and yet a former Chief of Staff of the Susana Martinez Administration and his Deputy Chief of Staff not only particip

[01:07:00]
when I elected or when I appointed my Community member had I known that we were going to bring in Heavy Hitters it was just an unfair an unfair process to put at least three appointed committee members on the committee on the process I guess I would ask that the district revisit standard operating procedures for for this process I had it in my head a process that was going to be that

[01:08:00]
put play out naively so that would play out something along the lines of having a public involvement that mirrored or Congressional and I believe it was a city council effort and and that's in retrospect I realize that there's no way that was going to happen with an October convening of the committee other districts and I think that is more appropriate and they didn't vote until June or July and that gave time for this incredible learning curve because there are there are questions of questions and you start manipulating

[01:09:00]
precincts and boundaries you start to realize how easy it is to influence and bring to bear a political point of view which is inevitable but I think our process could have or process suffered from a lack of nuanced conversation and challenging one another and what we end up with is a very deliberate agenda that it will my fear is that it will end up disadvantages are most vulnerable kids so

[01:10:00]
that is again I find it disingenuous to say that this process was independent and transparent that committee was a shadow Committee of who we are it's a were divided board they were divided committee and we should have mitigated that and that's all I'm going to say any other comments were all redistricting principles met in creating these maps maps E2 E3 all of them okay the other question is when you are you know looking at I know my district and I think you're Romero's is is a growing they're growing districts just based on building permits so we know that so when

[01:11:00]
aren't you trying to when you're looking at communities that are growing that you're trying to undershoot if you're growing so in time everything is equalized it's not something that we're trying to do that's not necessarily a goal that has to be taken to account in our opinion it follows under that broadcast of communities of interest it's not necessarily required by those four people population voting rights compact is contributing it's just another factor that you could take into account if you so choose okay and so when you're talking about the basically the whole point of redistricting is just trying to adjust districts to the population that's what you're trying to accomplish using all the principles of redistricting right okay and then just a question I don't and I could maybe

[01:12:00]
legal challenges at the you know Congressional level state level County City School Board challenging anything as it concerns and undercount were there any legal challenges to my knowledge none have been brought concerning the 2020 census and the results that were reported okay and then this probably would go to superintendent Elder APS could have mounted a legal challenge if we thought there was an undercount which we always know New Mexico always under counts did APS Mount any kind of illegal challenge as it concerns underground okay I think that's I mean I think that's I think that's it but when we're looking at the districts and I I'm obviously

[01:13:00]
a woman of color when we're looking at it and we're talking about a majority and minority when we are looking at five of those seven districts they truly are when you are not just taking into consideration we can't just think about one population we have to think about our black population are Asian population are native population five of the seven are minority majority thank you Mr Sharp thank you because yes if we are going to use the 2020 census numbers as they stand then it is a conscious Choice it is not a requirement to the Voting Rights Act of any other process for redistricting it is a clear and conscious choice on the part of this board to put the majority of influence into

[01:14:00]
neighborhoods at the expense of other neighborhoods if we use population as counted solely by the census then there is absolutely no reason and some of the projections from the city are saying you know some of our growth projections may not fight match out what some people are speculating it is based on speculation that there will be the degree of growth on the west side and it is a conscious decision by this board to accept these numbers and again by the count of what is spelled out in the Voting Rights Act looking at the population total population of Albuquerque there should be three majority Hispanic districts there should be at least one

[01:15:00]
more additional majority minority District in the way it is configured and it's not just a matter of ethnicity and race it is also a matter of income when you put the income maps on top of those there's no question but what districts 41 and 5 are packed with certain parts of our community and the result of that is the districts to 776 in particular become weighted much more white much more fluent and so we move forward and start talking about where are we going to build schools where are we going to

[01:16:00]
model schools what schools are going to get closed what schools are we going to say oh they're not up to standard what schools are we going to close what neighborhoods and communities are going to be impacted by that and believe me I'm not the only Soul person who will be watching that carefully as we move forward as a board there is no question but what we need to build additional schools on the West Side period any particular district and I think we can prove that as we as we look at work has been

[01:17:00]
as we look at what kinds of investment but believe me based on this redistricting I am really uncomfortable that I can say with the same fervor that that will be the case and I'm not the only person in the community who will be watching that board member tell you I think I want to add some clarity to some of the numbers that were thrown out there because I believe there's a lot of assumptions and speculation as to the way the process took place and to reiterate when we chose our committee members all of us chose people that we thought would be able to represent our District's appropriately and who had the knowledge and no way in my opinion was this ever partisan and to for that to be assumed and spoken as if we're doing something unethical I am I'm flabbergasted by it

[01:18:00]
it was intended to do to now make it for our own personal gain an interest and I will do everything in my power to speak up against that this committee voted on a 6 to 1 for the emaps there wasn't wasn't solid division down down the line it was a 6 to 1 Vogt when I look at our populations we look across this board and sing that there's five out of seven of us that are represent the minority vote we will continue to do so I will not just sit here quietly and say now we turned this into Susana Martinez and people who is going to vote for her I'm sorry it's a bunch of BS and maybe I don't have a lot of the the verbiage that we speak at so eloquently I will just speak to you off the cuff and tell you I am not here to represent a board or represent committees that are going to be unethical or that are not going to follow the standards of the lot and actually depend on our our resources

[01:19:00]
the professionals the people who have experienced in these to guide us the way we need to we actually vetted this process the way we needed to we provided several opportunity to have Community input and have everybody come to the table and now to have the opposite assumed I feel like it's I have the right to be able to say for me and my district and my representative that was not the case and I know several other people who represented those committees and I could speak for them as well and they do their due diligence they did their homework they vetted these communities the best that they can and to do it legally to do it ethically and I will stand by these these Maps when you when you compare Maps H and E the minority vote is not that different when we're comparing each district you know and overall I look forward to make sure that all of our voices are heard but we will not I will not stand by and make this a partisan issue when it was never a partisan issue to begin with

[01:20:00]
when I'm seeing text messages going out from other partisan groups trying to Rally everybody that I'm like heck it did become partisan and that's not right you know I am I'm confident I could represent my district the way I need to the way I can have my community voice be heard and I believe all seven of us feel the same and we will continue to do so with the new maps but I won't let this turn into a skeptical of what it should be and we will focus on student outcomes we will focus on what our goals need to be going forward and I won't let other people assume otherwise are be able to speak on our behalf that we did something in any sort that did represent an ethical methods in the way these Maps were developed so I'm happy to hear that there was a motion and there was a second and I look forward to voting thank you I'll just close by saying that this was a very complicated process and as what I understand

[01:21:00]
and I've looked at had a chance to talk with other school districts that are going through this and other community members it's very complex and it's really hard this is probably one of the hardest things that elected bodies have to do so and and I don't want it to divide us because I I pretty much did the same thing that board member Jackson did I looked through the through the numbers and saying like where do we have like some majority where do we have majority near majority supermajority and looked at that and I know that from our old Maps it pretty much it pretty much made what we had previously in my correct Mr Sharp yes that's correct yeah so in in previously we always had two supermajorities and then we had the others that were just nearing majority the other thing that I just want to say to is running for school board

[01:22:00]
and anybody out there who's listening when you run for a school board you do not run as an rrd you cannot and it's unfortunate because yes I mean am I still a political person absolutely is Peggy still political is everybody political we are we we we we can't not separate ourselves from that but the thing is is that when you run for school board you run as a non-partisan member and you have to be committed to that because we represent all of the students in our district and we have to we have to figure out how we do that we have to do it well and it's the hardest thing that we have to do and I just want to respectfully disagree to that on the split votes in the districts that we last had where it was very split in the districts we also had too many candidates running when you have a lot of candidates running you're not going to have a supermajority for one person over the other I love it that we can run as many Canada's as we want to have because the best

[01:23:00]
it's it's tough to get your name out there it's tough to to campaign because your campaigning on the issues that you believe in around education and so if you're running against three or four other people in that you're not going to have a supermajority who's going to vote for you you're going to get the people that are going to vote for you because you've done either really solid job of going out there and campaigning around the issues that are important to getting people to to support you so so I just I just want to state that as well so I know we've had in some cases across the state board members in in a lot of places in our state go on a post because there isn't anybody else that wants to run against that they believe is a good candidate is representing the District 12 we have had that happen in New Mexico here in Albuquerque in a while but we could and that's one of the issues that could also happen and that happens when a candidate has done a really good job of really presenting them

[01:24:00]
miles from that nonpartisan perspective of all the issues that we're trying to do there is a motion on the table and I know that I agree with board member top your Romero that all the maps that were voted that were put forward E2 and E3 were voted on a 61 there were several people that were in there they had an opportunity to to express their concerns absolutely a learning opportunity for all of us on this board because the complexity of who to select to be on the committee is something that I think will is a good lesson learned as we move forward because I think it was a lot to ask from the individuals that were part of that maybe didn't feel as comfortable asking questions or or or or doing the homework because it was hard but I will say that every person on that committee did their absolute best I believe every person on that committee gave their heart their soul they were committed

[01:25:00]
to looking at the maps I saw them rolling up the shirt sleeves having good conversations I also agree with board member Dominguez APS needs to have an sop on this so that we have an earlier start to the process and we're not just kind of doing it at the at the end of the process or at the end of the year but I do want to thank the committee for their effort and their work on this I also want to thank all of the board members who I know have done and have dug in I I appreciate board member Peterson for bringing up all the concerns I did look at all of her concerns I studied some additional Maps studied some additional things I've asked more questions I've had to learn a whole lot more through the process and doing this so so I also know that everybody on this committee are on this board has also done their has done their homework as well and taking into account the things that we need to look for so what I'm going to

[01:26:00]
yes yes Barbara Peterson no Crystal tell me about yes all right so we're going to move on to our next item which is going to be an update we're going to go ahead and jump into the update on the community listening session and the next steps in the continuation of the student outcomes Focus governance this is just a discussion item Ashley from the Council of great City Schools is going to be joining me tonight on this conversation and so Ashley I'm going to turn it over to you because you've got some good information for the board and then we'll talk about our next steps and where we are

[01:27:00]
yes great thank you so much president Montoya Cordova and superintendent Elder and board of education for Albuquerque Public Schools so in September the Board of Education and several members of your District's leadership team received training from myself and a colleague AJ crabill to become more effective at creating the conditions for improve student outcomes across Albuquerque Public Schools this framework is called student outcomes focused governance and It Centers the mindset that school districts exist to improve student outcomes so your next meeting you adopted a timeline that really focused a sense of urgency around the first step that you have to take which is changing the way that you work with the community improving improvements in the way that you collaborate with the community and really seek to understand

[01:28:00]
Vision that they have for improved student outcomes and the values that they feel should be protected along the way as you seek to improve the student outcomes so I would like to start by extending a moment of gratitude to superintendent Elder and all of the faculty members who answered the call to plan and coordinate public meetings for the board to host these conversations with the community that hosted a two-way flow of information they in collaboration with you the board have done an incredible amount of work in a very small amount of time you have received a lot of really great feedback is you seek to understand really what the vision is of your community and what their values are so far you've had five meetings three of these three additional meetings which have been tailored to a unique approach

[01:29:00]
for communities that really require a different way of communicating where there are different cultural norms and interpretation accommodations that are needed you also have had a couple of specialized meetings for students and the tribal council and you have each individually or not individually you've been going out in pairs to meet with Community Partners with a shared script and a common voice so that you are truly representing the voice of the board versus individual Forum members so far you have received over almost 1300 responses and I'm going to tell you all about those responses and just a little bit before I do that a president would you like to give your opportunities or opportunities

[01:30:00]
to share some of the highlights that they have taken away from the engagement sessions that they posted I would love to do that so we'll keep it really brief cuz we're going to go through some other items but I mean I would just like to ask you to the board members if you could share at least one highlight from you know something that stood out for you with all of the engagement that we've done thus far that stands out for you know start over here with you board member Dominguez I'm always heartened when I hear from newcomer and South Valley immigrant communities that they want their children to learn as much as possible to to command language skills but with the purpose of coming back to the community and with passion and and giving back to

[01:31:00]
I loved it I loved hearing that and the passion is more important than money is what the newcomer said at that meeting I think mine was just getting the thank yous from family members that they actually had an opportunity to talk to board members and many of them had never even met their board member before and to have us in their schools and you know being relatable and having that two-way conversation with him I think that was the biggest highlight of it and that's what makes our job fun fun I think I have been really surprised but I really enjoyed hearing but no matter where we are in the city some of the things that are coming back are very similar I think I went in thinking that the

[01:32:00]
I've been really pleasantly I really enjoyed hearing that we are we are more together than we think we are going well always to me what the Highlight always is is the kids I mean that just so I just I know we had a couple where we had at Cibola a group of students that were there and gave their input and I think we need to listen a lot more to them because they're the ones that are in the classroom and also when we did the Spanish session at Albuquerque High and we had a big group of of students and what they have to say they are wise Beyond wise beyond their years and everyone wants their children to grow up and be be successful and they want them to be prepared

[01:33:00]
chemically for college career whatever they decide to do and it was good to hear that across the entire City Board member Peterson and I think one of the commonalities that really came through is over and over again I heard people talk about wanting kids to come out with the sense of giving back to the community and being part of the whole community and that was echoed through I was at 5: 5

[01:34:00]
and also a reminder are you going to do this again we really want to be able to hear from you again I got a lot of like thank you also Ashley you need to know this part too is a lot of thank yous on the process that it was you know how we had the small group discussions and that ability to do that because there was this opportunity for them to hear each other as well and when they were sitting at tables maybe with individuals that they wouldn't normally be engaged with having that pleasant surprise to his brother as a board member Jackson saying it's like how similar we are and a lot of areas and a lot of the thinking so there was a lot of like thank you for the process to because that was really helpful and so continue on because you're going to share some data with us we're really excited or some information of what we've gleaned so far

[01:35:00]
I think that everything that you just highlighted is really important to why this process exists taking people out of the out of their districts where they get elected I know you just had a really important conversation about this it's getting people out of their political boundaries out of their the schools that they attend out of their neighborhoods and literally around the table to have a conversation about the value of values for children and student learning can be truly transformational framework is a continuous improvement improvement model it's really important to think about continuous Improvement it starts with the expectation that

[01:36:00]
the first time you do anything is not going to be perfect you're going to come out of the gate a little bit clumsy you're going to Fumble over yourselves there's there's always going to be room for improvement and this just like any other process is implemented by humans and humans are going to always have room to to do things better so in that in that vein just think about all of the times that we've had the debriefing conversations which I really enjoyed being able to have these conversations with you about just asking the question what worked and what didn't work and again acknowledging your staff and how responsive they have been to that feedback and how after every single session they have made course Corrections so that you have you really do have real-time improvements happening so that the very first session that you hold is going to be

[01:37:00]
you know very different from the the last one you're going to you're just learned so much even across this band of five or six meetings so to that end let's get into get into the data so you had I'm really going to talk about 7 meet just from a high-level overview so and this is not in the order that the meetings were had but I want to talk about which ones were held and how many people attended so I have for the in-person session we just have data on the number of people who showed up we didn't we didn't want to overwhelm them with any kind of demographic data getting into we just didn't want to them with asking a lot of questions because we really wanted them to focus on the the three big questions that were asked but we do have the

[01:38:00]
high school there were 75 families in attendance plus 15 staff members who helped Provide support for facilitating the meetings and 15 students who also attended and helped Del Norte was a very specific session that was held for the newcomer community and there's a lot of praise to be thrown out for that meeting a lot of deliberate deliberate effort into making that successful so that there were 3500

[01:39:00]
had a session that was completely hosted or it was completely delivered in Spanish for Native Spanish speakers and shout out to Peggy and Josefina for facilitating that and infecting their their skills for their Community you had 30% attend that one with 15 staff members and 12 students Rio Grande High School was the first meeting that you held and there were over 100 100 to support and 15 students that provided help as well and then it El Dorado or El Dorado there were 80 participants with 20 staff members and 15 students and then another special meeting was held with the super sack that was all just students and there were 25 students who attended and participated in provided responses for

[01:40:00]
so these are really really good numbers I can't stress that enough I've done a lot of these sessions over a lot of big districts like Albuquerque and I don't I can't say that I've ever attended one that had a hundred people presents so I need to I need to check with my colleagues but you may have a record there you know and I was so worried if you all remember because it was the first one and I was like oh it's not going to it's going to be hard but I remember that night because Rio Grande had to pull extra tables because we had more people show up that we had planted for so yeah yes yes yes so you have an online survey so as you've been going out into the session hosted by your Community Partners you've been encouraging people to go online there's a there's a survey that is linked on the homepage of the Albuquerque website or APS website

[01:41:00]
sorry and you have gotten a lot of responses from that as well currently over 1300 exactly 1278 survey responses from that and so I do have specific demographic data for the people who have or for the survey respondents and this is and I'm just so you know I'm going to share the information here but I also have an email to the board that I will that I will send out as well I'm riding so we want to make sure that as you go out and do this work but you were talking to a statistically relevant number of people you have you have achieved your your minimum number for that which was around $600 doubled it so congratulations

[01:42:00]
so statistical relevance on the size of respondents is important it's also critical that you ensure that you were talking to people that are representative of the demographics of the district so as you if you remember when we first started this process I had one-on-one sessions with each of you and I asked you a couple of questions about who you wanted to make sure that that we definitely heard from and the big the big responses were you want to hear from parents do you want to hear from teachers there was a clear request for that special education community and that you want to hear business business business community respondents and and then I think it was I'm pretty sure it was

[01:43:00]
is board member Peterson who said don't just talk to teachers when you're talking to Steph also make sure you're including our classified staff so we made sure that we measured the number of gay people the opportunity to self-identify within each of those those relational areas with the district so as of right now you have received responses from over 66% so over 66% of your respondents were parents 25% of your respondents were special or specifically special education parents 31% of your respondents are Educators so we broke we broke out the your asking them to so asking if they were Educators or classified staff so 31% of respondents were specifically Educators and

[01:44:00]
5.6% were classified employees and then you have the tribal Community which is 1.5% on the survey you also I want to remind you that you also have that you also had a specific in-person session with the tribal Community as well and then 3.2% were business partners and 29 percent were just community members at large who didn't fall into any of those categories and to be cleared their those are not going to add up to 100% if you're trying to do the math you have some people are business partners and parents or you know tribal tribal leaders community and business partners and parents and special education parents so you're going to have more than 100% if you add all of those up but those are

[01:45:00]
those are the percentages of the of the total respondents that fall within each category so overall the demographics of the people who responded and I'm going to go in order of response site so 41.1 percent self-identified as white or Caucasian 32.2% identified as Hispanic or Latino 8.5% or two or more races 6.3% identified as other another 6.3% preferred not to answer and then 2.6 per cent were Native American 1.4 percent and so

[01:46:00]
I want to be clear we're looking so when we compare whether or not this is a reflective or a representative sample of your District at home we're not looking at the demographics of the students in your in your District we're looking at the demographics of the community that the entire APS community so that's going to include parents Business Leaders and just neighbors people who don't have kids but really care about the outcomes for APS because they want to live in an educated Society so the most recent results show that your Hispanic or Latino population in the city of Albuquerque is 49.2% and your wife are Caucasian population is 38.3% and then two or more races is 9.2% and then

[01:47:00]
everyone else is is below 5% they kind of have a lot of them lumped together but black or African American residents of Albuquerque makeup 3.1% of the population and African American Indian or Alaska native are 4.5% and Asian the Asian population is 3% of the city so before I move on does anyone have any questions about these percentages I just have a quick question so I cuz I you know I just sort of take note we're just having conversations that have done that do they mean because our Latino representation in this was that was actually below the the average right it's only at 32

[01:48:00]
did other school districts do they work till like sort of eat that up a little bit or is that just you know I mean because I wonder if there's like you know barriers challenges I was just curious about that so and this is this is actually the question that I want to put this question on the table and that's does the does the board feel like this is a sufficient response rate and based on the demographics of the of the district or of the people who live within the district so another I will say that most of the time Hispanic or Latino population is usually one of the lowest response rates that we get avocado is special because he has a larger Latino population Or Hispanic population then a lot of the urban districts in America and you have a you know several in Florida and California and

[01:49:00]
here in Texas that are equivalent to actually where I'm located in Fort Worth is pretty much our demographics are very very similar to those in Albuquerque and so when I compare your your results to and I haven't sat down and done like a side-by-side comparison but this is this is the one area that boards usually do come back and say okay we need to do some kind of targeted communication to do a specific Outreach to to the community which you've already done that when you had the Spanish I mean he had a session that was completely in Spanish and again I don't have the demographics from the in-person session but I know that they are from from the conversations that I've had

[01:50:00]
with your Administration there it's not too it's not too far off from the demographics that the survey results are given so so really the you can choose to do a targeted meeting you can do targeted some kind of targeted communication or special last-minute plea to community organizers who are already active in the Hispanic or Latino or Chicano Community there I should say community in Albuquerque it's really a matter of what the word wishes to do okay thank you can I ask you a question do we have any way of breaking down either socioeconomic level three

[01:51:00]
we don't we that's information that we would have needed to collect in advance or when the when they were responding to the surveys and because of the so because of the number of of meetings that you were having and not wanting to overwhelm the community with having to answer a lot of questions and you know the concept of survey fatigue has been discussed a lot and bees it was more important to focus on the racial and ethnic demographics of versus associate economic status and I can tell you that from previous like prior experiences that I've had working with districts they're usually isn't when you look at the responses based on social economic status it really doesn't differ from people

[01:52:00]
who are in the you know the the 1% actually I don't know that we've ever had 1% respond but people who would be considered a living below the poverty line or socio-economically disadvantaged typically don't respond any differently everybody wants the same they have the same values in the same vision for their kids and so the I think that the more important thing for this board at the time was to focus on making sure that the racial and ethnic demographics I work in consistent with the district at large the

[01:53:00]
we may want to Target like particular School communities that we can get more input from is the online survey still open and if so for how much longer so it initially was scheduled to close on Friday so 11:59 on Friday one of the recommendations that I have for the board is to actually extend it until December 16th that is the last day of classes that will give you a little more space so that you can do that targeted Outreach and get the additional responses if you so choose and I am are we going to get to next steps yes so she's actually has like some really good stuff that I wanted to talk about to because it's the summary of what

[01:54:00]
from the survey in terms of like what are those top areas so that's where we'll get to next yeah let's let's let's get into it so I wanted to share the some of the most frequent responses that have come that have come up and I want to be clear these are going to be very general and they're you know their lumped into categories if I if I give specifics about you know this person said this or well I can't tell you what individual said because I don't know myself they're all in Anonymous but we don't want to get into the details of what is being said because the survey is still open and we don't want to influence potential responses and that from that but just from a high level your top frequency responses that have come back as it relates to the vision this is the question that was asked what should APS students know or be able to do what we're getting to is what what are

[01:55:00]
what is the knowledge of the skills that people think that students need to have during their time in APS those have been focused on English language arts that's any response related to Reading Writing and effective communication skills there's also soft skills that's response is related to a student's ability to perform soft skills as a whole or where they may have mentioned specific soft skills like having confidence or self-management or empathy or managing of their time but with that said most of the responses have been the literal word soft skills there's also a post-secondary Readiness this is responses related to knowledge or skills for entertainment for entering the workforce jobs preparation for college courses any kind of postsecondary Readiness or preparation for success

[01:56:00]
After High School and then there's also mathematics these are responses related to mathematics financial management financial literacy and so on and so forth and then you've got science these are going to be responses related to the scientific fields and really a lot of a lot of the responses were just science and then but someone into like stem or specific STEM related categories and then there's also a fine arts which is responses related to knowledge or skills within the Fine Arts domain again most of these responses just list Fine Arts instead of you know getting into a category more specific within Fine Arts so you didn't hear as much like being able to paint or being able to perform Define

[01:57:00]
so that's the division and those are in no particular order I'm not sharing what is most common I'm not sharing what is coming up the most is those are just the top let's see those are the top six most frequent responses that are coming back inside of that question what should APS students know or be able to do and then the next question is getting at the values that your community holds we try to understand these by asking the question what should APS not do or stop doing as they pursue improve student outcomes these there are a lot more of these and so I really stuck to the top 10 and again these are in Noah's are focused on instruction and curriculum quality that's any responses related to increase increase the quality of

[01:58:00]
instructors materials curriculum strategies related to instruction and curriculum so that's just kind of a high-level category the next is supporting teachers this is all responses related to supporting teachers and their time their expertise and their professional judgment there's also instruction time this is any response related to issues that reduce the amount of time that students would receive quality instruction a lot of these values are are based around time spent on testing and this is because the whole idea is that testing takes away from instruction time so the next is academic rigor and high expectations for all students these are any responses related to holding students to high standards or providing

[01:59:00]
rigorous academic Frameworks regardless of their race their class their ethnicity or their economic background then we have decision quality these are responses related to issues that impact the district's decision-making capacity this includes school size District size capacity of administration the effectiveness of implementation efforts research-based decision-making Strategic Management all kind of in that realm and then we've got student voice and accountability these are responses that are related to the board or the district receiving student input giving students voice in their education and holding students accountable for their for discipline issues chronic absenteeism and for the academics and that their own student student outcomes next we have

[02:00:00]
the electives and extracurricular options these are any responses related to access to or improving the quality of effectiveness of electives and or after school enrichment and the next is individual instruction these are going to be responses related to issues that impact the effectiveness or access to individualized or differentiated instruction this includes a lot of responses about class size and the next is Equitable access this is any responses that relate to how students access the access the resources or programs and the disparities that historically exist for students based on their zip code their economic status or their physical or mental ability and then finally I've lived the final

[02:01:00]
category as academic Focus these are all responses related to a desire to not focus on issues related to non-academic levers this may include but is not limited to issues related to political ideology and this is on both sides of the fences there were plenty of people saying plenty of people on both sides saying don't bring politics into our schools so those those we've identified as focusing on academics and that is those are the top so do you have any questions about the categories or the frequency that we received or anything else related to the survey or your community engagement efforts and as you mentioned she's going to we're going to have a memo so you guys will have all of this stuff because it's going to come I promise I know but any questions

[02:02:00]
up to this point no I just really appreciate because she's she's calling through all of the stuff and having to like categorize it and and and and thank God Ashley is there to do it it's not something the administration to do cuz I think it's a lot of work so I know for us so so this is the work that Ashley's doing she still has to take all of the information from the in person so this doesn't even include what we did through those engagement sessions like all those sticky notes this is just from the survey yet just the survey so she still working through all of that so and I think what's really striking to me is like the survey the online survey and how how much how similar it is to what we heard in the in the in-person session so I don't know if it's if it's going to change a whole lot of stuff but I think it helps us

[02:03:00]
things that were coming out in that survey results go ahead question on the survey is it possible to know if any of the people who submitted the survey also attended an in-person now that was actually a question that I initially had on there but we we cut that question just for sake of not having a survey that was too long because there are lots of other surveys going out within the short time frame so we really wanted to keep it as easy as possible for people okay but I like where you're going but don't we have like a mechanism where you can add more because at the end of the community engagement we say something like if you want to add comment

[02:04:00]
you can go online and and so all we've done is we told the the community that if you felt like you didn't have enough opportunity to just go to the survey it's just the survey again so it's not like and something else but it's just you can still go back to the survey and still submit additional information if they felt like during this session they forgot to say something and they want to say it so so it's just more it's just additional input and there are instructions on the survey that say if you if you're coming back to add something from a previous response or after a session then just hit it I think it says to just type in past for everything until you get to the final question which is would you like to add anything and I have not actually seen any responses that are just passes all the way through okay okay

[02:05:00]
obviously this is all public what you cuz you have just said this but I like to share at least through my social media like updates on the process but I also do not want to taint any of the potential information that's coming in from this point forward so can I would you recommend is it okay if I share some of this like this Top Line what vision and values have come in or do you suggest that we just keep it as a discussion here and so that the community still feels as though they're not being led as to what their response should be so I would encourage you so all everything that I have shared is now Public public record I'll share I'll share all of this with you in an email that will be public records so it's out there and that's why I've shared things in the way that I have shared them and I'm not you know not saying this is

[02:06:00]
stop response or anything like that I do think that you should exercise caution when you know encouraging people through social media or through emails and the way that you that you share that information what you don't want is to create to create the implication that you're encouraging people to respond to certain way or you know we definitely want to make sure we have a representative voice of your community so but that's you can't assume that you know all his people think alike and that they're all going to have a certain type of perspective because that is not the case and this survey you will receive the the raw you'll have a file with the raw data so any of your welcome to go look through it it's going to be a lot it's just

[02:07:00]
a show of it's just important to be cautious of creating the perception that any single board member is trying to influence the outcome of the survey which I don't think that's what you've referred to but it's just something to be mindful of yeah okay yeah I I am I would like as many people as possible to fill out the survey and but I just like to keep them updated but I don't know this is really cool information to have so I just wanted to to bring that up so thank you thank you so we can go into what our next steps are going to be I have a clarification because remember we still have a whole section to do after that is 35% and for Albuquerque 49% oh thank you I actually haven't looked up that Fort Worth's demographics since the last census report was released because I was off

[02:08:00]
and I didn't want to know so so I do want to move us along through this because this was intended as a discussion just to kind of give us an update of where we are so the next steps for us and like I kind of wrote some notes down for myself and what we've got going on so Ashley superintendent and I are actually meeting tomorrow because we've got to talk about starting to draft some draft goals and some draft interim goals that will start entertaining as we as you know when we come together so that's kind of like the next big step for us and we're going to be talking about how that process is going to look and how we're going to get to that the other thing that I wanted to know is that we also have one additional upcoming session that board member Gonzalez and I are going to do and that's with special ed parents engagement groups so we're going to add another group into this even though I was so pleasantly surprised to hear that even with the demographic that we had that we had a good representation

[02:09:00]
but I think this will be an opportunity to really just be engaged with them in their you know I'm there like issues and with that group so we've got that coming up on the 13th and we're really I pushed really hard for that meeting so I know we really wanted to get that one in so that's yes would you mind sharing so that some of us could hear the sure you can actually attend it's going to be doing it yeah it's going to be we're going to be here on at city center and it's going to be from 6 to 8:00 and I'll have Dr Albright will get us that information of where where exactly it's going to be but we don't anticipate it being a big group it'll probably be a smaller a smaller group so we'll get that out too and we're just using that as an it not as a direct engagement but an Outreach session so we'll have that let me look for my other notes here really quick

[02:10:00]
I am using a computer which is like driving me insane why are you looking I want to add so you know you yes you absolutely received more a bigger response from the special education parent Community then the number of special education students in Albuquerque or APS that said it is never a bad idea to over represent in your results historically underserved voices so if anything it's always going to be better to defer on the on the higher side of over representing the underrepresented if that makes sense so just another time line is as I mentioned we have a meeting tomorrow that we're going to be going over some of our next steps online survey we'd like to keep it open until December 16th because that we thought that would be

[02:11:00]
Ashley is going to prepare a report and work with the administration on the presentation for the board based on the results of the community conversations and the survey so that that will be coming to a future board meeting and that future board meeting if you remember we've the administration will present to the board at the special board meeting workshop at 5 p.m. on January the 11th and that's where we're going to actually go over it's just going to be a workshop on just that we're not having anything else it is a workshop on student outcomes Focus governance and the goal on that is really to settle in on our our draft goals and guardrails we will articulate that they'll go out they'll be announced they'll be open and then we can get community input as their as they're posted out decided you know this is kind of a decision I made decided not to do this or to post these over

[02:12:00]
so we're going to we're going to do the hard work on the 11th will come we'll do that will put them out will post them hopefully our newspaper will help us to also do something that maybe will we could get some channels on there but hey they're out there posted we want input we want some you want some guidance on that and then at our regular meeting the following week on January 18th we're going to actually vote on those gold goals and cards and so the whole purpose here is for us to really just and then I just want to remind the board go back and look at your student outcomes focused manual on the pages two and three in terms of of goals and guardrails and terms of like how they're made up what they should look like do a little homework go and look at that you know certificate up on that maybe start to draft them in your mind in terms of what that look like and then when we come together on the 11th let's see how close we are right

[02:13:00]
what time is the best you're going to get the snow these notes from Ashley obviously we're still going to have some additional input and pieces that are going to go around the community conversations but I think we've all been in those Community conversations that we've listened in to so it's an opportunity for us to also sort of get our hands dirty on that and start to think about what that will look like and so that's the process of where we are and where we're headed and we will meet our goal of having these done by January 18th so that's that's my goal is that we could get it and we could actually meet our goal of getting this all done which will be great for the superintendent and the staff because I think as you heard the attuned update their waiting on us for that part but we're in such a good place with these two phases on these this is one project with two phases we've got this part with the board and then the part with the tune but it's going to all start to come together and I think we'll start to see

[02:14:00]
and the second semester to the end of the fiscal year that one aligning all of this the work with the Strategic plan but also starting to align it and how are thinking is going to be around budget decisions that we're going to make so we're in a really good spot and I just want to congratulate the staff and thank superintendent Elder to all the work that the staff has done to get us to this point and just really want to thank the community too for showing up and coming into those conversations with us because that's really been that's been an important process for us and one I hope that we keep the board I think it's a value that we should continue to have is to be in continuous conversation with the community so that we can make sure as we're going through and we're starting to monitor those how we're doing with that and that's the whole purpose of of the process in the exercise it wasn't a one-and-done but it's really an opportunity for us to continue to stay in communication with with the

[02:15:00]
play as we move forward so thank you Ashley for your time and for your wonderful work look forward to the memo I had it I got a chance to see things early so I know it makes a whole lot more sense when you see it in writing but it'll be nice that we have that so I appreciate the work that you've done on that Ashley thank you so much all right yes yes so one of the things that is put on the table is whether we wanted to do it feels maybe underrepresented in the data and I think to her Point her final Point around for perhaps he can over-representation of historically underrepresented groups I want to open up that conversation and see if there are any particular groups at the board would like to reach out to I was looking at the I have right now the community and I I don't know how updated it is so I just went in today and I know I did a lot of updating on it today let me see I'm trying to pull

[02:16:00]
I guess my question is so there's groups like Albuquerque Interfaith Community School council's families United for Education partnership for Community Action scene for Terrace swap Olay which are groups that may organize these types of populations that we're talking about and so were they and I'm so glad you brought that up because Sarah I know I was like trying to wrap it up so we can get but one of the things that we will do and Ashley it helped us to pull together a letter and so we will get it out to that I will get it out through through my channel because this is the she had recommended that it come out like from the board chair so that I'll get that out if there are specific groups on here because you're right I had thought of all the groups that you mentioned Community Action Partnership for action with the who could also help us in this but there was some targeted groups that I had on there that I thought I would send out and say hey the survey is still open we really would welcome your membership

[02:17:00]
to come in and to respond to that so what I would ask the board members if you could send me who on that list because you have to also go back and look at this list not all of it is complete and so I might not have contact information for so for those that we have immediate contact information it's easy for me to send it out and I can get the help on that with with board staff but if it's not there then I'm going to have to be like digging and looking and that makes it a lot harder so as board members if you've got some good information to add to that in terms of a contact just send it over to me and I'll make sure that that goes out and that's on the Google drive right it's on the it's on the drive my question along with that like it's been going to as many PTA meetings and Community School calendar so

[02:18:00]
that's those are like points of contact there's not really any follow-up with it do we want do we have the capacity to do more than that with with some groups or do we count that is okay we've done the Outreach and it's done because sometimes sometimes it's just not being able to coordinate with another board member so we can't you know we can't listen to this official listening session plus the time frame that those organizations have I guess I'm not quite sure what you're asking is like to follow to follow up with them we want to try to deepen that contact or do we want to say that I think it's our best effort I think I think we're kind of past the listening sessions point because we've done that part I think now is really pushing through the 16th

[02:19:00]
increase maybe that demographic so that it looks more representative and I think that's our push as board members and so and I'm glad that board member Gonzalez brought that up because we do have some groups on here that we could do some targeted Outreach with in terms of just saying hey we really want to hear you we really want want to make sure that your members or your network you know can come in and respond to that survey but that's I think that's really the last that's the best the best push at this time my only other question and this is something that I've heard from any number of people who have been part of the listening session such is the common to what comes next and after we start developing the goals and Guardians how do we continue that conversation what if we what if we develop them in the community goes well let's hope that we don't I mean I mean that's like no I know it is

[02:20:00]
but I think that figuring out ways that we do continue the conversation so if you were recalled with the student outcomes Focus governance the next part to this is always the monitoring side of it as well so it's not like we're just going to do this and we're not going to be here on the day as having that conversation back about how we're monitoring this and where we're going so the next piece too is part of that monitoring and build into that monitoring our continued conversations so this is it's not going to be over after this point this was just the first phase for us to get to the discussion around goals and guardrails and as you recall we're committed to the Council of great City schools for at least 18 months on this process and they're going to be coaching us through that next phase so that it becomes sort of process and we can continue to do it as part of our governance is a board so it's going to be it's going to be a continuous cycle so so it's it's just our first step

[02:21:00]
all right can I move on now all right cuz I do want to get to our our last items because we moved and then I have to find my my agenda here okay so the next item that we have is consideration for approval and what we've done here is we pulled out all of the items so we're going to go through each one individually first so the first one is approval of the charter renewal with a term of 5 years for the Albuquerque talent and development Academy and yes we do have our wonderful group here who's going to help us with this so I know board members that there was like several questions that went through on this and so will responses so is there any other discussions as we have our wonderful experts here with us and we're talking specifically about the Albuquerque talent and

[02:22:00]
development Academy so I'm concerned I'm very concerned about what I see in the numbers both well you all have a supermajority Hispanic population and your applications and accompanying documents pose problems and so in fact I think what I did in my calendar

[02:23:00]
administrative costs at the expense of students and so because you have such a high number of Hispanic are most vulnerable kids I'd like to recommend that that the office of innovation put the school on a forgetting the phrase thank you so Dr Esco Google are there plans with this particular school around the corrective action pieces on the things that need to be corrected on that or how is that how would that be handled as part of the 5-year renewal if that goes through so good evening

[02:24:00]
but when we go through our review processes we visit each school every semester twice and so we're working with them on improvements so listen to talk to you about the details she's here with us the executive director but what our work in the renewal is to look at their plan for the next 5 years are seven member review the dozens of pages of documents and meets with the school and we really feel like they have a solid plan definition

[02:25:00]
profile and getting the students you know matriculated through their personal education plan so listen to do you want to explain with us typically I graduate is 90 percent we do have students who do come from you know other areas of environmental factors Mental Health social emotional issues a lot of anxiety issues when they leave on APS school they come to

[02:26:00]
and they end up performing a little bit better they feel safer we feel we have to address their social emotional and mental needs before they can actually produce well academically or perform well academically and we believe that we are achieving that Mr Davis is our you know data genius he cannot my assistant he can also address some of the proficiency levels as well but we do feel that we are moving forward and helping our students be successful okay can you get like three examples of how you are helping them to move forward to be successful with addressing their social emotional needs what specifically are you doing we have what is called a personalized

[02:27:00]
education plan it is somewhat similar to an IEP so at our school all students that we meet their individual needs so the peps the personalized education plans address each student's needs each student has a goal similar to an IEP I was a special education teacher so we wanted to address something similar to that of students with disabilities because each student with disabilities have a particular goal and objectives geared towards them so we created and we actually finalized and improved in my opinion Escobedo agreed that we actually improved our personalized education plan they are monitored viewed and discussed

[02:28:00]
a monthly with students and staff there's also a reflection piece in the personalized education plan and that is one way how we are addressing the needs of our students we also were funded a gear up Grant so we threw gear up an avid strategies we are also assisting our students within that area as well we are seeing more students interested in attending college with when we have never seen that before so these past two years have been in Improvement in actually boosting the students self-confidence by discussing that they can attend college they have the ability to have the skills to attend college and to boost their academic skills thank you

[02:29:00]
any other questions

[02:30:00]
possibly be ready with these kinds of of scores and then I'm looking and I did look at all of the the ways you wanted to address that you know the I think the proficiency rate for math was 2.9 percent 14% in science and 26.6 percent in reading and to me those are not acceptable for for any child because all our children are way more capable for sure and there were all these different ways that you said you were going to address those areas so I mean I just want and I know I'm a member to Minges and remember Jackson were kind of asking the same question and I don't think that we've really got an answer to that yet you can't graduate 90% of your kids with these kind of scores and say that they are really ready academically anyway they could be in many ways that you worked on their social emotional health worked

[02:31:00]
is there anxiety and that's that is important to make it in the in you know out in the world as well but our kids have to be able to read and do math and do science as well correct but also covid did put a put a damper on our students on the students so something related to these comments and I don't know if I know this is not the Montessori of the Rio Grande numbers function 1000 I'm assuming these are your numbers it's they're just that column is missed labeled correct is that correct so even though you're in the green under direct instruction and I'm on page 9 of the agenda packet digital packet 37.1% should be

[02:32:00]
in red because you're below 45% and that seems to be linked very directly to these low scores and so I guess the more specific question about corrective actions is that how are you articulating that office of innovation and school I mean how are you working have you identified that with your plan is for five years yes indeed five years the doctor I mean I saw that one too because the direct instruction is only at 37.1% student support is only at 2. 9 9

[02:33:00]
Arthur just isn't the investment in the direct instruction or the student supports that you need or in order to to Really turn this around it's like it seems like the the investments in the school are at school administration Central Services maintenance and operations and I'm just I'm just concerned about that because the direct instruction is not there and I'm wondering are you have a teacher shortage as well are you do you have do you have missing staff how many are you missing and why do you not I would assume you don't have a counselor oh no we do have a counselor we did have to conduct a riff so there is a shortage this year so what did you who did you lay off what was the rift we actually

[02:34:00]
laid off let's see a lunch it's a lunch server a special education teacher because we did not have the number of special ed students in order to maintain a full special education teacher the percentage of special ed students has dropped OK Google how many yes we have one yes we do have one counselor are all your teachers certified are they yes and we have three teachers who are certified in they have a Tesla endorsement also the projected Lisa assistance will be down due to its down to lower enrollment

[02:35:00]
we are also looking for you know purchasing a building in order to utilize our HP 33 and sb9 and so we also have a math interventionist that we did we were able to hire and an avid instructor which is the salary for the instructor comes from a gratitude last year and this year we just started last year with the Avid this year with the math interventionist this year correct okay and

[02:36:00]
I guess I'm I'm going right back to what are your why are your administrative costs what are you paying your principal or the lead you want the salary ya am I allowed to salary is 1158150139

[02:37:00]
I know that it's not easy to set up a school from the ground up but we do have examples of that happening and and it's a problem with all of them so much for such a small enrollment I mean that is the criticism of of charter schools principal wouldn't love to have that situation and granted I understand that there are startup costs and what not but your 5 years into this or more

[02:38:00]
and you're asking for a 5-year renewal and I want to hear I want to hear how you're going to bring down your administrative costs and up the direct instruction cost I mean you need another you need more instructions and these are the most vulnerable that's the question for me and I feel the weight of budget responsibility so my question then either to

[02:39:00]
Mr Garcia what is the if we do a renewal what's the least we can do can we do a year renewal I just don't want us to get caught in when we had this problem where we didn't quite get the legal representation that we needed to tell the board what we needed to do so I need to know can we just renew for a year is that a possibility to give him a chance to maybe change some of the things that were bringing up their budget through that process it is very clear has to agree

[02:40:00]
if you wanted to do a term less than 5 years so we would have to negotiate with them through this process to come to a less than 5 year agreement but we can work on you know a turnaround plan with the school if they're wrong we need one the doctor this is Yolanda I just have another question on this because I know we just kind of go round and round in these circles and I I think the hard part for me because we have this responsibility around authorization we want to put forward good quality places for students that we know are really vulnerable and the things that need to happen here but we sort of get caught up in this in this in this weird conundrum where I'm just curious and I don't mean any disrespect but

[02:41:00]
why are they being considered for Renewal if we have all of these concerns the school brings an application forward and they can bring them to the public education commission or us and we we we we we we review that now the review of the renewal is based on their next 5 years and so I hear your concerns and I think we would like to work on that has multiple so I mean we're in this position you know

[02:42:00]
I understand that this is a group of students who struggle they Struggle No Matter What school are there in and they need supports and I look at it and go and if they were in one of our traditional schools they would probably be getting more support and better instruction than what I can see any evidence of here and then I look at the financial and if this page I mean I'm assuming that the only error on page 9 with the operational expenditures by function I'm assuming that the only error is that it says Montessori of the Rio Grande at the top rather than the the school but they are putting 4.1% or 41.1% of their budget into what students are receiving everything else is Central Services Central Administration School

[02:43:00]
illustration maintenance if we put if APS put a budget like this in front of the PED we would be told in with no uncertain terms to go home and redo it we even have statutory language that says we could not come close to submitting a budget that looks like this and I mean I just I look at this and can't figure out how they could keep a straight face I'm sorry how you can have a straight face and bring this budget to us looking like this so the question is for me can we can we agree to a term less than five five years because you don't want it

[02:44:00]
we need we cannot give 5 years so where can we negotiate here I'm not a president of the board one option would be the table this item and ask the school to negotiate with our office and to bring a term less than with the corrective action plan regarding your concerns I will remind you that we did disapprove new America's budget for the same concerns and the public education department did approve the budget in so I just want to remind you of that process but I think that was going to suggest that it was a technicality about contracts decisions so that's what we're trying

[02:45:00]
to avoid this time around and just to clarify I want to make sure I heard this right so the items that were concerned about today are the exact same items that we were concerned about before when we were having their contract negotiated is that what was said I know when we're looking at you know when they were renewed last time were these the same concerns that were brought up five times decisions

[02:46:00]
to do so who was in that position in 2007 so yeah in 2017 so we're going to what I would recommend is that we're going to definitely table so that and principal Melina it's like you know I think it's just really wanting to be in partnership with you so that we can make sure that we're all so that our office is giving you the right information and the guidance that we need to have so that we could turn these things around because if the end of the day what we're all interested in is making sure that these 150 students are getting the best possible piece of they can have and just based on the information that's presented as to us today in the way that it's presented we just don't feel that confidence just yet so work with the team to help present that to us so that we have better confidence in what's being presented to us around

[02:47:00]
the actions that you plan to take so that we could turn this around I think our students deserve that and I'd like to believe that you as a principal also believe that that's what you want is in the best interest of the kids but you're also serving and so let's let's table this so by tabling doctor Escobedo when would be the next time that this would come through and what is the timeline that we have to have so that they can also we can also meet some other important guidance that we have around PEC and etc etc will ask the school to waive the contractual okay thank you I don't know if we need a motion to table I guess we could probably just have it on record let's go ahead and do it is it better to instead of tabling just postpone it because that's what doctors talking about I would just make a motion to postpone I believe

[02:48:00]
play the motion to postpone you have to have a specific date table is more General okay I just thought we had to have a motion to the table but there is a deadline right that you have to operate off of Dr Escobedo the deadline is December 15th but we will ask and that we've done that in the past and they'll sign a document so that it's legally as long as everything is legal and Crossing that we just want that to be a little a lot stronger and a better presentation around the goals and you know where you're headed with this so that

[02:49:00]
you can also have that confidence around meeting the needs of these 150 students so I'm appealing to that to that notion that I think there's there's a desire to want to have a partnership with us for sure and I think that this partnership can be strengthened but we have to we just have to work a little bit harder on this presentation so that we have the confidence about what are they going to actual things that we're going to change and we're going to shift that will get us to the place where we feel a lot more confident with where the school and the direction of the school okay so I'm going to go ahead and I think we have a motion do we have a motion okay please okay second who's seconding all right let's just do a quick roll call on that just so that we have it on recording yes yes

[02:50:00]
approval of the charter renewal with the term of 5 years for Corrales international school so let's have a conversation on this one really quickly too I think we had some questions out for that board members what are the concerns that you have on this or do we have any or do we have a do we have a motion to entertain on this one for Renewal I have a recommendation or request for a recommendation from the school first of all I mean the numbers are you know what they seem so both Montessori and Corral have strong applications and they seem to have the finances and Data Tracking in order Corrales the only the lowest scores were in math and reading but they had impressive science scores and so I have no doubt they will overcome the challenges of the reading in the mouth scores

[02:51:00]
and then I did ask how many and here's my concern how many of your two of your how many What's the total population 2145 to see that increase I'm curious about you know you have I looked up the demographics of Corrales Elementary

[02:52:00]
and 40 some percent Hispanic it's pretty even Hispanic and Anglo and so you have 57% so that meat that tells me that you're busting in kids so the recommendation is that you increase local kiddos and serve the neighborhood some more they have to really go outside of their neighborhood

[02:53:00]
the students from but it would help to answer that question about how local their the recruiting I just think it's also important board member to me is to realize and know that also on our Charter Schools like this there's a lot of the system and so lotteries are also they can be a barrier to that because you've got to get on the wait list you've got to fill out the application and be those pieces as well so that's the other flaw I think on the side of charter schools where you might have a great charter school and we have family that want to get into those but it's a wait list and it's all so and sometimes it's not you know I think you hear about this also like in like larger cities like in New York where people are fighting to get into like you know specific schools and getting on that wait list is really difficult I think that's one of the issues that we're all so facing here so so it does

[02:54:00]
I'm not sure that it's always a flaw of the school itself it's the system as well but it does look like they have room for growth cuz they're enrollment cap is it 300 and they're only at 242% so it would be interesting but I but I hear your comments and I think that's just something that we can have doctor Escobedo and and Mr Garcia take back to the school and say you know the district is just that the board is just really interested in making sure that there's more Outreach or there's you know capacity building for the local students from that area so other than that are there any other concerns or questions with this particular Charter know I would like to make a motion to approve Corrales a second question I do not see socioeconomic status I'm curious about what that is do we have any information on that doctor's appointment for the school

[02:55:00]
I don't have it off the top of my head but I will get you an updated graph we need that because I think it's important information for us as we think about what is what makes certain Charter Schools work well and quite frankly lots of times it is very strongly connected with what their socioeconomic status is for their families and it makes a huge impact so we make judgments about how excellent and the school you know all of the data looks great the amount the resources that they're spending on their students you know it looks not not strong out of line with what the demographic of the city are the they do good stuff

[02:56:00]
Mr Bartoli the executive director is on the line and he can answer your question I think that leads us to make incorrect conclusions about what's happening at a school so I think we have the director you said is he always calling infection OK Google had nothing to do with Finance we had worked with him on a leadership change and a complete change a couple years before and they were all so much bigger at that time so I just thought I'd say that secondly we are

[02:57:00]
a lottery system we do not provide transportation it's hard to say what our neighborhood is because of course we don't know any District boundaries we pull from all over the city and parents drive their kids to us worried about 2:43 now we have been closer to 270 we're working on Outreach because the pandemic has had weird effect I think on everyone but the biggest thing that holds us back is our is our building and we do have quite a bit of money and we are currently looking to to grow we don't want to get giant but we'd like to grow a little bit more to get away from the small schools adjustment money lost board member I know we talked about this little bit in the past you know the lottery does guide most what we do I think we're up to about 192% free and reduced lunch but we also have several parents that

[02:58:00]
we work really hard to fill out the forms and whether it's a social thing or what we have several families we know could probably use the assistance and don't fill out the forms but you know it's it's a matter of we run a very rigorous program but we also take what we can thank you and thank you you've done I mean I just want to just send them out there on your special education compliance I mean you're just doing a really phenomenal job there and I know some of those falling scores had to do with the I think you had said aligning The Bachelorette with the state standards and so I know that that's where some of that came from but I just wanted to tell you I think you're really doing a great job for our kids mister tally and all of your Staffing thank you in the aps Department

[02:59:00]
you are very different from many many many many many many many many many many of our APS schools and I think that you are able to reflect that and all of your data which just look very good thank you Mom I think we have a motion in a second already yeah Courtney Jackson yes

[03:00:00]
Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes okay so we'll move on to the next Charter approval with the term of 5 years is for the El Camino Real Academy and I know that there was some questions that went out on this is there additional commentary here what are we thinking here I'm feeling the same way about this one so I mean we did we agree to table until there is the board members I appreciate the

[03:01:00]
82 share a few things with you about our school where a k through two School here in the South Valley we have a population of 345 students across that great span and I understand your concerns in regards to our academic scores I guess what I would say first of all is that we've made a lot of changes programmatically at our school in the last year and a half particularly even throughout covid to try to address that and I'd be happy to speak to that I also looked at neighboring scores of schools we have Adobe Acres who's right behind us and they have a lower reading Proficiency in a lot of different kinds of ways as a charter school with our mission and vision and I have to tell you about some of the changes and plans if you if you're willing

[03:02:00]
I just want to point out I did request this I think my my questions were about comparing you to local neighborhood schools demographically but also you know test scores it'd be nice to have that in hand but I'm sorry you said I just wanted to clarify that it's K through 12 so there are comprehensive School 6 about over 600 students I think right are you currently at 600 or where are you currently at know we are currently at 345 students stopped really significantly okay but that was the 600 number was years ago actually

[03:03:00]
650 and that was back in about 2009 so we've actually grown our population significantly in the last couple years what's your what's your breakdown in terms of the number of high school students that you have versus just curious about like the elementary to Middleton High School I'm just curious about what that what that's looking like in terms of how many students are in high school so Elementary we have 1788 Middle School is about the secondary total is $167.78

[03:04:00]
I mean I'm I'm just looking at the concerns about liquidity that you I mean don't have the ability to pay your obligations there and then also just kind of at your special education compliance those are I mean that's falling evaluation compliance numbers so just concerning for those you know special ed children and their families I would be happy to get our business manager on the phone period we have a 61,000 square foot building and 11 and a half acres here so the upkeep is a little bit different for us than some of the other facilities and one of the things she had pointed

[03:05:00]
principal and executive director my salaries in a different category which has an impact on the overall numbers I'm happy to get her on the phone if she can if that's acceptable if you wanted to ask her any questions about this because obviously that's her role and she's much more proficient and explanations like every category except admin you know it's concerning I'm just the same thing kind of looking at your you know your graduation rate is amazing like 92.1% but then when you're kind of also looking at your proficiency you know proficiency levels there I just kind of go what you know what's going on there I just I just want all our kids to be

[03:06:00]
play ready and prepared and if we have a 16.1 percent reading proficiency 11.9 math and 23.2 but we have a 92 percent graduation rate are those kids really ready to be out there so I mean I'm for I mean I would move to table so we can get some more information so I moved to table I will suck it up and just as a comment maybe moving as these Charter renewals are coming up and you are recommending renewal based on what their 5 year plan their looking forward five year plan is it would really be helpful if that five year plan was included in our documents send that

[03:07:00]
I mean the other question if we're tabling this like we did the the other one are we do we want them to consider less than 5 years as well I was assuming it was going to be the same cuz that's what we said we have the same concerns so if you could go back to them and see what they would be willing to do as well thank you and I just I just want to say I mean I know I'm not I don't want to be disrespectful because you know we said we've got students that are graduating and we've got these proficiencies as we have that same proficiency with her regular high school so so I we cannot we cannot throw shade that way when it's all so it is true so the you know the the director did mention that there you know their performance or their academic performance pretty much just

[03:08:00]
Adobe Acres they you know said those kinds of things so I know that El Camino Real has you know it's in my community it's in the South Valley and I know that there are several families that really just just love the school we have some wonderful charter schools in the South Valley that I just also know that their operational side wouldn't look this way that it would come to us and there would be a lot of green so if we could just get that part cleaned up I think it would it would help us a lot to really understand that but it is a struggle and you know I know for some of the public that's here and listening to this this is the hardest one of the hardest pieces I think that APS is engaged in is around we want to have we want to have choice we want to support choice and you know the school

[03:09:00]
is is a is a choice for a lot of parents for lots of different reasons but we also want to make sure that we have a list of choices that also is going to give them great quality and so I think if we could just clean up a couple of these things and we'll come back I think we'll be I think we could be really good on this one so we've got a motion to table Dr Albright can we have a roll call please Peggy Miller yes Crystal of the negotiated no no no we need Montessori I'm telling you I'm trying to move too fast approval of the charter renewal with the term of five years for the Montessori Rio Grande

[03:10:00]
if we could turn down the heat it's like okay thank you it's like we're like we're dying up here all right so questions on this one do we have where are we at I have concerns about but I have to say again order impressive results elementary schools are in the area and those two other schools reflect very different demographics and outcomes the Hispanic population at the original Chavez Elementary School is in the upper 80s

[03:11:00]
it's about 77% and start contrast Montessori on the Rio Grande accommodates 33% is 38% Hispanics I'd like to I'd like to see Montessori of the Rio Grande reduce that kind of segregation because they they need to accommodate the neighborhood and and so my recommendation is that they bring in more neighborhood children and that they accommodate in the name of equity and I know that the takes hard work and it requires Facebook but I think they're in a good situation to to do so and I'm

[03:12:00]
hopeful that they can Rectify that number I mean part of the problem is I understand there isn't Transportation as well so if you're too far away from the school even if you're in the neighborhood you're not going to let your kindergartener first grader walk that far so there isn't transportation and I always say that without transportation that keeps people from going to certain charter schools because they just don't have the ability and that's why we need to work on Transportation rights well they're awesome yeah I'm like yeah good for you guys right I was going to say I think we have to be mindful of using throwing around terms like segregation's which is not the case at all and if we're talking about a portfolio of choice a system of choice in our city families from across the city are choosing to attend this school for a reason families within the

[03:13:00]
Thomas community may not be for variety of reasons we don't know but what is it that we want do we want them to pull the kids from Reginald Chavez and duranes is that what we want cuz those both have pretty declining enrollment so I think this for me just really relates back to having a broader strategy for our district what are we trying to accomplish for which children and how how does Charters fit into that how to facilities fit into that how do academic strategy fit into that bigger strategy I don't think it's up to us to dictate to Charter Schools what ought to be there focused when it comes to recruitment enrollment that said looking at the application that face value which is what we can do their numbers are strong there shouldn't performance is strong the financials are strong so I would motion for approval go ahead I mean yeah there's there's no

[03:14:00]
Christian book into approve this application there is definitely all of all of the concerns that board member Gonzalez pointed out or absolutely true I do have some real concerns about the fact that we have families that make the decision to Elementary School in Birmingham Alabama and I know for a fact the second schools became desegregated White flight was the real thing and we shy away from saying that but I but I do think that there are some realities in this community that are not pretty and that

[03:15:00]
families do choose to go to schools like Montessori because they have a certain amount of privilege to do that that they can get their kids their the socioeconomic status definitely reflects that they are very outside of who most of our community is I think this is not to attack the Montessori on the Rio Grande and it's not to text but I do think that we have to look seriously about how that impacts us as a district and what that means for families and for students I mean one example is Longfellow was is the school it made the

[03:16:00]
Community first and foremost but to focus on the Arts and dual language and open up that enrollment and I think that it's one of the models that can be really well done it it both supports a level of choice will still being absolutely committed to the the Martinez town community in as a different picture of that Coronado opened up specifically as an entirely not distracted magnets we as a district need to figure out where are our priorities and what does that really look like for everybody

[03:17:00]
so I mean my wish would be that Montessori is a magnet school that is that has a commitment to serve that community and still reflect the needs and desires of the of the families that they choose to go there and I I think that we need to start thinking about Innovation and what that what are array of school choice really looks like and what does it mean overall for the community that's not going to happen this year I mean I'll support this this year but I think that we need to think more broadly about how we think about Innovation and I I was talking to

[03:18:00]
last night about the choice they've made to Charter Schools and they did it for legitimate reasons for caring about their kids wanting the best for kids but one of the things that they said that does really concern me is that the reason they feel safer sending their child or children it was two different families to Charter School is if family don't abide by and if children don't abide by the contract they set up they send those kids away I don't know what the numbers are for actual disenrollment in charter schools based on Behavior but I do know that virtually any neighborhood School in the city will talk about getting kids back from charter schools because they have been counseled out is not being good match and so I just I think that it's not as simple and straightforward is just saying

[03:19:00]
this is a remarkable school and that the family service that you were just talking about I would like to see them I would like to see them too if you do have them that would be obviously very concerning I'm sure to all of us so if you all have those numbers that be wonderful the other thing when it comes to Montessori learning a lot of people choose that for a specific reason and I mean that's who I think a lot of times is drawn to that school because they want their child to be taught in the morning and everybody everybody doesn't everybody doesn't like that style every parent doesn't like it and I'm not disagreeing with that but I am saying that we need to contemplate the repercussions of it and I'm not sure we always do when it comes to Charters it's a different topic and so but I think also is

[03:20:00]
we've got a long-standing charter that was part of our group of Charters and it's in there and it's doing a good job and so I want to just call for the vote please thank you again just a confirmation board member Gonzalez motion and board member little out of one thank you thank you yes and keep doing a great job I'm very proud of you Gonzalez Peterson is yes okay so our last item we really do have a last one on this one yeah this is a consent so I'll just have a motion for consent this is Crystal emotional and this is consent for approval of the negotiated changes to negotiate agreement between the Albany Community School District number 12 and Albuquerque Federation

[03:21:00]
so have a roll call please thank you yes Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson yes Crystal Tapia Romero yes Josefina Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes okay the last item for us or not last time we're getting to the end of our agenda we really are we'll move on to board member comments and I'll start with Peggy Muller out of going okay so I just want everybody to know that the Gordon Bernalillo Paul graduation is coming up and that is just obviously everybody knows that's just my favorite no fence I'm not supposed to have favorites but I do so if you can come please do go celebrate those children they aren't those students have worked really really hard to get where they are in unbelievable circumstances so please please come if you can it'll be at you on the 15th is that right

[03:22:00]
and then I just want to thank the redistricting committee members my redistricting committee members Carol and stiff and Joshua Neil they did an amazing job never had ever done it before but they are both absolutely brilliant and worked really hard and they learned a whole they learned a whole bunch of stuff so if they ever need to choose him to be on another one and 10 years they're going to know exactly what to do so thank you to them I appreciate them a lot and then I want to say that that we shouldn't ever discourage anyone from participating in serving our community ever just because they may have served in a certain Administration that we may not agree with me we may not align with that shouldn't ever keep us from serving because we may not agree with somebody so I am not I am not that person and I hope that none of us up here are that person at all

[03:23:00]
we need all the help as one Albuquerque that we can possibly get and I don't believe anybody should be excluded because of their political leanings whatever they are we should just do our very best job and then the last thing that I just want to go through I got a whole bunch of like emails and text messages Etc and I I just want to get them out there so that people know that their voices are being listened to and these were all about Equity grading so these are some of the things that I got I obviously didn't vote for it because I think it should all be based on on marriage and not on skin color or socioeconomic so some of the things that I was told is no wonder in New Mexico education is the worst in the country raise the bar don't lower it and a lot of these came from teachers and

[03:24:00]
administrators we are working to make our school better not by lowering the bar but by raising it you should eliminate these so you can raise expectations raise the bar and kids will then have to pass their classes with a 70% because if we lower the bar on grading kids will respond by passing their classes at 50% or 40% with my experience and education I've learned the kids will respond positively to the structure we put in place they will try to get over the bar instead of what is going to now happen which is they will scoot under the bar competition makes you better it raises a bar it raises expectations it raises output I was told and this was these were teachers I was told to give students a 50 if they didn't turn in their work at all not a zero they were supposed to get a 50 I was told

[03:25:00]
it's still an F but they can recover and they won't be so discouraged so what I said is if they don't show up for work in the real world no employer is going to give them give them 50% of their pay so they won't be discouraged about work equity and Grading is great inflation for a year this idiotic notion has been thrown about yes it will allow our high schools to improve their graduation rates without actually educating or holding our students accountable and we're asking taxpayers to spend over $60,000 to justify it speak the truth because of us in our schools are grateful when you talk about what equity for grading really is thank you I don't like to have my appreciation for the redistricting committee on the time but they put forth into this process

[03:26:00]
the expertise that they brought in the commitment to that they brought in the hard work that they did all along the way I'm tremendously appreciative of all of that and I do think we ended up with a strong product songs that have maps in the end it's a tremendously appreciative to the community representatives for doing that also want to express appreciation to the strong Charter leaders that we have in our community and for their work to do their part to lean and to try to serve and support our students I think it's tragic that many of the sad data that we talked about that we reviewed for some of these Charter Schools is echoed in some of our APS district schools we have APS schools that are performing at single digit proficiency and some zero Proficiency in math and reading and so I just appreciate the leadership of our community members who are trying to make a change I also want to thank Mrs Stewart in public comment for shining a light about the data and transparency issues with Special Education data collection and hope that we

[03:27:00]
we can have more transparency more information around some of these issues particularly related to seclusion and restraint and making sure that we have transparency and accountability for what's happening to and with these students and finally I just want to express appreciation to my fellow board members for your continued an ongoing focus on student outcomes and I look forward to our upcoming board meetings where we do Focus primarily on student outcomes where we have those goals that and we keep those students front and center and we remember that our primary focus the main purpose of the school district is to improve student outcomes and so I look forward to the to the point when our Board gets there and focuses our time on student outcomes as well thank you thank you board member Peterson covered all of our community listening stations it was a massive effort and couldn't have been done without people going

[03:28:00]
way Above & Beyond on top of everything else that they're doing to keep things going so a huge thank you to that and I will I probably have said more than I need to say during the meeting but I will send one final shout out to my members of the redistricting committee and once again Echo the fact that there was a lack of respect for equality voice that they felt strongly and deeply and so our challenge is as we go forward to make sure regardless of those redistricting plans that we truly represent the entire

[03:29:00]
is there a district and that we truly look at what Equity means across the district thank you board member Jackson sure so the the one thing that I want to highlight and I just saw this on social media it looks as though Locker 505 was broken into yesterday or the day before or something like that and some of their a lot of their stuff was stolen and that is just heartbreaking when we are trying to help our students that need the help so I would ask anybody who might still be listening to if you can reach out to Locker 5:05 see what they need to see what donations you can send to them now as we're heading into the holidays that just might be something that we can help with

[03:30:00]
I would also like to reiterate the survey I was going to say we only have 3 more days we now have many more days we have until the 16th can't do math right now but please please please please please please please please please fill out the survey as I think that the meeting tonight definitely highlighted that your voice is being heard and we are we are listening to what the feedback is is and you are not just filling out another survey to fill out another survey you are filling out a survey to chart the direction of our student outcomes for the next five years and it is critical and then just my last comment is I would like to highlight my to representatives and kind of get the final word on on them for the redistricting committee I would like to think Scott Darnell and

[03:31:00]
fire Richie who are two men who are of the highest Integrity who work extremely hard who were one of whom was elected by the redistricting committee to serve as the chairman was elected by his fellow committee members to serve the the registering committee and served it in the best way possible again with the highest amount of integrity and ethics and I would like to reiterate we asked the community to help us we asked people to do things for us and then we have the audacity to sit up here and then criticize them personally

[03:32:00]
it is disgraceful and we need to be really careful that when we asked the public to do something we have the utmost respect for the time and dedication that they are giving back to us so thank you I don't I don't know who's still listening but thank you Scott Darnell thank you I appreciate your representation on the registering committee and I hope that you can bring your expertise again in 10 years and I think I thank you too Scott Josefina Dominguez please yes so I think there's a I'd like to say a few words about Equity grading there's a misunderstanding about that because I was brought into an one of the best

[03:33:00]
AP advanced placement programs in the city at Highland High School when I served there and our 12th grade AP teacher Joe Calvert had the highest grades in the city the largest number of fives and she would you guys need to get off that hundred percent grading scale you need to go to a 4.0 and she she made all the arguments this is not a woman who had low standards she had the best standards and she was my mentor and despite that I was afraid to move off of 100 and so

[03:34:00]
500 points to make up for the hundred you know the assignment that you didn't do before so I don't think we can lambaste Equity grading until it requires teachers to be to rethink what we want to count as homework and forces us to rethink how we approach teaching and that's always a good thing I want regarding redistricting I also want to thank my Committee Member Lisa Omen who voiced some of the concerns that Barbara Peterson's representative voice

[03:35:00]
and it was through several conversations and trying to understand that what was evolving we were trying to get at the root of the problem and it took a while before we figured out that it really is a standard operating procedure issue because I felt bad I felt bad that I had put Lisa and I have some of the others in a in a bad unequal situation so I look forward to rethinking How We Do redistricting for APS and getting it started in February and March and then maybe voting on it in July so that we have lots of room to learn to ask questions to fully understand the process

[03:36:00]
and then I want to thank the negotiation negotiating team I am looking forward to a legislative session that will provide I keep hearing this compaction money because you know what as the secretary from the East Mountain Area road in APS secretaries and bookkeepers are the glue that holds our schools together we are responsible for ensuring that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes and we are the face of our schools the first people that anyone meets when they call or come to the school the current job description and pay for secretaries across the district is not in tune with the actual job responsibilities the language in our current contract includes quote other duties as needed and then she proceeds to list

[03:37:00]
22 other duties as needed and they vary they vary these women are awesome and they deserve as close to $22 an hour because many of them are single parents trying to raise children on that and and it's not just secretaries so I look forward to getting as close to 222 an hour as we possibly can get them and and I want to thank our staff are incredible stuff for working so diligently on the community engagement pieces

[03:38:00]
and I am looking forward to I'm glad the survey has been extended because I have an appointment with Megan Miller and Vision Quest and parents there and I think it's important to include those voices and in fact I asked who's in charge of Bernal I had to put in a plug for a community I'm hoping we can get in in time but again thank you to the staff and superintendent for being supportive so I will limit my comments to no comments to take up all the time for everybody went over their time thank you you're welcome I just want to say I had a chance to listen in on the LSC they were in session so it was listening

[03:39:00]
to you know what's coming out of the legislative education study committee and you know as we were listening at the School Board Association definitely some big ticket items in terms of what they're looking at I just want to say thanks to the superintendent for continuously putting out that conversation about the calendar because I think it's it's it's it's important that we're just transparent with the community around the fact that our calendar might look different we've got a session that's coming up and there's definitely a lot of interest in trying to increase those hours and just to remind the public it's not something that we say are the ones that are doing that this is definitely could potentially be the will of how this whole state is going to tackle that issue around student time

[03:40:00]
I just want to say that you know the community needs to be engaged they need to be involved and if there are concerns with that you know also talked with our legislators help us with that either Advocate on behalf of or do what you want to do on that but I just think it's important that we've had continuous conversations with the community about that because it's definitely something that's on the mind of our legislators coming up there's also a lot of additional conversation about money in terms of how that's going to look different in some of the ways that they're planning to put some additional funds back into education in different ways so if you haven't had a chance to kind of go back and look at that platform but it was pretty much solidified through the lesc as they met over the last couple of days all so just say thanks to the board members too for your commitment to the hard work that

[03:41:00]
I think I think I was I was hopeful that I was going to get to every single one of them but I ended up with a bad cold which was not what I had planned but I just really appreciate you know the hard work that that the board has done to stay connected and stay on the on the path to getting this done because it is definitely a lot of work and so I look forward to the upcoming meetings that we have with this so I appreciate that our our new administrator John a king did send out to everybody a list of those dates so please pay attention to those because we were shifting some dates around a little bit so the announcement of our upcoming board meetings due to the winter break the next Board of Education meeting previously scheduled on December 21st will be canceled the board will hold a special Board of Education meeting on December 19th

[03:42:00]
