[00:03:00]
play Fancy items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum isn't a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up were there in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone in the center aisle at the back of the room when their name is called online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room until it's their turn to speak when it is your time you will be escorted into the main meeting space please turn on your audio and video once you're speaking time is up you will be ushered back into the waiting room when you're finished speaking you may choose to leave the meeting and watch it on live stream we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are fewer than 22 speakers each will have two minutes to address the board if we have 23 or more each has one minute for comments please be concise and try not to repeat what other others have said tonight I don't know how many speakers are are

[00:04:00]
there's three there's three speakers and they're all in person okay once your time is up you'll be directed to complete your sentence quickly so others can speak you may not yield your unused time to another speaker if we don't get to all speakers which that should be no problem you or you feel you're unable to convey your message you can email us at board at at aps.edu edu in addition for those of you here tonight a representative I don't think they're here but from our service center is with you but they may not be here okay Mr Gonzalez on our first Speaker this evening in public forum is in person Luis Martinez when you begin speaking at the mic you'll have two minutes good evening my name is Luis Martinez and

[00:05:00]
safety issue that's affecting all APS employees and student body here in the City of Albuquerque recently the New Mexico Senate and House enacted a law a bill that was signed by the governor into law and it's a house bill number 7 I have a copy of that bill here in my hands and basically this law says that this deals with gender-affirming care and it deals with anything related to health protecting reproductive gender firming Health Care providing enforcement and posing penalties and prescribing relief it goes on to say that this bill covers any psychological behavioral surgical pharmaceutical Medical Care Services supplies provided to support a person's gender identity so this does affect schools and school districts like the one here in Albuquerque which is the largest one in the state this bill also goes on and does touch on

[00:06:00]
the subject of preventing pregnancies abortions and managing pregnancy loss and also preventing sexually transmitted diseases this law also which is under chapter 24 nmsa 1978 does come into the enforcement of this law so anyone that tries to hinder or prevent a student athlete or a student academic from pursuing gender identity can be sued and find in for the amount of 5000 per a fence and that would be in addition to attorney fees this field in my estimation has very little to do with the title of gender of firming care but it really is a lot of ethical issues like how it affects parents and student

[00:07:00]
play athletes and so sorry my phone is big enough so you've been over your 2 minutes if you can wrap up in one quick sentence please I'd like for you to consider what we can do as a leadership body to really take a serious look at this many places across the state are resisting this bill because it lies to parents it undermines their Authority with their child and also it is also line to the children too and creating lots of confusion about what is gender thank you sir thank you very much our next speaker is Doctor Who give me if I got that wrong you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president

[00:08:00]
I'd like to share with you the petition and I would like you to consider this petition of the Carlsbad Municipal School District Board of Education and I quote whereas in the 2023 legislative session of the state of New Mexico ped pass legislation concerning reproductive and gender citizens of New Mexico have engaged in a referendum project to appeal this legislation as reproductive and gender of representation best made by medical professionals and parents substantial time resources research and efforts of school administrators and teachers including nurses and counselors will be necessary to properly evaluate carefully consider and topless respond to such legal requirements or ask others including parents and grandparents and others in the community legislation where is due to the extreme workload of the school administrators teachers and other District Personnel that do not have

[00:09:00]
what time will expertise to adequately read evaluate research and respond to the new legal requirements in post on schools by the state legislature now therefore the board of the by unanimous approval by its members here by support the referendum project and its effort to appeal reproductive and gender legislation currently in State Statute respectively submitted Municipal School District Board of Education Robbie Chacon president and again and encourage all of you and consider this for the sake of our children and grandchildren Health please follow the example of Carlsbad school board members thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Jenna Perez once you begin speaking thank you good evening ladies and sir my name is Jennifer Davis I'd like to speak on SEL

[00:10:00]
which is the social emotional learning and it is it is brought to my attention that some people in a committee that I am a part of actually the teachers enjoy learning about that program that SEL program and then in other places it enhances the identity of child's identities like changing your identity or what year what is your identity instead of learning about the education system politics in the classroom I really don't agree with that scl focuses too much on children's identity children's happiness is based on environment within the home academic success in their school how to manage relationships can be a class

[00:11:00]
but many but like many selective classes appearance involvement and its intent inclusiveness details to this curriculum should be transparent meaning transparent being with the parents involvement so including the parent and agreed upon curriculum is my belief that we should have this SEL probably but with the agreement of the parents please many children that are in the environment less conducive to others such as Gang Related development delayed and other can fit this SEL Cricket for emotional disturbance emotional learning Etc and I like to bring to your attention to their question can we agree that SEO SEL can be appropriate for some students but not all thus making this a selective class not mandatory

[00:12:00]
thank you thank you ma'am board members in that concludes public forum thank you thank you so much to our speakers for coming in tonight for a dialogue so really appreciate you taking time coming tonight so our next item that we're going to be going on to today is our student outcomes Focus governance and tonight is our discussion and action is acceptance of a progress monitoring report for go through interim goals through 0.1 through 0.2 and 3.3 focusing on postsecondary Readiness and our presenters are our superintendent Elder doctor Antonio Gonzalez Chief academic officer doctor Chanel chief of schools and Dr Richard Bowman who's our chief information and strategy officer before we get started on that but I want to tell the the group

[00:13:00]
who's who's ready in the wings and she's going to be listening to us and we'll be providing us some guidance as we're going along but for tonight we're going to try to to get ourselves through through this and so the first part you know with this is kind of keeping in line with student outcomes Focus governance the first question is obviously to ask her to confirm that the reports contain all of the required criteria from our perspective the first thing does anyone have any evidence that any element of the required criteria for a high-quality report is not present all right so this is good that's kind of like our first piece so that we know that the the goal clearly shows it clearly shows specific goals interim goals to be monitored it has data that tells us for the three previous

[00:14:00]
preferably on a line graph it clearly has content reporting the current period and it does clearly show the target reporting periods in this part it also has the superintendent's understanding of systems performance relative to the goal and it does clearly show supporting documentation that evidence is the superintendent's understanding of systems performance and if the school system is not a Target or the or the superintendent is understanding of the systems performance indicates implementation is not attract does the monitoring Port clearly describe a systemic root causes strategic responses and any needed steps to move along so these pieces are all clear and the reason that I'm just stating these two is because we do have an audience as watching us and so as we're monitoring these are the key questions that were looking for and these are the pieces that come into to a monitoring report so what we're going to do next is we're going to go

[00:15:00]
go ahead and turn it over to our steam speakers and we're going to go ahead and cover all three reports so that will go through each one and then we'll come back with some questions I do want to say first of all to how proud I was aboard asked some really great questions I thought that was some really smart questions in their those have all been posted so the goal is not to repeat those questions but so that we can start to think about the next pieces and some next clarification if we need any as a result of the presentation tonight but for the audience and for our folks that are monitoring this you'll get to see all of these questions and some of the things that were posted that we'd have greater understanding but I'm going to allow you guys to present your reports so the public can hear where we are with this and what we've learned from this particular goal in the interim goals Madam president thank you in the script I was giving notice that the coach was supposed to jump in between you and me well she told

[00:16:00]
me that she would be available in the wings I don't know Ashley do you want to jump in in any way or did I I I I thought that was I followed the process I was I was going to do an introduction but you didn't have to but you did a great job so thank you superintendent Elder but I'm going to be all good very good I just didn't want to step on anyone's toes before we even got started all right so before you tonight we are here so these things were printed out and the numbers are very small or I am really so but anyways we're here to discuss go through so I put on my screen so it's bigger here discussing go through the percentage of high school graduates who earn Credit in two or more advanced placement International Baccalaureate or dual credit courses or earn an industry certification or bilingual seal will increase from 39.6% in September 2023 to 49

[00:17:00]
6% in September of 2028 so interim goal number one is the goal will we look at the percentage of high school students who dropped out of school and we are trying to move that number will decrease from 4.2% in May of 2023 to 3.2% in May of 2026 on the figure you can see that it's a fluctuating number that it does tend to move because I think a lot of times it has to do with circumstance when you look at the three point one percent during the pandemic I believe one of the questions was why do we think it was slow I think the answer is going to go there was no work that one job so I don't think they left as the right thing but then we came back from the pandemic we know some kids were really struggling with being back in school and being in the routine of school and so you see a pretty significant

[00:18:00]
up to 5.2% I think now you see leveling back down into the 4% which you know again this number will bounce quite a bit but 4% is a semi consistent number throughout the years you can apply those numbers also by reminding that we have a slightly declining enrollment so the numbers can be impacted a little bit by the denominator changing these numbers do not include students who attended an APS Charter Schools that's the old from the star system which is now what Richard Nova Nova and this is produced by our supper team when you break it down for free on there you can start to look at it by the subgroups and these are not just the Martinez the board you see that certainly there are some groups that have historically

[00:19:00]
no interestingly enough females were higher than males in the traditionally are I don't think I have an explanation for that I'm just pointing it out we definitely see some changes in some of these the subgroups specially Native Americans are Native American department is Indian Head Department really has been working hard to reduce that number that has been very targeted a specific work it's never a perfect solution but you know they are that it was a target of theirs one group I wanted to point out and then Dr Bowman will probably explain this later if you look kind of the right you see exited eels Exodus perform very well on this District so I will throw some ideas out as to why that is throughout the evening and

[00:20:00]
enter the English language program and then get out of it they tend to do quite well and in our systems and that's an interesting group to look at some of the groups are too small to be really pertinent so we don't we don't include them and in some of these are again small groups although some are large groups so we need to keep that in mind so when we talked about what's going well we do feel that having the diversity of school choice options within Albuquerque schools to support diverse student needs is helpful so we do have magnet schools and that students can pick up a variety of elective course offerings for students from which to choose we know that White cards Music Theater Athletics Club Esports certainly is a growing growing group so those are good to keep

[00:21:00]
again having that variety of extracurricular and co-curricular activities in athletics and activities also we are have some schools that are in the process of either running an early warning system or piloting early warning systems are they look at data such as attendance behaviors and course grades they can create reports and this exist as a tool for schools to inform them when students are beginning to fall off the path and allow for an earlier intervention and then perhaps one that happens after it's just too late to really turn out comes on what we're hoping to well we'll talk more about that public schools all offers number of methods including in person and virtual what's not going well we have a concern about the

[00:22:00]
job specific training for registrars who are responsible for the data input that directly impacts the Dropout and graduation rates oftentimes deserve transient positions we don't pay very much we've heard this before sometimes are hard to find and it's fairly labor-intensive job these are the people that are putting in the credits for the transcripts these are the people that are putting in the transfer codes and you have to be very careful that when you put that code in that it's done correctly I think the training is there but we are beginning to wonder if we don't need to sort of revisit and crack back and just make sure that mistakes aren't being made because those have an impact on our rates legal talk a little bit about the career Pathways and Court academics not being systemically aligned we know that whereas we have a career pathway that work may not reflect in their core classes that may not reflect in math and language

[00:23:00]
and what we're trying to work towards is if there are Coors and career Pathways in schools specifically the high schools that that work will be supported throughout their day not just in that class so that some of the reading could be broadcast technical reading around you know they say it's a cybersecurity maybe they could read some things about cybersecurity maybe it's a class on auto mechanics be nice if they looked at a technical manual and showed kids how to utilize and operate a manual that they'll see in real life because those read differently than a novel and so it's great to have the novels I don't I don't just want to move away from that but that's where we're going to improve on that and then again the inconsistent use of Integrated Systems of supports so we have early warnings

[00:24:00]
we don't have them everywhere some people have what they think is an early warning system some people that one that looks different we really need to look at a consistent use of this integrated system so to address that obviously we're going to be looking at some ongoing job specific training to registers who enroll in additional students I know that we have run a mentor program in the path with the past with better qualified and talented registrars going out and helping other people when they're new in those first few years and it can be a little confused and that's been very productive in the past through a curriculum and instruction pathway program review with the southern region education board all APS high schools will conduct a data analysis and inventory of current systems in practice by December 19th resulting data to create actionable steps and alignment with something very last year with the middle schools and those reports

[00:25:00]
it's an objective report on what's going on in your school and what are some steps you could take it's not designed to blast individuals it's not designed to you know destroy the school but it's it's an objective look and say you you say you're doing this but we didn't see it or even better I don't know if you noticed you're doing this and you might want to keep it and so there's things that come up that will help us to create intentional next steps around the consistent integration of the early warning system report usage and so for intervention at the school level and that is 3.1 the last time we discussed just doing all three of them up front moving on to 3.225% of high school

[00:26:00]
Robinson Road in advanced placement International Baccalaureate or dual credit courses second year or higher language course or a career pathway concentrated course will increase from 40.1 percent in May of 2023 to 46.1 percent in May of 2026 again you can now see percentages of high school students enrolled in these types of courses across the years from 2019 through 2223 we have dropped we were kids enrolled in those classes some of that I think can be attributed to certainly during the pandemic the difficulty of dual credit repair

[00:27:00]
everywhere and we could certainly add more courses hopefully it would lure more students in and that would be the the goal is not to have the same kids taking AP classes but variety of kids taking AP classes International Baccalaureate is going to be extremely difficult for us to grow we only offered in one school we do that for a reason physically it is incredibly expensive just to hang the sign up cost $10,000 just to do that say your school there's more behind it I think it's incredibly worthwhile program I think it does amazing things for kids and there may be some ways that the school could look at potentially increased numbers but I'm not sure it would require a fundamental shift from the last few months I can get into that industry should have vacation is where we're going to be looking

[00:28:00]
aggro I think you know we do see an upward Trend in the bilingual seals and we're going to talk about that a little bit but industry certification is where we have the greatest potential to to meet this goal and and grow this goal and I think is the most exciting so again if you want to break down the figures by subgroup on the next page you see the the chart here that gives you a very nice breakdown across the years if you can read that light gray one to the left but certainly stands out and you see that we've had some groups do very well and other groups we need to improve I do think it's interesting that in many of these females are performing better and I don't know why that is I do know that almost every graduation I attended last year

[00:29:00]
and it's actually gotten to the point where it's it's almost odd to have a male valedictorian again I don't have any explanation for that it's just that seems to be going but we definitely can look at the Ozzie Martinez and African-American students and see we need to do a lot better job in terms of getting them into these type of courses and we'll talk a little bit about how we plan to do that so what's going well is it all high school students have access to a variation of advanced placement dual credit and language course offerings at their school sites or through the Career Enrichment Center I would also add that they are often times able to take courses at CNM and sometimes they will actually take a course of graduation there's a foundation of course offerings in advanced placement IB dual credit courses that do exist within the district

[00:30:00]
we have Baseline historical data for AP so we can look at our enrollment in the past we can look at our exam pass rate we have that from 2018 then there was an upward Trend in bilingual seals achieved at the high school level we definitely are seeing that become quite desired by our student population they're proud of it we do a good job of celebrating it I think we will schools do a good job of really interested and they'll tell me when I'm out there oh yeah I'm going to get my Bilingual School that you're proud of I'm going to get my bilinguals begin to realize the benefits of dual credit and again of course we do have

[00:31:00]
beginnings of the early warning system to hopefully move students into these type of classes and prevent them from getting himself in a state where they can't get in so it's not going well so we know that we do not have an equitable distribution of these types of courses across the district oftentimes courses are offered because we have a teacher at that school that is certified to teach that and that's it and if you don't have a teacher and there are some of the Apes that quite frankly are hard to get certification on there is there's two types of AP Physics for example and AP Physics C I think is the one we teach at most high schools and it's the very theoretical AP Physics B is more than mechanical engineer type of physics and that one is taught at CEC because there's a small group of kids who want that I don't think it would make it an individual school but looking for those type of offerings to

[00:32:00]
we used to have a German we don't have a German anymore there's just it wasn't the interest anymore and I'm not saying it's disappearing as a world language but that is not one that she'll popular around here these days so although we are now seeing more interested in horses and students home language so we may see a burst of I don't remember but we do have ongoing challenges with the Staffing and funding of those courses because the teachers really have to recruit for some of their more esoteric courses it was a rock and roll history class at 1 High School it was just there was a relationship

[00:33:00]
it should have been one of these large you know really good electives ended up being was there and the kids that took it you know they liked it but not a lot of kids took it cuz they never got past the recruitment effort so these are things we're going to have to think about so as we review and update District procedural directives we really have to have these conversations about how do we ensure Equitable access to course offerings and opportunities district-wide how do we find people at these schools and get them trained so they can offer courses that honestly I think training is right I got training you know and it's a lot of work and not everybody's teacher's hard to find and and we do have to find the funding and we have to

[00:34:00]
go to be specific on what what kind of the core of April should be offered everywhere and again we have those people into one offset really love you know it's that physics be I'll give you an example that guy loves teaching and the kids love the class but he's one guy and that's one place so that's tricky again working with that sorry B will have a better sense of all the high schools in practice and that will help us create some action steps moving forward would like to increase the number of certified staff so we are working on ongoing collaboration with higher education to maintain and strength and teach a residency programs in specific areas and I will tell you that the College of Education and Human Services was hosting a series of focus groups of the last week and they were

[00:35:00]
stakeholders in with the interest to change and grow and evolve the College of Education and when I got my invitation I very happily went because I had some thoughts and I shared them and people in the room shared their thoughts and we're all sharing the same thoughts was not pretty clear that they need to change and so that was a really really positive thing that you and him at least thinking about it and looking at it and it's got a group to help them make some adjustments but one thing I did push was don't let go of the residency programs as one of the best things we've got getting people in the classroom for a year with the master teacher is the best thing you can do because they learn how to do it again trying to develop collaboration with industry Partners to track Career Technical Educators we are hearing more and more from the career

[00:36:00]
technical field that they are more interested in trying something like this they just haven't quite figured out how to do it on their end we have some groups that have an idea and we just haven't finished the collaboration but we're getting there and of course we'll have to continue to take the systemic next steps around resource allocation of course offering student class scheduling to meet goals so that's going to take some butt on the school's part moving into part three interval let me just make it big again the percentage of grade 11 students who earn Credit in at least one advanced placement International

[00:37:00]
but it's dwindled and again I think you can point to the pandemic had some impact cuz kids didn't want to take some of those harder classes online the Career Tech courses were harder online as well cuz a lot of those are very Hands-On and you really couldn't do it so I think you see a loss loss of interest to be honest and just a sense that they didn't want to do it that's going to take a little bit of work on trying to recruit and find kids for these courses and convince them that this is worth their while and that the challenge is worth their while and there are ways to do that again you can look at the actual numbers if you want to look remember charter schools and then we move into the breakdown who does well period

[00:38:00]
and that was sort of a revelation I think wasn't it Richard yeah that was when we met earlier to discuss this he was very excited to point this group out to me we've seen growth in in areas but we still are really got to look at the Jersey Martinez decision in African-American students and really try to start pulling them into this class so again what's going well we all have the variation of advanced placement of course offerings we do have Baseline historical data again the upper Transit early warning system let's not going well the course offerings are not equitably accessible throughout the district inconsistent use of the systems of supporters what we're going to do next reviewing up

[00:39:00]
8th District procedures to ensure there are Equitable access to course offerings and opportunities district-wide again will have that pathway review and we'll know more about exactly who has what again and trying to increase the number of certified staff systemic next steps around resource allocation course offerings and then create a system to identify encourage students to select enroll in one or more advanced placement courses who have demonstrated AP potential to the PST their 10th grade is take the PSAT the PSAT they hit a certain score will throw up a star by their name and say this is a student who has a potential and my understanding that we meet with those kids and encourage them you know you should do something with this this says you could be in April and school and and we need to do a better job of recruit

[00:40:00]
what we talked about the other day is do we look at the layer of kids who are just below a people and I don't know how low that goes but you know how much recruitment do they get and what we want to make sure is that AP potential is not the gateway to get into AP at 8 people potential helps us to identify students but that if a teacher comes forward and vouches for the student Port Antonio

[00:41:00]
who knows how that kid felt that day you and you know it there's kids who sale on that test cuz they like taking tests and they blow the PSAT out and they go into AP and they hate it cuz it's not just a test there's work you know they're just doing a lot of tests so it goes both ways but I do think we need to we really talked a lot about this our systems of identification and a specifically in the Yazi Martinez subgroups an African-American how many of those kids are just below a people potential and if a teacher stood up in about them and said I really think with some effort they could do it I'm not sure what we're saying they're going to go in there and take the test and get five but what I do think we're saying is they would benefit from the experience of taking a college level course and learning What It Takes the effort and the grit and the determination to get through something like that and who knows it may get in there and find out they like it that they really

[00:42:00]
like it and want to do it again so those are the areas that we are looking at for next steps I will remind you this is a very much an implementation goal that we are really Building Systems right now so some of the things that were responding with are either they're in process or they're not they're not happening quite yet but this was the cycle for for this we will learn some of the questions we asked last time is what do you what do you see in here like well we haven't really busy out from that angle yet right but we do learn from these and it will probably help us in future reports along these goals as we begin

[00:43:00]
really says this that's where we're going to we're going to grow and what's good is it's not just a few people anymore looking at it it's all of us looking at it so with that I believe we stand open for questions okay so I do know that you had referenced Dr Bowman in there around the stuff that we've learned around the exit at El I don't know if you want to say something here about that or point something out about that before we we move on because he just referenced you and I just want to make sure you had an opportunity he said we are going to hear more about that so I just wanted to make sure I appreciate the reference but I will also say that for the purposes of this report I don't believe that we have anything else and it's something that will be looking at in the future

[00:44:00]
but it was it was a subject of conversation and I just for clarification so an exited eel okay thank you for the definition we have current else which is often with people think of it as we also have never heals and these are students who in their registration they never reported I'm language survey on all of them and the exited eels are those eels who have exited out of current status by passing the receiving a certain score on the accessories Test in English all right okay thank you

[00:45:00]
for all that information cuz that there was a lot on this and I really appreciate all the work that went into it and I think with all the questions too it just really helped sort of frame like the whole you know sort of the deeper dive around some things so hopefully through the questions are also learning about you know some of the things that we may struggle with just in terms of like technical terms or just like tactical understanding so I really appreciate that so what we're going to do now is that we're just going to move into a conversation about where we are and so the point of this you know is just to not to restate our questions period after this presentation you know is there any other additional questions that you might have

[00:46:00]
and if you need some coaching to ask your question we do have our coach available but if you feel like you're prepared to do that I think now we could just invite the board members to just stop participate in some questions if you've got some at this point so who would like to start I mean I have a question of of Miss pause if she's there so Ashley if you're there but I mean what I did is I sent him questions that were my Technical and tactical or whatever I sent those in but my strategic questions I can't for tonight so that's what we were supposed to do right cuz I want to make sure the public might not read all the questions that are posted okay so okay I just want to make sure that that's what I had done so okay I'm on exactly On Target so the purpose of asking the questions before was just anything that was that would clarify

[00:47:00]
tonight is really around the Strategic conversation okay so I'm good all right do you want me to just go and we can you know take turns if you want to do that so we can start with your first strategic question okay so I'm going to try to put this all into one I have like three questions but I think they're basically asking the same thing so when we're looking at you know the data I'm talking about the 3.1 when we're looking at the data we see that there have to be strategies that worked for our non-targeted groups because we're looking at those numbers and so they seem to be higher for the non-targeted groups and the targeted groups and then also you know when we're looking about the trends for the Native American for all those targeted groups what those Trends look like and we have an idea what what they have looked like for the last four years so we're seeing declined Dropout rates for our

[00:48:00]
targeted population but not for our targeted groups so my question in general is like what is that being attributed to what strategy strategies are working for those non-targeted groups that may not be working for our targeted groups so that's kind of in general and you know when you're kind of looking at the populations that are above a 4% dropout rate and then you see those that are you know that are below for Point 4% dropout rate I mean what are you counting all of that to have any idea so it's kind of a big question but it's kind of the same question what's working what strategies are working one of the things that may be helping is the creation of the attendance teams one of the things we know

[00:49:00]
when kids drop out is nobody has reached out you know they disappear for a for a while and that while just extends too long so I do think you can look at some of the efforts out of the district out of the schools from individuals reaching out to those families and kids and trying to find them I also think you see that at Community Schools where you have a community school coordinator who is much more aware of the community and the individual challenges that families face so they many of our community and you know this but many of our community school coordinators have a real deep understanding of what's happening in the community and when something is going down they tend to know and they're able to help in ways that I don't think happened before we don't have Community School coordinators everywhere and

[00:50:00]
because we do have a tenants teams I think they're at various levels of activity and they do try to meet the legal requirements and I think there's some who go beyond the legal requirements so those would probably be two examples now I know for example with Native Americans students the Indian Head program was really pushing hard for a while they're on credit recovery and really trying to place their kids in situations where graduation didn't seem either impossible or just too far away and they were being pretty aggressive especially around summer school bringing in large numbers of students and putting them on computer and doing computer aided education

[00:51:00]
a lot of support recapture credit so I think that is an example of a focus group effort on one group that really helped now I don't know how they funded it I just know they did but that's example of things you see happening where it works and now what might not be working for those groups of the ability to have real resources so sometimes I'll be honest sometimes families bring challenges that we can't solve and I know we like to think we can solve everything but sometimes it's so severe with you know whether it's a medical situation or somebody is I don't know then incarceration is created a situation where the child is sort of somebody you know

[00:52:00]
they're not sure where I heard this but I don't know where the child is but they put him with a family member they just figured out which one yet and I think there's probably a reason one family member doesn't know where the child is right so that's tricky because that kid becomes if he doesn't come back to school or not in that situation doesn't come back to school that's a Dropout so I think it's about alignment of resources and some interventions that actually work something out for a while there you know we were having kids having a hard time getting to school because they had to work through school bus and they still do that and that works great as long as there's adults that are willing to do it and those adults sometimes you know their kids move on to the next grade level and they don't want to do it anymore and then all the sudden the other parents have stepped up and they got used to somebody else doing it

[00:53:00]
and it gets tricky to find another walking school bus so but those are interventions that we can suggest that just again comes down to Manpower and and will can I just ask a follow-up to that question or just know I think it's related to that because I'm curious about the Native American Credit Recovery was part of that strategy because you had mentioned the students were there was a focused effort so they obviously have a cohort of students that they knew correct so was that cohort was part of the strategy like a case management strategy with that cohort potentially or we don't know Madame President members of the board the program was funded operation students

[00:54:00]
through an AWS process in this case are Native American that are perhaps struggling with being behind in credits they were then brought in in this model that were referencing for summer school support around online programming with coaching and support for the students to have a warm touch wraparound services and the result was positive I mean we had more students asking these Credit Recovery courses with targeted support on an online platform and the program has continued so we can continue to have summer support for our Native American student population and I would just add that another component worth mentioning with our Native American student population is are Indian Head department has made intentional

[00:55:00]
to go into our tribes in Pueblos to work with tribal governments to work on how we can bring the students into our schools in addition to supporting students who may be behind in credits so it's that warm touch philosophy and support under senior director Phil Farson that has really paid dividends in changing the narrative in a very positive way and how we support Native Americans students in the district okay thank you because it's a real intentional program sounds like a great strategy know I will I just wanted to fly off of that so I want to start by thanking you all for the presentation and the day as well as the visualizations that were part of the follow-up materials and the work done through supper as well so appreciation for that regarding goalpoint one is I was listening to you

[00:56:00]
superintendent speak I heard you refer frequently to some schools have ews there's inconsistency there's lack of systemic alignment terms like that so my question is what strategies will you be using to become more consistent and standardized across the district as it relates to all of these issues related to goal 3 but it seems like certainly standardization and consistency is a challenge and so as you think about the organ that you just completed the role of cabinet collaboration across different divisions staff roles and just curious sort of how do you Foster that collaboration consistency and some degree of standardization Madam chair and board member Gonzalez we have reorganized and so with that we have Mr Mark Garcia who is in charge or taking on the leadership of

[00:57:00]
level three and when we look at early warning indicator systems we started it in a few schools some of them have done a fantastic job I want to shout out to Manzano High School they've done a really great job with that and now that we have one person who is specifically overseeing all high schools instead of four people over seeing high schools we're going to have a greater focus and consistency regarding how this is implemented we also received a grant from ped an attendance grant that is going to allow us to also highlight it in a few middle schools and elementary schools and so with the focus with the reorganization I know Mr Garcia he's in I think he's on an airplane right now back from Principal supervision training and

[00:58:00]
he is very excited and knowledgeable about the ews system how to approach it and has a plan to bring all principals together to start looking at that work what kind of interventions can happen at each level and and support also what's in their attendance plans because they have to put together an attendance plan by school so all of it is coming together and what we're seeing as we meet as a goal teams is the cross functionality of each department coming together to support the work so trying to break down the the silos and coming together and so that's that's kind of the focused so my questions related to number 3.1 and when you mention about what's not

[00:59:00]
academics are not systemically aligned I was hoping to hear on what we're going to do in the next steps of how we were going to move to that I guess a greater detail you know what the plan was so I've done that at schools before and it's it's difficult but you have to do because part of the thing is you got to schedule kids a certain way right so if your kids are in one career pathway those kids by necessity will sort of need to follow each other throughout as much of the day as they can and it gets tricky especially around math because they don't all exist in the same math level right that you could have kids who are in Geometry kids who are now brother so

[01:00:00]
would you have to group them as carefully as you can and set the scheduling issue until you have to make a commitment to that cohort then it becomes an issue of the teacher's planning together and that's a little little tricky too because for a while there we tried interdisciplinary teams we tried to break them up by teams and there were benefits and there were cons and we sense then have moved back to court teams which means you work with other teachers in your department which we've seen benefits at least academically but it limits the amount of time that the two cooperating teachers could talk and share material so you end up having to try to buy time either outside the duty day or inside the due today by flexing schedules and having somebody sub for you know if you were going to pair with Danielle we would have your two classes for 30 minutes and give you

[01:01:00]
what chance do some planning together talk about what type of materials and share materials so often times the language arts teach you would say I'm willing to teach these kids how to look at a technical manual I don't have a technical manual and the other guy would say okay I'll provide you how much do you need you know and I'll get you enough documents that you can do this and that right there is a type of collaboration but it tends to happen more on a granular level and at a school by school level Because unless we have very consistent industry certifications and every school which I don't think we're going to have other than we've got the culinary arts is pretty popular cat is when we do I'm really hoping we're going to continue to push out cybersecurity because I think that's got potential others are coming you know we have all the stuff down at CEC in the kids at attend the Early College Academy

[01:02:00]
did they do very well with CEC and I think there's a lot of collaboration at College and Career high school over on the CNN campus between what's happening in the college courses and what the high school teachers are trying to support but the comprehensive it's a little Miss and so it'll be a matter of training people how to have that type of collaboration and if we can build collaboration and so does we do we build that in during the PD days certainly possible do we build time in on the 2nd that's certainly possible so there's times we have that exists inside our contract that were paying for and we can use it so I think that's the next step in the duration of the implementation but it's going to be a little choppy and I think it's going to look a little different in each school as the programs are going to be different at each school but ultimately comes back to

[01:03:00]
get these people together to coordinate that work okay thank you and I can imagine so I really appreciate this ginormous amount of information that you've given us and the thing that's always interesting questions the work that went into answering your questions and there are a couple where I know it was saying we have more work to do and so I just really appreciate that period

[01:04:00]
play I really appreciate that work but I did think of can I sneak in one technical question because it just really came to my attention or was another red flag that I kind of knew and didn't think to ask do we have a way of identifying in the in the data about English Learners are real students the recently arrived English Learners and do we have a way of breaking them out because that includes a really diverse group of students and it might be really interesting apart from some other groups of students who are here from kindergarten on what happens with the students that hit the US for the first time in 9th grade 10th grade

[01:05:00]
board member Peterson so yes it's a bit of a technical question we do not have that broken out at this point but it would be something that would be that we would look at kind of in the future to see we could we can calculate a metric something like number of years in a particular El status and kind of do some sort of break out that way so it's something that we can look at it so going forward it seems like it has real distinct programmatic needs for this group of students and there's some ideas that I know have been in the district that have been contemplated

[01:06:00]
I know what the data shows is that it's in 9th grade that we lose the greatest number of kids and dropouts and a lot of it is just that reality it sounds like from looking at this is the reality hits home and they're feeling overwhelmed so my question then is what what can we do backing up into Middle School to to help with that bridge of what's coming and at the same time pay attention I keep thinking of some of the results of that Middle School task force of developmentally what middle schoolers need what what can be done to both support the mayor and honor who they are there and at the same time help bridge that that transition into the reality of high school

[01:07:00]
ambyr Peterson members of the board I think that's a very timely question because as we were talking before the meeting we have the sreb high school visits taking place as we speak and the reports and findings recommendations that they are going to yield are going to be specifically tied to their feeder middle schools who have already had this visit really the stars of the line beautifully in that we are getting recommendations and supports on how to align our Middle School programming with our high school programming and vice versa in other words we have our Middle School staff going to the high schools as we speak right now giving those recommendations as the high school folks were in the middle schools in the spring so if we're talking about three specifically for example we will see how

[01:08:00]
horse taking patterns how pathways are going to be able to be aligned in a way that is Meaningful that can be messaged and communicated to our students as they begin to anticipate in Middle School their High School experience I also think just kind of I'm touching on member Gonzalez's question earlier in terms of how we are aligning the work is there's a real connection here to go for and how to ews for example we're leaning in on the pilot and our partner John Hopkins University to see how we can take that work learn from it connected to the work of go for as we move forward in transitioning the student experience for Middle School to high schooler what what can we do to stop

[01:09:00]
what's developmentally appropriate in middle school and still create that pathway and that comes down I think with the expectation anyway I'll stop because that's that's yours how can we how can we protect what middle schoolers probably need and still help and you started to address that I just would like you to go a little deeper Madam chair and board member Peterson and I received a lot of communication from teachers at the middle school level who have asked what can we do to have greater accountability for students at the middle school level because their you know they're not credit-bearing horses unless they have an algebra one and they feel like students become very apathetic in middle school because they don't necessarily have to pass all their courses and can be passed on if they

[01:10:00]
play some you know summer programming and so I think that is the work that we could do in the future is what does that look like do we look at some type of policy or procedural directive in middle school where students have to pass their four academic core classes and or a certain number of classes they have to take something during the summer I think that's just been the the greatest question is what can we do about that because then they get to high school and in that 9th grade year they are credit-bearing horses and they're not used to that and so when they oh I can you know not pass this class and just go to summer school when they have to go to summer school to recover three classes it's almost impossible for them to catch up and they end up feeling that it's impossible and they end up become our dropouts and so we need to do better

[01:11:00]
I think I wrote some notes here about informing our families and our students about what opportunities their students have what are the options that they have in doing this work for this specific goal we realized our District offers a lot to kids and families and we have a lot of options and that could be a blessing and a curse right but I think we can do a better job of informing families early on not in 9th grade of what career pathway they can be a part of but in elementary school like if you know these are the programs that are available and you can start in Middle School by taking this class that will feed into the high school that you go to and start building that relationship but I think I think that's part of the work there's a lot to it there's not a silver bullet but I think we realized there's there's work to do and where we're excited about it okay I'm going to ask a question and then I'll go back to the rest of the board

[01:12:00]
I guess one of the things that stood out for me obviously was that distinction between males and females and I will just say it's because it also matches with labor force participation in our state so our labor force participation amongst males is already lagging so obviously it's sort of starting in this area something is gone you know something has is happening there so I guess from a strategic perspective as we're doing these sreb pieces I'm hoping that we're looking I'm hoping that the report tells us like you said the things that were doing but what are the protective factors obviously right for some students and that are participating something and I'm curious you know what those are for young men because I think we're going to have to pay real close attention to what you know what young men are doing so I don't know if you've already starting to think of some strategies around

[01:13:00]
caused you to think anything differently or about approaching the work a little bit differently from that perspective small initiative and I know it's modeled after National program but I don't think I'm comfortable but I do think that we have a pretty solid team over in equity now and we have some leaders that I think will take further steps and then we have in the past because clearly what we've done in the past isn't enough that I have a people now

[01:14:00]
but I think really see the potential to do things different and want to change their behaviors to support kids in different ways you may see changes in the way we do black student union for example but that's just an example the other questions so I I mean I saw the 1, 0 0 0, 0 5

[01:15:00]
looking at the you know number of students who dropped out and this might go to Dr Bowman so do you have those numbers by do you have those numbers by school and if you have them you have them by school what are the schools and I know that might be difficult for you what are they learning if it is like higher at one school than somewhere else like are their strategies perhaps different at a school that has a higher number or there's some schools that have very few that maybe we could learn some strategies from thank you for the question so we do have a plethora of ways that the Dropout numbers are kind of broken out this is just one version of it and I will pass it over to Dr Gonzalez in terms of response a couple things come to mind

[01:16:00]
every school is allocated at risk budget that they have to justify their expenditure for targeting the at-risk student population so there is a nuanced school by School in regards to how they are addressing this from a wraparound Services point of view at Target point of view guidance counselors supporting our student groups that may be referenced so every school the point is has a plan on how they're doing this there's another piece that I think is worth mentioning in that every high school for example we've gotten School designations recently and we have what are called MRI grad schools these schools in addition to their address justifications have to develop very targeted and intentional plans on how they are going to do exactly what you indicated with

[01:17:00]
populations that have been identified so this work does exist and is evolving in regards to response to the reference groups okay so there is that accountability superintendent right there's at the accountability for spending the money the way they need to spend it for those children and so that is the accountability piece at the school level then right now for the purpose of tonight's conversation remember this was a district wide conversation so we didn't really do a lot of digging into individual schools but behind the scenes this you really have to remember that there was a doctor Segura put together a framework for leadership and instruction in the district and what you're starting to see now and you go out into the schools is your starting to see alignment of what we are trying to do the goals are appearing all right they are putting up she just showed me

[01:18:00]
what day is school with wildly important goals and posting their data so that people can see that point is that they are aligning their thinking and their systems around what you have identified as valuable write 90 Day plans should reflect work towards District goals they should no longer just be a compliance piece this is a pretty fundamental shift in this type of work in the past we were told something something but this is changed because now just

[01:19:00]
like you have tied my evaluation to the goals we're going to have to work with our principals about their evaluations and how they should look moving forward and we have been working on job descriptions and adding this language into job descriptions where we can to make sure that people understand this is actually part of the job so there's a lot of the the leg work so when you say holding them accountable yeah but remember we have to build a system and place that allows us to hold them accountable and has the language for what that would look like and how we both celebrate and critique outcomes thank you

[01:20:00]
but it was going to be that there's clear integration between goals 3 and 4 as we think about some of the skills habits and successes that are skills habits and mindsets that are important to life success so certainly if students are building an increasing their competencies and perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy they are more likely to complete high school and so given that I'm curious if you could share a little bit more about the integration of strategies across schools three and four is you think about building of those social emotional skills so that sort of the Strategic part of the question and then sort of the technical part is what is the timing for the first implementation of the Panorama survey so we could have some of that Baseline data around levels of student engagement by the different student groups by grade level so that we can sort of use that as part of early warning but also sort of begin to understand where our

[01:21:00]
Gonzalez members of the board on the later part of your question Panorama will be here for the official lunch next week to begin to intentionally look at the rollout plan we have a target of a November survey so that we will get the first Baseline data that will inform us with some Next Step data that we can look at that can be correlated as we continue to flush out and anticipate our presentation to the board and I believe February with the First Progress monitoring around go for Dr Segura looted to this earlier in that on a weekly basis the goal leads so for example of Mr Garcia and Associate superintendent Garcia and Associates superintendent for gold three and four

[01:22:00]
and we are looking at a Cadence of accountability on a weekly basis as we are looking at the rollout of these goals then the connectivity of the goals critiquing is critical friends the work of the goals as we are seeing how the connection exists I think certainly through this conversation there has been several examples of how Middle School to high school experience are connected in terms of preparing the whole child for a proper articulation or to high school so the work is definitely rolling out quickly and we are very we're excited to be rolling out the specificity around Gulfport and how it will relate to goals one two and three

[01:23:00]
yes I think Ashley for giving us a little template of how we can ask questions appropriate so you know given what we know about the challenges of our teacher shortage and I work for shortage what and how that impacts really severely the implementation of these goals what is what can be done to really accelerate finding training hiring getting in the classroom school buses additional staff phone number Peterson not 100%

[01:24:00]
borderline because I don't know what you what you want us to do you know and I'm not saying that directly to you cuz it's a question I hear that from a whole lot of people in the public or why don't you just hire more people like on the people I have a friend who can't get hired in their teacher and I will say we probably interviewed him there's probably a reason because they're not coming in and the special ed so I will say on the short-term when we met with you and him yesterday some of my recommendations were to immediately begin the implementation of letters training for incoming teachers immediately begin the implementation of classroom behaviors to help them have a shot out there with the kids that are that are coming in

[01:25:00]
but long-term they need to also get active on the recruitment Trail and someone mentioned that they attended that college and they said when I came here you know the building was full it was vibrant there was stuff going on people are cutting paper and group projects and activities you go in there now pretty quiet and there are classrooms and there are kids in there but it can't just be us it has to be this bigger picture and it does need to be the state and I do think the public education department gets it I'd have seen some just social media I was offered an opportunity to learn how to be a teacher today and I thought that was interesting and so it's out there they are trying and we've got to do more of that and as a district we've got to be aggressive in our recruitment the residency programs are step one we just need to expand

[01:26:00]
do that we've got to convince people that they can come in and I think we have to take some shots on people kind of like I said to want to run our apers up and you as a Martinez then you're going to have to take some shots on some kids I think it's the same in the adult world if we're going to really want to increase our number of Native American Educators we really want to increase the number of bilingual Educators and we're going to have to go out there and and say all right we would love to get you in here and if they're like that you know and we think man I don't know we've got to put the full court press and take a few shots because otherwise we are going to move to a system like I see done and other states where they just bring it on license people they're basically just putting people in the classroom and saying thanks for showing up hope you know what you're doing and I just don't see good outcomes that but that's where we're heading it's a national emergency definitely a local emergency special ed

[01:27:00]
they're not there there's nobody there they're not coming so we can only exist with what we have and otherwise you will see a day when we start having to do very extreme steps just to have a body in the classroom that nobody wants to get there but this has been going on for a while and it's really I think it's past prices but it needs to be spoken and it sounds like there are some ideas of how to start really working with communities different with our communities to recruit and doing it very intentionally

[01:28:00]
sleep well we know in the newcomer program that we think we found some teachers and I know Antonio on some connections try to figure out a residency for them so that'll help some and anything else but again it's like I said hey Google do we see a high participation rate and because they get their schooling for free and

[01:29:00]
I think that I don't have those numbers and of course somebody's but I last I heard there's about 25 in my program especially now that we have the opportunity scholarship so you would hope that would relieve the financial burden of going to school but okay question mark what you are anticipating in terms of budgetary implications what those resource allocations might look like

[01:30:00]
what strategy is my to use to be strategic about resource allocation and reallocation so if you can answer any of those that's fine but I also was just thinking as we move forward with our progress monitoring monitoring it would be helpful to sort of have some of that budgetary and financial information if there are vegetarian implications included in the report so more than anything that's a statement that would help if you can't answer any of those tonight that'd be bonus points I'm not going to answer the question tonight because I don't have enough of the specific day that would that's what I will say is we spent the last two days with the IRS going through some pretty interesting data points and I don't know if you guys are you guys are doing that soon you're going to see the same presentation we've seen we've been looking at some some schools and we've been breaking it down by schools to see how

[01:31:00]
what we've discovered is the need to really focus down on how they're spending the money that they've got so sometimes in the budget it'll say something that effect of other position that's where you really have to know exactly how that's funded we also have some thoughts on you know how how many flows to schools and how how much needs to be restricted by law and how much is restricted by District policy and how much is restricted by culture and so looking at some training for our decision makers on campuses because a lot of times we place people in decision-making capacity but they don't have the necessary training to really understand what they're looking at and so somebody acts like they know what they're doing says this is the way we should go

[01:32:00]
wherever he goes out the thing he knew or she knew let's go that way so there's some thoughts on that but I do know that we're going to have to really make sure our people understand that when they have discretionary money what can they do and how free are they and that's philosophical pull that we're going to have at the district level and I've been through it on both sides we went through period

[01:33:00]
going on that didn't aligned anything it was just schools making decisions based on what they thought was best but it didn't help K12 because there was no Continuum so I came back to central office so I think we're now back to where is the where's the the median where is the the middle ground where we say these are the mutuals that we have to keep tight this must happen but you can do what you want with the rest what will happen is it it'll there's going to be issues with you know what we really need to have access to why and that's where things are going to get slightly messy but we're not there to at that point but that is a process that we're going through with the IRS group

[01:34:00]
the strategy and thinking about special ed students and as we've been looking at this and you know you looked at the data and the reports and the activities you know what are some strategies that you're thinking about around the special ed side of the special ed lens especially around career Readiness president of the board thank you for the question I think a lot is going to have to do with the way we approached pre-registration for all of our students including special education principles gathered and they are having ongoing conversations and how they are going to

[01:35:00]
Market courses Korean pre-register students for courses think about this work differently push on the status quo or how we are offering courses that the students are really wanting to take to keep them engaged in their High School experience and what does that look like so I think that's a general statement for all students but with great intentionality for our students special education student population as well schools often function of an annual cycle and we don't have any time to waste and in January we start registering for next school year so I'm proud of the work that our teams have been doing to prepare for a strong 24/25 because the preparation for that

[01:36:00]
restart sending our course catalogs to print before winter break so there's a lot of work being done around you very question and the way we're going to approach enrollment for the new school year beginning after the holidays and I know that there was some questions around specially the CTE and Industry partners and how we engage in that so that there are Partners in the educational side of that what are some of the ways that were using current industry Partners to to help us expand or to grow CTE in a different way so it's not just you know not just so that it's just finding classroom teachers to do this because there's an industry lots of Industry out there that have the expertise but how do we have will the SRB help

[01:37:00]
with alternative ways of bringing in Industry Partners president of the members of the board one really exciting take away from our Middle School SRB visits is that through the leadership of our directory Stevens we now have officially recognized career and connected learning programs at more than a few of our middle schools that are articulated to our high schools and just today with a conversation with another one of our middle schools making that connection for how they can be part of the I mean the success success success and what we're seeing is we have this articulated and once you start building these programs funding comes with it so you're able to get the support for these career in Connected learning opportunities so that has been

[01:38:00]
a very tangible reality or result of our Middle School visits and the support from our industry Partners have started to bleed into our middle schools with also the realization that we can't do everything for everybody everywhere so these visits have helped us align our limited resources by pathways through theater patterns as we look at how we can leverage our limited resources beginning in elementary to Middle School on high school any other questions I just want to say thank you too for all of the information I know it was although it was hard to see the data sometimes and some of our space is where it's you know

[01:39:00]
it's not as great for some students The Experience isn't Equitable right I mean there are some students that are experiencing things in a different way and but I liked that it puts it out there and we can see and hone in where we need to so that we can make that you know cuz some of them it's as high as a 20-point gap you know so we've got huge gaps to fix and you know I was struck by the gaps but I was also struck by the opportunity that I think it could bring for us if we if we're really intentional and and we can get you know get to the work and really hold ourselves accountable to the things that we want to change so I appreciate the I just really appreciate all the access to all the data to sort of linking for us as board members places that we could go to sort of study even more or dive in deeper that remind her on

[01:40:00]
in the additional dashboards and such that you provided okay so let me see we have completed this part I'm going to actually I'm just going to phone a friend at this point but we've done this part and I don't know if there's anything you want to add here to just having you know observed us through this process before I go to the next step yeah so I have a couple of pieces of coaching so so first of all I want to I'm going to offer some coaching for the administration and so one of the pieces of the coaching that I regularly provide to administrative team and one that you all have received from from me and from my colleague when we began this process is not to sugarcoat there are some things that are listed in this report that are

[01:41:00]
specifically under what's not working that can be hard to it can be hard things that are hard to hear the fact that you named the hard stuff and identified how you're working on it is really impressive telling the hard truth isn't fun but it's also the first thing that you have to do in order to grow and so definitely want to celebrate that fact and Pat you on the back for being willing to engage in some of the more difficult parts of the conversation especially when we start talking about equity and the way that just the disparities between how different groups are are achieving or realizing educational and it's not something to really productive

[01:42:00]
get like deep into like a shame spiral about in the board should be celebrated for not allowing that to happen and to not going there they're actually and that was one of the things that I was kind of waiting on edge like are they going to are they going to do it but you didn't and you celebrated it and board member Peterson you you actually named it out loud so great job with that for the staff so you and your presentation you told a lot of stories that painted a fuller picture of the situation on the ground and by adding the contacts that contacts to the challenges that you're facing on the management side it provides a glimpse into your thought processes and decisions that you will have to make which is going to the one is going to help not only the board but also your community

[01:43:00]
just have a deeper understanding of what the facts are on the table for the board so first of all and Yolanda already mentioned it but I'm going to mention it again you did a great job with everyone submitting questions beforehand you clearly did your homework also great job with for everyone with engaging every single person ask questions every single person app Smart questions in fact the majority of the question that the board after tomorrow question mark

[01:44:00]
patient really does need to remain focused on the goal that is being monitored and keeping the conversation at a district level it's really easy and it's always there's always a pool to want to get into like what what the campus level conversation is and how things are being done school by school but this is a you know the board's perspective have to remain district-wide and so these monitoring conversations for the same reason have to remain district-wide and on the same note that the goal that is actually like connections to other goals and other priorities that have been set those are all really great questions but they can distract from the overall conversation that's happening in the monitoring session and so those are great questions to ask beforehand or even after the fact and that and that and doing it

[01:45:00]
poor hand or after the fact allows the that allows the staff to be able to draw those connections in future report so with that great job everybody and you can now I'll turn it back over to you president and y'all can go on to consider accepting the report hey so we're at this point where we're going to actually work to accept our first report and on this one there's three basic questions does reality match the vision is their growth towards the vision and three is there a strategy and plans sufficient to cause growth towards the vision and so if we answer yes to all three then we can we can we can be confident that the data is accurate and the superintendent is performing basically on the report that's in front of us if the answer is you know only one or two of these questions is a yes and

[01:46:00]
you know one that is still lacking or you're not sure on that we could we may have to table the matter and we'd have to bring it back at one of our next meetings hopefully within a month or so so that we could get some additional information and if the answer to all three is know that you know we just don't feel like there's it's not there the vote basically informs the superintendent that we fail to meet the expectations of the monitoring and should be used with discretion so that the board vote is simply to accept the report and not ever to approve the strategies or plan that the superintendent has present has presented so so I guess I just will go back and ask if there's emotion to accept this progress monitoring report based on where we are I will move that we accept the report

[01:47:00]
acceptance of the progress monitoring reports for goal 3 interim goals 3.1 3.2 3.3 focusing on post-secondary Readiness all stated and then focusing on postsecondary Readiness and board member Peterson has offered a motion in that do we have a second all right so we have a motion a second any other discussion can you read those again

[01:48:00]
is there any other discussion I will call for the vote then Peggy Miller Erica yes Danielle Gonzales how exciting we've accepted our First Progress monitoring report congratulations that's great all right thank you so much for being here with us tonight is our next item is just a real quick president's report I just wanted to give an update to the board on the superintendent search firm so as previously mentioned members of the education's executive committee have been part of a team that has reviewed proposals for a superintendent search and recruitment firm other evaluation committee members included our Chief Financial Officer renette Apodaca who represented the administration and Heather snedden who is the audit Committee Member who represent

[01:49:00]
the evaluation committee reviewed six proposals versus individuals and then as a group and the firms were Alma agility Hazard young attea associates also known as hya ideal team Consulting JG Consulting and McPherson and Jake Jacobson the vendors were ranked and the top two firms were Alma and McPherson and Jacobson were interviewed by the committee the committee recommended McPherson and Jacobson one of the nation's leading National superintendent search for him to help with the aps search and the Administration has entered into contract negotiations and hopes to have a contract in place by the end of the month we're still on track to having a superintendent selected in the spring and in place by July 1 so just wanted to give you all an update on where we were was a very Lively process I really appreciate the committee members that are on there and I will add that are Community member Heather said in was it was excellent

[01:50:00]
do you have her voice and her perspective there cuz a lot of things that hadn't thought about from a community perspective so that living up to our guard rail around Community voice and participation and it was really sweet that was really nice to have her on there and then I just want to close with one more thing this is Community Schools coordinator appreciation week so there's a lot of you haven't looked on Facebook there are highlighting each community school coordinator I think that's really incredible it's a such a nice program and so just want to acknowledge our community schools coordinators that are working for the district and all of the great work they do there and then I'm going to but the other thing we had a meeting I know on the right sizing committee we had a bit of a coaching call with this and Peggy is going to give an update on where we are with the right size and committee right so we we met with Dr Blakey and

[01:51:00]
also our coach Ashley was there with us and so what we've come to some decisions so the right sizing discussion group I mean it served a really important role and kept us informed on all the challenges the district was facing because of declining enrollment we had lots of informative meetings and we looked at several recommendations that were presented to us and that I did update you know the board on those discussions and then we met as I said with the coach and with Dr Blakey to just kind of discuss what that what that was as it concerns our governance structure and so what we came to the conclusion was that the work ahead really belongs to the administration and they have their own rightsizing committee already

[01:52:00]
and so the staff is going to continue to meet with the Community Capital advisory commission to explore on going ongoing issues and concerns as it concerns right sizing and the superintendent will keep us updated on on that committee and the work that they are doing internally and they'll inform us when they plan to go out to the communities to to talk about some of the recommendations they may have and I'm hopeful that the Community Capital advisory commission that was created to report to the board will be able to report directly to us whenever they feel that that's that that's necessary so that's a piece that we just need to make sure that we that we keep that we are hearing from that Community Capital advisory commission as they were to report

[01:53:00]
directly to to the board and then menstruation is he's going to be coming all the recommendations will come to the board before us for us to to look at them so that's where we are right now with right-sizing right go ahead we saw a committee that was going into perpetuity what it was and that was like I can't do that I think it makes sense to streamline that process at the same time so is this the group that exists now has been sitting so my concern with that committee is that it's very industry

[01:54:00]
in many of them are our parents of children in a PS and at the same time they represent very heavily the industry side and not other parts of our community and so I'm we certainly need to listen to them and and learn from their wisdom but that's only a part of the community and so I'm really concerned that if they're making the initial recommendation solely it's not going to reflect the needs of our community and that's not how it's going to work I mean that is just one one committee that I know that doctor Blake is currently working with but there's a lot of internal work that's going on internal and external to like the school community that they're working with so with the parents and the school community

[01:55:00]
is that are potentially impacted by some of our decisions there is intentional work that's going on in that process and there's a real commitment at the district level to one engage with the community but also to include the board members in that community outreach engagement when the support is needed what we were just finding with that group is that it was just kind of like we were going on and on and under a committee structure with with boards and what are Lane is and what the work is it was not fitting and so it was and I know Dr Blakey was really looking to us all for some support and trying to figure out how do we structure this so we had a long we had a good coaching call on that so that we could make sure that we were not that we also were not in this specific world because we should really be looking at recommendations that are coming to US base on like all of the feedback all of the hard work

[01:56:00]
they've done at that point to help us to help make a decision about what's best for a particular Community but there is a real commitment to making sure that that Community engagement knowing that the guardrail is there around Community engagement stuff boys student voice so that we can make sure that we're making the decisions using that value that's a really important value so it's not just that committee is to make sure that we listen to public and put and that we're informed that we are that we will attend those meetings that we will be invited and we will live in as well any other comments questions the other thing I just want to remind bored I will be out all next week I'm trying to remember next week in the following week I will be in Portland with my grand girls so for the

[01:57:00]
