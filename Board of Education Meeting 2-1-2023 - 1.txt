[00:04:00]
to those two first action items didn't actually occur until later on in the meeting so as amended you would push board member Peterson moved to maintain the current executive committee leadership for continuity Dominguez second that motion I would actually strike the first two OK Google and then on the very last page page 7 at the very top board member Gonzalez's name is misspelled the board member topping Romero nominated Daniel Gonzalez so those are my amendments all right good night thank you I'd like to add go ahead on page 5

[00:05:00]
at the bottom of the very last I don't know clear bullet board member Dominguez has been and will be or will continue to serve as the alternate for the mid-region Council of governments I think it would be good to clarify with board member Peterson as the voting member okay so and that's on page 5 that was page five of the state of the January 4th yes yes January 18th yeah okay 18 minutes did you catch that this thing there's a shift in that okay I see it

[00:12:00]
Melissa's there should be sections that apply to staff visitors or chaperones in each of these separate sections and needs to specify the use distribution and possession of products tobacco products can you wrap up in a quick statement we have resources for APS to use if they adopt a comprehensive policy and I would love to be in contact with someone about making these changes thank you so much thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person I believe it's Laney Douglas and after that will be Jaylen calabasa you have one minute when you begin speaking me president Montoya Court of a Mr Elder and members of the board my name is Lane Douglas and I'm a teacher at West Mesa High School I'm speaking tonight on behalf of my students who have very strong thoughts and opinions about their experiences with guns on campus but cannot be here tonight

[00:13:00]
my students are primarily concerned about their personal safety the disruption of their learning and the mental health impacts they're worried about becoming desensitized to guns on campus and don't want it to become the norm they believe students are bringing guns to school because they have easy access to them and want to impress their peers to intimidate and Bully others and to protect themselves from those who are threatening them regardless of the reasons my students are overwhelmingly asking for better security at school they want more security aides and police officers they want to know that adults are watching out for them and that they are there are enough security Personnel on campus to keep them safe all day every day my students want the community to step up for them to do what's necessary to address their concerns and to keep them safe at school they don't want empty platitudes they want action to stop you over one minute if you wrap it up real quickly please the most powerful statement made from one of my students is this something I think

[00:14:00]
I don't know I'm a kid I shouldn't have to think about this stuff thank you thank you miss our next speaker is Jaylen calabaza when you begin speaking you have one minute man my name is Jaylen calabaza I'm a stop at West Mesa High School I'm speaking on behalf of the students that we do not feel safe our campus is supposed to help us learn not be a free for all Zone it's a shame that I'm able to admit that our campus is that our campus has too much violence all these people make me think am I going to die that bring me back into our souls this only to stop better security and better discipline of students even bad chicks the increase in violence has diminished my fight or flight response I feel as though it doesn't scare me anymore schools are supposed to be an environment where we should feel safe the real sad fact is that we have to know our surroundings I want to feel safe like in my own home

[00:15:00]
Martinez you have one minute when you begin speaking Sirena has to happen to my peers to make change I walk around my campus seeing almost no security officers I see students smoking and dealing every time I go to the bathrooms guns keep spreading in our community and those involved should be held accountable these students and their parents need to be punished are backpack should have to be searched students and staff ideas should be visible we should have more external and internal security protecting us metal detectors and a camera system that is able to detect guns will it take another student killed for the resources we need to be provided I'm desensitized to it at this point I'm expecting more problems to rise and continue to see my school fall apart period i

[00:16:00]
that these problems can be solved soon thank you Miss Martinez the next speaker is Gabriel Wheeler School I wasn't diagnosed with this Lexia until 5th grade due to my own experience I'm extremely passionate what I do in Early Child Care we have one of the top Early Child Care Centers in the state of New Mexico we have children in her learning sign language being exposed to multiple languages by Pre-K their writing and they can count to 100 and many have started to read we following and we had which numerous Studies have shown preserves childhood curiosity and nourishes a lifelong love of learning I strongly

[00:17:00]
I suppose The Proposal of turning APS schools into Early Child Care Centers we don't need to look for back into our history to see that institutionalized settings are not optimal for children Native American children were put in the settings and it was detrimental what is being proposed would start the academic career of a child and possibly six weeks of age APS educators are not the same as those who practice Early Child Care to stop you you come over a minute if you can wrap up very quickly Advanced countries in education continually show that play bass programs are best for children those 14,000 slots being proposed could put Early Child Care Centers out of business and thank you thank you ma'am thank you our next speaker is on zoo Ariana's Pizza

[00:18:00]
walking on a campus and feeling absolutely scared is not right this issue is not going away on its own just an expression is not going to solve this for some students this could easily be able to get out of school yes students who take guns or weapons should face consequences but how can we solve the problem West Mesa needs a full-time social worker and permanent police officers you say you have put out applications for officers but who's going to do this job for 16 dollars an hour and are you advertising the job enough or at all School schools thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Veronica and after Veronica will be Teddy's son

[00:19:00]
you have one minute when you begin speaking hello my name is Veronica barasa I'm a sophomore at West Mesa High School I'm speaking out today despite my nervousness and hopes to spread Awareness on the many issues we are facing and not only West Mesa but many other high schools as well as Mesa student coming to school where my focus should be on my education I should never have to worry on what I would do if I were in a position where my safety is question I believe that my school is easy to leave campus with an increase in Security on campus students and staff will feel more protected the help regulate who is on campus to avoid any potential danger as an older sister and many siblings and family members who will be attending public high schools in the future before I graduate high school I want to make sure they can go to a safe environment where their lives won't be at risk thank you thank you very much speakerphone when you begin speaking man good evening board members and superintendent I will be reading

[00:20:00]
is there an accounts and the student really went for it the reason I think students are bringing guns to school is not really I'm going to shoot up the school situation as it is stupid kids who claim they need it for self-defense when that's rarely rarely the case and when it is usually someone just wants to be the person up and no life has to be lost but some kids just want to stay away from stuff like that because they think it's proving proving themselves and they look cool I think they shouldn't be so lenient with kids who have proven themselves to get in trouble constantly sometimes the 5th 3 day suspension isn't enough to keep kids in check I also think there should be metal detectors as we are already limited to the points of entry on campus in the excuse of cost doesn't sound right as the school itself might have the money but the state and the funds and the school there's been a lot of construction there's a lot of stuff going on I think that the fact that we haven't had a bad mass shooting here in New Mexico is the reason why but there has to be enough other incidents for it actually to be

[00:21:00]
because maybe the parents don't necessarily care about what they do or they don't know that their kid has a gun and I don't think that the kids should be able to have access to a gun maybe students bring guns to act cool or to scare people or many people think that it's funny to bring guns to school and I'm sorry I have to stop you got over a minute can you please wrap it up very quickly I will wrap it up with a beautiful last statement if it wasn't a problem I wouldn't be writing this help us get safe for protection at our schools and protect children of future Generations thank you ma'am I appreciate it Rosa is our next speaker you have one minute man

[00:22:00]
concerned about the schools building more buildings for 3 and 4 year olds is the purpose of the aps to get small businesses out of business not thinking of the communities where the parents have to go to work when the school is even shortage and stuff and then we do the wraparound services for the children not only in our Pre-K programs but we also have child care available for parents they work till 5 and 6:00 so you also have a lot of shortage of stuff where are you going to be getting this stuff to be building this new programs when there's already a lot of this program so my question is is the aps going to be the ones that are trying to get small services in the world Community social out of business thank you for giving me the opportunity to voice our opinion of a lot of providers are working with this young

[00:23:00]
that has been proven that we have the same standards as the school system and there will be a lot of children without the restaurant service and there are needed in our small communities and even in the larger communities I'm sorry I have to start over there if you have one quick quick quick sentence please thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Ruth Porter's Valley no I'm not even sure I apologize

[00:24:00]
I come to voice my concern about the aps plan on repurposing some of their buildings to provide child care for 3 and 4 year olds with the 10 right sizing the number one issue with right sizing is that they should be focusing on increasing the academic performance outcomes of the students 35% English language proficiency and 25% mathematics instead of creating Pre-K hubs to increase enrollment it is well known for the last 10 years has been decreasing APS only want to increase his money for the district without consideration for what is best for families the community and the current location to 2007 population of violence Apso should you have to report to focus on current students by creating

[00:25:00]
* 220 in English language history math to provide mental health wellness and to provide parenting classes programs already provided early childhood education will be out of business thank you hello my name is

[00:26:00]
about the gun violence that's being ignored and pushed to the side I also want to mention students are terrified some of us don't even want to go to school because we fear we may not make it back from school alive even my parents say they're worried and scared they don't want me to die parents don't want to hear that their child got killed at school nobody wants to hear that my dad told me if someone pulled out a gun or found another person with a gun he was going to take me and my little brother out of school because it isn't safe we really need to change that I don't want to keep living in fear we need more security I also want to give a shout out to the security guard Felicia that used to work at West me so because she made everyone comfortable and safe please do something thank you for listening thank you Miss Lily our next speaker is Evan boils and after that is Laura Vickers

[00:27:00]
and you have one minute once you begin speaking okay this is working my name is Evan Barrios I like to share my feelings about gun violence at West Mesa I'm afraid that every time I go to school I think someone might have a gun and start a lockdown I fear for my life when I go to school I try to search for the nearest exit students are getting guns from the dark web stealing them from their parents or buying them from their friends they think it is okay to bring it to school which puts other people's lives at risk I feel like our school needs more protection we need more security we need more metal detectors to catch students who bring weapons to school thank you for listening thank you sir Laura Vickers or next speaker after Laura will be Melissa Scott give one minute man

[00:28:00]
hi my name is Laura Vickers and I teach at West Mesa High School and I would like to read some student statements school should have to have more security and metal detectors school students parents kids and teachers need to do better you're putting other kids in danger and in an unsafe environment I think I think the possible solution would be more security board members as a member of APs District do not feel safe with the allowance of having guns on campus due to the violence and conflict it may bring to our safety our students and parents do not feel safe at all Anything could happen in a second funds are everywhere this won't be stopped by anyone but we could take better measures and protecting people I've heard about

[00:29:00]
what students who have brought guns to school as a student myself Having the courage to speak out and tell him the person that can be scary or you've gone over a minute I need you to wrap up in one quick sentence please I hope you hear the students voices and do something about getting some Quality Security on our campus soon thank you man Melissa Scott and after Melissa will be cold later on Pandora I want to quickly tell you about how business works in the child care world we serve children 6 weeks through 5 years old and our business is float because of our three and four year olds the ratios in our classrooms mean that most of the money we make groups and that money allows us to create and toddlers spots if a significant

[00:30:00]
are pulled into the public school system those Child Care programs will be gutted we will lose because we will not be able to afford them will also lose access to after school care and before care again because we won't be able to keep our businesses running and we're losing the funds that we would get from enrolling children over the course of the day expanding APS is Services the three and four year olds sounds amazing I am 100% on board of the universal Child Care Universal Pre-K I would let my business die in a second if I thought it could get us there this is not that this is moving too fast it's not Consulting with the people who are already doing the work on the ground over a minute if you have anything more to say please do it very quickly okay thank you ma'am next speaker is Cole Leo's I don't know if I'm saying that correctly right ok Google

[00:32:00]
APS or or students please please do something about it because we don't do something now our generation will get worse and thank you for your time thank you sir or next speaker is Jessica Barrett and after Jessica Marissa Gonzalez Gonzalez one minute president presidents High School I also have the privilege of being a West Mesa High School class of 2009 graduate West Mesa is my home so I care about the safety of my students myself my colleagues and my community one of my students who cannot be here tonight told me that I could share some of his thoughts

[00:33:00]
last school year the student personally witnessed the young man that was gunned down and killed just outside the boundary line near West Mesa he informed me that he feels politicians and school board members do not understand the feelings of the students that have experienced gun violence this is because he believes that our leaders are lucky enough to not have excuse me to have not experienced guns in a way that West Mesa students have to be taken in order to reduce the number of guns in school one of which could include installing metal detectors I'm sorry I have to stop you've got over a minute I need you to wrap up very quickly please the last thing he really emphasized is he truly cares because his younger sister will be coming to West Mesa soon and he wants her to have a healthy and safe learning environment

[00:34:00]
and he strongly emphasized that he wants us to be proactive and not reactive thank you for everything thank you Carissa Gonzalez and after Christmas I just want to hurry up and add on to everybody else's statements one of our students this one stood out to me very powerful way and I just wanted to quickly share this the way gun violence at my school most impacts me that having to wake up every day five days a week and knowing that today could be my last day walking and being on this planet having to constantly stay alerted and on edge for 7 hours every single day listening you know see if a student has a weapon the guns on campus to make and it makes it hard to focus and to relax at school

[00:35:00]
during try to do your work it's not fun knowing you can happen to me and everybody else around me from the start of school to the end of the school day and makes me relive every day when I arrive home knowing I'm not in a very big danger zone with someone whose intentions of shooting or hurting me or doing the same act of violence to somebody else or somebody I know so I think you heard a lot of our kids are afraid we already have enough statistics stats against our kids just another one so action is what we need are kids voices are bigger than all of us here so that's how much this statement that to me every child is scared and I hope that you hear each and every one of their voices that's it

[00:36:00]
thank you Jalen Baca Miss Baca you have one minute when you begin speaking and ever since I first joined Public School I've always had to deal with shelter in places and lockdowns and drills of all sorts and I've always had fear that it would happen but over the drills over all of that it's kind of like I've noticed it's become like a joking matter to kids like they'll joke about it all the time like if a person with a gun comes in I'm going to take him down like like it's easy like a like lives aren't lost every day for this I don't have much else to say as a kid who doesn't really know how the system works I do hope that action can be taken whatever can happen happens I don't I don't know

[00:37:00]
you have one minute walk to and from school I know it well I made that walks and elementary school but sometimes these kids have guns on them for other reasons criminals on Main Road in our bus route District or maybe even just putting the finishing buns on our gates and on our fencing to our school

[00:38:00]
because they've been put up and haven't been finished could make a difference so these kids don't have to come to school and fear walking or going to school or going home so people could get jobs and these kids can be safe this can grow our community in many ways I could see this is a good opportunity for both people and our students I see it helping other issues around campus like vaping fighting and ditching if we have an up and security things will be being watched more things will be being seen things will be being said our biggest problems are some of the most untouched and unheard problems and it's sad and a lot of us and makes us fear I really hope that all these students stepping up and having the voice that we need actually is going to do something because we beg you to hear us and make a difference we are scared and so are the teachers and it shouldn't be this way thank you thank you Ariana

[00:39:00]
I apologize it's one minute once you begin speaking them hi everybody my name is Arianna I think it's very sad that this is something we have to discuss and fight for but this is a horrifying truth I was present at school last year when a student sadly lost his life due to gun violence and this year when it's gone went off in a classroom full of students it's sad that if students we have to constantly be alert and on the lookout for weapons and threats around campus when it is supposed to be our safety I have never truly feared for my life like I did last year seeing my teachers who I look up to terrifying and Confused once they were notified of the situation that day has stuck with all of us I still get scared every time I hear the click of the loudspeaker I still remember how terrified I was thinking that one of my loved ones was hurt we need your help to not only get more security cameras at school but to ensure that students understand that they're real consequences for their actions thank you thank you Mom on speaker is Eric Ruger

[00:40:00]
just one minute once again speaking sir well first off I just want to say wow we have some really powerful students at West Mesa High School and I hope you heard their voices today they deserve a lot of credit I can't imagine doing what they did at their age I've got some words from students I'm just going to read him each time you see me flip a card as a new student I don't feel safe coming to school anymore there's always a thought in my head of will I make it through the school day wow some of these the way gun violence in my school most impacts me is not being able to focus on school work because I'm too worried about my safety I think stronger discipline and safety security measures will leave students or will prevent students from bringing guns to school something I would like Community leaders to do is to address this problem just to listen to us and take this seriously because nothing will change if we don't take it serious and put in the effort I would feel

[00:41:00]
play my own school if they actually took action and showed us they took action or having more security to be more aware and to be on the lookout Vision at 40 is terrible I feel we have we need more security we need to be more cautious of our surroundings and who we surround ourselves with it's terrible that multiple students and teachers have to come together in order to convince you that we are in danger as a school we need more surveillance who comes in and out of our school is of the utmost importance of your last statement very quickly thank you continuously make excuses yet they still want us to trust them how can they trust how can we trust them when the people we love our dying I had a very close friend died last year and it didn't and it can't happen again this issue needs to be dealt with as soon as possible there are absolutely no excuses

[00:42:00]
thank you I just want to thank all the speakers for coming tonight whether you're here for the issue with the gun violence tobacco cessation or even our early childhood approach I appreciate everyone taking time to come here I know it's difficult to be here public forum as we mentioned is the time for us to listen to you so we're not going to be able to respond back but just know that we have listened to you I appreciate all the speakers that we're here tonight and so we're going to go ahead and continue with our agenda sorry and our next item for discussion

[00:43:00]
and action is consideration for approval of revisions to student outcomes Focus goals 1 and 2 we had sent this one out so what I'll do first is ask for a motion to approve with the changes and then we'll have discussion as their emotion I will move to approve goal number one in goal number two with the Amendments have a secondary Jackson the reason the changes were brought forward was actually pointed out by an advisory committee member of the original language said something refer to Yazi Martinez settlement and there was no settlement and so they asked from the advisory committee that we

[00:44:00]
bring that back and place the language that you see in front of you so that we're just referring to the results of the Ozzie Martinez ruling and identifying those subgroups and then all I would ask again is that it would include all students because we're here to educate everybody and it should be the percentage of third grade students and I'd be happy if it was that because that's what APS is supposed to be doing all right any other discussion Barbara go ahead I'm sorry because I wasn't here for part of the discussion of the last meeting I just I do always feel compelled to point out that I've been involved in APS for 50 years 35 years is a teacher and now more recently as a board member and Advocate and I have not

[00:45:00]
been through a single year where we haven't looked at test scores set goals and had teachers work incredibly hard to fulfill those goals and in all those years we know that we have students that have not received the support that they need to be successful that it's easy to point a finger at teachers as they are not doing what they need to do when we know the impact of poverty poverty poverty in the conditions that many of our students face we know what happens when they don't see themselves in the curriculum when they don't have the language and support so I don't disagree with these goals but I think in the guard rails and then the other goals that we said if we don't think about the

[00:46:00]
missions that we haven't been able to address in the past we are not going to meet these goals and that's that's our task I mean that's what we put in the superintendent's lap but I just I think we really need to look at how do we enrich how do we give background knowledge how do we make sure that we address the opportunities that too many I think that's what the rest of our girls thank you any other discussion on these two goals on the revisions on the consideration for approval of the revisions to student outcomes goals one and two

[00:47:00]
yes Freddie Jackson yes Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes okay so our next item for discussion and action is consideration for approval of student outcomes focused guardrails this is also a discussion action and I believe on the guardrails we had that I'm trying to remember where we are so we have three that I believe that we had some agreement on the last time we were all together and we're considering two additional ones so that would bring us to to five so I see superintendent and doctors they would have coming to the table and I think let's pull this up does everyone have access to the to the guard rails doc on are you all looking at that as well superintendent and Dr Segundo okay

[00:48:00]
because there was some additional language that was proposed let's see what we're looking at potentials for guardrail number for and guardrail number 5 we just got worn down last time so we want to try to do is to to fish finish up here I'll start with a board member Dominguez cuz I know that you had offered up some some language here that you'd like for consideration which you mind going forward you know trying to Wrangle language language

[00:49:00]
I think collaboration with family students and staff is is a key idea and I think there's a way to I guess I worry about and when you're saying number one number one on page one of the proposed guard rails so Garfield

[00:50:00]
that's what you were asking for let me clarify so we we talked last time and where we were is that and let me read them so guardrail number one I think where we had some agreement and we left last meeting Garden rail number one was the superintendent will not allow the district to operate with an equitable in equitable distribution of school and or community-based wrap around and support systems guardrail number two was the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated inevitably and there's a couple of revisions that are being revised or recommended there when we left last meeting we were at that plain language is superintendent will not allow resources to be at allocated in equitably Cardwell number three was the superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not district and standards aligned challenging culturally and

[00:51:00]
responsive and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students and then where we were struggling was really with guardrails number four and five because we we still work we weren't clear there but it sounds like we still have some work on guardrail number two but I was I was hunting over to you because are you saying that you have still concerns with guardrail number one as well so again I'm looking at I'll jump to number 4 okay okay because I think that addresses one of my concerns so I would like to see something like the superintendent will not make major decisions without utilizing process that includes meaningful collaboration with the families and students and their students

[00:52:00]
Educators staff Community Key Community hold on I'm looking at my community leaders and I guess on the heels of what we just heard right during public forum collaboration has to has to enter into this we of course it's families and their students and Educators and stuff but I'm hearing that we need to collaborate with our community we need to use our resources to to better affect we have talent in our community we have people who can help with

[00:53:00]
restorative practices restorative justice because we sure don't have the security guards we don't have the workforce and so we have to be creative in some other capacity and I guess that's what I'm trying to get out here are you know the very students that we are targeting for an increase in proficiency are the students who are suffering the most with violence or threat of violence and unless we get that element in here yeah so I'm drawing from effective decision-making from the San Francisco website their guard rails so just to summarize are you are you feeling that that statement I don't know if it's for c4d you know looking at us the superintendent will not make major decisions

[00:54:00]
utilizing a process that includes meaningful collaboration with family students I heard you say add Educators or has staff in here staff and Key Community leaders who will be impacted by those decisions at the Inception adoption and review okay so so and then just to summarize here if it's state something like this you're feeling like this would also help us capture some of the issues that we heard in public forum because we're not going to have a real that's specifically around violence because it wouldn't come up in the community conversations okay all right but I am for the record at least Wayne in that I would hope that include those issues or addressing those concerns we just heard okay I'm going to

[00:55:00]
go to the other side of the Dyson on board member to Romero's with the language is that it's a bit longer and trying to see if it's possible we could simplify because I do think we do need to be collaborating and making sure we do have the voice we said it before a family students and staff at the table but make sure we could do it in a way that we can follow through that it's not just words on a paper because it sounds good and we want to you know come up with it but make sure it's something that we're going to be able to challenge ourselves and be held accountable you know throughout the entire process do you have a recommendation to shorten it

[00:56:00]
Community voice and engagement that was my suggestion just trying to make number for Dora but to make sure that they need that they had to listen for everything so that's why that's why I was trying to do with 4B is trying to make 4D where you know or are you on the no no okay it's just on the papers

[00:57:00]
will not make major decisions without utilizing a process that includes meaningful collaboration the only thing lacking there is is community well but I'm saying if we didn't say all of those things the superintendent will not make major decisions without utilizing a process that includes meaningful collaboration with those who will be impacted by decisions at the Inception adoption review I said that

[00:58:00]
is it implied that we're going to include all of those people I mean I remember Ashley saying to what we stopped writing he starts interpreting so we were addressing student family stuff Community voice and engagement like Community voice so I think that I mean that's why I kind of just take in the community voice and engagement play the only thing I didn't put in mine was staff probably but I think I put everybody else are you talking about 4G board member she's 40 I'm doing sign language

[00:59:00]
the administration suggestion got deleted accidentally when we kind of reformatted this so I just added it it's in bold and it's number four you added it okay the superintendent shall not discourage schools and District apartments from respectfully and collaboratively partnering with students families and communities in their students education

[01:00:00]
but it wasn't specific to just the superintendent shall or the district shall a lot of feedback really revolved around what happens at the school so we really were focused on the language we had if it's asking the shall not that made it tricky because we could come a little positive ways to put this but we didn't want to discourage the schools we want to encourage more participation with parents in their children's education more conversation with the local levels so that was what we had sort of focused on in our suggestion and I'm sorry it wasn't there did not focus on available funds for this particular girl again I think we need some level of we need to engage

[01:01:00]
and I'm not just talking local school Community I'm talking about City County State resources because and Human Resources who can help us with the problem with the SEL essentially our kids need to feel safe they're not going to work without without without collaborating more effectively with Community Partners so how do we insert that okay so we're going to keep bouncing around so I'm going to go to board member Gonzalez I am completely comfortable with and I also see superintendent and Elders concern around it reading like it's just the district or the superintendent that is rejecting

[01:02:00]
current engagement versus schools and school buildings so I don't know if it would help to add in all District Operations at the end of the sentence the superintendent shall not exclude or reject apparent legal guardian students and staff Community voice engagement in all District Operations but I do agree with board member Romero and motor go around the importance of short clear into the point and so I'm supportive of 4B with the addition of the end and all District Operations okay so I'm going to bounce back this way board member Peterson so do you think that the spirit whether it is written or not the spirit of collaboration has to be in here because that's how we have meaningful Partnerships and I'm wondering if there needs to be specific

[01:03:00]
reference to engage in some of the other entities that we know impact what's going on in our schools and I mean for an example I think we got at the early stages of the pandemic we got a sense of what we can achieve when there's real partnership between the city and the county the state and APS I mean we really it was a perfect example we don't have the resources to help families but the city did we have the resources to feed the community and we did you know the state provided incredible resources on the health fronts in everything from how do we really guarantee that we can

[01:04:00]
are able to implement restorative practices able to implement the things that will keep Kids Safe how do we expand CTE Workforce Solutions has has resources that we do not have at the district level and if we don't figure out the ways of developing these Partnerships all of so many of the things that we want to achieve aren't going to get achieved and so whether it's a separate Standalone guardrail or whether it is definitely integrated into one that talks about partnership with with Community for resources so if I may

[01:05:00]
I just want to ask for clarification so when you see Community voice and Community engagement at this are you seeing that it's not inclusive of like State resources County resources or city resources I think it can be if we're really clear that that's what it includes you know again when we start stop writing the superintendent starts implementing and so then it's the question of is it clear enough that we need to find better ways of collaborating with other community folks resources strengths and that might be I mean I'm looking at guardrail 5:00 I don't want to go there yet so I've got Ashley who's coaching me I don't know Ashley if you're able to come on was she able to connect cell cuz she might have some

[01:06:00]
it is his responsibility to Cascade that work through the district in his interim card rails so she's also reminding me is like it's not what the community said and I'm thinking you know needing to go back and always being I guess mindful of what the community asked us to do right because the community Was Not That explicit I think in terms of like every single little detail I think it's again it might be what we wish and what we want but you know was it Community voice and engagement is is what was most important I think what we heard from the community was the the most important part was the

[01:07:00]
current legal guardian student and Community voice I think stop voice was in there as well but that's the most important part so there you are actually do you want to you want to help us a little bit here so I came to a different room to get logged on and you said exactly what I was going to say so the the important thing here is that the board is creating a guard rail that focuses on what the community has voice as their values so in this specific the specific word that you're discussing right now you're calling it girl number four what is the value that needs to be protected that's a question to to the board what is the value that is being protected here voice and engagement with that or what is it I mean what I have to pull up my daughter

[01:08:00]
number five responses related to not leaving families slash Community Partners out of the educational environment your student support intervention services related to not providing wraparound services or not addressing Maslow's hierarchy of needs for students we need help on that so it does say that on number five and number six on the what should APS stop doing on the values was parent Community engagement and student voice and accountability which accountability is a little bit different so we don't have accountability per se but mostly around Community engagement and voice so okay so number six also

[01:09:00]
expressly addresses discipline issues chronic absenteeism academic accountability all responses related to parents and or student input and or accountability for their behavior so these two these two values that they're being referenced under this one is is very much that it is it's about a say in their child's education in other members of the community who are Partners in the community being welcomed into the education system as partners and that students also be considered Partners in their own education with their Educators on the flip side that also

[01:10:00]
the tools that they need to be able to hold students accountable to be able to hold parents accountable with with that voice with that with that agency comes accountability and that that's the really important part here is that it's a given a take it's not necessarily one or the other so that is up to the board you know the board has to interpret that I don't think that you're far off in the in the discussion you've had to this point okay I'm having to like open up too many documents here hang on a second let me get back to this one I know you guys have taught me to like go between documents really quickly so I forgot I'm sorry I didn't I didn't intentionally forget you

[01:11:00]
but I agree I like 4B I think it addresses the the actual issues that we are are being asked to address and I think it's more a little bit more specific and a little bit more clear than just number four with the amendment of in all District Operations the only change that I would make is I think we should use will statements instead of shall not statements and the reason being is if I remember one thing from law school it was that we don't use shell anymore because we've tried to write in the most plain way possible so I would write it as the superintendent will not exclude apparently legal Guardians student and Community engagement in all District Operations

[01:12:00]
like that part number the reason I had put will or shall not because different ones had different so I was like well which one is it okay this is just my question probably to Ashley and should we is it fine it won't take anything away from it or will add something good to it to add in all District Operations is that fine since we're talking about the superintendent and that's what he does so is it necessary to add that is it important to have that yes so this is actually a really great question I'm glad you asked it is up to the board it depends on what the board intends with their guard rail if the board intends through the road to have a hyper focus on what happens on campuses

[01:13:00]
can you should make it very specific to what happens on campuses the superintendent shall not allow on individual campuses or School communities if your intention is that it be focused District wide that is not that does not exclude individual campuses but it isn't specific to individual campuses so if the superintendent thinks that so if his interpretation is that that may include campuses that that may include District Operations that it may include you know Communications in any type of of any part of the districts that interacts with humans in the community that could that could be his interpretation period being more specific

[01:14:00]
is how you how you dictate the level of specificity that you want to include and Ashley I also understand that once we see the interim guard rails against this we could also see if it's if it's on target or it's not so it gets an opportunity to also sort of readjust it if we need to cuz that's where the interpretation will will come in so so just as a coaching question so if we adopt this without having the interim cards in there we kind of run that risk or we'd have to wait to at least say these are the ones we want and then say give us the interim guard rails for that and then we can finalize that is that kind of the the best approach because he can't he can't give us interims because we don't know what the garage sales are just yet and I'm glad you asked that as well because I'm kind of like no you're not

[01:15:00]
so that that's the exact point is that with your guard rails it's really really important to see the entrance first because you need to know how they're interpreted so that you can make sure that they're specific enough so you know if I were in your seat I would you know provide the guidance that this is the guardrail we want to go with and next time we come together or at a future date when you can when you provide the guard or the interims then we'll make the formal adoption but if that you know that is really your choice it's just my strong recommendation that you see that before you before you make any formal adoptions I think that would make a lot of sense because it will help us to see if we're on target superintendent looks like you want it to say something I was looking at your face we're just playing a little over here

[01:16:00]
but I do think we're fine with will we make you understand will better so we're good with that the word all concerns me in all District Operations again we make a lot of decisions there's a lot of things that happen across the district and when we talked about the district there's a oftentimes a context of when you say District you mean central office or even though it doesn't always at least in the culture of APs it's not always referring to the school so they might ask for some clarification I totally understand that just for the board to decide if they want to go with it which one they wanted to use so that's why I just I think we were settling on exclude that's when I like obviously that was first song

[01:17:00]
so what is so that leaves me to interpret but I would I would just lost you so anytime a Community member wants to have voice on any District decision cuz you put in all does that mean we are it just seems to me that that could become problematic just logistically I mean I mean every decision I know you don't mean that but um what about I just I mean I just wanted it to end it engagement that way it kind of left it to you all and not put in all District Operations but that was just what I wanted so I'm you're the ones that are going to have to do it so that we're also looking at I guess over five years

[01:18:00]
we've actually protected the right or not the right but the engagement of community and their voice in that I mean I do I'm going back to board member Gonzalez do you have a mulling it over a little bit differently I know I'm trying to think of something that would be a little bit more comprehensive but a little clearer maybe it's in major decisions but if you made it in school and District Operations it gives us some some leeway then so again I think the intent is that we do take I hear you collaborate collaborate listen to parents when it comes to their child's education listen to community members and it comes to they'd like to see and in the in the Schools District Operations

[01:19:00]
my interpretation of the community voice that came back because teacher staff support is its own is number seven its own entity is different though too because it's all so I mean I really do like

[01:20:00]
I'm not and I don't I mean for me personally I don't mind adding stuff to that part as well as the as part of the voice on that I was going to say it and staff is more all-encompassing it includes I think they're part of the Community Food Service I would strongly support changing engagement to collaboration because collaboration implies an actual level of decision-making that it means not only is their voice but there's really thinking about how do we come to a decision and I think voice is absolutely the starting point but

[01:21:00]
we asked them to be engaged in things that we cook up that we is as the district think about and say you should Aiden this I think collaboration implies a level of their decision-making there is I mean it's what community school counselors instructional councils try to do and so I need to come back cuz she was the one that was scoring is how did that get how was the wording on that is there a differentiation between engagement and collaboration so I don't it's really so yes and no so it really depends on what the board intense if the board intends

[01:22:00]
for collaboration to happen meaning actual decision-making to happen that that is something I would be interested in hearing a little more from the superintendent about because that could potentially so collaborations always going to be a good thing but elevating collaboration to or defining that to me having the authority to make decisions or having decision-making inhibits your ability to hold those who are doing the work in the district accountable for the outcomes that they're producing so you just you can move forward I just say move forward with caution I think what's important here though is collaboration implies

[01:23:00]
they get to voice their self-interest it's not dictated by I mean that's what community schools are all about so what if it said superintendent will not exclude apparent legal guardian student staffing Community voice collaboration and engagement I mean yeah you have to interpret voice collaboration and engagement that's a lot well I would drop engagement Community I would say engagement and collaboration I mean superintendent what do you think about collaboration I mean what are you thinking I'm a big fan of collaboration collaboration it's a word I get what we're talking

[01:24:00]
collaborations that aren't occurring we already do quite a bit we already have tremendous Partnerships with the city we also have already have tremendous Partnerships and you know especially one of these things that came up tonight the security you know tremendous collaboration I'm trying to solve that issue collaboration is fine with us engagement is well I don't know about you what I want I want I really appreciate your guys's attempts to keep these short and sweet I really thought about some of the language that might be too all encompassing or is it great situations where people can say we

[01:25:00]
so I'm not sure there's a huge difference in collaboration engagement I don't really get a nobody's run up into Pat me on the back and say don't do it okay so I think we can live either or with both I guess I would push for engagement and leaving it at that period they want to be heard they want to be listened to they want to be asked for their opinion they want to be engaged which is different from partnership and collaboration and some of these other Concepts which are also important but didn't rise up to the surface of being the top three four five in the community listening session I think the problem that I heard about and that I have experienced is this culture of no with an APS that it's hard to get information it's hard to communicate it's hard to get

[01:26:00]
that's put on the table so I I like collaboration too I think it is a good thing but I think if we're going to stick to what we heard as the values being expressed by the community it really is this parent Community engagement student voice voice and engagement and then just adding a member consultants in school and District Operations after engagement then yes I mean I like it like that cuz then we just keep making it longer and my point was to try to make it shorter board member Jackson and and to that point again when we look at the like these specific values that came back that we're trying to address with this guard rail it is only for the parent legal

[01:27:00]
staff can be addressed in its own guard rail because it is its own separate value statement that came back and so I I would prefer that it stay as the superintendent it's only legal guardian student and Community voice because again we have to respond to the values statements that came back to us and when they requested engagement and voice it was only surrounding parents student or parents students and community and we can address the staff boys and staff support in its own guard rail which I believe we have a guard real number five that is solely focused on staff so I would ask that staff be removed from guardrail for so that they can have their own their own section so I'll go down the desk

[01:28:00]
we do need to make sure it's represented represent what we're saying is represented based on what we've heard from our community and again to make that its own separate board member Peterson I will Reserve to see how deserve an opinion until we see how the conversation and goes board I mean I'm good leaving it you know taking it out and concentrating all of that on Garfield Gonzalez I agree with what's being said so far period

[01:29:00]
I have a suggestion was engaged okay so let's put a pin in it that's where we're leaning towards this 4B where we are somewhere there it's either going to have I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm in agreement that I think it needs to be without staff as well because I think it speaks to what our students and our families were asking for in the communities asking for let's put a pin in it right now we'll just kind of hold there and let's go to guardrail number five because it sounds like we're going to hold out for some different opinions because number five guard rail is going to be focused specifically on the thing on the piece for the listening session and that would be around teacher staff support so we would get a guard rail in there that would speak specifically to them

[01:30:00]
so I see you board member Peterson on are you going to make a suggestion on guardrail number 5 I actually have just a service clarification for guardrail for I think most people when they look at parent legal guardian it's cumbersome I'm wondering if there is a real reason for having it stated like that rather than saying family because if there's not a real reason for stating like that I think family is much more friendly not family legal guardian we just had a

[01:31:00]
current policy that we had lengthy discussion on adding legal guardian parent so that we had to that way apparent legal guardian and family and caregivers so I I mean I think if we're just for continuity throughout our policies and that would be why I would say leave it as parents legal guardian well then add caregiver if we got that in policy right because lots of times grandparents are not legal Guardians it's an issue it's something that we address all the time and he's going to family issues but that's the reality that our community has and all right so I mean I think I think sticky what the policy language would be appropriate so if we just put parent legal guardian and caregivers

[01:32:00]
students and Community voice engagement I think we could do that just make it consistent I agree with board member Jackson will just make it consistent with that because then I can always refer back to our policy on that too in terms of who we identify comma technically it's individuals with caregiver authorization yeah I know it's like we just made it longer so I mean parents legal Guardians I think we're kind of understanding except that you do have do you have you that are couch surfing they're sitting at a neighbor's house that doesn't have a butt that neighbor doesn't have legal guardian for that child anyway so they can't make any decisions so so longer won't be bad in this situation I think let's just go ahead and put it at the end so that way we just sort of Encompass all that let's put a pin on that and we'll add it as with our policy

[01:33:00]
and we're going to put a pin in this one so we can go to guardrail number 5 I'm trying to get us to a decent time tonight so hoping that we can finish up our five card rails so that we can get these to the district and they can get us some interims for our next next round whenever we do that so let's go to guardrail number five a proposed one for teacher and staff support is there a let me go to board member I'm going to go to board member Jackson is there one on this that resonated with you yes it's the one I wrote darn and I will say I always hate going first but no so 58 is the one I wrote the superintendent will not Implement new programs or procedures in school

[01:34:00]
without supplying appropriate professional development and essential material and human resources and I guess kind of the background on that is is just not only from what we heard that you know the supporting time expertise professional judgment and supporting our staff I hear I have been hearing throughout the district that a lot of times programs are procedures are implemented and you know principles or staff are said okay now go do it but there's no guidance and there's no development that goes along with that or resources aren't provided and it's just kind of just nebulous this is what you're supposed to do figure it out on your own so that's that's the reason behind 58 which I think is not talking board member Peterson so the way that we make

[01:35:00]
sure that 5A is accomplished is by going with 5B the superintendent will not withhold I don't know who wrote this I wasn't the author of it but I I think board member Jackson's Pretty successful tonight with not getting slaughtered the superintendent will not withhold professional development that supports collaborative teacher-led approaches to curriculum instructions and culturally responsive the grammar might need a little bit of touch up and just differentiate it to meet the academic needs of all students and I'm sure that this will receive some blows

[01:36:00]
because of the length penis but the way that we make a happen is to make sure that it's embedded in the life of the school and the profession no matter how wonderful it is no matter how what resources are provided if the professional development is not embedded in the life of the school it will not be successful okay so between the two I definitely prefer 58 and not because of brevity because I think appropriate professional development is what we're after it's a term of art high quality professional development I think the stuff that board member Peterson is talking about in terms of job in bed and curriculum professional development is I think when we add this other language around teacher-led approaches to curriculum and instruction

[01:37:00]
what we want the professional development to look like rather than what the research says it should look like which I think is appropriate or high quality professional development so I think in this instance less is definitely more and that we want appropriate or I would say high quality I'm fine with either of those professional development along with the material and human resources to support what's being asked to them the only thing that I was actually noodling over is the use of the word knew whether that's necessary or the superintendent will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without supplying appropriate professional development and essential material and Human Resources I'm not going to die on my sword on that one but I do think basic essential functions programs and procedures that are already being done in schools should also be appropriately resourced so I would propose 5A with removing the word new

[01:38:00]
Auntie Anne's changing it to high-quality professional development instead of appropriate that's what I think again because I think the word high quality professional development has been defined in the literature is certain things but I think appropriate gets it over after work number Dominguez very good I like that too I like removing the word new okay I would change so I like five bucks but we could shorten that the superintendent will not allow will not allow or will not withhold rather professional development that supports collaborative Educators to curriculum and instruction rooted in an excellent culturally responsive

[01:39:00]
curriculum is what I would suggest as a way to shorten it but if we added to 5/8 at the end we say the superintendent will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without supplying appropriate or did we change that high quality we don't know yet professional professional development and essential material in human resources in a collaborative manner with affected staff board member realtor going I like 5A and I have taken out new also and I think I like high quality

[01:40:00]
what I would add to that just to kind of go back to to staff voice I would maybe add that in there but I mean if if people wouldn't want to that would be fine as well if we said the superintendent will not Implement programs or proceed or procedures in schools without staff voice applying high-quality professional development and a central material and Human Resources so we get their voice when it comes to programs or procedures but I'm fine if everybody wants to leave that out going back down the diets here that board member Gonzalez made to 58 first number six out but I'm good to boot number six and between 5 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. know what no changes know with what board member control so

[01:41:00]
what this implies is that everything that happens in the school should be top down that only the sport apparently in conjunction with the superintendent know what works in a classroom that we have teachers who are experts in their field we have teachers who faced their students every single day and work to give them what they need and if we are unwilling to open up the opportunity for them to impact how they learn and how they practice with the sense that only we know what this research is that will be acceptable to them I think we do a real disservice to the practice that goes on in a school

[01:42:00]
and love teachers are you sure appreciate the work they do but we will make sure that what gives what gets designed for their development does not include them and I say that with no intentional disrespect for the leadership that sitting here because I think you are attuned to that I think you're paying attention to that it really and truly is not meant to be disrespectful to the work that the district leadership is doing but when we emit their access to voice for what professional development is included I think we send her very bad message to our staff so I heard that board member of that because I'm looking at teacher staff support and it says responses related to supporting teachers time

[01:43:00]
expertise or professional judgment so so it has the way that it's stating that I was just watching have you been a teacher I would want them to listen to me that's why I thought adding staff voice would be important okay but so Ashley I'm going to have you come on because I'm confused with your with your little coaching here I'm not sure that I agree with you so so when when you add on so what you have is a guard rail right now around professional development for teachers so it is very what you have so far I'm looking at 5:00 it's very specifically talking about appropriate professional development you know and so

[01:44:00]
superintendent has to provide that with the central material and Human Resources by just tagging on teacher voice at the front of that it kind of breaks it up into two separate so it's two separate values that are being protected is high quality professional development so making sure that teachers are resourced and supported in that what they're being asked to do and then there's also the value that protecting teacher Voice or encouraging Teacher voice so it's two separate guard rails I do think there's a way that you can State 5A in a way that does include teacher voice I just need a second to look at it and it may even be something as simple as saying you know informed by the people who will be delivering the people who will be receiving it or having

[01:45:00]
something about including the teacher like including that professional judgment by the actual professionals who are in the classroom including them in the decision of what is provided you're going to get into some sticky some sticky area going into that because you didn't get into the question of where to draw the line so if you want to have a if you want to have a guard rail specific to professional development resources that are provided in the classroom you just have to you need to be very specific about what that all should tell okay so you go ahead superintendent looks like you want to say something just a couple of things were listening to this one I think it's important when we look at 5 a I assume we talk about staff or not just to

[01:46:00]
for example we're doing a lot of training on our new system for putting work orders so you know we needed to get feedback from secretaries and assistant principals around what worked for them as we looked at new systems the other thing we're looking at is and finances bringing this up for specifically the 5A but it would be for both just that there be no one budgeted programs or budgets stay with them budgets because sometimes people will come forward with requests for professional development relating to a program that might say for example say involve travel that we've had to deny because it's just too much so when this says I won't block you have some sort of budgetary restriction because it has to stay within the budget that they've got to operate with and we've just had that come up recently with a couple of chips we had to limit

[01:47:00]
I'm going to read and see if that works the superintendent will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without staff boy staff boys high quality professional development and essential material in human resources that seems to me that that gets the staff voice to the superintendent's Point not just teachers but stopped across the board is being essential actors in this and that has to be a part of what happens does that I'm sorry I got lost so it's a programs are procedures in schools without staff boys comma high quality professional development and essential material in human resources did you say Supply

[01:48:00]
doesn't that get out dot Wilson no comma then right in schools could you read that again please the superintendent will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without staff voice comma high quality professional development comma and essential material in human resources of the issues around the conversation that the superintendent is bringing because he's kind of like he's giving us just a caution like if it's not within budget like how do we deal with that you're giving them the opportunity for voice but that doesn't necessarily mean everything

[01:49:00]
can I have discussions you have conversations the answers and always yes but it means you talked so could it be staff partnership instead I'm just saying stop voice is fine I have no issue with that I think from the financial people they were just sort of pointing out they're concerned that people might say well I didn't have enough professional development so therefore he's violating the guardrail I need to go to you know Bismarck South Dakota because that's where I want to go for this training on literacy and that was funny and we have to say no and so they come dancing when you put the interims in so when when you come up with interims around this and we come back we can see if it's being interpreted

[01:50:00]
yeah cuz that might be a way to sort of put what the what the interim guardrails are in that in terms of making that happen or how it would work I mean I'm thinking what is appropriate professional or high-quality professional development I mean because it's the superintendent and then we're not going to implement something if we don't have the budget to buy the program actually I think it's a it's well thought out and well intended it's going to have some ramifications but I think they may be positive ramifications in the long run so I am I guess I

[01:51:00]
I know issue with the removal of the word new other than we're not going to go back and review old programs or old decisions to say well at that time you didn't have it so because there is part of it and I'll mention this in the Strategic Plan update later as we're looking at things we've got going how do we go back and we resource or retrain people or can extend training so I just want to make sure that that's what you mean by removing new well so I think Implement like Implement is the start right so we're saying you will not Implement you will not begin from this point forward I mean that's how I probably by having Implement knew it was almost redundant so Implement when you start something from this point forward it will be with staff boys high quality professional development and essential material and human

[01:52:00]
okay all right so I think somebody else who's typing away I love it because we can see we can see it live it's it's the looks like I'm doing it I know it's really cool I know good job good job superintendent all right okay so here's where we are I think I hear kind of a majority I don't know we have consensus but I think we have a majority at least of us

[01:53:00]
comfortable with this 5A with staff voice listed in there I'm looking I'm not sure that still not sure I don't know Barbara and and board member Peterson and Dominguez are still on the fence but let's try this and see what happens with interims see how they come in because what we've got to do here is just kind of draft up at least five guard rails we don't want to have more than five because it's too many so if we go with five we start with this we get some interim guard rails in there to see how they're being interpreted to see if they're you know on target so what we need to do now I'm going to put a pin in this one for a little bit and go back up to was it number two okay yeah

[01:54:00]
so I I I want to just kind of readdress this one cuz I wasn't totally settled with with number two cuz I think that as I was not sleeping on this that it's very broad that it's so bright it doesn't have any real meaning and that it lacks clear Direction and what made me think of that is when we asked superintendent Elder about how he viewed inevitably and he said well you can view it one way and you can view it another way and there can be seven different interpretations so and there was a thing that was said to me that really meant a lot and it was clear as kind and I don't know that this is clear I don't know that this gives very specific direction to what we are asking of the superintendent because it can be interpreted several different ways and so

[01:55:00]
I submitted a second revision because I'm hoping that with a revision it can at least be clear as to at least what what my intent was for addressing resources and that's to a the superintendent will not allocate resources without first addressing student needs at all schools that was what I was hoping would because this is the one that regards Equitable access so I think that by having language that's more specific it's clearer to what is actually being asked of the values which is equal distribution of resources that it responses related to providing access to resources or programs no matter what zip

[01:56:00]
economic status or ability and so I guess I I would like to potentially read address number two if the board is not comfortable reading number two then I would not like to vote on this guardrail until I know how the superintendent is going to address it in the interims well I do want to I do want to state that we're not going to be voting on The guardrails Tonight all we're doing is we're finalizing them so that they can come up with some interims and then we can see how that fits and see how they got interpreted if there's need for clarity or things that you know we need to add in there I'm going to respectfully disagree because I I do like the way that it stated because I felt like it did capture the value around

[01:57:00]
the issue of like how resources are distributed so I mean so we could we could just land there and see what the interims look like and how it gets interpreted but I'm is there any other discussion on that I mean I I just agree with I agree with membership that I think what she's trying to do with that to a is making sure that you're addressing all students needs so that we're putting that in there is that correct that you want to make sure that it's like all kids get the resources that they need so if you have to have fun to get to class at 1 and you have to find something else at another that it's done fairly so I I understand I understand that and so what I was trying to do with one of the guard rails

[01:58:00]
and it didn't it wasn't specific to to this one is that I had written the superintendent will not neglect the intellectual academic physical social and emotional development of all students but it didn't include the resources in there so that you know I mean I was just trying to do what you were trying to do to I was doing it in a different way and kind of make it like all encompassing of everything I mean I I like addressing all students need because no matter where they are they need resources to serve them so I mean I like it and what I was trying to do I mean there's just a way to I think write this in a way and I don't know if there's a way to try to I'm just not good at figuring it out on the Fly though so maybe we need to

[01:59:00]
at this point or just let them put our interim guardrails as we can see how they get interpreted because then we have this ability to come back and refine and see where we are because I think right now we're just sort of we're kind of guessing how the interim guard rails might come back I would be okay with that so long as superintendent Elder doctor I'm looking at you I hope that you know what my intent is and I hope that that shows up in one of the interim guard rails because I am I just think in equitably is a very broad subjective term and I'm concerned that it doesn't give you clear Direction and when we stop writing you stop whatever it is actually you start writing you start interpreting right I just

[02:00:00]
make sure that it is interpreted so that all of our students needs are met when I made the comment two weeks ago I meant it I do think that each of you brings a different definition of inequity to the table and it's going to be and I understand interim guard rails and this one we we've been we talked about this quite a bit and and we're like well what is that look like trying to develop is going to be interesting we haven't really decided this yet you know our initial suggestion had something to do with making sure that there was a line fishing at each school which I think is what you're trying to get to the schools have you know fishing operations I'm going to tell you that some of the what for example in the community supports remember they only provide those in schools that have higher

[02:01:00]
so theoretically you've already established some inequities it's not equal it's it's Equitable right so that's why I get nervous when we leave again with that term and then leaving it completely open but we can we can play with it and bring it back to you and and say okay here's what we suggesting my feeling is you may want to rework it at that time but we'll see cuz you're pretty smart people behind me and they're pretty capable so we'll see what they come up with but I don't have any problem with it clarifies for me what you're intent is I think I need from all of you know as well we'll try but I agree it's very broad I mean is there a way that we could like in if we could what I was trying to do is look at all of these and try to combine combine them so if we have guardrail

[02:02:00]
quad rail one and we're talking about community-based wraparound that isn't everywhere it's not at every school and support systems but there are support systems at every school so if we would just say the superintendent will not allow I mean how I had written it as a superintendent will not allow funds resources services and support systems to be allocated on fairly or inevitably but I get the inequity and then we could come up if we use put all put all of this into guardrail one that we could try to focus on guardrails to about addressing student needs and maybe we can figure out how to write that just a thought I think if we start listening out all of the things that sort of starts to pigeonhole something so I mean it's just

[02:03:00]
I think to operate implies to me it implies all of those things and implies Staffing it implies budget it implies the resources that you need to do that because you need them all yeah I don't know I mean I don't know so I guess I kind of feel so I think it's fine because that the way I interpret that IT addresses those needs right the the wrap around needs the the title one needs kind of so then the second guard rail addresses the all I think that I'm trying to get to the

[02:04:00]
where where do we include all of the students because guardrail one address is kind of like in my correct me if I'm wrong the Yazi Martinez the ones that we've addressed in the first goals right that those are the ones that need to wrap that need the wraparound services and the support systems and all of that so where do we address the all where do we address the other 30% and that's what I was kind of hoping guardrail to would do was addressed the the everyone doesn't support systems apply to all well I think I mean just because it's next to Community Based I agree that that services will support systems is only addressing those that need the support is all students not El Dorado students right

[02:05:00]
let's just take their circumstance they needed a wellness room they're not yet I mean somewhere and and they they have they needed that support system they got it so what I'm suggesting is and I could just have school and or community-based wrap around services and support systems that applies to everybody additional resources so those kids don't come up short I think though so just again when we look at it into the conversation the inequitable distribution of school Under community base wrap around it's going to be an equitable because it's designed that way so I'm not allowed to I don't know what that means if I'm not

[02:06:00]
not allowed to accept those when we talked about not allowed resources to be allocated inevitably I get nervous because I think you all will have to find an equitably probably differently than other people and I think even across the group you will Define it differently there's going to be built in inequities because some schools are going to receive money that other schools will not just that's how it works that's how the system is designed to work so it's not APS that's state federal funding so I understand what we're saying I found this conversation I know what remember Jackson's concern is just saying so the superintendent when you're talking about inequitable why wouldn't we just

[02:07:00]
say the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without needed community-based wraparound and support systems and then you're not using an equitable you're just saying needed I don't know I'm trying to figure out but I think in terms of trying to think back to what the community was saying to is that being in equity and that that we do have that concern that somehow we need to elevate keep that value you know that is one of the things that the districts need to stop doing because we created some inequity and we want to stop that so I hear that I think when I was thinking about guard real number two

[02:08:00]
I remember seeing from another District where the superintendent will allow like students to to to to to like not progress or to lose progression something because that because you know something that was related I don't know how it was stated I'd have to I have to go back and research but there was one that was around where it captures what I think what you're trying to say is that we're not going to allow students to start failing so you know because we're we're all going to pay attention to the fact that as we're moving resources and we're doing things that we're still paying attention to make sure that those students don't backslide or that they don't that they're not they're not succeeding so I'm trying to for that idea was in guardrails that were added on January 17th that the superintendent will not allow the district to operate with all students having access to sufficient resources to ensure Prof

[02:09:00]
we got into the discussion between the wraparound services and proficiency rates and at some point proficiency rates dropped off and I remember the conversation I don't remember the reason it was getting late but I I know what you're saying here again the concept is that we don't allow schools to operate in such a way that kids began to fall off that they don't have the resources they need to be successful I don't think that's anyone's attention if you leave it as it is we will bring back some interim guard rails and I kind of have a feeling that's when we'll get into maybe we need to reword it a little bit but maybe it'll be more specific to how you want to reward it at that time but I do think board member Jackson I believe we understand where you're coming from and as for the rest of the board I think I understand as well because I think the concept of an equity in different parts of town is going to be defined differently

[02:10:00]
okay and we need to address the achievement Gap in different areas I totally get that but let's not let's make sure that that the ones that create new ones yes exactly exactly exactly okay all right go ahead just a bit of wordsmithing for guardrail one it's basically what board member Miller to say the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without without without equitable distribution of school and Community Based wrap around support systems based on need or it could even take out totally inequity we understand what it is so it just says Facebook

[02:11:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:12:00]
distribution of resources and I think keeping an equity as a concept is important I would point to the Columbus City Schools guard rails as you're looking to develop your interims because they are real number three is a line resources equitably but they're interims for example start with Columbus City Schools will develop a multi-dimensional measure of student need to inform an equitable budgeting process that is quite a line to the student budgeting process that the finance offices already related to or is already working on and some other measures of need so I think there's ways to

[02:13:00]
capture this concept around need and necessary resources without losing the terminology or the concept of inequity which is important because I was again the number one thing that we heard OK Google I think if we put the affirmative the affirmative word is equity and so I think that if we leave the furniture putting the negative in the other spot just

[02:14:00]
makes makes it read better without equitable distribution of school and community-based wrap around and we know it's just like differentiating instruction it's giving students that they need so I'm just going to jump in go ahead real quick because here's what I'm saying like the more we're focusing on like specific verbiage we're starting to add our own definitions and we're going away from what came back from the community like a lot of these are it's like we're we have some solid statements here and some solid guard rails and we're just we're tweaking it away sometimes where it meets our need vs what the community wanted just my observation from the corner I just I mean I know it's like we're creating like

[02:15:00]
so let's let's just go with guardrail number one what do we add something necessary now okay we took it out so we're just going to let's leave guard rail number one let's leave guardrail number two let's go with guardrail number three that the superintendent will not allow curriculum instruction that is not District in standards a line challenging culturally all that I think we all had agreement on that we'll go with the proposed guardrail

[02:16:00]
number four which I've lost so let's see superintendent will not exclude parent legal guardian something caregivers students and Community voice engagement correct and we'll go with guardrail number 5 I mean didn't we did we get rid of in school and District Operations for 4B I thought we were just going to go with four beat right period voice engagement in school and District Operations will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without staff boys

[02:17:00]
high quality professional development essential material and Human Resources Central materials probably and Human Resources when I wrote that I actually meant essential to be the modifier for both material and Human Resources so we need to take the comma out from behind material essential material and Human Resources then she'll modifies material and humans okay on five five that we could start with and then we'll come with some interim guard rails and their see how they're being interpreted and then we can adopt them and finalize this piece of work on this side so where we are is we've

[02:18:00]
what are goals identified for sure we just made the revisions to 1 and 2 but we have three and four were fine on the goals we still need interim goals so that we could look at those as well which will be the next piece that we need to do and with the guard rails once we get the interim guardrails then we're going to be adopting our guard rails can't adopt them just yet because we need to see those pieces together just a question are we going with the guardrail too with member Jackson's and then they were going to or we are going to leave it how it was I believe we're going to leave it how it is superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably and we're going to go because board member Jackson has clearly stated and we're going to see how that comes with the interims and see how that supports all students

[02:19:00]
okay Ashley do you want to pipe in here where we are at this point is that a good stopping point for us it is very good stopping point and I think that you are all on the right track and with the plan that you have to see your entrance and then adopt and not adopt anything until you see them okay so go ahead since we were instructed not to adopt goals without saying interims interim guard rails and we're trying to do this to teaching plan at the same time plus run the district we are probably looking at about two to three weeks for everything to get to get put together because we all have a lot of homework on the Strategic plan that we've got going on at the same time so I've got Dr Bowman's team is working on interim goals related to

[02:20:00]
play the academic performance goals and looking to get into the actual numbers for the AP dual credit so forth and then we have a doctor gutierrez's team is working on which two were going to use for the SEL goal and that will have to find the work there so we should have would you like we're working on it is rapidly as we can do you feel comfortable bringing that to the first regular board meeting then on March 1st at 4:00 with all this

[02:21:00]
so that gives us some time because we have I know that there's some coaching with Ashley coming in to working with the team because I believe that's going to happen next week yeah or week after so that will give us time to make sure that it's really refined we've got those pieces in and we can start focusing on as a board on the next piece of us around our self evaluation and all so the monitoring pieces in the schedule of how we'll get that done so there's a lot of pieces that are going on in Tandem and I think I think we're on a really good schedule because all of these are going to also be effective next school year so we're we're in

[02:22:00]
we're setting this all up and we're getting the path ready to go forward but I like that we've already done with the goals that we have and and I will say superintendent I really appreciate that you have done a lot of communication around this work or what's happening you've shared with your staff of where we are because it's already starting to set that the path in terms of the expectations especially around all the goal conversation in terms of where we are so I think we're I think we're really good shape on in that regard I know and speaking with Ashley she is she she gives us a lot of Applause on the backend saying that you know we are we have made incredible strides in a short period of time in the work that we've done so I'm feeling pretty confident there and I don't know Ashley if you wanted to pipe in on anything else on that yeah so just just that you you all have made a tremendous amount of progress in a very short amount of time so please don't lose the side of that and

[02:23:00]
I'm really excited to be with you all next week in person in real life to see your faces and hug your neck so good job today so I guess my only concern is that on this we had consideration for approval of focus guard rails and we're not going to do that so it was a discussion action but we're not going to be a proving these because I think what we want to do is Doom in tandem so I think that action that we can go ahead the action we will take us to table but sorry before you make that motion and I would like to kind of set an action item for for this process and I would like to request that March 1st we see interim goals and insurance that's four weeks this work has already started I'm assuming and so four weeks

[02:24:00]
I would assume would be enough that we could at least start to see some interim goals and guardrails by March 1st don't think that's a problem I just like I said it's not the only thing that we're working on in conjunction with this type of work so I get it but I've learned that unless we set a date and unless we say that something has to happen thanks kind of get pushed off a lot and so I would like to clearly State for the record March 1st is when I would like to see I think that's would you like to make a motion why thank you I would like to move that we table agenda item 5c no 5B consideration for approval of student outcomes focused Garden Hills have a second this is Crystal second can I have a roll call on that please give me another one

[02:25:00]
is a report on the Strategic plan as it aligns to the student outcomes this discussion superintendent elders just going to give us an update on where we are right it's a very brief so since my last update on January 18th the number of activities have been completed within the Strategic plan so as I shared before the tune created a scope and sequence for the strategic planning process that aligns with the boards goals and guardrails work on the 18th and we would one codify a draft set up priorities as an internal team responsive to the boards goals Garden the organizational analysis that has been completed so those priorities are cleared in a culture of high expectations and accountability to achieve academic success for all students

[02:26:00]
rigorous instruction supporting leaders and teachers to provide students with rigorous culturally sustaining grade level instruction that leverages high-quality instructional materials and continually responds to students progress engage students cultivating safe schools and classrooms to keep all students engaged in their learning by ensuring they each have access to robust academic and social emotional learning opportunities that meet individual needs and finally responsive and coordinated systems established clear District systems for managing resources and communicating and supporting schools and families in a way that authentically responds to students needs secondly we said we would convenient advisory committee made up of teachers principals family members and Community leaders provide feedback on key elements of strategic plan with the first element on January 24th and provided a great deal of feedback and useful

[02:27:00]
what's the language change came for tonight's goals one and two was from The Advisory Group they will meet again on February 15th which is going to have a little bit of a conflict with the board meeting that night so but I think the only person that's really directly impacted is me so and then finally we are identifying and sequencing multi-year initiatives aligned to the Strategic priorities by the end of February we are completing this work over the coming weeks and as a matter of fact I'll take this opportunity to remind the cabinet that they have homework due tomorrow and I notice many blank forms as I completed mine today so there is some work around those those priorities over the next five years

[02:28:00]
so that's the work we're engaged in now and we hope to have that completed by the end of February along with the work around the goal interim goals and guardrails great I need discussion any questions go ahead and remember Jackson look like you're about to ask a question so I'm wondering if the Board of Education if we're going to be able to see the diagnostic report okay and have a present to you on February 15th with and provide you a copy of the report and so as you're moving forward with the Strategic priorities with the plan can you just speak a little bit to how that is happening when the goals in the interim well the goals have been set up at the interim goals have been set yet how are you working today as I mentioned before part of the Strategic plan is starting to

[02:29:00]
work on those interim goals and guardrails so what I originally had asked what would some of those interim goals be in quite frankly I intended that time was that many of them gold revolve around the completion of the Strategic plan at least in this window right but we're going to moving forward we'll have to have the goals and God knows that you requested around on these so at the time I didn't have this stuff so that was sort of what we're thinking now we're making adjustments based on the long-term prognosis is adjusting to the work that's being done around student outcome Focus governance and trying to lead us through the process and making sure that I'm so that's part of what we're receiving in terms of our work with them he'll be helpful to have that report on the 15th just to hear from him

[02:30:00]
play discussion questions I just want to say I know you guys are working and and running the district district and I appreciate all that you're doing I know you're working long hours but thank you I just have a really quick and superintendent so I know this is an advisory committee so how how much will their inputs be taken like into consideration like is it where you going to really listen to them or is it going to be like a lot of know I just asking just like some advice you get the advice and then you do what you want I mean I've been on committees like they had some really interesting advice and so I know it made some adjustments in our priorities and brought those to us and said what do you think about this what do you think about that and so that's still an ongoing that was what they were presented

[02:31:00]
that's a really good point and none of us got thank you for catching that and so we made the adjustment tonight so we're listening and we are making adjustments based on what they're giving us there was a productive meeting that tune does a good job at the facilitation it's a large group they do a lot of small breakouts they do a lot of moving people around so people actually get a chance to actually talk and not just be talked at okay I don't say much at all so that really gets me a chance I wish you a lot of sleep after March 1st anyways thank you

[02:32:00]
I just want to say also thank you to the staff I know and superintendent I know how hard you are doing this as well during the session because we've also got a 60-day session it's a little crazy over there and there's a lot of activity going on around education and I really appreciate just how much you know it's being done to also pay attention to that and keep up with what's happening in the session because it's also going to impact usually with you know the bills that are being proposed around just extending time day whatever that's going to mean changes in graduation credits does definitely require us to be here to the ground not to mention just changes in healthcare premiums and what's being proposed there as well so I appreciate the work all right so now this next one is going to be pretty quick and then I think after this will because we're going to be going into executive so we could take a break them but the next item is cons

[02:33:00]
operation for approval of the process of the timeline for the 2023 superintendent summative evaluation and so like on top of all this we also have to evaluate the superintendent and so had a conversation about that looked at our contract in the way that it's set up it is just really wonky so got some clarification from legal to help us with this piece because we the way that it was set up and had a conversation with the executive committee we came up with the timeline that we're proposing and so submitted that for you all to review but essentially we would start on February the 27th and we've got a series of actions that will take us through but it will get us to actually getting his contract ready for the

[02:34:00]
next school year with an in time and meeting the pieces that we need to do on that was there any questions about the proposed timeline have any question about the timeline I think it looks fine it's reasonable I am wondering for the evaluation form itself that we're supposed to be respond to online I'm wondering what what that form is going to be so we're still going to continue to use the same rubric that we started out with so it's going to be the same rubric but Joanna is Miss King is helping us coming up with a format on the way that you want to go ahead and describe a little bit about what you've explored on how we will be doing it sure Madam president of the board actually what we had talked about probably won't work but we are working on a fairly straightforward survey that you all have

[02:35:00]
on a scale of one to five but also they'll be some room for comments so we're working on that now and so what it would be is just what we've done in the past where we do it individually it all goes this route to miss King and she will summarize that and put that together for us and that's how we'll look at it as a as a full summary but you will each of us will have that we'll start out first with ourselves the superintendent is going to do a start out with the presentation to us we get to hear his review where he feels like he's been through this then we go back and we'll start the evaluation process with the with the with the rubric and with the survey that we have and we'll have a discussion following that board member consults yeah so my question was can you help me understand the difference between March 15th and March 29th so

[02:36:00]
15 be convenient executive session is the difference that the superintendent is not in the 15th and that he is in the 29th right let me see hang out so I got the board meets with the superintendent yes so on the 15th is when we meet as a board without him without him and then there's okay just want to clarify you and I know that they're needed to be a man and amendment to superintendent Elders contract in order to extend this timeline has that Amendment been drafted and signed so it was in agreement that he agreed to the extension of that time line in writing yes so it should have been as part of our packet for us to review

[02:37:00]
it has been signed by the board president and by the superintendent we can get a copy to you it doesn't need to be approved by the board or is it solely the president's signature that qualifies as the agreement Madam president the short answer is you have delegated to the superintendent and to not to the superintendent to the board president to sign on your behalf the contract and therefore to the extent there is a change in date from March 1st and I understand I drafted it

[02:38:00]
and I understand it has been presented to the board president and the superintendent and they have agreed to the wording I think they may have even signed it subject to bringing this all to your attention it is not effective until after they both sign off but but it is done so we could let me see here so what we could do is we have to have a motion on the the evaluation timeline one and if it you know if it pleases the board and if it would make it more comfortable for you is to say that you approve for me to go ahead and you know to extend that time line that would be fine too

[02:39:00]
I think it would just make me feel more comfortable unless I mean I know that the language says that we've delegated to the president but it would it be redundant or would it just be Madam president would remember Jackson the reason the board president wanted to bring this timeline to you is to make sure you're comfortable and if you are we thought that would flow but what you suggest is also possible which is while approving the timeline which actually would be moving that date from March 1st signature thank you but do we have a motion authorized the president to sign the extension of the contract from March
