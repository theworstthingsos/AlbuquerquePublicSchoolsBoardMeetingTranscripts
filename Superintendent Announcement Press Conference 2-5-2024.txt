==================================================

[00:00:00]
all right good morning I am Danielle Gonzales the president of Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education I would like to begin by introducing my fellow board members here with me this morning we have board member Josefina Dominguez board member Ronaldo at home Oriental board member Crystal Tapia Romero and board member Courtney Jackson and I am a specialty pleased to introduce for the very first time superintendent select Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey it has been quite a journey to get to this moment and I'm really excited that we're done I also want to say that this is not a decision that any of us or the full additional board members who are not able to be here for the press conference today this is not a decision that any of us took lightly in fact the school board has only three

[00:01:00]
responsibilities approving The District budget setting policy for the district and hiring the superintendent which we believe is the most consequential decision we're making this year so we took it very seriously because we know how much these decisions matter not just for us not just for our community but most importantly for our students they are critically important because we know that they depend on Albuquerque Public Schools for so much this was a thorough and a deliberate process and in this we wanted to make sure that we were getting it right because we recognize that there are some things that the school district has not gotten right for all kids we know that APS hasn't always provided the very patient for all students especially those who have been historically underserved this board knows that we need to improve student outcomes and we also know that student outcomes don't change until adult behaviors change including and especially

[00:02:00]
in a moment you will hear from our next superintendent but first I'd like to drag it on a little longer by talking about the process that got us to where we are today the aps Board of Education began the Nationwide search for new superintendent last October we asked for your help and thousands of you answered the call many families staff and community members and students also attended public forums at the end of last year more than 7,000 people weighed in on an online survey nearly 500 people attended a marathon day of public forums last week where you had the opportunity to meet our finalists and to weigh in on them additionally last week's forums got over 3,000 views on YouTube stemming from that public forum we received written comments from over 450 people during that for him which were then shared with all of the board members

[00:03:00]
so thank you for all of that feedback through all of these interactions you the public were asked to tell us the qualities experience and expectations you have for the next superintendent our choice is a reflection of what you told us and we heard over and over again that our next superintendent should be someone who believes all students can learn to succeed wants to improve student outcomes and who knows how to do it you wanted someone who understands values and respects Albuquerque and New Mexico's unique culture and assets you told us you want someone committed to equity someone willing to help APS address the Martinez Yazzie settlement someone who listens to and respects families students Educators and Community someone who can hit the ground running with the experience

[00:04:00]
passion and mindset to implement the district's new strategic plan emerging stronger you told us you want someone ready to make real change that person is Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey if you attended or viewed any of our public forums and her Dr Blakey talked so passionately about our students and public education you know why we selected her as the next superintendent if you have worked with Dr Blakey over the past two decades in APS or if you or your children were in her classes or schools you know how much she cares how Innovative she can be and how persistent she is you know Eddie she is to make changes to benefit our students and staff will we would be remiss to not think the 23 other educational leaders who applied for this position each candidate's Challenge and expertise made this selection difficult are extraordinary

[00:05:00]
School of applicants is evidence of the success of the process and we had to extremely qualified finalists we appreciate Dr Thomas ahart who travelled to Albuquerque as a finalist to let the board and the rest of the community get to know him and we wish him the best in his future endeavours the search for a superintendent is over it led us to the right person for the job and we can't wait to get to work so now it is my honor to hand it over to you hand it over to you and introduce the incoming APS superintendent Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey who is currently the chief operations officer of APs previously served as an associate superintendent in APS and an assistant superintendent in Santa Fe Public Schools and is poised to take APS to the next level congratulations Dr Blakey a leader who will make all decisions in the best interests of all of our students in Spanish

[00:06:00]
thank you for the present Gonzales and thank you all members of the board I am humbled to be standing before you this morning but it's not like I haven't stood before you many times before you know me as an APS teacher principal Charter School founder associate superintendent and chief operations officer I can't count how many times that I've talked to the media to the public about working to improve Albuquerque Public Schools but this time I'm talking to you as our next superintendent and wow what an honor thank you to the board of education for putting your trust in me and to all of you who came out during public forums and throughout the search process to support me and also express your concerns I hear you and I want you to know that I have a plan I shared with the board

[00:07:00]
need a plan that I will Implement as soon as I take him as the superintendent I won't go over the details now but I know what I'm going to do in the first few days weeks and months on the job for example I plan to assess the strengths and weakness of the District academic programs and evaluate the district's Current financial position and strengthen the superintendent board relationship as well as relationships with Community Partners administrators teachers and are support staff but most importantly I will do everything in my power to improve our student outcomes there's so much work to do what I listed now only touches the surface let me tell you I already have my sleeves rolled up as Nelson Mandela once said there can be no Keener revelation of a society Soul then in which it treats his children and I know our community and the dedication that we have to our children

[00:08:00]
Albuquerque let's be an example to the rest of the world so yes president Gonzalez I am ready to get to work before I open up to questions I do want to share a little bit about next steps process and timing in the coming months Dr Blakey will work closely with the current APS superintendent Scott Helder to better understand the district's intricacies responsibilities challenges and successes and both leaders are committed to ensuring a seamless and smooth transition so thank you Scott Dr Blakey will officially take over superintendent Scott Elders duties on July 1st I also want to address the superintendent salary cuz I think that's probably a point of interest when we initiated the search for a new superintendent we reviewed salaries for superintendents of large school districts like ours and our incoming superintendent salary is on par with that of similar districts

[00:09:00]
the new contract will be provided to the media and the incoming superintendent signed a two-year contract with a 295,000 a year salary so we will now open up the floor to your questions we have one in the back thank you and I think the main message is that we're going to do great things together I take my role very seriously and I know that the community trust me and with that trust comes a lot of responsibility so I want the teachers and the children to know that they're in good hands with APS and with my leadership it's a little surreal that I'm feeling very proud you know I just see myself as a student that grew up in Albuquerque

[00:10:00]
can I think my biggest humility is just knowing that I have a commitment to our community and to our children and honestly I hope to serve as a role model and that there are girls at Van Buren middle school right now looking up thinking that they can accomplish whatever they work for and that we set the stage for them to be prepared for that and so right now I feel very humbled and I also have a big sense of responsibility on my shoulders but most importantly I hope to serve as a role model for our community of what what we can do together think the biggest thing is to continue the road that we have worked so hard on over the past year the boards commitment to the goals and guardrails that you see surrounding this room and

[00:11:00]
commitment to make sure that we implement the Strategic plan so I really do believe that the foundation of the work is set forward for us and that we have a committed team with the superintendent and the board and the administration to get things moving with the road map that we have in front of us so love the 90-day plan is to get momentum behind the emerging stronger it's a little bit of the superintendent's role particularly in making sure that the foundation is set and that I've looked at all of the duplication in the district for example to make sure that we're set up for Success because our staff takes the responsibility to implement the Strategic plan very seriously but as the leader I need to make sure that the foundation and the conditions in order to do that work is set for success for staff

[00:12:00]
he's going to see a lot of me so I'm sure he's really excited about it but superintendent Elder and I have had a working relationship over the past few years and I know that he has a lot of information that he needs to share with me and I know that we work really well together as far as making sure there's a smooth transition and he'll probably get really sick of me asking questions of him I think my biggest message is that I believe in you and our communities going to do great things and you can do great things and I want our children and my Hispanic brothers and sisters to know that we're going to accomplish things together that we never saw possible and we have a great belief in what we can do together

[00:13:00]
so I don't know that there's any sort of routine given that all of us are new board members of the first time we've hired a superintendent so there is no precedent for this board I would say the internal or external wasn't one of the criteria by which we judged our candidates we judged our candidates by which the criteria that I shared do they believe students can learn they have evidence of improving student outcomes are they committed to community engagement are they standing of the Aussie Martinez lawsuit so those were the factors among others by which we judge our candidates and certainly there is the consideration of internal versus external but that wasn't one of the things that was on our rubric any

[00:14:00]
about yeah I mean I think so all of those things that I ran through Dr Blakey really demonstrated that she has the skills competencies experience to meet those but also vision and passion really stood out I talked about how passionately she spoke about this District in her own experience coming up in this District I think there's other factors too of course like school safety equity and transparency which are all areas where Dr Blakey has also demonstrated some really significant assets and skills particularly for this community so she certainly stood apart there any other questions well if you do all right well
