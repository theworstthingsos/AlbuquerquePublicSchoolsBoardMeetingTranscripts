[00:17:00]
critical students emerged out of critical by two or three levels so they've gone from level one almost to level three and a letter to and later when kids have also made huge gains in our reaching level four and five on our iStation assessments and that's been huge because it allows us to Target our instructions and last year are in our reading intervention is only saw six kids per grade level and now she's saying classes that allows us to move on mister I'm asked us to material there were so many things to say but I think this tops program has been huge messed around organized it all the stuff got together we worked together the kids were together the

[00:35:00]
so that was our elementary school presentation thank you so much we're going to move on now to Mr Hughes who's going to talk to us about our middle schools thank you very much

[00:36:00]
Adam president members of the board superintendent Elder it's a fantastic to see you guys here this evening and have an opportunity to produce some of the goals and the things that we have done and go to before I want to get started I want to thank board member Peterson and board member I'm on the corner of the for your years of service and courage and commitment that you have given of your personal life to help lead the board and to leave the district so thank you guys so much for that and will continue on with the work that you have put forth that we are leading and doing in the middle school so as you guys know go to is math and we're getting our kids ready in 8th grade to to do well in math and as we go through there's been a lot of things that we've tied in and put forth with that we have plans we started arrows we start putting things into place that goes with it we have critical actions that match

[00:37:00]
what we are attempting to do and putting those forward for our students doing our walkthroughs this is teachers from Jackson Middle School and we saw some things that they were doing that was a compliment in the work that we have been putting forth where you actually get to see the effort that you have put forth down to your principles down to your teachers and into the students work so as we align those and we've done our apps observation we saw highly qualified instructional materials being used in the classroom we saw the kids and joined technology first hand where they're putting in their information it's going up on the boards it was a great Testament to where they were and talking with the principal afterwards it was evident that they have been using you know not just the professional District curriculum but also that they've been using the professional development of from C

[00:38:00]
professional development from themselves and professional development within their own collaborations to really work forward as a school so they have really taken a deep dive at their school in mathematics and it's been a beautiful thing to to go with I do want to introduce Mrs Powell in the student teacher and this is Crawford it's kind of great to have in math student teacher will be staying in middle school because I won't let him go and we will find find something there for that the I do want to to extend some thoughts and prayers we had a teacher from Truman who is going to be here as well but he had medical emergency like a real medical emergency

[00:39:00]
Anonymous we can share their work online and they're not afraid to make mistakes they can explain each other's work

[00:40:00]
great and it's just it's really helped open up some of the math dialogue that they're just not used to having because the curriculum does demand that map dialogue so using decimals to help that we at Jackson I'll see you soon I ready growth monitoring so every month of the students have a little checkpoint of how they're progressing in their learning it is documented in their interactive notebook we also use IXL in regular math as well as their master's class and that offers another Benchmark of testing and it really targets their learning apps so there's that we use paper paper is a wonderful tutoring program that I have my students do quite often they have the practice that they do in there and then they are also getting really comfortable with talking with

[00:41:00]
paper helps a lot with that and then she was talking about the I ready we were able at our school by using these tools with the kids and making it available so they can get that private tutoring kind of deal going on and then the curriculum or the instructions and I ready that help them boost their learning when they get a question wrong it explains it to them through that they were able to have like a little mini celebration for students who they're already at least 20 points so that was really exciting as you can see using the material and putting the time in for the professional development and sharing

[00:42:00]
best practices within the department has really been beneficial for goal to and Jackson is a great example of of our schools doing what we put forth from the board and really growing from that and in their ICS pushing it and then they're working with it and good Administration and it's just a great Testament of our goals and our adult behaviors changing over time so I want to say thank you very much for that and that's our goal to presentation are there any comments or questions I feel like we don't have students to scare portfolio so my question is with these aligned with yesterday

[00:43:00]
go go into paper or are they aware of like a lesser of math and and how it's kind of a little bit little bit different curriculum than traditional we can't pick the tutors paper hires them but they do have like the worksheets that we give them and so they can take a picture and they can kind of see that and then we haven't seen anywhere they're just like giving answers and stuff they're like working through the problem and asking the students like okay you got here what would you do next which is awesome it's not just giving for the most part they're not giving answers that I see no the the tutors I don't know if they're familiar with the curriculum but they definitely help us really good probing questions to help them work through the problems in the curriculum so it sounds like they actually support that dialogue that you were talking about the probing dialogue to just have that I've seen them draw

[00:44:00]
diagrams for the students and they'll say can you explain to me what I do here they'll do that and they'll also they really work with them with me to say this or did you mean to say this which one is it so it's really helpful with them getting that done all correct as well I'm glad I'm glad to know that it's like it's being supportive with what you are doing in the in the classroom it's good to hear is there any yeah I was just going to say last year when when we selected less I know there was concerned because it was a break from some of the previous curriculum framework and it was really exciting I mean I was personally I was really pleased with that curriculum in terms of the whole conceptual work but knew that it would be it might be a heavy lifter

[00:45:00]
so I'm curious if you had time to do the collaboration with your department to really be able to develop into it and we have actually just recently got with the cni to really focus on that collaboration and working through a bunch of the different scenarios in with different grade levels in that curriculum so that way we can really see what it can do it's exciting and I just like I have to say I just love the fact that you and this is what classroom teachers do and it's what you need to be recognized and honored for seeing where the barrier is with your students in finding creative ways of addressing it and I and I think teachers do that all the time and you don't always get recognized for it so that's I just I love hearing that

[00:46:00]
any other questions or comments again thank you so much it's important to hear and see what's happening you know with our middle school work and I really truly appreciate you all coming out tonight thank you thank you very much so our next goal is go through and this is associate superintendent Mark Garcia and Sherry Jackson are going to cruise

[00:47:00]
well good evening president Montoya Cordova board members superintendent Elder it's my pleasure to be here tonight with Mr Garcia my name is Sherry Jeff and the associate superintendent for goal for and this is the first time I think Gulf War has come before you so hello we are really on go for looking at a lot about our school climate and supports so that's really how go for is translating into the day-to-day work I'm really thankful for this opportunity tonight to present alongside the students and Mr Garcia and the conversations that we had with the students have been really very rich and helpful in terms of knowing how we can change those adult behaviors so that our student outcomes can improve I am also really happy to have Mr

[00:48:00]
Garcia here he's been a super strong partner in getting go for off the ground as have the other associate superintendent for the goals we are having really great conversations about how skills habits and mindsets happen in develop within the academic Endeavors and so when we talk about perseverance and self-efficacy that's happening in the classroom not maybe in a separate time where we focus on our social emotional learning so I just want to really thank them for that because it's kind of been a mindset shift and how we think about this work and we approached it I am really excited to come back to you in February to present our Baseline results on our survey around skills habits in mindsets but for now I will turn it over to Mr Garcia and he's going to just give you some context for tonight's presentation and then we will hand it off to the students thank you for president

[00:49:00]
call Yolanda Montoya Cordova members of the board superintendent and Elder it was just awesome to get to see students back in this boardroom and I think for me as an educational leader just seen our elementary students and them being able to present in their families in this boardroom it really allows me to Center myself with real purpose and Alignment to our four board goals our goal 3 team considers being a goal three team member a team sport meaning that we have to work with all four goals it's Paramount that we work with gold one in career connected learning for elementary students giving them an introduction to corrected learning and then as we move to work with our goal two partners exploration at middle school so that students see the relevance in what they're learning tied to the to their career goals and as we get

[00:50:00]
high school that experience they have in high school that's directly related to their post-secondary goals so tonight has just been awesome and we have the opportunity to assemble high school students to do a data dialogue and what we did in this data dialogue is actually invite our high school students to take a look at the board progress monitoring documents that you all were presented back in September 20th of the 20th of this year and if you remember back we looked at intro goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 and what was presented on those documents is focus group data what's going well what's not going well and next steps and I want to thank super associate superintendent Sherry jet for being such a strong partner with gold three were really working on

[00:51:00]
writing Student Success systems / early warning systems that every high school and really embracing the concept of skills habits and mindsets and perseverance in self-efficacy for all of our high school students so go three four goals as our goal and without further Ado we're going to have our students come up and Niki's going to introduce yourself and then all of our other students so we thank them for being thought partners and having this data dialogue and I'm very excited for them to show their thoughts with you all so thank you thank you great

[00:52:00]
all right hi my name is Nikki Dyke I'm a senior at El Dorado High School and I'm also the student body president I will be attending Hamilton College and also playing softball for them I want to pursue a major or concentration in political science or pre-law and then I want to attend law school to become either a lawyer or a politician or something in that realm I want to make a difference and also like talking so that's why our superintendent my name is Bianca Quinones I'm a junior at Sandia high school I want to go to college outset in New Mexico and study either psychology political science or some sort of stem fields from there I want to either attend law school and become a lawyer or go into some sort of stem Fields such as engineering or fire medical before I started to say

[00:53:00]
thank you all for letting us have this opportunity tonight I appreciate it a lot it was really just an interesting experience but I'm telling her that I'm a senior at Siegel High School and the student body president my plans for after high school are attending Barrett the Honors College at Arizona State University and I want to double major and software engineering and Investment Banking and I'm also planning on joining ASU student leadership program hello my name is Taylor I'm a senior at San Diego High School I plan on attending college outside of New Mexico and I want to study Elementary education with goals of becoming a third fifth grade teacher hey for teachers and the selfless senior I am good evening I'm Cree Ackerman I'm a senior at Sandy high school and I plan on attending the University of New Mexico and studying the early childhood education

[00:54:00]
okay so what we noticed was that in 2021 to 2022 that and all of the demographics there was a big spike and dropouts and we play that on covid the Native American English language Learners and the free and reduced lunch students have the highest Dropout rates from any other subgroup and we also noticed that the

[00:55:00]
repeat dual credit like that credit increases for juniors because it is a graduation requirement we noticed that all students have access to something which is definitely positive but opportunities are not always equitably accessible Which is less good and we also noticed that where you go to school determines the opportunities you have so I'm not at Sandia we have a great program that's IB so that's wonderful but you have to go to Sandia to have that we also notice that the focuses on those that have taken in AP class are to take more but we want to know how to focus on those who need to take an AP we directly linked this to school climate and belonging so we know that the jump from regular courses to APK can be very dramatic but we need to start normalizing that and we need to give the students a sense of Safety and Security and say hey I know you're taking a regular class but like AP is a great opportunity and you don't

[00:56:00]
whatever you want to study in college or whatever you're interested in the moment messaging to students about the importance of taking on challenges is missing and needs to start before our senior year students and faculty and other students need to challenge each other to become the best student they can be even though something is hard to say that's like too hard like that's really scary I don't want to do that so like thinking that mentally challenged like that's awesome and when you start normalizing like failing it's okay to fail specially if you are taking apart and bigger classes okay and that's how you learn and the adult influence is very important when it starts and it starts with students are young I know my middle school in elementary school but I have some hard teachers but those are the teachers I remember and why I'm such a good student and yeah it was hard in the moment it was very hard but

[00:57:00]
I think that's what really made me made my work ethic is do my work do it right if I have questions ask a teacher but there's a line of saying okay like I'm scared to make a mistake but you just the teachers and faculty and the other students like hey it's okay if you have a question let me know just a sense of that security and also the impact of covid on the generation is very real and I think everyone we all know what happened and we need to know that happened and that the students especially my senior class is very hurt and damage we see the effects of dropouts and also in clubs and like clubs and sports I know my softball team will have three seniors and even in it will only have like five compared to the junior class where it's like 20 years and we have about like 10 Juniors on my softball team there are lots of opportunities in APS I think that needs to be known to the everyone it's like super sack why I'm here today and also career-oriented

[00:58:00]
opportunities as well outside of school and student engagement and adult influence are connected I think that one speaks for itself they go hand-in-hand and good things are happening in APS this isn't us like blaming whatever like if you could stuff but this is us acknowledging it in that it's it's getting better and we are going on the right path it just needs a little you know sleep steering Corrections so up next what we have is implications for practices for both goals 3 and 4 and then the guardrail for so to start off we need to expand offerings especially those that are career-oriented like things like horses or workshops another thing that we need to focus on is strengthening the transition from 8th grade to 9th grade because I know that I especially struggled with that that was something that I had to I needed help with like I for example one thing that I really struggled with some understanding how the structure of high school work

[00:59:00]
what requirements that I needed for high school and those types of things should be taught and be focused on especially when you're going to your 8th grade year I'm 29th grader my apologies also if something is scary we thought that it's important to just do it anyways because that's how you learn that's how you grow as a person and you learn skills and other qualifications for yourself and intentional messaging to students about the power of taking a challenge because it's important and then this leads us to a question that we as a team asked which was how can 8th grade teachers prepare students for challenges in high school and we came up with these three things which is to teach students Google setting skills work and to start as early as possible because the early start the better outcomes and performance that we see another thing that we also notice was upperclassmen have an influence on the younger classroom so if we encourage these upperclassmen to teach these younger students to put themselves and work hard

[01:00:00]
also improve student performance and outcomes as Nikki stated before we need to start as early as possible and we can do that through family involvement and more school challenges whether that be teachers and other various things at the school offers and that's cool that family engagement starts through community school counselors and other translated resources fall for skills habits and mindsets increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills life success perseverance self-regulation self efficacy and social awareness from X in 2023 to why in 2029 and as measured by an evidence-based and align tool right so as you can see perseverance

[01:01:00]
bullet for a reason we want to focus on those two words I'm going to be talking about perseverance so we saw the data we saw the the dip when covid happened but it's starting to go up we're starting to go on an upward spiral we just need that perseverance for like everyone teachers faculty students especially like just have that perseverance keep going strong we're almost there it's we're coming we're trying to find a bat like trying to find normalcy again and I think we're on the right track to that but it's going up just persevere and perseverance is a great thing another thing that we plan on boosting and hope to see is a self-efficacy which is students pretty much realizing their capacity in their capabilities of their skills and how they can reach the goals that they want to achieve and it starts off with just more involvement and just more pushing for pushing for like more achievement

[01:02:00]
more and how you can build yourself in a successful Manner and so you can achieve whatever you like how can adults help students build the skills habits and mindsets that help them be successful we are asked to respond to that question and hear some more responses encourage encourage and encourage challenge your students and remind them to work hard in life it will get you far I think this is talking about how we want adults and teachers Administration just to really challenged students and push them towards wanting to keep their goals second one is they should encourage students to want to set goals for themselves and motivate them to want to motivate themselves and Bill skills to help them stay motivated to achieve their goals this means that we want students to really be self-motivated and really truly want to have the skills to achieve their goals themselves and really want to

[01:03:00]
make be able to have other people push them but surely they want to achieve their goals for themselves they can challenge students to achieve the goals that that they make having them feel accomplished will let them know they're learning and will help them be successful it all starts with discipline when adults continuously teach the values and importance of work ethic to their students mindsets will change your students to find their drive because that's where it all starts also being a well-rounded model for your students get too far students notice notice that and support and motivate support students so they know you are always there for them but also push them to achieve more I think all of these responses sort of have the same message of like efficacy and perseverance that we really do think that adults and teachers should truly push students to make their own goals and really be set on their goals and truly think

[01:04:00]
about what they want to do like after high school and build skills to be able to achieve those goals so that's the end of our presentation is there any questions great job that was a lot I'm going to open it up board members if you have any questions that I really loved hearing normal decades ago but when I attended my first summer Institute at UNM for those teachers who wanted to become a teacher we had

[01:05:00]
strictly a College Bound class we need those skills doesn't matter that they get seeds we don't care we just want entry level employees to come to us with some exposure to apology and I have to say that in my daughter's life she did not do all the AP classes that she should have but why she stands out and she she says it's because and it made a difference so yeah

[01:06:00]
thank you for that observation and then I do have a question and maybe the psychiatrist can help us with this one no pressure but I heard I love how you analyze the data by the way under intentional messaging about the power of a challenge for 8th graders transitioning to 9th grade upperclassmen teaching the younger students I heard that comment how how would you I mean how would you do that tomorrow is just telling the young I notice I have a younger brother and sometimes he struggles with understanding that high school is important like I remember when I was a

[01:07:00]
turn on I struggled with the fact that my grades matter and if I want to go to college which was my plan that my grades matter and if I want to go to like a big college for example or even whatever option those they matter they build a work ethic and they build the skills to be able to do not just in college but whatever other options that you see fit for yourself but if you learn just the challenges of working hard or simple little skills that technical skills or even communication skills like those those start the foundations and they just continue to build up as you progress through high school so would you like that I mean I'm just curious I think maybe having older than be aware of really the benefits that they've gotten from AP classes I think maybe just saying that and then saying maybe

[01:08:00]
you could encourage you know maybe some of the 9th graders or 10th graders to want to do AP classes and I think even when students just talked about what classes are going to take I think maybe that'll show through and so that they'll be like oh I know I got like better communication skills or better study skills from this AP I guess like all encourage somebody I know it's a want to take the same class or really just having them speak highly about AP classes just around the halls or like in casual conversation I think maybe it'll get to the lower classroom El Dorado had something like that my freshman year my freshman year I was online and we have to do things called Eagle buddies so I was paired up with an upperclassman and she was paired up with two other freshmen or two or three and that she would just check up on us saying hey how's it going like you're standing make sure you guys are good you need any help that really helped me my freshman year since I was online

[01:09:00]
and I felt like I was alone cuz I didn't know anyone I was online but yeah and also I did have an older brother to who is 2 years older than me so he was a junior when I was a freshman and he really helped me understand the importance of grace especially my freshman year I also was very grateful to have an 8th grade her name was her name is Christina she was a my English teacher for 8th grade and she really pushed my class and myself say hey you're in high school next year you got to make sure you're doing this you got to make sure you're reading all your chapters you can't you can't like have to do something I have to do it and you have to do it right cuz there's not there's not going to be any excuses when you are in high school so I just think that really helped me when I was in 8th grade singing oh my gosh like this is real I need to I need to get my act together any other I just have a comment like I love that you were every single one of you are blazing your own trail like you were truly confident in Who You Are

[01:10:00]
hear the passion and it's very personal to you it's not something that you were just told to do but you could tell that you took it to heart and you applied it to real life experiences and how we can make APS better for the Long Haul and for that I want to say thank you like you are exactly what we want representing all of our schools and continuing continuing this Legacy for many generations like I will please you come back I know you guys are going to other schools but we need your talents we need your expertise here like you are New Mexico's like this is who you are and we want to continue to make our state better but everything that you've continued to talk about like you get it and it's amazing just to see like the thoughts that we had in place really see them roll out tonight and see it first hand come to life

[01:11:00]
play this is what makes it worthwhile so thank you for what you're doing thank you for the commitment you made for doing hard things and for making sure that this is just like the first step of greatness what's to come for all of you so congratulations thank you guys I'm glad you're here tonight for speaking to us you guys will really change the world that's hard to follow me but I do have a question I'm just curious because you've talked about AP classes and I'm also curious about are you able to access the electives that you're most interested in and what role do you think they play in in your progress with academic and emotional social social I can start this one off so I started taking AP classes when I was

[01:12:00]
Junior and I honestly just wanted to experiment my junior year I really I really like writing and when I go to college I might take a ride in class or in English class cuz I really like doing that so I took an AP Lang and cop class to see if you know maybe I like doing this and that turns out I love writing I love writing argumentative essays somehow we're not surprised it's just having the option to take see I like riding and I had the option to take a pee I also took honors my sophomore year so I wasn't jumping into it but also my sophomore year I had just normal world history and I was really interested in the European part so my teacher recommended hey seems like you really like Queen Elizabeth maybe you might want to consider taking AP European History I was like okay so I took it and loved it so that's just the accessibility and

[01:13:00]
whatever you want to take like I wouldn't want to take AP Physics that's not something I would like the other people it would have been the option there for them like helps them get to where they want to be I have a book for you on Queen Elizabeth okay well this is my birthday and I never had a thing for math but I've always just kind of taking school as like a it's easy you know I don't really have to apply myself and so this year I kind of was like oh I really do have to apply myself to get a higher grade in my math class and grades have always been super important to me so I like I took the class knowing that I would have to push myself a little bit harder but I just think like having that available for me was definitely like like game-changing but also I know like my friends are taking like computer coding as they're like aplas and so like the

[01:14:00]
algebra so you know they had the option to still take an AP class but it's their math credit so it's like the Parallels for that I appreciate I'm going to ask another probing question what about the Arts what about music and art and some of the not so specifically academic classes so it doesn't really leave a lot of room in my schedule to take other things and I do think that it would be nice like to take like an art class or I don't know a music class but I take I'm in Senate leadership so I do think like through their we do a lot of like I guess creative things and even like my Apache will have the opportunity to do something creative or physics even

[01:15:00]
I do think I think in the Apes since it's such a wide range a lot of times like some of my teachers will Implement different forms of teaching so that it's not just like videos and notes and books to add on to that a lot of the AP classes that I took were incredible like I learned so much that I don't think I would have learned in the regular classes and yes they were challenged but I personally love the challenge I love to be able to like challenge myself and I remember just for example in my AP Psychology class we did a lot of like analysis on like ourselves our community and our environment behind us and it was really interesting and then I took APK and they progressed my writing skills from here to here and I've seen a lot of progress and it's just so cool how

[01:16:00]
even though they're AP classes you can still have fun and learn so much at the same time and it's honestly I'm I'm glad I took as many AP classes as I did I'm taking apart for that like Arts topic so I took painting and drawing just to try it out my sophomore year and it turns out I love it Junior I took a no no painting a drawing three and this year was probably my favorite art out of all of them just because we had the freedom to do what we want it's like we did the assignments we did what like my art teacher wanted me to draw a cow on a human body I did that but it was really cool he gives us the freedom to drop portfolios and what we like I like painting flowers not house on human heads that's what my portfolio was so I think having that option of APR and other you know bands and choir is really such

[01:17:00]
an escape from cuz I'm taking 480 classes so that's my on my favorite Escape I can just paint and in a pretty flower but you had in the back no no no thank you if you want to go to law school go to law school everybody should go to law school and if you never practice law you're still going to get an amazing education so so I was I am thrilled to hear that some of you want to do that I cannot really add on to what board member

[01:18:00]
just a couple of notes that I took down as you guys were talking and what I think one thing that you just said is I never knew I could do that right and I think that's the point of all of this is you never knew you could do something until you tried right or until the opportunities were given were there and to take from your presentation you knew about those opportunities right and it's all about intentionality right I think that's that's what came through and I was rapidly trying to take notes until I noticed that your notes were on the screen so so I will be taking those so that when we do have our presentation in February we can ask them very good targeted questions of how are we being intentional to present these opportunities not just to you but to every student in

[01:19:00]
free single school and so I am your future is bright I'm I'm proud of you and you guys have worked so hard and and I just love hearing what what what what what what what we want to happen for you is being reflected in the words that you guys are saying to us tonight and so best of luck to you I hope that you're I know that you're you will meet your goals and you will you have a bright future and I'm just there's a lot of a lot of Pride tonight so thank you period what I'd like to tell you is first is thank you for the sacrifice you made during covid I think as young people you don't hear that very often I think you get a lot of messages

[01:20:00]
we hear all of that stuff but I think it's really important for you to hear how grateful I am and I'm speak for myself personally how grateful I am for your generation and the sacrifice that you had to make during covid this was your big life event that you will never forget and it is it was life-changing and your perseverance through that was amazing and so you need to be applauded for the perseverance that you did have and you already have demonstrated in so many ways through that pandemic and through what we had to go through your courage and your ability to do that actually helped set a path forward for us to get healthy to get well so that we could come back to school

[01:21:00]
and so every time I see a young person who's in high school that's the first thing I say to you because as a community member I am grateful for the sacrifice that you made that's really important for you to hear and to not lose sight of the fact that you already have demonstrated tremendous perseverance as a result of that yourself efficacy tonight is like it's overflowing it's all over the place and so what I'm going to invite everybody in this room to do with me is to stand up and Applause for these young people and their perseverance thank you thank you and best wishes on your graduation I'm so proud of you as well there's so much to be proud of here thank you for coming

[01:22:00]
now tonight and I hope you all have a very happy holiday and a good restful vacation do something fun okay all right thank you thank you very much and I just I want to say also a note of gratitude to our Associates superintendent Troy Hughes Mark Garcia and Sherry Jack for pulling this all together tonight and bringing the teachers our staff and being able to highlight all the wonderful things that are students know and are able to do it's a great way for us to finish up a semester and hearing all the wonderful things that we do and I agree with Mark Garcia it's been a while since we've had students and families in here with us in the boardroom so that we could hear all of these important pieces and so thank you again for for bringing that to us tonight it was

[01:23:00]
play guys did a wonderful job for us tonight all right so our next item we're going to move on with our agenda is the discussion item and this is an update on our superintendent search including a stakeholder feedback report we have Dr Walt Cooper with us from our search firm in welcome Dr Cooper it's good to see you so you have the floor let's get caught up and tell the board where we are okay thank you very much and thanks for including us on your agenda tonight especially alongside so many inspiring young people that was absolutely incredible and it's good to see you again as well I want to first introduced YouTube national recruiter

[01:24:00]
and Regional director for McPherson Jacobson and he's joining us this evening from Lincoln Nebraska his hometown and he is partnering we're Partners together on this search and you will meet Dr Joel in person as he joins me in Albuquerque on January 10th so welcome to Dr Joel and also just like to take one moment of privilege and thank you and vice president Mueller Aragon and board member Peterson for the work that not only that you get to Albuquerque Public Schools during your during their term but also for the work that you put in at the front end of this search to kick off and set a really strong foundation for a successful search we appreciate that work very very much and we'll miss you through the remainder of this process in January but wanted to recognize

[01:25:00]
our primary purpose for joining you this evening is to reference and really answer any questions you might have of the stakeholder engagement report that we presented to the board and I believe is is now publicly available to your constituents in Albuquerque and to see if there are any questions or clarifications of any ambiguity or other thoughts that you might have around the stakeholder engagement report also want to have a little bit of conversation about further Community engagement opportunities in the search process as we get into Canada selection of public forums that type of thing if you have some suggestions or thoughts about how we can support the board in that Community engagement and then to offer

[01:26:00]
the opportunity while we're here as a captive audience if you have any questions about any other part of the search that we're doing where we're going to be happy to answer any questions that that we can so to start I first want to say and give credit to the board for your commitment to community outreach and public engagement in general but as it affects our work specifically this search the the time and effort and intentionality that you put into Community engagement in this search quite honestly is more than I've ever seen in any work that I've done in this world and so you should be commended for that it's one thing to have a lot of work it's another thing to have really intentional and actionable work and while there was a lot of

[01:27:00]
put into this even more importantly it was very intentional and it's very actionable I believe in the way that that it has come together and we're not done yet in terms of community engagement so so with that I will stop speaking and offer the any board members the opportunity to for comments or questions that you may have for either Doctor Joel or myself and I'm just going to open it up for board comments to have any comments regarding mistake holder report period

[01:28:00]
because we did not get a chance to include them and I also pitched the idea of doing an Outreach I know it's it's late but I think it's it's of utmost importance that we have the tribes are tribal leaders way in and so I'm going to pitch the idea depending on how full tomorrow's meeting is that maybe the 8th or the 9th and January we get an opportunity to hear from them and there's a question mark on my face because I somehow remember us doing this and I know that Mr Parsons not here but there was a meeting with the tribal leaders I don't think we had it was right after the summit no we we had the tribal leaders together and we

[01:29:00]
did ask for some input at that time I remember it wasn't a really I'm looking at superintendent it wasn't a really well attended meeting at that particular time what was that meeting but we did ask I mean we did get some some input from them I don't remember I don't think we probably included it or shared it as part of this piece but I know I have some notes around that and Mr Farson took copious notes because he always keeps minutes from his meeting so we could go back and look at that but I think tomorrow with the IPP we could definitely just remind again and see but I believe we did Peggy was there with me I believe and superintendent was there it's the energy tribal government so there was one held after the summit they were brought in for some specific reasons and I do believe you guys took feedback what you did with that I don't know

[01:30:00]
but I do believe there was a conversation at that time I'd like to see that included in the summary as even an updated so we could we could probably go back and gather those notes because there was definitely some meeting minutes that were taking their but we asked specifically for their feedback on that but I think tomorrow at the IPP we could also just do it again and we could certainly included as part of the stakeholder report it won't be that difficult I don't think I like the way that you've done it Dr Cooper where you've outlined like each of the groups and some of their their thoughts that was really helpful any other comments are extensive community and intentional Outreach so

[01:31:00]
came from I think as we deliberate is the future board since I won't be in on the deliberation but I it is a constant concern and we have good intentions and it's just the world it's the communities that were part of they're definitely the responses the percentage of responses from different zip codes are very predictable that the the highest rates of response and the least the smallest rate of

[01:32:00]
what's this definitely from the most struggling communities in the communities that tend to be most that feel most marginalized that feel most detached from APS and so I think it's really important to weigh that as deliberations continue or else we will have people with the most weight reflecting who's actually a minority of our community because the majority of our community is in economically Strickland neighborhoods are minorities minority community and so I I really strongly feel that

[01:33:00]
I need to take that into account that the future board must take that into account to make sure that we have someone who's in the best position to to move the district to continue moving the district forward because we have been moving forward we are not at a dead standstill and we never have been but he's in the best position to understand what is going to address the Martinez yassi lawsuit that's going to be able to really and truly understand the broader realm of needs of some of our schools and some of our students I was grateful to see that for sure and I think it was the first time we've had some data that's presented that way so kudos to our data team who assisted in that because I think it really I think

[01:34:00]
who's responding and how well they're responding and so I think the opportunities coming back with that town hall you know that that last look or when we finally have finalists and making sure that we have a representative sample of of everybody in the community being able to weigh in will be will be really helpful but I thought it was I thought it was well done and I really appreciate because I know that we made that decision to go in house and I appreciate our in-house team to be able to very quickly pull something together and support you Dr Cooper on this because I think that was that was a big decision and it obviously has paid off well they did a phenomenal job and we worked very well together to try to put this into an understandable and actionable format and

[01:35:00]
certainly could not have done that without his team's assistance so thank you for that write any other comments I think we're at home the question that I had is when I we were looking at the online online survey and all the demographic information that was put out there and when it came to a lot of what member Peterson was speaking about is when you're looking at the race and ethnicity when it came to those on online surveys and we saw that only I think it was like 21% of the respondents of the survey were Hispanic and we have obviously a large majority of our population is Hispanic I just want to know how much how much weight are you really going to give to this

[01:36:00]
there were many zip codes that you know weren't didn't show up on that online survey I know like 87102187104 and so I mean I'm just I'm just a little bit concerned as member Peterson is on that and is that not going to play as important as a of a role because we didn't get such a big percentage of Hispanic population and certain zip codes responding at all may I present thank you so one thing that I would highlight initially is that nearly a third of the survey respondents did not indicate an ethnicity at all and so neither neither the 34% that indicated

[01:37:00]
play White Caucasian or the 21% that indicated Hispanic really is a a truly defendable defensible and viable number because of the number that that that that was an optional question that that we put into the the into the survey it is certainly worth noting that there is a discrepancy between the communities General demographic makeup and the responses as board member Peterson was talking about but I would say to that two things number one this survey serves a purpose but we all need to realize it is a limited purpose this is the survey as a whole is one data point in the entire decision making process and one of the most important pieces of that data point is to act as a balance to see

[01:38:00]
for the for the board members themselves and the board as a whole are their desired characteristics are their objectives are the questions that they are developing to pose to candidates in line with generally what they what we see in the online stakeholder report and the stakeholder report in general I would I would venture to a certain at this point they're very closely aligned there's there's very little disconnect which is a credit to the board in the work that they did because that work was done prior to seeing any of the results from the stakeholder groups the other thing that I would say and this is really more in in response and and supportive board member Peterson's concerned what you see in the online in the day and the demographics around the online survey is not unique to Albuquerque that is a that is a demographic response

[01:39:00]
that is almost that could be mirrored in almost any Urban Centric School District or Community across the country what I think APS has done and you have done as the aps board that is really admirable is that you've gone beyond that with all of the individual communication conversations that you have had most of which are referenced in the report but not all I know that you've been engaged in others that really provides not just unidirectional feedback like the online report but it provides a contextual conversation the newcomers group for example a contextual conversation about what that segment of your community is really and what is impacting their most and what are they feeling when you talk to the Kirkland partnership for example those those carve outs if you will can get very easily lost

[01:40:00]
what's the results of an online survey that has over 7,000 responses so it is the online survey itself is one data point the and in many searches that we do that is the only the only substantive stakeholder feedback data point that they have which is certainly not the case here in Albuquerque and I think that's really playing to your advantage so it is it is not the most important part of this report I think all three parts of the report the individual conversations the online report and the synthesis of current trends are all equally important to consider and one should not be weighed more heavily than the other thank you Doctor Cooper I I wholeheartedly agree because I think when it comes time to start interviewing with candidates it's going to be looking at those individual stakeholder reports too right

[01:41:00]
making the whole story but those individual group reports where we heard some of the nuances of what was important to them I think it will help those it will help the board members tremendously to start to keep that in the back of their mind as their you know evaluating candidates and saying like how am I hearing this from the context of like the carpenters union or from the principles group so it's just like and like you said or the economic Forum because each provided real specific thoughts that they had but their it's just a great tool for the board members because I will say in the past board members when we did superintendent searches we didn't have anything like that at all so it was all just pretty much bass on like our own personal things you know people we were talking with but it wasn't really a shared document it was like in our heads but not necessarily communicated like this in a document where we could look at it and then it would be a way for

[01:42:00]
the the board as a whole to sort of like as your thinking about it and you're talking about it you know a board member can say but remember what we heard from Kirtland you know do we see that as do we see that evidence in this particular candidate how is that I mean through or even evaluating and saying you know yay for this particular candidate because it's real clear that there's like a lot of support for some of the thoughts that were brought up by the principles for example so I think it's a really well done report Dr Cooper and really just summarized really well everything that we've heard and I I can't you know I can't say enough how much better this particular search just going to be because it's giving you guys a better context for all of that it's just easier to look at all of that all together so it gives you some really good information and tools to to move forward so thank you

[01:43:00]
I loved the how you broke down each of the questions and then really just honored the notes that were sent up to you by each of the groups that sent those up and I just want to say thanks to the board members to who did those Outreach sessions who made that commitment to doing that taking the notes going in pairs I think that was really critical as well because I think it really honors the the Sox around you know when we do Outreach we go out in pairs and we're we look at that information together and that we validate it with each other I saw that happening a lot because I was in a lot of emails like here's the notes you know I was like okay they're doing their job you know they're getting his stuff but I thought that was really well done and I really appreciate the commitment that the board made to listening to those groups but also Gathering that information and getting it to Dr Cooper as quickly as possible I know

[01:44:00]
we had some last-minute add-ons and he was you were just so gracious enough to like take on some of these pieces for us and there'll be a couple more but I agree with Josefina is that once we get from IPP tomorrow if there's some things that we hear we'll just add it on there because I think that context is really important and it's just this is more of a tool for us not for us for the board I'm not going to be on the board but it's more of a tool for the board who has to make this really important decision but making sure that you're making that decision based on the voices that have given us you know have weighed in terms of what's important do you have any other comments that you want to make or go okay but we'll get to that so not hearing any other go ahead did you have something

[01:45:00]
I was just going to ask at this point if thinking about further community outreach once we get down deeper into the search process I didn't know if if board member Jackson on behalf of the the Outreach committee had some some questions or thoughts about how we can support you how Dr Joel and I can support you in that realm and I'm thinking specifically about what happens between the the 16th of January and the 30th of January and that time and that time frame on your on your search schedule sure well Dr Cooper I have more than thoughts I have a plan I would expect nothing less than the community outreach committee has a plan so we just wanted to present that

[01:46:00]
play to the board and so that you guys can kind of understand what are thought process is and then for the new board members who will be joining I will be sending you a document that summarizes what the plan is this plan is specific to January 30th which was the day that we had tentatively but I'm now making the official announcement the public Outreach will happen on January 30th which is the day before the the plans the executive session but just as an overview so that everybody knows and then if there's questions and we're happy to take questions this will be an all day event so it'll be at burn a fossio starting at 7:30 in the morning what we planned for this event was to have basically four well three constituent groups that we wanted to Target at four

[01:47:00]
panels essentially so the constituent groups are obviously the public the the general public we want to have a student specific panel and then we wanted to have a teacher and a staff specific panel as well so I'm starting at 7:30 in the morning will have a breakfast for invited guests this will be very similar to what we did with the summit where we'll use the community outreach document where we had the invited guests will invite them and each candidate will have the opportunity to give a 10-minute introduction and then we're going to run that morning session very much like economic forum is run where we'll just take questions from the floor we'll have a break and then at 9:00 the the next session will Begin work will begin where we'll have another 10 minute presentation by each candidate I should pause here to say all of these time frames are based on

[01:48:00]
on the premise that will have three finalists that all the time frames can change but that's what that is based upon so then at 9:30 we will start the student panel and the the thought right now this has the potential to change is that we're going to have six six students who will ask questions to from elementary to from middle and two from high school will be working with the associate superintendents they will be developing a plan as to how those students are are chosen and how the questions will be will be put together but we're going to rely on the associates to take the lead on that so that will go from 9:30 until 10:30 which will have a break and then at 10:45 will start the general public the first general public forum what the thought process for this one is is that

[01:49:00]
at each finalist is going to rotate through the main room so you'll have one finalists in the big room to to answer questions will have 20 minutes for each candidate and we're going to rotate through each candidate will receive the same set of questions and I'll pause here to say that we are going to develop two separate portals for questions submission will have a general public portal in which the general public can submit questions and then we'll have a separate teacher APS employee staff portal cuz sometimes those questions are a little bit different than what the public is going to going to want but the so each candidate will rotate through for 20 minutes that'll take about an hour and a half we'll we'll break it noon then the candidates because they will have

[01:50:00]
4 1/2 hours non-stop they get a break so that that'll be a break until 5:00 p.m. so they'll come back and then we'll be still at Burnham right okay so still at Burnet Osteo so at 5:00 p.m. the aps employees specific form will start again these will be questions that are submitted via the aps question mark portal and this will be very this will be a panel where all three all three candidates will be up there asking the same questions or being asked the same question 5:45 a break 6:00 we will start the general public forum and again it will be round robin style along with the suggestion that Dr Cooper submitted to us and that will go from 6 to 8 p.m. so the the meat of the general public will happen in the evening but we wanted to give an opportunity throughout the day so

[01:51:00]
just some some questions that might come up at all address prior to is we will we're looking at the ability to live stream right so that if you can't attend you can you can still watch we will we are reaching out to moderators so that it's not it obviously the board can't be the moderator and so we're going to look at kind of outside people to help us with that we will have a way to submit feedback to from the public to the board that night because it'll be a very quick turnaround for us to have the public forum the 30th and then the very next day going to Executive session so that will be through a Google form so that that data can go to Dr Cooper that evening from what I understand Dr Cooper you can get the forms and you can kind of collate that information pretty quickly so that

[01:52:00]
turn on the 31st the board will have any feedback as we go into executive session that next day sorry we are we are also very similar to what we've been doing with community outreach it will be an incumbent upon the board members to reach out to the organizations that we have affiliations with and ask for participation participation you know individual request individual invites but it is going to be incumbent upon the board to make sure that people attend these public forums invites save the dates for the public forum are set to go out this week and then the actual invitation is going to go out to the public beginning the week of January 5th and then we'll have an invitation reminder go out every every week after that

[01:53:00]
I don't believe so I think you were pretty exhausted there I am exhausted I have a question but I think I can catch up with you it's not clear to me what that 10:45 it to me so I can get there but I just was like what is that rotation rooms I just didn't it didn't drive in my head but I just need to get it's not that important for me to do this on the dice tonight and I just want to clarify that Mr Cooper you're going to take responses from feedback from the public is that correct

[01:54:00]
and get get those comments back to us that evening is it to comment card or something is that what it is we're going to use a Google form and so they'll they'll be a link to a Google form as well as a QR code so that people can can enter their comments into the Google Forum right then and then it'll go to Dr Cooper for collation correct Dr Cooper so I will work to present to you on the at some point post and reviews on the 31st a summary that looks very much like the summary pages that you saw in the stakeholder report frequency of responses and commonality of terms that sort of thing and and identify some themes to present to you so it

[01:55:00]
it will be largely being done overnight and then you know during the time that you're with candidates on the 31st I'll be in Albuquerque both day so I mean I'm right there but yes that would be the objectives that we would turn that around with a summary and synthesize list of themes that came in around what we will ask I would assume Miss Jackson I haven't talked about this but will assume we will ask for you know strengths identifying strengths identified concerns those types of things and so we'll look for themes in there we're not we're not doing anything that's quantitative that's really simple in terms of math but we will put together some some themes for you to look at once you finish with your final candidate on the 31st translation services

[01:56:00]
some other format for people who are not comfortable with the technology I think would be very small number my suspicion is that anyone who actually gets burned a fossil is going to be really happy with the with the Google form but I still think there should be some opportunity

[01:57:00]
it might be me Dr Cooper this is Yolanda no I just I just assumed that we would do that yeah it sounds like there's lots of flexibility thank you Doctor Cooper that was great I really

[01:58:00]
appreciate all the work that McPherson and Jacobson has done for us on this it's been outstanding so it's been a pleasure also working with the I will see you there because I will be there cuz I'm going to be a Community member giving weighing in for sure so looking forward to to seeing you again in person when you're here with us and I would just as I exit let everyone know the the seven members that will continue on in the the search and selection process will receive an email from me to look for an email from me tomorrow that's fairly extensive in terms of identifying some next steps and giving you a heads up on some homework that will be coming your way that sort of thing nothing that you have to immediately over the holidays but we're going to we're going to hit it pretty hard right as soon as we get back in the

[01:59:00]
I need accommodations and we should we should probably do something like that okay all right

[02:00:00]
okay any other comments questions and I think we can allow Mr Dr Cooper to sign off go enjoy his holiday he's going to send his email you all have to read something tomorrow I don't thank you very much from our board members that are leaving and this was just again a little bit of ceremonial piece for us just to have an opportunity to say goodbye to folks that are hanging in there with us either online or here in the boardroom and so

[02:01:00]
I'd like to open up first to our board vice president Peggy Mueller Aragon with District 2 Peggy are you still online with us I'm I'm here can you hear me yes we can okay and sorry I wasn't able to be there tonight I wish I could have been but those of you don't know I was in a pretty serious head on collision and so I'm still recuperating from that so hopefully it'll get better soon so I will go on and just remembering when I just began my 10 year on the board in 2015 I'm going to end it the same way by giving praise and honor to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because it's only with him that all things are possible and why I'm even still here today our daughter Amber was killed in a car accident on as you know January

[02:02:00]
2015 a few weeks before the February 3rd School Board election and obviously I couldn't or would I be able to do much with my campaign but God had a plan for me to serve on this board and continue making things better for our kids and I was elected and given the ultimate honor to advocate for my APS kiddos for almost 9 years when I was sworn in I dedicated my 10-year to my daughter Amberly who always always saw the best in everyone and I truly mean everyone I've tried my best to be more like her since her passing because ultimately when it's my time to leave this earth I want to see her again and talk to her and hear her Amazing Stories and give her the biggest hug and kiss and tell him what I did in her name and I'm certain she'd be very proud of her mom and I just wanted to talk to the most important people in my life my biggest support is supporters and

[02:03:00]
cheerleaders my family who never ever lets me down my husband Robert who is around with me yet so many APS events that many people got to know him and see his genuine love and belief and supportive of me and know that he too wants what's best for APS and my three daughters one in heaven Amberly and two left here our baby Kylie and our middle daughter Ashley and anyone who has children know they are your heart your son your moon and stars and the reason your heart beats and the reason you live and without them I really don't know what I would do so I thank them for being mine and it never goes without saying that my mom and dad my dad who passed in 2016 but got to see me sworn in and my two sisters and my son-in-law's are treasured by me and who I count on for so many things and I those of you who know me know I came into this position knowing that children are the most important people in the

[02:04:00]
world in the school district and never did I ever waiver from always putting kids in their rightful place every single one of them is capable of accomplishing and at the highest levels and of doing amazing things of contributing to our world and their deserving of being loved and having the adults believe in their promise because that with that promise comes the possibility which leads to the probability of their success all adults have to do is believe in them and it'll be amazing what children will do I came into this position already with many friends and I'm exiting with more friends that I came in with and for that I will be eternally grateful I served on the board with so many people of character with those whose political ideologies and leanings were diametrically different than mine but who wanted what was best for our students what is Barbara

[02:05:00]
who like me Todd at the elementary level we both knew what was best for kids and we agreed on most everything dealing with educating them and we were able to with differing views to raise the level of decorum on the board by simply doing what's right by our kiddos to Yolanda fellow Latina from 87105 we show all those children from our neighborhoods that we care for them and they too can become president of school boards I was honored to serve beside you his vice president to Hispanic girls serving side by side what is an honor I was blessed to see our great student Scholars our gifted athletes are talented artists share their giftedness with us you know you don't have to look very far from our neighborhood schools to see the greatness of our students he should all go do it

[02:06:00]
to so many of you who are staff and have spoken to me in confidence about what you see going on in the district for mostly wonderful things to sing fraud waste and abuse corruption or unfair labor practices I hope you find that person who will finally make the changes and finally make things right because you all deserve to be heard and not worry about retaliation this position gave me so many opportunities and one of the greatest was being connected to the National Association of Latin elected officials and organization that works on behalf of our Latino communities across the US with APS having a majority Latino student population I found this was a place where I could really help my community and I was lucky to be elected to the board of directors and for a little Hispanic girl whose parents and grandparents first language Spanish

[02:07:00]
do anything you can be elected to serve on national board to conserve in public office you can be anything you want but there's a season for everything under the sun and my board season has ended but I truly really proud of what we've done with changes to how we justify spending how we deal with Salvage to hiring investment advisors so taxpayers know their money is being taken care of to supporting school choice through great Charters to student based budgeting but most important to me was inserting in our board policy that when we make decisions that will make them in the students best interest and APS like any organization is only successful you know if its clients the kids or successful put kids first and everything else will fall in its place I know that heavenly

[02:08:00]
does will prosper or APS family and give our kids hope in a wonderful future and like the great shell Silverstein said and I know because it happened to me anything is possible and anything can be and again to my Amberly I love you and it was on honor to serve with all of you thank you thank you thank you both remember hope you get better soon speedy recovery and it's really hard to not have you in the boardroom with us one last time you're going to be missed thank you board member Peterson you have the floor it's really has been an honor to have the seat the connections I've made in the community and you know I just I have to give a shout out to my community

[02:09:00]
with so many struggles there's absolutely not a square foot anywhere on Earth that has more people who are dedicated to the well-being of their community and work day in day out to really give their children what's needed even with some pretty insurmountable odds sometimes but the community and I think one of the as bizarre as it sounds the thing that I am grateful for having gone through the pandemic with his bizarre is the sounds like seeing the resilience of the students who were in front of us just now but also seeing how people inside of our schools people in the community stepped up to do everything possible to make that period for families and

[02:10:00]
and I I just care so much those connections that I've made with people through that you have to say you know I came to this position as a teacher and so in schools we have real opinions about what happens in this building and and when I got here I have to say that I had to really let some of those go because this building really and truly is filled with people who care about education care about our students and care about our staff and so I and I mean that from the bottom of my heart it's been an honor to get to know all of you Echo Hecky's words for is disparate as many of our beliefs are that we did always come together with respect

[02:11:00]
I think and with a mutual concern for what happens in the classroom hopefully what I've also been able to bring to the board is what it's like to be in the trenches what it is like to be in a classroom that we can talk all we want about caring about kids but if we don't make it possible for the people who see children day in day out every day if we don't do what makes it possible for them to do their job with children then all of our promises about four children are thin air that we have got to look at how do how do we respect and support our staff and I think tonight's example of the teachers who were here and the teachers of those high school students that it's the work of teachers and the community and that brought when

[02:12:00]
how do you say teacher I mean EA's I mean custodian I need cafeteria workers that we work together that those students in front of us wouldn't have been here if the adults in their life hadn't pulled together to make it possible and to make our commitment to making that work so some of the things that I'm proud of and I'll try I'll try to be brief but there are a couple of things that I am hugely proud of one is the expansion of community schools and that is an ongoing job but it is the way that I see we have a structural commitment to really and truly altering children's lives that what a classroom teacher can do is valuable essential absolutely critical but without that Embrace of the community without that entire framework of of

[02:13:00]
how do you make schools work better we won't achieve our goals and so I I just feel like the work of Community Schools is a really significant launch of a commitment to to who are we as a community and what do we need to bring to our students I am delighted that I think we're only five short of Art and music and every elementary school every year that we can talk academics all we want but if we don't give students the things that nurture their souls everything else will run out of steam I mean listening to these students and I am delighted that they are working so hard and taking such pride in their progress but I've been in this business long enough to know that

[02:14:00]
looking at scores on an iStation whether you're in green or yellow or red that inspiration only lasts so long and there is a track record there will be a bubble they will work and work and work but there comes a point where McDonald's and the other treats run out of steam there's a pointed which and sometimes it's a year sometimes it's three or four but there comes a point where all of those ways that we as adults measure them will run out of steam it's not sustainable if we're not giving them the rich content and thinking and being able to Grapple with the world that they have to have and that's our mission I mean I am fine with

[02:15:00]
and I'm happy that they can celebrate that I just know we've got we have a responsibility to give them more than that and that's I think the challenge of the board going forward of how do we look at the goals and guardrails and not go back to the finger pointing kind of you know single test score as the measure of all we've been there we've done that that is not the science of reading is not you it's repackaged for some Publishers profit but it's not new it's what we've known as good and instruction all alone what will make a difference and I hear the Alamosa folks talk about the tops model and I was at the top school today and third grade student

[02:16:00]
genius hour because that was what was driving him and he had a librarian who could take him by the hand and guide him through that process and that's where the innovation has to be we have Innovative teachers in every single school we have committed loving Professionals in every single school and what we have to do and I think the tops model is an example that came out of the MRI process we could have given their schools away to to the PD at that point we could have let them take over we could have said it's yours have fun or give it to a charter and that's not what we did as a district we pushed back we said we know if we collaborate with the community with students with

[02:17:00]
teachers Federation with some of our wonderful staff who are sitting right here right now figuring out what we could do what do we know to do and how can we make it work for students and that's the kind of investment that won't run out of steam that's the kind of investment that will sustain us for our students into the future and so my final frustration is we're on the verge of losing that funding that the reason why we never make the progress that we as Educators note to do we know how to teach our children what we have to do is have the time in the resources to make it work and so I may be stepping down from the board but I am in this for the long haul that we have got to alter the way we do schooling because these as an example are about

[02:18:00]
I want to have the rug pulled out from under them I've worked with some amazing principles who have left this District because after working and working and working with the extra resources and funding that they got from being a school at risk you know we've been through all of the different labels but they start solidifying their staff they have a dynamic collaborative staff that's really grappling with how to make things work and they lose the funding because either they've talked out they know longer in need of improvement because they use those resources well and no longer show up as a school qualifying or simply the grant runs out and it's over so so my long-term commitment those things that I mentioned that I'm so proud of I'm not done fighting for them because that's what's going to make a difference for our students

[02:19:00]
I have been honored to be a part of this board I've been truly honored to have been mentored by people like Dr Dave Pearce and Lorenzo Garcia Dan Duran there have been some my colleague your London Montoya Cordova that I learned from constantly so I'm not done I'm honored to have been here there's some things that I just played with with all of you to really grapple with hold on to and invite for this District because we have amazing strengths we don't need fixing we need to be supported in doing what we know works for students so thank you thank you board member Peterson cuz I know it was going to be really hard for me to do this

[02:20:00]
I think first I just want to give a heartfelt thank you to the constituents of district one who entrusted me as your representative for our beautiful lovely Community it goes without saying how much I love myself Valley Community the heart of Burke the community was so much heart resilience and soul a community who with beloved traditions and enough faith and belief for the entire state I'm a fourth-generation South Valley girl and my family has really deep roots there and I'll always be really grateful for the educational experiences that I had growing up through the schools that I had a chance to be a part of with APS also want to say thanks to my previous and current board members I've had the pleasure of working with along with the superintendents Scott Helder

[02:21:00]
and Raquel reading courage is certainly an important quality that I found in all of you and I really appreciate that and what I leave with is this art is when you are seen and I believe education is Art I have been witness to the many forms of art many forms of the art of Education with APS over the last six years are can be found in the Myriad of programs and activities ranging from traditional art and music to our bilingual seal recipients are athletic dance and student clubs it's found in newly constructed buildings in our complicated bus routes and schedules and our playgrounds our outdoor classrooms are instructional materials are professional development our policy making in our budget development APS is truly developed the art of partnership

[02:22:00]
genius our tutoring programs are Refugee programming gay straight alliances parent-teacher associations school-based Health Centers internships and work-based learning courses dual credit courses magnet schools Charter Schools before and after school programs Avid Jag and the list goes on and on I've witnessed beautiful expressions of traditional art in Folklorico dance Mariachi Native American fashion shows and pow wows showers Drumline concert in marching bands live theater and an all APS art showcase that Rivals any art display found in the museums in New Mexico more importantly I have found art in our classrooms every day principals teachers educational assistance nurses

[02:23:00]
is drivers Food Service workers janitors behaviors Community School coordinators community volunteers and so many more who work to make sure that the art of education is delivered in ways most of us learn during the pandemic is not as easy as it appears and the most special art is found in our students their energy their enthusiasm their struggle their Triumph their Joy their sadness their success their are all used to propel them forward just to be seen I saw it in the student who organized a vaccination drive at her school the student with the perfect score on an international test in our selfless seniors the student with the disability Landing their first job the kindergarteners running their first race the student who lost their bid for class president the English language Learners earning a bilingual seal the mail

[02:24:00]
courageous enough to join the dance team and the female student courageous enough to wrestle the homeless student Fearless enough to seek assistance and the lgbtq student strong enough to be seen and to the students thank you for the opportunity to be in your presence and to be in your service thank you for your sacrifices through the pandemic your courage Made Me Stronger I've Loved bearing witness to your art in all its forms and may your heart always be seen may your heart always be heard and may your heart be appreciated with that I just want to say thank you to everyone it's been a pleasure it's been an honor to be here I'm not done either I'm not going anywhere I'm so committed to the state to our communities so I will continue to fight on behalf of all of our students but more importantly on top of APs this is a great place this is a great place
