==================================================

[00:00:00]
welcome to the policy committee meeting I would like to call the meeting to order Ms King may I have a roll call please Yolanda Montoya Cordova Peggy Miller Peterson's Board of Education educational complex or watch live stream on the board of education YouTube channel our first item for consideration and action is adoption of the May 1st 2023 policy committee meeting agenda and approval of the January 5th 2023 in February 2nd 2023 policy committee meeting minutes do I have a motion this is Crystal I will make a motion to adopt the May 1st 2023 policy committee meeting agenda and the approval of January 5th 2023 and February 22nd 2023 policy committee

[00:01:00]
discussion on policy review and policy diet to ensure alignment with the vision and values of the aps Community discussion Community joined by Ashley of great City Schools you have the four hi hello APS board and superintendent Elder I'm happy to be with you tonight to discuss the policy diet process and policy review process I wanted to start off this evening just by opening the floor and asking any questions about

[00:02:00]
the process as it pertains to the reading that you were all assigned prior to tonight's meeting we will start there are there any questions and response to the reading that we were assigned for tonight any additional questions so the policy so and students focused governance we have a process that is called policy diet so this is a process that takes School boards through reviewing your board policies and looking at them through a lens of management so dividing policy between management policies and governing policies so in student outcomes Focus governance there are three types of policies that we encourage school boards to focus on these are going to be your goals policy

[00:03:00]
guardrails policies your governing policies and your delegating policies so your goal policy and guardrail policy are pretty are pretty clear-cut that's your goals and your guard rails and these are actually policy statements that that Define what students should know where we will do as your District pursues is educational program and what the values of the committee are the values of the community should be protected along the way so those are going to be your goals and your guard rails policies and then your governing policies are going to be the policies that are specific to how you as a board conduct business how you operate within the district and how your relationship to the superintendent and your Administration so those are going to be your governing policies and then delegated policies are going to be everything

[00:04:00]
thing that is is not a government policy goals policy or guardrail policy but it's still required by law to remain on the books or that specifically delegates action to the superintendent and the administration so the policy diet process takes you through your current policy book which is quite long it is it can be an intensive process and you look through with that lens of which policies do we want to keep which policies do we want to delete and which policies do we want to modify and that's kind of an overview of the policy diet process great thank you for that so I think we just wanted to create some space here tonight to talk through what that process would look like in our context and appreciate your answers to the questions that were sent in advance

[00:05:00]
and doesn't sound like they have any more questions and so I just want to see if there is anything else we need to talk with Miss Paws here miss pause if there's anything else you want us to discuss before we move on to the next agenda item which is the update on the board procedure manual yeah so if I was my understanding that your board may want to discuss what that might look like for Albuquerque Public Schools my recommendation has been that over the summer you actually can pull together and ad hoc committee my recommendation to the president is that that committee be led by you board member Gonzalez as a policy committee chair you were probably the most appropriate person to leave that process and the reason that you probably wouldn't want to do it as a full board is it can take a really long

[00:06:00]
so the actual review process can be divided and you can actually get through it pretty efficiently if you tackle it in an ad hoc committee structure and then bring recommendations to the board from that point I think we currently have it scheduled to begin in June and then for all of the final record for the work of the committee to go on over the summer and then final recommendations to be brought forward at the end of the summer kind of towards the beginning of next school year how you how you want to do it is really up to you all and that's just my recommendation for how the work be done based on my experience of working with boards also I was privileged to be the chair of policy committee so I've been able to learn a lot of lessons through Hands-On approach which

[00:07:00]
it can be beneficial for you all but ultimately you all have to be the ones to decide how you want to move forward who will be a part of the process and what that process will look like I do have one quick question so this is Yolanda just one quick question in that process with the ad hoc group starting with board members is it customary to also just involve some stuff so like would Jessica who's our policy lead for our board Services office also have a role in that and then we pull in staff as we needed so that's actually a great question so are my recommendation is that for all of your committees that you have some at least one member of Staff who can support the work of the committee and this can be just through technical through technical processes and whatnot now in the policy review there are actually three different three different

[00:08:00]
factors that you want to put on policy so there are three questions that are asked the first question is is this legally required there's only one person who can answer who should answer that question and that is your district attorney I can I can literally look at statute and say well this is probably legally required you can too but the attorney for the board is the one who you really should be depending on legal advice from so that's the first person and then there is a second question that is how what is the degree to which this policy when you answer this for every single policy in the book corresponds to impacting student outcomes we actually recommend that the that piece of the review be conducted by the superintendent and a staff that he leads generally it's not literally the superintendent who is doing the work it's usually

[00:09:00]
play the policy director and some combination of other people within the district that they decide on and then the third is the question is this policy does it require on more of a management expertise or more of a governance expertise and that's the specific review that the board conducts and they're in the questions that I the answers to the questions that I provided I actually included a link to a matrix that includes two rubrics that you may use one for the staff question and one for the school board question to make it easier you of course don't have to use that rubric but you're welcome to it definitely is a lot easier to use one that's already out there or two men one that's already out there versus trying to make your own and then across walk instrument that allows you to it applies to scores from both of those rubber

[00:10:00]
and the answers from the attorney in helping facilitate that final conversation thank you for that and again acknowledging that everyone has read the document I just want to make sure that there's any thing else about the process that people may have any questions about because we do also have an our agenda for tonight special issues item C which is actual appointment of the committee and we could talk through all of the process-oriented stress here before we get to that later in the agenda and so with that I know member Peterson you have a question or comment I do I'm curious about the experience of boards that have done this you know I have no aversion to work I have no version to lots of work but I do hate busy work and so I really would like some insight into what the boards on what they found in that process

[00:11:00]
I'll stop there yeah that's actually a really great question and it's usually the one that most people leave with so thank you for speaking up so most of the boards that I have either walk this through and even my own experience on my own board is that there is an easy way to do this and there is a difficult way to do this the easy way to do this is to start with everything goes out so we're going to delete everything and if we're for anything that we keep we need to justify a reason for keeping it so either it's legally required or it needs to threshold that the board has identified for the level of of governance expertise so that's pretty much going to include all of your governing policies and most of those you can generally expect to

[00:12:00]
modify so I know that there is one of the other things that you have on the agenda for tonight is to hear a report from the board operating procedures committee and so they're going through the work of looking at the different operating procedures that you have which are also called your bee policies and they're not necessarily going to be editing policy but I identifying here are the things here are the policies that we specifically think or we recommend to the board to take an additional look at so that can help get some of the heavy lifting out of the way but then you know your financial policies your you know your student student policies and everything that is not a governing policy or your or a delegating policy will pretty much be put into

[00:13:00]
policies that fall below that threshold of involvement that the board agrees that you want to have anything that goes there is going to go out so that's going to get rid of the vast majority of the busy work and save the most robust conversations for the ones that really have the biggest impact on student outcomes the other Global sort of question I have is that without a doubt over the years many policies are policies that were adopted to specifically addressed issues that come to us from the community and we do have a role I mean one of the things that's in this is saying that is part of our role is that outward look and the place that people come to so I'm just curious how bored have gone about juggling

[00:14:00]
all of those things and at the same time reducing the weight of the policies of girl yeah so actually the most the most effective boards that we are currently working with and have worked with in the past have actually relegated their their their policies related to the communities vision and values into their goals policies and their guards policies so additional policy that is selecting inputs that is articulating what should and shouldn't happen in the district how the district should or should not be managed those are the policies specifically that the policy diet is helping you get out of the way one of the ways that we often will

[00:15:00]
drive this to school boards is you know you've you've adopted your goals and you've adopted your guard rails they're going to be a lot of things that have done in the that have been done in the past by previous boards to know no ill-will no negative connotation to their work and they were responding to the the needs of the time but now we have created a new set of a new set of priorities and we want to focus on these priorities so any policies that are removing the focus from those very specific priorities we're going to we're still important but we're going to pass them to the superintendent to decide where they will where they will live and if they will live on from home is it like many things I think the devil will be

[00:16:00]
hotels there's lots of fun stuff when you're making sausage so are there other questions or comments related to the process while we have missed pause all right thank you and we have and Courtney Jackson you both have the fourth so what board members are doing is we are going through his Ashley alluded to earlier as we're going through the bee policies and those are the Board of Education governance and operations policies there are 19 of them and currently what we are what we're working to do what our goal is is to to

[00:17:00]
consolidate and organize them and to make them more transparent to the the public we are trying to kind of clearly delineate what our governing policies and what are management policies and what we're doing is we're going to use an outline from the Council of great City Schools to kind of incorporate all of those and I did just want to take a second to think Johanna for going through all of the bee policies and putting them into one document as as best that as she could as to where she thought they would line up so that it'll kind of be easier for us to go through and look at the difference is there but we're just kind of working through this and while do you want to do you want to talk about like our procedure what we're going to are going to well I think what we discovered is that there there are

[00:18:00]
we're working in tandem with the procedural directors which are more administrative and so that's why it's so great to have Johanna is Staff right because as we as Courtney and I get through bored a board focused portion of this for example today I looked at work and I was like oh my gosh this is all administrative work and and it's good to have it because she gets to look at our work and and it's a good way to double-check right to make sure that

[00:19:00]
we are but it will be a seamless operation and so that's that was the takeaway today among other things new technology not excluded but yeah we're just getting started and I think questions are going to arise they already have for me fascinating that we will have our own goals and guardrails I think I was just talking to me about this I don't want to create more work we need to be in alignment with the golden guard rails that are already on the books that we've already adopted so

[00:20:00]
is this going to take a couple of months and our goal is to have this document ready to go by August so that when cuz we're already starting to see new people and putting in to be interested to run for the board next year and so I guess this year and so we kind of want to have that document ready to go by August so that anybody who's interested in running for the Board of Education understands kind of the what the work really is and so this document will create just very singularly what it means to govern for the the Board of Education and to create a little bit more transparency and to kind of to one of your notes from before kind of take out some of the education needs and make it a little bit more public

[00:21:00]
facing and transparent accessible yeah absolutely thank you for the update are there questions from other members I have a question so based on what they're doing are we now going to follow this exact sample of what Ashley gave us as they go through theirs and as we have other committees as well in terms of the diet are you guys going to go through this using this manual or this template is for all of the other policies other stuff and then as we consider any new policy it would kind of be filtered through that okay yeah our templates a little bit different so yeah it's basically we're pulling out the bee policies so that the ad hoc committee can do all of the other you're welcome welcome

[00:22:00]
it's pretty foundational and so yeah I think it's going to take some deep Dives other questions is item C appointment with Ashley and just talking about the committee and also with board member Gonzalez to in terms of ad hoc committee and just a reminder that just because we set up an ad-hoc committee doesn't mean we don't have a voice in the process it's just that we have worker bees that are doing all this so we don't have to worry about scheduling meetings and stuff because we're not going to have a quorum of the board and so the ad hoc committee for this and folks already aware

[00:23:00]
who who it's going to be or what we're doing but I've asked a board member Peterson and board member to Romero to join board member Gonzalez on that process and so they're the ones that will take the Deep dive working with Ashley as they're going through that entire rubric and then we'll be reporting back to the board on progress as they move along recommendations by the beginning of the school year and we will have staff support from Johanna and Jessica and I think we're going to figure out a lot of it out as we go so acknowledging there's lots of questions we probably don't have answers to I will ask are there other questions about this specifically being the appointment of the ad hoc committee to oversee the policy review I think it's fantastic

[00:24:00]
I don't think we even know what they are yet yeah so it's a I am willing to engage in it so I think perhaps after we adjourn tonight the three of us can get together and look at calendars and figure out some times that we can propose to miss pause to maybe have a first conversation all right anything else on the ad hoc committee read so our next item for discussion is item D discussion on developing a budget policy and we had in our packets a model policy with a big water bottle on it that said sample and so this is really just for discussion only it's a model policy just to get your juices flowing about what are policy could look like so the goal for tonight is just to have

[00:25:00]
Apodaca and the finance team as well as anyone else who needs to be engaged in the process to put together a new budget policy and we will follow the existing policy development trajectory calendar so this is just preliminary discussions sort of the discussion before we have a first read so it'll be the first discussion development of a draft policy then the first reading and then feedback and then the final reading and vote for approval and then it goes to full full board for approval as well as the policy committee so we're very much just on the front end I just wanted to remind folks we're not editing the policy that's in here I know the dates that are in there don't make sense for what we're doing so ignore those dates we're not

[00:26:00]
the finance team needs to do their work we're not going to get into the weeds of that but really important for us to think about each one of us as individual board members what do we need to effectively execute our role as a board member when it comes to managing the budget which is one of the most significant pieces of our role as board members so if you looked at the policy which I know you all did There's sort of three big chunks in that model policy there the first to sort of about process and we've been talking a lot about process and we have been in our finance Community monthly getting the update with this PowerPoint and we know we have the little church in here that shows that the process goes year round so we're not talking about the process that the team does we're not going to get into their work we're going to talk about the process for us in terms of this calendar and again we've already made some changes so we're already getting the monthly updated in the finance committee meeting maybe we just want to systematize that

[00:27:00]
so what are the reporting documents what's the Cadence of reporting what's the degree of transparency again that we need to be able to do our work to serve as board members and then as you see there's a section in there on reserve so we could certainly address that as well or anything else and so for the purpose of our conversation just want to encourage everyone to take into consideration everything that we've learned so far through sosg everything that we've learned from Eden comic sessions everything we learned from the board and budget document that we reviewed a couple of weeks ago everything that we've learned from nmsba and those sessions as well as well as our experience and there are many members on the board have had a lot of experience not just on this board but in other boards as well so taking all of that into consideration if you can see through three questions so we're going to go through each question individually

[00:28:00]
framework that you think you'd like to see us adapter bring into our policy on budget we'll have some conversation about that the second is what's missing and again really thinking about what you need to help you do your role to really understand the alignment of budget to goals and guardrails to really understand the role of the budget to the relative to this District but what's missing from this policy what else would you like to see added I think particularly in the financial reporting section which is right now just kind of a Litany of things that could be listed there may be other things and then any other feedback that you have and so I'll just also acknowledged that this same conversation is happening with Papa and her team what did they need the board to do to hold them accountable to manage the policy etcetera as well so with that the questions again what do you like about this model policy what's missing from it

[00:29:00]
I'm coming from my right down on the what do you like about it and then we'll switch on the what's missing about it and go the other way so we will start with member Mueller Oregon on the what do you like about this model policy I mean what what I saw that that I liked honest was the the reporting part of it that it was just really detailed so that's that's really what I did truly like about it so that's simple thank you yeah I I think what really stood out to me when I was reading it was in under the financial reports specifically I really liked the her people expenditure and all of that I really liked that and then the section A very very clear section about

[00:30:00]
School site based budgeting I think that sends a very strong signal and to our community to our schools that we really are shifting how business is done so I really liked that section and I really liked this specificity of the reporting thank you remember yeah I think obviously in relation of keeping our Focus that this is strictly about budgets and trying to remove other variables out of it I would like I would like the part I almost ditto to what board member Jackson said about the purple and also knowing about the site based budgeting of knowing exactly how was school is looking to month and then throughout the year because if we have to make decisions long-term when we're talking about consolidating site or whatever the case may be we have this Dad in front of us already to know how a school is performing and what resources it's needing thank you I think

[00:31:00]
I was looking through it I mean I was just you know the reports I agree those are really helpful but I was just thinking about there are times when they are reporting revenues and expenditures here today we do see those pieces so I think for me it was it's nice that it's all just in its its stated clearly about where we are I think we have a lot of these pieces already it's just putting it in a policy in terms of the the pupil expenses and this is just my my experience is that I think that one can get really tricky because I think there's a whole lot of other variances that can get in there so I just want to be really cautious about sort of caution us on that too because sometimes it's not it's not as clear as it appears to be I mean I think it can get really tricky there so we do have on our

[00:32:00]
supper does a really good job of sort of outlining those things for us and I think it's just also being able to use this policy to direct our public where they can also find that information because I think supper does a really good job of helping us to to coordinate that so I think that's the and of course I probably jump to what's missing but I appreciate you know just everything that's in it I will say that I know from the public there's always a lot of concern around the general fund balance reserve and what that looks like being able to just put some more transparency around that in terms of How It's utilized and what it actually looks like isn't a bad thing so I like that as well that it does cover and it dresses that as well it's an important for us and we definitely have enormous costs on a month basis and so having that Reserve is really critical that's it for me

[00:33:00]
thank you remember Peterson like having written down and in policy some of the criteria criteria for Community input I think it's something that we've stripping strided to do I think it's good to have it written down I think the school-based budgeting site-based budgeting in fact is really minimally different from what's been in practice for a long time but I think having written down and clarified is always a good thing because there's when it's not there's always a level of distressed around the process even if that process has been standard operating procedure so I think clarifying some of the things that we have been doing

[00:34:00]
specificity is always good thank you remember I want to know how site-based budgeting now is different from the 1990s when when I was aware of it and I think it's important to know how it's different so that we can if at all but I'm sure there's been some tweaks in order to know next time nothing happens in a vacuum and so it would be helpful to know what are the different foods and

[00:35:00]
given our goals how will that impact the next step and and I would argue that this is helpful for the public to know as well and I would apply the same thing to the other categories thank you some pretty clear guidance on what we're supposed to be reporting and what you're looking for and I like that you keep saying you're going to work with the budget department so can I add one more thing I also like that we talked about the difference between

[00:36:00]
tell us what the heck's going on over there we spent over two top heavy and now we have a clear distinction of being able to justify the spending all right and we're going to go to the opposite direction Financial transparency was sort of the top thing that I liked all of the reporting so just hope that we can integrate that into our policy so we're going to go the other direction we'll start with first member Dominguez on What's Missing or what else do you need as a board member to help you affectively execute your role as someone who has responsibilities well I'll keep it simple I just I want to know history here how are things different now than they were back when we were

[00:37:00]
in the 1990s does that something you think needs to be in the policy or that's a reading individual learning goal that you would be interested in it now I think you know again I think the public needs to know this I mean that's been something that I have perhaps it's a teacher in me but when I go out to talk to people and they bring up budget concerns I give them a history lesson and I give them a lesson about where we get our money right and how much how much comes from the state etcetera so I am approaching this in the same manner to explanation of the broader history on New Mexico education Finance or something like that for which we've had those readings in the past

[00:38:00]
there's there's a couple of different things that exist so maybe it might be mindful about the links that are included to this in this absolutely okay remember Peterson so is their third question before I went on What's Missing the third was any other feedback and wish they could be on sort of this whole process that we're embarking on or okay so yeah I have several things in this is the items of purple expenditures by school compared to student growth what that what those things really and truly mean and how we how we actually should light on that rather than confusing

[00:39:00]
disorienting and I think some good examples are Mark Twain with incredibly huge very high need special education if we just put out the Mark Twain has this much money per student and here's the student growth it leads to a lot of confusion same thing with schools with high numbers of language Learners schools with high numbers of refugees and what that means context really does mean something and if we don't have the contacts it leads to really figure out how to eliminate programs in the strength of schools and not just have it goes straight to test scores

[00:40:00]
and and demographics because we in in many cases we're talking apples and oranges and when it comes to school expenditures we just have to take that into account a lot of that I think is what falls to the administration I mean it's probably not something that we as a board directly oversee thinking about our policy diet but it's something that we have to clarify for how it's addressed so that people don't feel inside there are a couple of other things that cost no dispute about the importance I do have a question if we say the district shall always maintain

[00:41:00]
less than 15% of annual local tax revenues in the general fund I don't believe there's hardly anything that we raised locally that's part of our general operational budget yeah so this is totally just from a different place but so if we want to have a component of our budget policy that mentions the reserve and puts in place a description of when it's used like I think it would be pretty high level not this is from the only other thing is we are highly constrained by the timing of the legislature and we also do have an obligation we do have a collective bargaining agreement and that collective bargaining agreement whether we are fully support

[00:42:00]
and so I'm not sure how we want that to be reflected in in policy it has no direct impact because that again is an administrative feature not a not a board governing feature but I don't know if we want to add something of a tip of the hat that sometimes our best intentions with budget or have constraints based on other factors and and how we want to that's it for now I have more opportunities going to work some magic magic for me

[00:43:00]
what would I what I really want to be able to describe in this policy as well is that it's not just an annual budget but it's a continuous budget and so somehow reflecting I love the wheel because it's sort of gives us that perspective of everything that's going on for a district just in terms of budgeting so yes we do approve a budget each year but we're also we're we're adjusting our budget as we're going along so I really want it to reflect that and sort of maybe start out with this like sort of a brief that I mean I like the wheel for that reason because it's sort of tells us and I think it's a good because I think some community members might want to come in at different points of time depending on what where we are in that cycle the other thing is that I would just I would also we do need to be reflective of how are budget

[00:44:00]
depending on what legislative cycle it is because New Mexico is really unique to that I mean I worked in a state where we got 24 months budget cycles and in New Mexico we get a 12-month budget cycle but we're also getting 12 month budget Cycles either in as early as February or all the way into you know to April so I think I think our our community needs to understand that and and maybe somehow just putting some pieces of education and that because it's going to impact our timing for us and Barbara's absolutely correct the timing on that with regard to like negotiations will be you know will be impacted by everything that we do so I mean I think that's the only thing for me that's really missing is just making sure that we're letting the public know how

[00:45:00]
do you know how a budget gets how the budget is is not we're not building something and I think also straight out of the Chute just saying that the majority of our budget is for personnel I mean I think we just have to say that we have to straight up say that it's like 90% of this budget is for personnel and so we just need to be able to straight up say that as well thank you I remember your room the only thing that came to mind and I am completely flexible this it's not something that I'm has to be but maybe a comparison to what other districts are size but their budgets look like because I think many times people see our dollar amount and they think like oh my gosh they don't need more money but when we're inside and we're seeing what we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis we're always advocating for more funding and to see how we compared to other districts our size similar

[00:46:00]
cuz knowing that we're like the one of these I think the second largest employer in the state you know to see how we compared with other districts throughout the country do we have other districts that have Native American Hispanic Ells to the degree that we do I don't know but it's a suggestion that we can take into consideration the majority of the budget that comes to us is very categorical they've already determined where that money is going to be spent we just have to apply it right well I think just part of it is there's explanation of budget and how it works and then there's policy on budget and so I think we just have to we can link to other documents and explain things but also just thinking through it's important to

[00:47:00]
all the external factors that influence how the calendar works or how the decisions are made or whatever and given those limitations or external factors what what is the vision statement for the district that is important to this board and Community as we develop the budget remember Jackson and the only thing that I will add specifically about this policy what's missing is just to me succinctness this one that we're looking at is is long and wordy and so you know just sticking with my my assignment but I will have other feedback when we come back down the road thank you said is it's so long and there are no definitions for certain things so I don't know how I could interpret it would be different and I'll just give you a few examples or other ones

[00:48:00]
does actual financial performance house that defined how is the school leader defined how is the district Financial administrator design Define how is student growth is an academic growth is it enrollment so those kinds of definitions I don't know I interpret them different than you might interpret them and so I think that with it being so long we're just going to have to you know we're going to have to make some changes on taking some of the wording out or make definitions and then if somebody else already said is trying to put some some links to link to some of our statute like you know 22/5 - 4 and I know this is from another district and it says that you know you can make desire changes but is that really implicit in the language of 22 - 5 - 400 we're just supposed to review and approve I mean this all those kinds of little things that that I see that could be you know that could be missing but I mean I have a whole lot of other stuff but I think it's

[00:49:00]
we'll figure it out and as Miss Martinez takes her first stab at the new version so just acknowledging this was only to get our juices flowing we're not even going to start with this and edit it it's just sort of what are potential things so is there anything else when you say you have other ideas that you can get important to have in this first draft in the first draft I think somebody already said this out of member Peterson when she was going through on the second to the last page the 123456 I mean that is just I think that's a tough that's just a tough one I think that's just going to be really a difficult thing to do and then this may be another thing is when it's kind of defining access it's defining we're not really defining what is a training

[00:50:00]
that we may need our administrators may need yet we're expecting certain tasks from them like one of them the superintendent having to establish a district differentiated funding formula I mean but we're not we're not requesting that that's just in here so that that I mean those kinds of things that need to kind of get taken out or relooked at and I think that one two three four five six need to just be really looked at again the 123456 is that the addition to these aboard will have access to the following management reports and I know maybe ours might look different right it probably wouldn't be these six so trying to figure out and I think that would be up to you know Jessica kind of look at what we're really pertaining to and I think to myself too

[00:51:00]
I think it is true that a budget is a statement of values and I think we need to have at least one sentence at the beginning that sort of establishes that the importance of the document the second is we talked the other night about forecasts and how helpful multiple your forecasts are so I think integrating that as well and I know there's lots of different factors that you around the budgeting but figuring out what type of forecasts are Finance team thinks are reasonable or possible and this is from a district that doesn't have sfg goals and guardrails and so there is a statement in here around the budget you know I can't work without the budget needs to align to the Strategic plan and the goals so I think for our purpose we do need to just to type in a little bit around the relationship between the

[00:52:00]
all right so I'm just going to open the floor for the third question which is like any feedback anything else anything we haven't talked about yet anything important to you if you think about the development of a new budget policy moving forward member Jackson So yeah so my other feedback was like the again the purpose of us creating a policy for budget is because this is a statement of our values right like what you just said but also were in student outcomes Focus governance where we are going to be monitoring and so what I really kind of liked about like the one through six with the poor people expenditures and all of that is that it kind of helps us to answer those questions that we need to be answering during monetary the the who the what the why the how and I am totally cheating right

[00:53:00]
governance manual pulled up on page 20 and some of those questions that we need answered could be answered through you know implementation of a policy that already gives us the answers to those questions like who is struggling the most you know by having a pupil or seeing that were you know we have a big expense over here and yet low low test or low student outcomes why are they struggling I think having some of that information allows us to answer the who it allows us to answer what work and what what didn't work so I I my other feedback is I really like having statements like that in the budget policy because it ties back to the monitoring that we're going that we are going to do and helps us to better shift

[00:54:00]
and drive the the the momentum of the district towards student outcomes if the policy and the government structure is aligned thank you my feedback any other questions comma the only thing that comes to mind is in relation to this it just reminds me of stuff I've done previous and I'll just give you the terms that we've used before is plan do review you know if we plan on the budget we actually implement it at what point do we ever go back to see did it work that we actually put funding towards this program towards you know this particular resource School employee whatever the case may be to know if we got the outcome that we would really expected to see so just to review process of how we're spending our money any other comments

[00:55:00]
it would be really good to have not in policy but this is something that served risen up through this conversation about really helping the community understand budget and things like it's real hard to compare District to District even though I think it's valuable thing to do but it's It's tricky because we rely so heavily on state funding that lots of times people will compare New Mexico to another state where perhaps only half of their budget for schools comes from the state so when you compare what's the state funding it looks completely different from one state to another

[00:56:00]
Global information packet and if we could figure out a way to really clearly succinctly and in an accessible way explain what the budget process is for us the relationship with the state the relationship with local funding all of those things and to do it in a format that's not totally overwhelming is a challenge for communication but something that we should probably take on because I think that it really does illuminate where we are the other thing in this is this is the pie in the sky this is the kind of but if we were really doing we would start at the school level

[00:57:00]
and then figure out how to find it but that's not how we're able to defend schools because that's not how we receive our funding but I think there again it's important to help people understand that fact where are the gaps and since we're doing our guard rails that what we believe is always comes back to you thank you I was just going to add that flew out of my head a little bit here go back to superintendent you were going to go to him first it's going to be a quick comment oh okay so you better get ready okay I am

[00:58:00]
what's been itching to me is we saw the sample policy just you know late last week and we kind of read it and there was definitely some reactions to it and so I was sort of sent her tonight with you know if you can if you can so it's interesting that almost all the elements that we picked up as areas of concern you guys have sort of pointed out and said about this what word about this word about that so I just want to like I said I like the concept that you guys are saying we will work with Doc in the budget team that absolutely has to happen because there's certain things in the sample plan that really just logistically and and there's work for us and like you said this is not from here this is and they've been to the genomics training this is nothing that they hadn't heard of or seen before but I also like the fact that says buy a certain Year we're not saying in the next 10 minutes that we have to do this so there were elements of that just remember none of that is in the DJ plan so there is an element of the the shift to

[00:59:00]
School based budgeting is in that plan so those would be there as I just like to highlight from the administration side but I think integrating that and then also some of the broader work with ERS and just that brought that whole time frame figuring out how we can mesh all of this and I think it will tie in really neatly with that work with the IRS and so make sure that happens so my comment was going to be around that help because I know I've had to do this many times with the public because one is they just see that big old giant budget but there's a huge component of it that's tied to Capital and capitals in a completely different way and it's utilized it I mean it doesn't it doesn't really get back to it in as a people count for that particular for all the schools because it's only factored in for those places where we're actually going to spend it and it's only for that period of time because once the expenditure is made beneficial so there isn't a

[01:00:00]
so I think we just need to be really you know when we talked about Capital money that we need to think about first we're raising it and you know what what we go out to try to raise and what we actually raise because there's a there's also a discrepancy there but when there's an increase of a pupil cost at a particular school it might be because we actually had an infusion of capital money and we were spending it but it's not going to be the actual cost moving forward because once that expenditures done it's made and it doesn't it's not going to be a new but it's not going to have added budget for the next year so that all these confuses I know a lot of the public because they'll see that and they think that we're just you know sitting on some money because I understand that we don't have it here I just will go through these really quickly is

[01:01:00]
Romero had said should accountability be included in here I think somehow that it probably should be that we need to just make sure and look at you know we might be asking a lot I know this might change somewhat what does it cost to be to carry out this policy cuz there's always a cost do we have the staff to be able to do everything that's being asked of them so we need to make sure we have staff to do it and the money to pay for that so I think that's important and then somebody already said this make sure that this is all aligned with our goals and guard rails and then just because the school board is going to have access to very you know whatever reports we decide Financial reports doesn't mean that we may have the understanding so we need the training to really understand how to read whatever kind of reports because they can give me a report on or what the heck it means so I think that just because you have access I don't want access if I don't know

[01:02:00]
what I'm looking at so don't mind thank you so I just miss Martinez want to see if there's anything from your perspective and you follow up or clarifying questions that you have or if you have enough to move on and work your magic and then get into more details as we go further into the process and so with that the I will announce the next policy committee meeting which is Monday June 5th at 5 p.m. in the community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex the committee is scheduled to review the aps handbook for Student Success for 20223 and 2024 during that policy committee meeting which is June 5th and with that this meeting is adjourned okay now
