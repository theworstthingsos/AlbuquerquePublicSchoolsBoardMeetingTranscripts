[00:00:00]
the welcome to the Board of Education special board meeting I would like to call this meeting to order as king may I have a roll call please here period for the October 18th 2023 special Board of Education meeting workshop on the superintendent search the October 18th 2023 special board of education education meeting Barb

[00:01:00]
Peterson yes yes Yolanda Monterey Cordova yes okay so I think we're missing a few folks but hopefully some folks will join us our first so what we're going to do is just discussion today phase one of the superintendent search and I'm delighted that we have Dr Walt Cooper here with us from Mcpherson and Jacobson LLC of executive Recruitment and development search from that was selected to help us with this process so I'm going to turn this over to Dr Cooper who is going to lead us through this conversation of our phase one and give us all the good tips and strategies and activities as we're moving forward so welcome Dr Cooper to Albuquerque Public Schools and welcome to Albuquerque all right so you have the floor and let's go ahead and get started thank you I

[00:02:00]
I did not log into the zoom meeting it's for the 5:00 meeting it said was the invitation so I don't know that I'll need to do that unless there's something that you would like me to share on my screen we do have your hand out with us but I mean it would be great to have if we could have it zoomed up so because we've got Barbara Peterson we've got board member Peterson who doesn't have access and this so what you have in front of you is email to everybody next week okay all of the attachments are the same and in the second order the only difference is don't have the annotated agenda that I had sent in my in my previous okay so again thank you for this opportunity we're looking forward to the opportunity to work with you all in the search for your next superintendent we know this is

[00:03:00]
without a doubt the most important undertaking that Boards of Education are faced with and so we want to do everything in our power to make this a success for for you and the students and staff and community of APs so what we are doing today is what we call in for those of you that were that either saw our proposal or that we're part of the screening we call this phase one of the five phases of our search the search itself is actually we consider that through four phases Facebook reviews of finalists and your selection facebook.com

[00:04:00]
we'll talk about advertising we'll talk about selection criteria that probably will take the Lion's Share of our time today talk a little bit about stakeholder feedback and stakeholder engagement salary determination those kinds of things so I will walk you through that each of those in the agenda one by one but the first in is it in my calendar or email hey bear with me for one moment so the first item on the agenda is

[00:05:00]
just to review expect a process and expectations for the search the process for the search really are is the are the remaining items on the agenda for today those things that I just mentioned the the most important part I think about this first item on the agenda is for an opportunity for any of you to if you have any questions before we launch into this if there was anything in the material that was unclear if there's anything that will help you progress through each of these things today as we as I said build this blueprint for the search I want to make sure we have an opportunity to address those right up front so that that nobody is surprised or or confused as we go through each of those steps so any questions at this point just for the record board member okay so let's Jump Right In

[00:06:00]
and we'll start with the establishing the timeline and notice on the agenda it says Benchmark timeline and as I said in my preliminary information this week we can one of the things that we pride ourselves on in the in the work that we do with boards is being very flexible know we have a standard protocol you saw that in our proposal and most searches are you know they're they're more similar than they are different but no two are exactly alike so whatever we need to do to best meet the needs of the Albuquerque community and you as a board we will do that and one of those one of the primary places where that happens is with the timeline and so we've established this draft and as I said we can talk about and move dates around however we really need to understanding that some of these dates are contingent upon dates that have either come that that are before or after

[00:07:00]
on the timeline and so they have to move together others are independent we can put them wherever we want to put them if that makes sense so this timeline that I've laid out here as preliminary is obviously you see the phase one board meeting today after we do our work here I will go back home to Colorado Springs and craft the information that we what we settle on in terms of advertising venues and the search criteria and all that other sort of stuff I will put that into the actual posting that will then go on the person Jacob website to all partners and all of the advertising that we that we decide on and we will have that up next week so as of you know middle of next week with the search will be live if you will and we will start collecting applicants from applications from Canada's the other things the other two dates that I

[00:08:00]
have on the next two dates are the online stakeholders survey and these are are two dates that that are easily the most flexible so when later on in the agenda we're going to talk about the design of a stakeholder survey what we actually want to include on that and then we can come back and talk about the specific dates relative to I learned this afternoon once I got to Albuquerque I've learned about the dates of the the regional Town Halls that are going to happen so we may want to be strategic around the beginning and the end of those with that stakeholder so I put between November 1st and November 12th but those are really no more than placeholders at this point we can we can we can start and stop that online survey whenever whenever we want to so we'll come back to those dates once we actually talked about the stakeholder engagement process the application submission deadline that I've proposed is the 12th of December

[00:09:00]
so that leaves this open about 7 weeks which is ample time and pretty typical in in these processes and we don't wait until the 12th of December my colleagues and I don't wait until December 12th to start reviewing and vetting candidates we do that dynamically as they come in so you'll notice then within about 3 or 4 days of the applications closing we will then identify what we call the the short list of candidates that we will invite to produce video interviews so now that we we typically think about five or six in a search of this size we can do many more than that but there's there's no magic number the video the cost of the individual video interviews is insignificant I think it's 50 dollars an interview something like that it really doesn't matter

[00:10:00]
but we will then be ready to turn out turn loose with those invitations by the 15th of December and then we give folks about a week to respond those interviews are three questions and they're they're not three questions that are really detailed and unique to Albuquerque we asked them basically to highlight their interest and why they think they're a fit for Albuquerque what do they know about the district and the challenges and why are they will experience to handle that these are not Dynamic interviews they're one way interviews the the candidates are giving an invitation to an online platform third party platform we manage and they produce those interviews then phase four if you look at the at the projected January 8th so if you remember from the president those of you that were part of the presentation that I gave in our proposal

[00:11:00]
we really said we Engage The Board primarily before we get to the interview for that goes without saying we Engage The Board twice significantly Engage The Board the first is today and what we're doing right now in Phase One the next is Space 4 and that's when I and and my colleagues potentially some of my colleagues will come back and we will with you in executive session review the video interviews the video responses from all of those candidates that were invited with the goal of the board identifying from that group of candidates who they would like to interview in person either as preliminary candidates chapter 2 if you will or as finalists right depending on how many steps along the way how many times you want to engage in person with candidates before you actually get to your

[00:12:00]
the final round after which you will debrief and select your candidate so if I if I read the calendar correctly you all are back the week everyone is back on the on the ground the week of January 5th after the holidays is that correct the school calendar I think so January 8th again that's a date that we could that date really is not contingent on anything other than having to be obviously after the video interviews are due back the first date of the regular board meeting because that's a that's an organizational meeting for the board following the the election and you know the selection of the new executive team and so on and so forth so but it sounds like we have some flexibility and what I'm hearing from you is that a lot of that's just going to depend on how we get those things that's okay so you know they're there it's January

[00:13:00]
January 3rd is the reorganization meeting so yes we can I said earlier Sunday so that the only thing really were Bound by their number one your desire to have candidates present at the regional Town Halls that you have on your planning calendar for January so we'll want to work sort of backwards from those dates once you set those days because I imagine if those dates aren't set now they will be soon is that a good assumption and it seems to me like that's because I'm thinking of like that first selection or review board so that we've got to give them an opportunity and as you and I had spoke before you came here so

[00:14:00]
we will have our elected officials identified before the election is November 7th so sort of looking at how do we bring in the newer board members as part of like a search committee that you had mentioned a way for them to sign like confidentiality forms and so on and so forth to be part of that so they're not just coming in completely cold in January so there's a way to to Really sort of bring them along in the process so that when we hit January and we have Regional Town Halls they'll they'll be on on board I don't like so the regional town halls with the final candidates that conversation where did that was that coming from the the okay do we have a calendar

[00:15:00]
the stakeholder meetings in November were determined cuz those were dates that were shared today on the 13th and the 16th of November but the meetings in January I don't I don't remember the calendar that says the months that they're in but we haven't picked the dates okay so what will need to do then is the board is go back and sort of finalized those pieces because I think that's going to help us yes so that because it's all going to be connected to this okay so it would we have some time yeah right it's also a tricky time though too because families are just I mean we've got school starting back up and so so I think we just need to be thoughtful about what that means for the community members as they're coming back in January but what I heard from Dr Cooper today in our pre meeting is that

[00:16:00]
we've got a pretty generous timeline here too so everything would just get adjusted by a week or two and so you know our our timeline of having name the selected candidate by the end of January is aggressive but it doesn't necessarily need to occur at that point and at that juncture because we do have some time that we could build some things in there so so I'm feeling pretty confident about where we are but once we get to those Regional Town Hall meetings I think we need to be really sensitive to the fact that we're going to ask schools to be part of that process and so so we'll get back to you on making sure that we're really clear on that I would just say as you look at the proposed timeline here I was assuming that that would be someplace the third week of January or later okay because we'll also need to sort out what you words wishes are around preliminary interviews

[00:17:00]
we do those virtually we can probably turn those around in a day after we come together to review the videos if you want to bring candidates and then obviously now things are protracted because we have to allow folks you know opportunity to arrange travel so I would just encourage as you look at those Regional Town Hall dates later in January is better than earlier in January both from our perspective and exactly what you just mentioned go ahead I just had a question about the video invitations and how you think that will go considering that there could be three new board members and what kind of input they're going to have into that what kind of involvement are they going to have and is it appropriate to have it before they have you know taking off on January very good question so I think it's absolutely they can have as much involvement in this as you will

[00:18:00]
and as the governing body right and I think it would be perfectly appropriate because in many searches that we do the board appoints a search committee sometimes the board is part of a search in conjunction with a search committee sometime the search committee is the first cut and the board doesn't even participate in that in the search committee brings the next level so I think as long as we understand what the rules of engagement are and and everyone who was going to be engaged with a candidate whether that be virtual or in person agrees to the confidentiality of David with our firm I'll get to that in just a minute it's really it's almost a moot point in New Mexico given the transparency laws and and the open records in but in many places are held in confidence that becomes a much bigger deal like I said it's really almost Superfluous to go through that exercise and new

[00:19:00]
but yeah I think it's absolutely appropriate to have whomever you decide to have around the table or in the room as we as we go through reviewing will work through some exercises about how do we identify implicit bias and evaluating candidates and what is the rubric that we're using to score candidates obviously you can't blind score a video interview right but we do we want to make sure that we are objective as possible and and keep bias out of this process as best we can so we can go through the that exercise and involve folks in reviewing candidate videos with whomever you know if there are other senior level administrative folks that you want to have us part of that sometimes that happens other times that you know it's like I said we're flexible on that but in terms of appropriateness we've we've done that many times that's why I would want to make sure that they were involved it will be you know somebody that

[00:20:00]
so I just want to make sure that the new board members would be able to take part in that I just remember when I first came on and we were going through that and everything was kind of almost done and so it made it and I applaud you for that because that's that's certainly important so with that are there any on at first glance are there any significant dates that we need to you know Circle twice this really is not going to work understanding that some of these will be fluid but let's say you know it's just not going to work and we need to back up December 22nd December just because of you know it's just a hard month for It's A Hard month for me it's a hard month for our families there's you know the testing going on for

[00:21:00]
how old is it's a whole bunch of stuff going on and so that would be I think difficult for our families and it would be difficult for I think this is my really is there really isn't much about us because they have to provide the responses that December 22nd date they're very specifically because that often is prior to the break right questions three minutes per question so if they use the full-time it's 9 minutes so there's really nothing that's happening for us in our level board member know the next time we would really significantly engage the board by this time line would be January 8th and if we want to move that date around a little bit once we

[00:22:00]
don't know who's going to be seated and see their schedule and all weekend I would encourage you not to move it much because we're going to publish this with the posting right and everybody knows that dates can change but if that change you know if we if we change things by 2:30 or 4 weeks that's significantly impacts the path of the candidates and we don't want to do that so can you tell me so I know on the video invitations to selected candidates you say that could be that's going to take place after the stakeholder meetings Etc and then we will have the executive session in in January so when we're talking about those selected candidates that's going to be based on what we or you heard as well from the in-person stakeholder meetings as well as from the sitting board and if we include the incoming board members and I just want to make sure that they are

[00:23:00]
included in this that it's just important to me that they will be included in that those selected candidates as well but a point of clarification cuz what I heard from you Mr Cooper was that those video invitations to selected candidates would be candidates that you all would they're the ones that are doing here in a little bit so it's not it's not board members that are making that first selection on that so and what I want to emphasize here is that even for candidates that are running or that have already been elected we've got these in-person stakeholder meetings we've got opportunities for them to to participate and be a part of just as much as we're going to be a part of those conversations right nothing happens right okay so but I just wanted to make sure that we were clear that those video invitations

[00:24:00]
based on what they've heard and the candidates that they vetted and all of the things yes okay thank you that's newly elected orientation or newly elected something like cuz you mentioned that we would want them to sign confidentiality because we're going to be doing orientation anyway so I think we should just at least name on here that there's going to be a new newly elected board member we're doing it right after election so you if you would like for me to join virtually for that orientation for a small portion to talk to him

[00:25:00]
either one of my colleagues or I can certainly do that we can certainly would even be another reason to include it here on this timeline today and we've we've come up with the we don't have a firm date yet because we have to get it you know just solidified with Senior Management staff internally to make sure it's a good day but we've got a couple of dates floating but we'll get that to you soon as possible and that would be a perfect time for us with the new candidates to agree to have them sign that confidentiality forms and whatever else we need to do is part of the selection process what I would really like to do and this this primarily is driven by number of candidates and where we are is to share those video clips we have a manner in which we can protect those ensure those video clips with board members prior to when we convene in that face for meeting so you can look at them at least once maybe twice

[00:26:00]
and then we can take a deeper dive when we're all together around this the same table but so will and that's really the the primary driver of that is just this confidentiality affidavit but as I said before that's almost a moot point so I'm just laughing because like one of the things that I know board member Dominguez and I was like we have watched so many videotapes recently around just some of our training so it's like what 30 minutes of video tape watching or an hour and I know it's a little bit harder to like get yourself in there do you have any questions at all concerns about the timeline that's been presented that sounds reasonable to me

[00:27:00]
in case some of those dates do change so will it still be posting right it's sort of sets out there we can go in and change that but operationally yeah we can we can move these around the only thing that gets a little bit tricky is once we've committed to Canada's around their schedules okay great thank you so let's talk about very quickly about the next witches the advertising so that next item in your packet is the checklist of what we would what we would recommend so as part of our contract and what we've agreed to those are what we've what we might

[00:28:00]
identify there with the check marks as the yes you are a member of the Council of Greater City Schools that's always on the checklist but that only applies to those school districts that are a member so we will we will post it with them as well the two primary drivers for well there are three number one our website or website gets a couple of hundred thousand hits a month but folks have to know and and and and and and and and and have to go search for that information the most traffic we get is from aasa superintendents Association and then top school jobs dot education week those two are included here those two are included in your contract will post that for 30 days starting as soon as the posting goes up and as I said

[00:29:00]
will will provide a link for an announcement for you to put on the aps website I would assume you'd want to do that your comic books can create a superintendent search presence on well I know that's already there but add to that with the link or whatever else and so really the only thing the question here is is there are there other avenues for example do you want us to post this announcement in the journal for example you know those those kinds of more local types of things we get we probably could just do I'm looking at our comms person over there we probably could just write some sort of editorial or something they say hey it's official it's started here's the place to go look you know where is posted on the website what didn't used to be National this would be the national search anyway but what didn't previously worked National searches

[00:30:00]
the only thing that I would like to I mean that I think it's just important to me and it may not be to anybody else but the the association of Latin Latino administrators and superintendents like just because of you know our culture I think that was the best and that's an oversight on my part because you know that and also the National Alliance of black school educators are both included in our standard postings is included as well as the so I just didn't get the exit in there and I don't know how much how much you do on on the way which is also the National Association of Latin elected officials and I know that a lot of times that goes on I'm on their board of directors and so that might be something that you if you could look into that one but

[00:31:00]
Alice would be kind of a for sure for all of our searches we include both of those thank yous that's fine so chocolate has a pretty good footprint in various regions and so if you want to include chalkbeat for for this specifically we certainly can do that is that see everybody it's usually the cost for that it's about it's about a 1000 dollars for 30 days so I think it would be helpful for you to come back with the cost for all of these so that we can look at that before making the decision

[00:32:00]
specifically on developing women in education and superintendents and then there's superintendent development organizations like the road Center at Yale so I would want to just include Outreach to all of these organizations that are working specifically on developing superintendent candidates so for example the road center right that they don't actually have a job posting or we just send the information to them they distribute that so we always include Roadies in their most most of what we learned with most other like Chiefs for change for example will pick up on the ASA hosting and will will forward those good but we can certainly reach out to those that even don't

[00:33:00]
have specific job posting boards but maybe they have distribution list that they would include this that's what the roads are that's what what road is they they just put it in there they're blast but we get a number of applications from Brody still so easy even though their numbers are dwindling but you can just come back to us with whatever the price with adding the ones that never Gonzalez and the ones I know he said all this is already in there and nabc and then if you just look at Noah and 70 just and those are both six weeks postings just Baseline so the others are 30 days of America's School

[00:34:00]
Southwest Colorado wework specifically with the Ute Mountain Ute Council and just said here it is please help distribute this among your we didn't get any traction from that but it really is more those are more informal networks that if we're if they can connect with our tribal leadership and also through establish communication channels through your Comics which I'm sure are pretty extensive so we'll provide the same template and connection to the app to the online application platform in that initial posting to your Communications and anybody else that wants it right just for put it on your Facebook presents or whatever it might be and it's all the same information thank you so yes I will I will get that back to you very shortly board member Peterson online do you have any comments on the section are you good

[00:35:00]
I think we need to advertise as broadly as possible I think that it will come down to how do we think about them and look at the input that we get from our community so I think I have no problem with what's been proposed thank you as an initial step very good segue is to talk about stakeholder feedback and stakeholder groups and the next attachment for the next document in your packet is a sample of very very simple some simple it's not simplistic the very simple survey questions that we like to use

[00:36:00]
names of the online survey it goes beyond just putting out the survey however because we will also pose these questions however we just we in concert with you decide to do this in the stakeholder groups we also asked the same car that the Baseline questions to this the sample that you have in front of you and what we would propose is that we do the online survey through K12 insights it doesn't cost the district anymore this is part of what we do for our larger our larger clients because they have with smaller clients we manage our own online survey and we do text analysis but it's it's a more simplistic approach so in larger districts where we think we will have quite a number of participants data analysis and their their presentation of this information is much more robust and so we like to keep it at five questions or less we

[00:37:00]
more than five questions participation rates appointment very quickly so what you have in the sample is actually the the the survey the the populated survey in a district of similar size in Arizona that were were working with right now we can ask and and frame the questions however you would like to have them frame but what I would I would say is that the third question on this which asks what are the skills traits experiences and characteristics that this person must be successful I would highly encourage you to use that question we use that in I can't think of the search that we've done where we haven't used that and then the next question which asks the community's perspective one

[00:38:00]
most significant challenges the new superintendent will face when she or he takes takes over the rule anything else we can you know we can we can add however you would like to add that first question is the district wanted to put that in there just for you know the general information the first time I've seen that question asked but it's you know it's a simple click the Box move on there might be something else of that nature that you all would like to ask we can substitute that we can take it out however you would like to do that you're talking about that perception yes that is how important to you think perception is to picking up I don't I don't think it's I don't think it's very important at all in terms of picking the superintendent here's what I would tell you though what we've heard so there are really three critical

[00:39:00]
this is the most important pieces to the stakeholder feedback report in this the data that will be generated from this the first it well they're actually for so the first one is it really helps the Board because we're going to work through this selection criteria exercise here in a few minutes right once we get the stakeholder feedback it really helps the Board sort of as a as a litmus test were we on the same page or is there significant Divergence between what we think is most important and what we had set forth in our criteria and what we heard from our community I will tell you that almost never happens there's there's pretty good Synergy the right conversions there the second thing it helps us significantly as we start to compare Canada that list of all the applicants down to First Cut secondly it really helps us and these are the two most important I'm going in order helps us to craft interview questions

[00:40:00]
because we want to make sure we don't we don't want to have you know we'll have a script of of 1618.20 questions right that you all will run through as the board in their their final interviews we don't want to have that script fully populated with just very high level high altitude generic interview questions about leadership so you know those those have a place but we really want to make sure that we we dive deeply and that very closely those things with candidates that are most important to their being successful here in APS so without your input here and without the communities input through the stakeholder we're working in a vacuum there we're working in void lastly and this gets to your point the what we hear search after search after search from selected candidates so whoever it is that you hire their review of the stakeholder feedback is absolutely critical as a piece of their transition

[00:41:00]
into the into the roll helps them know what's really going well helps them know which questions they need to ask right off the bat you know what things they better not mess up and what things they better hit the ground running and be prepared to address and so to that point in terms of helping the candidate maybe assess the landscape a little more closely I can see where a question like this would be beneficial you asked about selecting the superintendent it's not going to help that much right now that said I'm sure that you have a lot of other data points from Community surveys from you know Town Hall whatever else that would also be of great benefit to the selected candidate in terms of transitions so again it's it's really it's really up to you whether you would like to have that information as part of this process or not so can I just ask quick question

[00:42:00]
so barring the first question is how well do you perceive the district if we took that one I'm just I'm just looking at the other questions so these other three questions are those pretty standard or so those are the standard questions that you have been asking consistently okay and board member Gonzales well I was going to say it doesn't seem to me that we need one and two so if we're asking how well do you perceive the district and then we all have please explain it seems that that kind of replicates community so if they click very well they would be telling us with very well if they could be telling us the second answer and if they need to stop what you don't see him here thank you is the logic involved in the survey that only population please explain only population period

[00:43:00]
what are the skills trades experiences and characteristics of person must possess is not a good question to ask and the guidance that we received is then you just sort of end up with the list of qualifications that the Unicorn candidate and those all make sense and then you try to find that unicorn candidate and that's not actually helpful versus the flip of that question which was what do you not want so that was the guy that we received like don't ask the Unicorn question asked what you not want question because that's clearer and limits more so I'm just curious could we ask both like what do you want to see in the superintendent and then what do you not want to see in the superintendent absolutely I mean it could be one question and then you slash or don't want to see I'm not an expert in this but I think what they would tell you is that that becomes problematic

[00:44:00]
that the survey question itself has to be very specific in terms of response so I think I think your suggestion of asking both separate questions and then you look for both conflicts and and consistencies across those two right but that's what K12 can that their analytics can do that much better than you know we can and must be going if we kept one we'd be going to 6 then and you said five was that I I think I would think we could cut anything else I did want to ask I mean I'm just and this is more for the board you know for us for our consideration how do you feel about the language level of these questions given our community to and some of the you know English language learner or I mean you did mention you could translate this into Spanish so that that wasn't it

[00:45:00]
that wasn't an issue but I'm just curious from your perspective I'm not I'm just what your thoughts are on it so my initial reaction so positive attributes is hard to know what that means it was also one of the reasons why I wanted to cut that one skill Street Experience characteristics I do recall on the previous search people were giving a list because we sat on our Thanksgiving table and we read out the list and then we all argue over it so I think there might be an opportunity to to like if you don't know what those means you could click and probably even go back to like oh this is what that is but we have all that from the previous search just a couple years ago I would assume yeah so and I'm familiar with with that approach and typically the way that I the way I understand it is the reason these are open-ended responses is

[00:46:00]
cause of the technology and the ability to analyze the open-ended responses to click to get a definition of what a what is skills trades experience is characteristics mean yes and that would include like examples and I admittedly do not know if that's okay within the the way that the platform is projected or not but I can certainly find out and if not perhaps you know we can we can reword this with some parenthetical information I was looking at Monica's well I don't think she's got the questions in front of her but if she would you join us at the table she is our Communications person so Monica might have some some thoughts for us on

[00:47:00]
the framing of these questions and what some of our experience has been this Gonzalez about the first question you know we we could very simply reword that or what are the best things about Albuquerque Public Schools that that you would share with people or you know that we can watch the new superintendent to knows we can put we can do however you think works best I think we have a survey results so thank you for that but I

[00:48:00]
I think that given the caliber of the candidates that you're looking for that the questions are not worded in any way that we could go to the public or to the police would go to our parents to our community to respond and to provide then I would want to work a little bit on being more specific so when we say how well do you perceive the district is performing your perceived gets to perception which I know we're looking for but I think we want something a little deeper and it just doesn't tell us exactly what we're asking here maybe just simplify it a little why are the what are the positive attributes the school district and community that might attract I quality candidates you know what again I think the word is qualities right what are the positive qualities of the school district and community that might attract high quality candidates I probably have to spend a little more time on

[00:49:00]
I guess because I'm even thinking of like a candidate for what I mean I don't want them to be confused I want it to be very specific this is about a new superintendent and if you would like we could call a small take a little bit of time but it'd be worth the effort if you want us to put together a small focus group to to look at the questions just to give you an idea of people who don't work in APS and how they see these questions and I understand why the questions we asked what I want to make sure we get feedback from everyone from the best candidates can we go back to the first question very quickly I didn't I didn't hear a whole lot of love for that in general given the purpose right the targeted purpose of this process

[00:50:00]
so if there's agreement that we can just eliminate the first question because that data may be available through some other at some point in time some other venue then we can just focus on the the three narrative questions and make those as specific and targeted as possible because you went through who that would really help it would help you to come up with you know interview questions it would help the superintendent to understand yeah so actually the first question really doesn't help me at all it helps it helps the selected candidate potentially but my guess is that information in general is going to be available in other places so if we can agree that that will eliminate that then Monica and I can work on what the actual best text for some narrative questions would be in circle back cuz we don't we don't have to launch this immediately because we're not the proposed launch on this is not

[00:51:00]
until November 1st and I think that would even get pushed around the corner but we're already in October 6th after that okay I get it oh October I mean again I think just some things to get rid of the first one like it I don't think it has to be that complicated

[00:52:00]
any other thoughts board member Peterson cutting to you just you have any thoughts I think it's really tricky to get valid input just because the people who are going to reply I think are are subset of the community and so I just I think that what the feedback that we get will be important and we need to look at but we need to really keep our ears open for other parts of the community that may not reply in this format so it's always hard I mean it's the exact same challenge

[00:53:00]
the Strategic plan is always the same challenge for making sure that we get a real valid input of the community so I mean I don't have any particular strong feelings about these questions I just I think that we need to continue to think of ways of broadening what kind of input we get and it's absolutely correct cuz what the survey doesn't tell us is like what communities have responded I mean we know parents but we don't know which parents or which students so so I mean but what I've also seen is that you're right I mean I think there's a group of very active parents and students and staff that will engage in that but there is definitely a group that often gets marginalized in the process and they don't they just don't respond for whatever reason it is

[00:54:00]
today's weather for Access or it's a lack of ability to really engage with the questions so I know one of the things that I talked to Dr Cooper about before that I think there's all that intentionality in between all of this of how there's particular Outreach to other groups too so that we can make sure that we've got you know capacity to to sort of go in with those groups and make sure that we give them an opportunity to either we can listen and we can hear to what you know what their input is but we're definitely going to have families on the fringes that are not going to respond to the to the survey and the voice is important but how we get to that voice I think is probably more important so is it possible to identify themselves they probably won't do it I mean I think there's that they may not even do it at all so if they identify themselves they won't even do the survey it's like how do you get them to do the survey we

[00:55:00]
so on the proposed we asked for their highest level demo right so are they a parent or they a teacher or the Community member we asked for that we can we can add if you wanted to ask you know drill down questions more specifically in terms of neighborhood or constituency you know District director districts whatever it might be I just would caution you that this stakeholder feedback is not selecting your superintendent I want to be because it serves several purposes as I outline But ultimately it is it is not meant to be an objective process right that lines up the criteria by which you use a checklist to select your superintendent it just is not so it's it's a critical it's it's important for us to have this opportunity we use this at a number of stops

[00:56:00]
the way but it is just one one data point really in your whole decision-making process so we can I guess it does seem that we should be able to add more demographic questions even if they're optional so at a minimum I think Grayson is important and that would show us if 95 percent of our respondents are white then we got to go back and do some more work so I would encourage that the other thing is just on the telephone you are question I had a question that are here because parents Educators student all make sense to me is this Community member but superintendent's cabinet seems so this was this this was the the criteria that was identified by the district that the sample came from and they wanted that on there okay that's why I said this is this is just a sample that came from an Arizona District

[00:57:00]
we can we can plug and play anything you want into this I just wanted to give you an idea of what what was currently out there in a semi period we have through social media our board members will send out all our neighborhood associations and everything so I think we do that but I think it would be very helpful as I mentioned to have a sense of how we're performing against key metrics so that if need be we can do additional Outreach so I don't know if you could work that in here just add just like the the characteristics of the individual just so that we know I'm saying like it's okay and at 7 days

[00:58:00]
I wouldn't have administrators on there or superintendent's cabinet and for support staff I would put School staff because you have teacher but then support staff does everybody else in the school consider themselves support staff I would just say School staff when you know you are staff at school you have do you have typical language that you use when you collect through HR when how how do you know that that's what I that's where I would defer what what are people most used to saying I'm not sure how we I identify that's the hardest piece is to sometimes ident

[00:59:00]
play who the audience is the only sure way I know and it's not guaranteed a social media so when we build this out we will of course use every available mechanism there is to get the word out I will say that this board has a unique advantage in the years that I've been here and that in the work you've already done that we've already done with emerging stronger they're already built in audiences who we can work with when you talked earlier about advertising will take that list of everyone who was in not necessarily all the invites but certainly the groups who received our pamphlets and we will request with them and meet with them that they put the advertisements on their website and that they joined the social media campaigns but all of this information has a broader reach then just going to specific email addresses for the district but I guess Monica the question to do we have a standard list of like tell us who you are kind of thing

[01:00:00]
we go back to work on the questions and we look at this one tell us who you are come up sort of look at some of our previous surveys in terms of who we have them Mark who they are and what are some of the standard ways that we've done that so that we may be we have some consistency there okay because they do all the surveys so we probably already have some standard ways of doing that and that's do that and then that can come back with the questions as well as that piece and then I think we could probably

[01:01:00]
Dr Cooper will be communicating with Johanna and I will just get stuff out as quickly as you can and maybe pushing you a little bit hard to say please review this now so that we can get moving I think it would be a good idea to do a couple of progress checks along the way from the and we can work with K12 we did that we did that during our goals and guard rail pieces well because we we looked at you know survey response and we could see where we didn't have response and did a secondary push and we were able to you know to kind of move our demographic a little bit okay I mean I would just worried that there are certain like we have basically four quadrants in our city that there would be certain quadrants that would we went see a response from and even though we may know what the demographics are you know their Hispanic or Asian or Native American we wouldn't really know what part of the city they lived either and how do we

[01:02:00]
how do we do that are we going to get everybody from the Northeast Heights or the Northwest that are going to respond and that's not a good thing if we don't have everyone just wondering how you can figure that all out I honestly don't know how to answer that because what I what I would tell you is our stakeholder feedback around what we're trying to gather in response to these questions has never been that sophisticated we've never we've never we've gotten really good information that's driven really positive searches without ever trying to be that sophisticated in understanding the feedback right now you know them putting their own we really just we matter of fact we've we've typically

[01:03:00]
busted out in three and that's staff member parent Community member so are they are they answering primarily as an employee are they answering as a current parent of the district or are they otherwise just a member of the community that's interested that is that's largely the the extent of the demographics that we've collected because we're we're really not we're not trying to drive you know if we were doing a pre bond election poll right or if we you know if we were doing something else that was was intended to be much more sophisticated in terms of parsing out all of that information obviously right but we would Elevate that to a completely different platform we we use polling software and pulling firms to do that it's really not so I I don't want to leave here leaving you with the thought that we can make this into a very sophisticated

[01:04:00]
scientifically defensible statistical poll it's not what we're intending to do and that's what I was going to get back cuz I love when you said earlier this the responses to this is not what's going to help us to select our candidate per se it's going to help inform some of the pieces that because it was that first part it's going to help the Board of Education to identify if we are on the same page or in the same if we have some Synergy around what the thoughts are out there and I think we are already to some degree know some of that because we've been doing a lot of surveys this year so I think part of what we could do for the board is to remind everybody of like some previous surveys or information that we had to that could also become part of that place to sort of build our general awareness in terms of where we think our community is but there's a lot of I know that there's a lot of survey fatigue out there too from the district because every time

[01:05:00]
I mean not a lot of times when I'm with constituents is like God another survey you know so they feel like they've all been surveyed a lot and so I think we just need to be really cognizant of that and also utilize some of the information we've already been gathering for the last 2 years too because I think it's real relevant if it's helpful we can put together quickly Communications plan to submit and the board it'll give you an idea not so much of how specific we can be in getting the demographics but surely to give you some comfort that we will be successful when we reach in the entire city so that you can know how that's been done and if there are you don't want to use or if they're more like to add we can get that done if it's helpful I think that would be great that would be grateful I think that would be fantastic I just wanted to push back on the three categories of community because from my perspective that's just

[01:06:00]
frankly not enough like that's not negotiable for me unacceptable in part because we have just committed ourselves to truly engaging our community and I think as one of our guardrails that we just passed like we will not make major decisions without engaging our community and to member Peterson's point if we are engaging the same people over and over which are the wealthy or white or more educated that's not fully engaging our community so for me it's important that we're collecting the information about who's responding period so that we can to appoint Monica made just make sure that we're doing it correctly I think I agree with that as well I mean I think the goal was to look at this and add working with Dr with Chris West about surveys if there's any other data collection pieces that are customary in terms of what we've done that will help us but I don't want it to be a real it doesn't need to be really exhausted but I think it would be really helpful because I don't want to get too fatigued either that they don't

[01:07:00]
spell it out right because that's the other thing too so I like that it's short and sweet must be short sweet to the point and then I think we're more likely to get response to so when they check the tell us who you are they can put in more than once they could be a parent and an educator or can do they have to choose one okay cuz I think sometimes they are parents and Educators and I mean I know what nobody wants to add any more but like to me on tell us who you are and this maybe just be important to me is like I think knowing that somebody is a tribal leader I think that's just important for us to know just in my opinion so that to that point but the feedback from folks who are that specific would you expect that feedback to come from the survey or would you expect that feedback to come from

[01:08:00]
play some direct Outreach and some intentional we would hope that it would more come that way I mean obviously we would want that for sure okay we're just doing really well with with you know our tribal leaders and I just think we need to make sure that we continue that absolutely thank you ok Google so this is something that vary significantly district for district state by state and so we always have it on the agenda because number one it may very well be the prime driver that separates your candidates either

[01:09:00]
among other candidates or among themselves and I say that because this is a currently this is a significantly a candidate's market pools and all across the country they're still really really strong pools and strong individuals out there who want to do this work but they are they are shrinking the pools are shrinking everywhere and so it's a supply and demand issue also in depending on where we do searches I'll give you an example in Colorado there is a statute on the books in Colorado that requires the Board of Education any any entity to publish the salary range as part of the posting so in Colorado long gone are the days where we would publish a salary commensurate with experience and education subject to negotiation write something like that so I spoke with your legal counsel

[01:10:00]
any any statutory or internal requirements that would require something different from how much flexibility you have around this and the answer to that was really you have a lot of flexibility there either you're not bound by current statute around that so this is not as I said in The annotation this is not something that we necessarily have to settle on today but at some point before we get right toward the end we need to know we need your your search agents in conversations with candidates because what you don't want to do is really settle on a on a top-notch candidate you're all in line with who you want and then that falls apart at the end in terms of negotiation because you can't come anywhere near agreement around salary so I provided you the most recent salary study from aasa

[01:11:00]
in the packet you also have very similar I would assume very similar information available to you from great City because of your membership there so there really are two things at some point we need to know where the guardrails are around compensation as we talk to candidates because if if you and a candidate in our conversations are 60 or 70,000 apart in terms of there's no sense in bringing that candidate forward likely right at the end of the day but you also necessarily don't don't want to put yourself in the position of posting a salary range that either boxes you in too low right or mortgage so that's why we provide as much objective

[01:12:00]
data as we can around the salary but I will I will tell you no one ever criticized the board of education for paying their superintendent too little and so it's all this is always you know that this is always a part of the search that is a bone of contention both both internally and externally so do you have available

[01:13:00]
membership Focus or larger school districts aasa is obviously member districts all across the all across the country many of which are very small right so I think that the end of districts the size of Albuquerque in this study is close to single digits I think if I remember correctly so it's just not as it's not as transferable as maybe great City but before the data before we actually get to the data itself or spend any time on the data what are your thoughts about including a salary range as part of the posting or is that a more Dynamic and later piece of conversation and on the posting you know the typical subject to negotiation kind of language language

[01:14:00]
you know it's It's tricky because I guess I don't have a lot to add to that all of those variables of how how many people will we attract and what can we actually afford and all of those things I I can't add anything to to this conversation I'm just curious and your experience doctor you know we have the sunshine laws which I think have certain I mean I think there are lots of reasons to have them I think that it's it's serves a role for the

[01:15:00]
Community but I also hear a lot of comments from various people about how it really limits our pool that that super experienced superintendents who do not want to jeopardize their current position will not apply and I'm just curious about how you see that we're how much how many obstacles does that put in our way of finding the pool that's a great question and I will just tell you I'm completely unfiltered and directly that will be your largest challenge in this search and speaking with with with with her last week because that was one of my initial questions because that very state-to-state by District policy or protocols the the stat

[01:16:00]
disclosure requirements in New Mexico will significantly limit your candidate pool there's there's no doubt in my mind that that will happen so we have to be up front with candidates about that as a matter of fact in in in in my experience and I'm certainly not an attorney and I have not worked all across this country but I would have a hard time believing that there is any state outside of New Mexico that has disclosure requirements to the extent that at least in terms of of candidate information this New Mexico and Canada will be very well aware of that and it will be our I mean you know we're responsible for disclosing that two candidates and so that concern about sitting experienced leaders they may

[01:17:00]
really really have a really strong urge to come and Lead Albuquerque Public Schools they just can't take the risk of if they're not the selected candidate what that would happen and so even in states where that have many more protections in terms of confidentiality in place we oftentimes lose candidates you know as the progress goes further and that disclosure becomes more critical or required so I hate to sound like it's a doomsday scenario it certainly is not but it's a very good question and it will be the greatest challenge I feel that you have to overcome this search sobering but thank you I just did a quick review on the great City schools and it looks like the average salary for

[01:18:00]
100,000 students the average salary was $260,000 so that and that's just the yeah that was just at the at the very top of that I guess and I'll open it I just wanted to pull that up cuz I just want so anybody else want to contribute I have a question at this point I guess my perspective is sort of a boat and I think leaning more towards the salary commissioner based on experience within a range based on this because anyone who is applying who is a serious candidate is going to know what the range is anyway they're going to know what the the Nationwide always is when I go out and I'm talking to constituents or talking to community and when we talk about what you know New Mexico and what are

[01:19:00]
average salary of a median salary is here in New Mexico and I'm sure you know what that is and then you talk about superintendent to yes obviously went to college and has a master's degree and when they hear what the salary is people are still in New Mexico still really dumbfounded at that they are just shocked that somebody's getting a salary plus extra benefits that basically amount to 300,000 dollars and they are I've never had a single person that asked that question and I told him the answer that wasn't shocked so it's New Mexico and do I think that a great superintendent deserves a great salary I think that about a great teacher and great doctor and great anything but it's just always concerning out there and nobody has ever been oh yep that's exactly what they should get paid so

[01:20:00]
there there certainly is some give and take around cost of living cost of living right so if you're you know you're trying to you have a camera and you know at the end of the day you're not competing against New Mexico the country for this town and I don't I don't discount that at all and it does put boards in a very uncomfortable position many times regardless of whether you're in New York or New Mexico or Colorado or Florida as I said no one ever criticized the board of education for paying their superintendent to little it's always just very uncomfortable for me

[01:21:00]
but it's a question of what's the top end that's a very that's a very good point because every candidate that you interview is going to be expected to be paid at the top end right so you don't want to publish a top-end salary that is so high based on a design to think you know to to catch people's eye with the idea that you're not really going to pay that but that gets folks in the door right and then you can negotiate something so whatever that range is you need to be prepared to pay the top of that range if your candidate in your mind qualifies for the top of that right facing the difficulties of the right yes and so yeah I mean it's

[01:22:00]
I know when I apply for a job and thank God I'm not doing that anymore but when I've applied for jobs I'm always I always did look at the salary range I expected that because it was helpful to know because I wouldn't have bothered to apply if it wasn't within my range so so I think I agree with board member Gonzalez I think within that range but also commensurate with their experience so that we're sort of letting that you know out the bag it doesn't mean you're automatically guaranteed that but you know we're looking for experience but I agree what's the top end I mean I think we have to I think that's the hardest part for us is knowing where is and where is our top end there will be raises so if we you know so the data table that I that I provided for you from 22/238

[01:23:00]
100,000 students the median is 300,000,900 and the base is $250 the lowest is $253 so now understanding the end the end there is only eight respondents and so that's why I said that you know the council may have is probably a more accurate snapshot in representation it's probably old so I don't have the current Table you just ask for it yeah I was looking at an old table so I did it it probably is has gone up since then but I think it's interesting that hundred thousand or more makes so much less so I would want to Benchmark off of those really the three bottom here 25,200,000 and for me honestly like

[01:24:00]
2 to 2:20 to 3:00 and in part because one of our neighbor districts just hired their superintendent paying $200,000 Las Cruces and if I think if we think of the most comfortable districts to us would be like Denver for example in terms of size and demographics and that's 305 so looking at so I think just like trying to stay in that range and I know that's a big range but it gives us the opportunity I think for that negotiation and like are unicorn candidate which I don't think exists so when you I know if you say commensurate with experience which we said Do you ever say commensurate with like a proven I prefer just to say subject to negotiation okay right because a fantastic job

[01:25:00]
they're a non-traditional superintendent who maybe has only been in the realm of education for half a dozen years right experience education and experience isn't going to be scored over really high but they may be so I just think subject to negotiation is the best language to put in there okay evaluation process we are ultimately going to incorporate bonuses based on outcomes so I think keeping them in mind as well is that a is that a potential or is that a definite that will happen

[01:26:00]
so we probably don't want to include that as a caveat in no hosting yet semantics for the posting I would say subject to negotiation and then I mean that is that is a very did you say 220 to 300 makes I don't know how much the cheese but the superintendent should make more than that yeah so whatever their that's the bottom over the highest highest paid obviously the superintendent should make more than the highest paid Cabinet member we would probably want to project that for what salaries look like for next year

[01:27:00]
so I will I'll Circle back around and Johanna and I will do a little data and but I know I think I hear the direction that we're headed so so let's make sure yeah yes we're going to say that range is subject to negotiation I I like the top at 3:50 320 3:25

[01:28:00]
just a little bit but you know put a little bit of quantifiable but what we can figure that out there are people going to look so at our candidates going to look at what the superintendent is making what we chose to pay him now potentially but everybody thinks they're worth more than the last person for this job in a vacuum right I'm going to be talking with him everything you know what once they get in the pipeline then we're having these same Cuts conversations with candidates so I wouldn't I wouldn't put too much thought into that as a as a benchmark so you could question

[01:29:00]
we've got that and John and I will work later this week on that okay so hopefully you all have done your homework because we're going to work through this exercise this goes fairly quickly I'm going to go to the Chart here and period but I wanted to do here is we're going to work through the this abbreviated version of a nominal group technique but what I'm trying to do here is identify from the board's perspective those really the answer to that

[01:30:00]
question that we posed in the survey to except what are the skills qualities attributes experiences that you all deem are most important to your next superintendent the outcome of this if we think about backward design here what we're working toward is what I'm going to use to craft sort of the outline narrative that becomes the job to it's not a job description right so so don't put an HR lens on this or any EEOC lens on this right in terms of a job description we're talking about a short narrative that captures what the characteristics or backgrounds are as folks look at this and they read this and say oh this matches you know this bitch with my profile really well or that I don't really fit with this at all right this is the very first announcement on our website that goes then to our our advertising partners that says

[01:31:00]
if you have all of these and more to be our unicorn candidate please apply for APS so with that let's just go in a clockwise fashion hopefully you have your list of your homework and I'm going to ask you for the first thing on your list doesn't have to be an order on I mean if your list isn't in order just the first thing on your list and we don't want to have any redundancies on the chart so if somebody steals your thunder cross it out and go on to the next one okay because we're going to do a little bit of ranking here later so I'm just start with you if we didn't we'll just go and clockwise what's the first thing on your list goal-oriented goal oriented first

[01:32:00]
dogged determination deep understanding of structures and practices related to equity and anti-racism hey

[01:33:00]
go back to you again we'll go back in reverse order this time what's the next one I had it on the tip of my tongue I wasn't expecting to be right back let's see go back to you if you'd like and this is worthy but I think aware of the strengths of the community respectful of the strengths of the community support

[01:34:00]
I can listen while I'm I'm from myself I would say strong negotiation and mediation capacity and then for board member Jackson her next one is committed to our goals and strategic plan you said negotiation negotiation skills every child can learn every capital capital letters

[01:35:00]
data-driven data-driven there very quickly and just ask a quick question in your mind do data-driven and data informed mean different things do they characterize different things they do but you can't have one without the other second one impatient impatient not impatient impatient and so I'm drawing a connection between these two period

[01:36:00]
so for board member Jack's the next one would be confident decision-making mine would be kind of like similar is just a very intentional on diversity OK Google

[01:37:00]

[01:38:00]
passionate advocate for Martinez Yahtzee and African-Americans a board member Jackson's winner winner winner see mine thinking about the online survey I want to say politically Savvy and I say strong Communicator slash

[01:41:00]
explicitly understands the value of negotiated agreements and works collaboratively with staff who can get already there I heard we have negotiation and and mediation what I heard a little more specifically from you was that specifically in terms of like employee agreements Master contracts right and understands the value of that has a problem solving approaching collaborative approach to work with employees categorize that as Master agreement

[01:42:00]
let's see preferably I mean we're pie in the sky right lived experience of our kids I don't for me I think I'm done and I think this might go home Educators educators

[01:43:00]
reformer or change oriented dictionary OK Google

[01:44:00]
thank you

[01:45:00]
I'm just going to very quickly number please in order I'm going to ask you this may be a little difficult for yourself

[01:46:00]
I would like for you to identify your top five so take five different sticky notes and write down the number corresponding to the thought of the top five if they are the five that you put up there and no one else is that's okay but maybe somebody else thought of something that you didn't but write your top six six and no specific order just write down your top six I'm going to ask you to rank them and just a second just a number in the middle 13274 whatever it might be

[01:47:00]
OK Google

[01:48:00]
once you have your six ID

[01:49:00]
please ranked them one through six and just write in the like the top right-hand corner maybe put a circle around so I know which one is the ranking and which one's the identifiable just put number 13 put a 1 if that's your top one put a two on the next one so rank them one through six do I have to go back up and then if you can multitask I'm going to give you one on that list of 304 items if there is anything

on that list this is Tim is Gonzalez's point about the survey question if there is anything on any of these charts that is absolutely a non-starter for you so you are you maybe you didn't rank it right it might not just that it doesn't make your cut or less but if there is anything up there that is the antithesis of what you want to see in your next superintendent please write that number down and then put a star on that sticky note so that I know that that's a no vote if you will as opposed to a ranking search if you think that it adds for example let's say that you

[01:51:00]
absolutely think that an individual with a strong ego is a non-starter for you right then that would be one that you would you would write down there or if if you want somebody who is totally intuitive and not data-driven for example right that would be the antithesis of that so and we put that on a separate put that on a separate sticky note that it's just not as important than other but that would disqualify a candidate in your mind I will tell you that doesn't happen very often but we just put the number on a separate yeah and then put it on that you know just so that I don't confuse it with what you did as rankings okay if there's more than one put it on

[01:52:00]
I think this is implied by some of the others but I don't think it was explicitly stated I added a completely different number five for my top attributes and that's an effective administrator it's it's implied in any number of the other ones but I thought that was more so if anyone has a non-starter a sticky note with a non-starter please let me have that I'm not going to share these at this point

[01:53:00]

and then I think the last one that I haven't put is respectful of Workforce respectful of horses okay got it okay so as you can see there are several that have multiple now I'm not going to necessarily throw out any of these as we as we craft the posting in the narrative but where we have multiple responses in terms of equity and anti-racism respects the workforce respects New Mexico culture those I'll make sure that I highlight or or you know bubble to the surface also those that have the lowest combined ranking I'll make sure that I that I like those as well but this is this is really allow us to form a really good first introduction
