[00:04:00]
Port there will be four main points of discussion tonight and also that according to state regulations this is a requirement of all school districts to have a yearly audit performed given the fact that we all had the presentation beforehand I would ask our presenters to just hit the highlights of those four main discussion points and then we will stand for questions so at this point I will turn it over to our presenters and you have the phone thank you madam chairman of the board superintendent memo has the Four Points so with those four points I'm going to go ahead and turn the meeting over to Seattle

[00:05:00]
great thank you all are you able to hear me yes ma'am okay wonderful thank you good evening everyone I think my I think Sheila is getting entered into the lobby right now so I apologize or entered into from the lobby and I see she's just popped up so I apologize we were trying to get her out of the lobby and into this presentation so that she could take over so when she is ready I'm going to turn it over to Sheila and we'll just hit the high points as requested you do have the presentation would you like us to share our screen with the presentation or just verbally go through some matters since everyone was provided with this beforehand I think you can just go through the the matters that are that are that are on that document and then if we need to refer I know that Mr Gonzales is ready to share the the presentation if need be

[00:06:00]
okay fantastic Sheila would you like to go ahead and just hit the high points yes thank you so much sorry about my tardiness I was stuck in the lobby but again welcome everybody thank you for joining us today to the Albuquerque Public Schools audit entrance conference we will end this entrance we are also including William Josephine Community Charter School as you'll see there's a short agenda in our presentation will go a brief overview of our engagement team the responsibilities from everybody involved discuss the audit plan overview the audit timeline and then we'll have some time for discussion questions so for our core engagement team as you'll see in the presentation in front of you we have our engagement principal or about John Smith who you met earlier my name is she looking I will be the engagement

[00:07:00]
manager and then we will also have Geneva Choi as a single audit senior and then Lynn thing as our FAS senior moving on to the responsibilities for everybody involved during the audit for governance you are responsible for the Strategic direction of the school district as well as holding them accountable for any processes or procedures they put in place this includes the oversight of any financial reporting managers responsibilities are to oversee internal controls and any accounting policies that the district has in place as well as responsibilities over management decisions the district is also responsible for their presentation of the financial statements and then responsible for implementing programs that would prevent and detect on a timely basis as your independent Auditors are responsibility is to provide an opinion on whether the financial statements are fairly presented

[00:08:00]
went and within Federal compliance we planning to perform our audits in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and this doesn't involve a group financial statement audit where we will provide reasonable but not absolute Assurance of the financial statements we will obtain an understanding of your internal controls for our audit procedures and then we'll perform our audit based on a risk space approach next to go over the audit plan overview overall this is an audit there is a risk that there might be some undetected material misstatement due to fraud or error this is this goes back again to us providing a reasonable but not absolute assurance that there are no materialistic statements if we wanted absolute Assurance we would have to sit by Amanda and Mark side day by day and overseas essentially every single transaction that the accounting department and partakes in as a result we do you know provide those audit

[00:09:00]
there are some significant progress that are part of our audit this isn't necessarily something that the district is doing incorrectly no matter the size of the audit that we would do that would always just be that inherent risk related to revenue recognition the potential management override of controls and this year there is a new gazi standard related to compensated absences and due to the implementation year there is just higher risk that could be implemented incorrectly we have talked about this with the district and they are aware of this required implementation and overall there are some control risks that are that are that are overseen during our audit that you know we could be controls that are not correctly working that would then prevent the district from preventing or detecting any materials there is the detection wrist since our audit process is based on Analytics

[00:10:00]
and then depending on the inherent nature of some accounts there are higher risks related to areas such as cash the restrictions of balance or in that position and any potential estimates moving forward to the audit timeline today is the process of the audit we have been doing some initial onboarding procedures getting the district set up with our audit portal and sending out requests moving forward there will be continuous audit planning throughout this time frame as items come up we might change some of our the direction that we're heading in but for now between June and July we will perform our preliminary procedures will conducting interviews get an understanding of the internal controls in place at the district and then do some preliminary samples then in between June and July will then complete our own procedures we will actually be looking

[00:11:00]
do the sample support for sample selected maybe do some preliminary determination on potential single audit programs that will be testing and then in September and October that's when the field work starts that's when we get really dig down into the numbers on your balance sheet on your revenue and expenses after your end closest will receive a trial balance or we'll start looking through those balances confirming cash things of that sort and then help working through the district as they draft their financial statements then between October and November will work with the review of the reporting the district does draft their own financial statements we still are required to review those to ensure that they we agree with our tests work and approved CLA draft essentially will then be provided to the district by November 1st and with the goal to submit to the office of the state auditor by November 15th if not sooner and then during this audit timeline

[00:12:00]
there are any items that are falling behind or potential findings that come up to our attention we will be having audit meeting on a monthly basis where we will then communicate any items that are falling behind or any potential findings that have been brought to our attention and then this last slide really is just to reinforce that while we work with management to work through the audit and complete our reporting we do work with for governance and if there are any areas where you would like for us to focus on any concerns that you would like to bring her to our attention or fraud that you become aware of we welcome those conversations and would be more than likely to have those brought up to us during our audit committee meetings or separate meetings if necessary and at this point I can stand for any questions

[00:13:00]
okay thank you Miss Katana filoso appreciate your overview of this I will open it up for questions with just again the reminder that our role here is to act as the governance side of things and that the management is left to the capable hands of Josefina I see a bunch of things I'm looking for my hand up hey Google do you have a question I was I was merely agreeing with that our government School

[00:14:00]
so I submitted several questions and I'd like to know and I was told that that these questions need to be directed directly to you so miss Quintana filosa how do I get these questions to you I don't know if you have access to our our our our our agenda but they are listed in the q&a's I think renette was able to forward some of those questions over to us I don't know if you would like to discuss them in order or if you would like to emphasize a specific question to start I don't I don't want to eat up our time with those questions but I would like a follow-up I guess okay I think overall it seems like there was questions regarding how as Auditors we track finding things that have

[00:15:00]
continue to occur from the past and seeing those Trends with potential dashboards or reports that we could provide overall we perform our audits in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures and then we also have to follow the audit rule as part of the audit rule we do are required to report on any findings that are repeat from prior years and then indicate if there are any new findings typically if it's a repeat finding it'll say repeat from but as far as any dashboards or reports that can compile findings from years back we don't necessarily do that as that is kind of part of the scope of our engagement now we do have a digital team that is amazing they do a lot of different things where they we could provide some sort of dashboards with that team

[00:16:00]
but I think in the form of dashboards and keeping things transparent it might be more useful to receive real-time data that you can understand what is a p card analysis that may be what are the PC cards usage look like on the district and there are other reports that might be useful to help you understand where the money stands at on a real-time basis rather than looking at dashboards for findings but if that's something you would like to explore we can definitely set up a meeting to discuss what that would look like it's fine I look forward to that conversation are there any I'm not seeing any other thumbs flying okay well it sound it looks so

[00:17:00]
there are no further questions so I would just thank you so much for that presentation thank you for summarizing the presentation so well and we will we look forward to having our monthly check in so that we understand how the district is doing and we appreciate your help Clifton Larson Allen so will there be no further questions I will go ahead and state that our next audit committee meeting is on Tuesday July 22nd 2025 at 5 p.m. virtually and you can watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that our meeting is adjourned thank you all thank you
