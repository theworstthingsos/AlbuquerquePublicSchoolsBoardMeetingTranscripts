[00:07:00]
the sake of our children's health and well-being in our school so with that said I would encourage all of you guys to to look at this because there is a Quantum medical scientist there is between now and it took the shots by 18 years period wait period we can expect trouble cancer blood clot and some other car back with damage 18 years so that's what Russian Roulette so I just hope that you would look at this and because you do care about the health and well-being of our children song Hello OK Google

[00:08:00]
board members I'm speaking today like most parents I think feeling frustrated following that state of the district display that was put on and completely glossing over the subject of school safety I think that was a major disservice to parents I think that further damages the confidence and the trust that we have in APS it was just really disappointing to not have that address on literally such a big stage and then furthermore I was disappointed by the reporting that came following that and the superintendents you know Shifty gays and unwillingness to respond to reporters questions

[00:09:00]
Andy deflecting to Antonio Gonzalez who also deflected it just feels like a lot of like past the blame past the torch and it's frustrating we've all seen the national news in the events that are taking place and it's a constant worry on all of our minds about whether or not our children are safe going to school and knowing that the board president and other members of the boards response to this has been you know we have measures in place and all I'm hearing are things that they're doing after the fact rather than things that are preventative that keep the situation from encouraging from occur in the first place but that's that's my thoughts those are my feelings thank you for listening thank you our next speaker is on Zoom

[00:10:00]
Daniel Tafoya Daniel are you there are you there I'm going to go to our next speaker

[00:12:00]
I would like to know what APS is doing to help our children not only the victims but the ones committing the act of the shooting we need to prevent and look at the signs of each of our students thank you thank you thank you ma'am okay Daniel can we try to join again I'm here okay sir you have two minutes to talk about the Discrimination of their discriminating against them when they report child abuse or stuff on principals doing unlawful things to students is happening quite often we're losing our substitute teachers we are so short-handed because they are firing them or getting rid of them because they have filed complaints against the schools

[00:13:00]
and staff members I was recently cleared to volunteer and then out of the blue they're not allowing me to but there's no reason why even though I have been cleared and I have heard this from other parents and other regular people who want to volunteer for the schools nothing is being done of complaints and they're being swept under the rug a student at a school I will not mention the school had his head kicked in by another student redirector did not come to the assistant teacher and she had other students from another classroom in her class so she had double the students and was left alone this is happening quite often and he's stopped teachers and he is have complained of issues and everything's been swept under the rug in and he's a stop I'm tired of it I feel it's wrong that the superintendent does not return calls

[00:14:00]
I just need issues and they need to be addressed thank you for your time thank you sir thank you and thank you and 3.2 related to high quality curriculum and instruction this guardrail was on the consent agenda so I will go ahead and turn the floor over to board member Dominguez who asked to have the side of agenda this agenda item moved from the consent to an action item so you can share your questions and then we can move to approval thank you

[00:15:00]
felt like this needed to be pulled was because I knew the answers to the questions were going to come in time to review them and meet the obligations of the open meetings act but it's always good I think for the district to have an opportunity to talk about some of the answers and to clarify as it turns out one of my constituents asked about how does the superintendent and her staff explain the outlier score of 52 per cent at the middle school level noted in guardrail 3.1 the section title superintendents interpretation of the data and I do have an answer but I think it's important for for superintendent to to respond because I think

[00:16:00]
I can do you want me to read the answer sure or however you want to handle it or would you have a good team coming forward so doctor Blake Shelton I don't have the actual like verbatim answer in front of me but essentially when we're looking at two different parts of the to qualify as what we're looking for for high quality instructional materials in the classroom in Middle School we're seeing that sometimes they're not aligned so we might have high quality instructional materials being used but not the right grade level or we have the right grade level but not high quality instructional materials so we're not seeing as much of an alignment in having both which is what we see in the discrepancy with middle school does the team have anything to add thank you I have a follow-up to that could you please explain for the public what is it mean to have

[00:17:00]
high quality instructional material is it strictly that they're following that they're using the textbooks that have been purchased or is there something else now there's actually qualifications for something to be a high-quality instructional material but I can defer to the team and probably miss it can describe what it means to qualify as a high quality instructional material good evening board president Gonzalez members of the board doctor Blakey boards we actually have a presentation that was included I believe in the answers I don't know if you were able to get to that link it's okay I understand so we we follow the guidance from the public education department on what qualifies as a high quality instructional material and it has nine criteria I did not care for a pop quiz on the 9

[00:18:00]
yes I'm not going to try to listen but I do want to assure you that they are there and among those are certainly that they are culturally and linguistically responsive great thank you I have one more but I'm willing to share time with other board members you have the four okay the second question was a strategic one as the district launches a district wide high quality instructional materials awareness campaign how will the district provide clear guidance at still allows Educators to exercise professional judgment when HQ I am materials fall short of students needs for example when culturally linguistically or developmentally appropriate curriculum is missing from

[00:19:00]
Publishers materials and I have a follow-up to that Miss Jack can answer the specifics of that but I think it's important to note that if a school if sorry for instructional materials being used to the school were not culturally responsive or accessible they wouldn't actually qualify as high quality instructional materials it's one of the things that has to be it's one of the indicators to be a high quality instructional material so if it wasn't showing that it was aligned to accessibility or cultural responsiveness that wouldn't be considered a high quality instructional material do you have anything to yes thank you guys we when we adopt these materials that is an incredible part of the criteria for them to even get in front of our

[00:20:00]
teachers in our adoption committee which includes community and should somehow a material get through that pretty rigorous process we also lean into the ongoing professional conversation with our school leaders in our teachers around the importance of affirming students cultural knowledge and language assets particularly for our black students or African American students Native American students in our English language Learners and so I mean this is critical work of our Language and Cultural Equity team under Chief compost and just having this conversation make sure that we are seeing all identities represented in our classroom in our materials we also I want to lift up the I guess two years ago created the guard guard rail 3 collaborative team which brings together people from across our departments

[00:21:00]
so that they really have two purposes one is to make sure that the materials that are going forward do you need the stringent criteria for high quality but the other is that should have material come forward that somebody is saying this has this problem whatever it may be that's not a whining to our definition of high quality this team looks at it and that's it and either suggest ways that we can enhance it or and this hasn't actually happened but you know we would remove the material but typically given the diversity of our city would say we're having these ongoing conversations about how we do really lean into making sure all of our students are represented in the classroom okay and I have one final question and I want to know that in the answer that

[00:22:00]
call Charlene linguistic backgrounds are taken into account when Teaching letters but it it becomes as someone who taught grammar because I was that teacher would I struggled with and what I had to do was go into the literature to find to find ways to teach grammatical elements and in this case it's technical phone names of awareness etcetera but it's hard to come by culturally relevant and linguistically relevant materials and so how are how is the district trying to mitigate that in the letters training thank you for the question

[00:23:00]
what is training as you know is based on the science of reading structured literacy is another way that we talked about it and so I have some examples that I can give you of how that's addressed through the letters training specifically One is using multilingual word study so very similar to what you're talking about we go to sort of mirror text to see those connections between the English phonics patterns and students home languages so that could be you know cognates for Spanish or it could be How Sound differently in different languages certainly you know we've mentioned building background knowledge with cultural relevance but I think the opportunity to really get in and affirm those language assets by having the languages side by side and then in addition a really critical component of all of the work that happens both in our high-quality instructional materials and in our letters training and so the the tools

[00:24:00]
teachers use to make the materials accessible without lowering the expectations is a really critical component of how we do that okay thank you I appreciate that thank you are there any additional questions or a motion to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring report I move that we consider accepting the progress monitoring report for in room guard rails 3.1 and 3.2 high-quality curriculum and instruction this is board member benavidez a second and this is board member we have a motion and a second can we get a roll call vote please yes so the motion carries thank you for the work on this important guard real well now move on to consider approval of the

[00:26:00]
the resolution as amended to be submitted to the New Mexico school boards Association and considered for the association's 2025 legislative platform I moved to consider approval of a resolution as amended to be submitted to the New Mexico School boards Association and considered for the association's 2025 legislative platform board members Dominguez membership thank you we have emotion and a second is there any discussion I don't like the word demands in the third the first second that we change that to either dictates urges or necessitates and I'm partial to necessitates all right so we have a proposed amendment to change the third world

[00:29:00]
principal of the school and Mr Traeger is also here in the audience so I can yes right now we are funding the school with some federal funds so if there are cuts to but to federal funds it could impact the school and we would have to provide operational funds to maintain the level of instruction that it currently has in its design and just a quick follow-up are we prepared to do something like that is there any plan in place just in case I was saying if you don't have to answer I was just worried she was going to like her eyes start getting really big yes we have looked at it as a priority and so we do have contingency plans but of course would mean that the funds have to come from somewhere so it would be some hard decisions that we have to make as we
