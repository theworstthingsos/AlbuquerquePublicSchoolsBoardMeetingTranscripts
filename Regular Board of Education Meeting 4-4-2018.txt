play did you a couple weeks ago welcome all right I'm glad to be back kind of sort of so and I also brought some friends with me at the last 40 meeting that I attended I didn't know a whole lot about what was going on with physical education I don't know that you all knew a whole lot about what was going on with physical education I'm glad we all know what's going on now so that hopefully we can save it I don't have a whole lot to say but I do want to read a letter that a student gave to me probably 12 years ago a student who was in my class that had a difficult time everyone everywhere else other than pee he couldn't sit still he could not sit still and often times in class he would get in trouble because he would be up wandering around messing with other kids and so when he gave me this letter I put it on my wall and it sits up there along with all four walls in my office are filled with pictures and letters and things for my students and this one is is like the one that brings me chills every time so I'm going to read it really quickly for you

[00:40:00]
I breathe I breathe for Jim I watched the clock and raised the gym I'm free and Jim to run and play and try new games and Shout hooray it's in the gym I feel so good I lived there if only I could if I only I could have Jim the whole day through why then I always Dash to school and this is indicative of a lot of a lot of my students the students who have a difficult time in class they need to move they have to move so I've heard that you are in support of physical education I'm so glad to hear that and I hope that you're able to help us out and save PE not for us we're going to have a job we're worried about our kids so thank you again and fight for us and help us out and I appreciate it thank you

[00:41:00]
my name is Daniela I'm a physical education teacher halftime at Eugene Field Elementary in halftime at the Elementary Eugene Field is on an alternative calendar so yesterday I was able to attend the meeting the board meeting yesterday morning it was a challenging exercise in biting my tongue but I want to thank the board especially Dr Piercy for questioning and stating many of the things I was thinking I was disappointed to hear our CFO make misleading statements regarding essay supplement not supplant as well as comparing the 2.8 million dollars supplement to the 8.3 million dollar overall cost of the elementary program thank you doctor for questioning this and I fully agree that this was a weak argument I was extremely disappointed to hear our superintendent mentioned the idea of using the supplement on reading teachers believe me I know the importance of our reading teachers and I also know that many of our physical educators are asked to help support reading in their schools again thank you for the board for pointing out that this was not a p e versus reading argument that is not the

[00:42:00]
if we are going to Champion whole child then he is included physical education physical activity is part of the whole child thank you for sharing the discussion towards adjusting in the allocations of physical education rather than eliminating them however I was displeased when I heard our CFO say multiple times that every school should benefit from this funding know this funding was meant for the most at-risk students Equity does not mean equal this was repeated multiple times finally thank you for asking that physical Educators be included in the discussion to determine where these allocations are most needed thank you bored

[00:43:00]
board members and superintendent my name is Filiberto Martinez Elementary PE teacher at Mission Avenue Elementary and father and parent of two current APS students so I'm going to come I'm going to bring the data perspective from this per argument this the sheets that you are being presented with now are from the Department of Health and a collaboration with APS healthy weight assessment project that was completed from the years 2009 to 2013 this is very valuable data and on the first sheet that's in front of you this shows a correlation between poverty or lack of poverty in a healthy weight as we can see on this sheet higher income students are much less likely to be overweight or obese than lower income students return to the next page

[00:44:00]
this is about achievement again this data is from APS from our students this is not State data this is not National Data this is APS data this shows a correlation between achievement and a healthy body weight students who are have a healthy body weight perform better on standardized tests than students who are overweight or obese matter of fact in APS at 7:00 to 10% better if you'll turn the page the last one or second to last one is attendance attendance for our district elementary school students who are obese have 17% more total absence of students who are the healthy weight and the last page this is a map of our district elementary schools this map shows the proportion of students who are overweight and obese at these elementary schools I believe if there's going to be any change in allocation of resources it should be using data

[00:45:00]
such as this map to best find the schools that can use the additional Human Resources thank you for your time next the next three speakers Matthew maestas Joe Buck and Jeremy denim good evening my son and daughter have been taught him he runs one of the best runs I've seen as a coach myself he is involved with the community he's involved with

[00:46:00]
kids I think it would be detrimental to have coaches split from one gym to another Not only would it affect his time but it would also affect the kids time I just I can't believe that we're here discussing cutting PE half or cutting you know their half their time as it is for the last couple years we had to decide between music and art in our schools and I feel like there should be allocated money to have art music and peaceful time in our schools and I I just I'm having a hard time believing that you know this has to happen I mean kids need physical fitness they need time to vent outside of the classroom I think a full-time coach versus a coach that's going to be back and forth is going to be detrimental to the kids and and to everything else I mean coach

[00:47:00]
Brock is one of the best coaches I've been coached all my life I played college football and I just I have a lot of respect for this for for Coach buck and you know physical fitness basic academics those things are all learned in the first 5 years of children's life and I think that if you start taking it away at a young age you know we're going to lose the kids are going to lose out basically and I don't think it's fair that that this is happening and I just wanted to as a parent's voice my opinion thank you hello my name is Joe Buck my teacher Alvarado Elementary I've been teaching there for 10 years I have two of my own sons who attend school there my colleagues have and I think will continue to speak to the undeniable facts about the positive benefits of exercise and physical education and have these benefits translate into improved academic gains also how are physical education teachers are the heart

[00:48:00]
soul of our communities I would like to speak a little bit more specifically about how it would affect someone like me who is being a full-time at one school and then divided as a 0.5 between two schools and I have some first-hand experience with this my wife is also a PE teacher with APS and she does currently work at two schools as a 0.5 at each so I can compare our two days today she had to transport equipment across town from the North Valley all the way downtown two trips to get ready for the second half of her weeks lessons Okay comparing my free time today in between my physical education classes where 40 students participated in a flag football and soccer league's students who wouldn't have that opportunity otherwise outside of school to lower socioeconomic status additionally during our afternoon exercise break today my students ran 22 miles including one who's lost over 20 pounds this year alone after school today I played basketball with four students

[00:49:00]
two whose fathers died last year and two whose fathers are in jail right now we shot baskets we talked and we had a really positive experience so I asked you do you want me to spend my time hustling across town grabbing equipment not knowing my students names not getting to know my communities or do you want me rocking intermural league for 40 kids are participating or having kids run 20 miles a day and cutting down these obesity rates I think that's what this Choice kind of boils down to so please support us please help us Empower our children to lead Healthy Lifestyles and I really appreciate all your support president Piercy board members and superintendent Reedy my name is Jeremy denam I teach physical education at the elementary and I've been there 14 years I'm also a parent of a kindergarten

[00:50:00]
who attends Zia as well and I'm also the president of the Society of health and physical education of health and physical Educators here in New Mexico there are many benefits students receive in physical education classes that can contribute to students becoming responsible adults who are aware of the importance of Healthy Lifestyles the inclusion of regular Fitness activity helps students maintain Fitness develop muscular strength and improve cardiovascular health the participation in physical education provides a positive influence on students personalities character and self-esteem physical education is essential to the development of motor skills and students especially in high needs areas who have substantial amounts of stress due to curriculum homework family life and

[00:51:00]
Thrashers physical education offers a method of stress relief for that as well as many physical educators are doing things outside of their time such as Joe Buck does doing intramural activities during recess or Sports before or after school thank you again for letting me speak next the next three speakers period

[00:52:00]
and my name is Suzanne scatliffe and I am what they call a pea teacher at party though elementary school but everyday I go to work I think of myself as someone else sometimes I'm the nurse sometimes I'm mom even dad and oftentimes on the counselor and social worker math and language arts teacher my co-worker and I were the ones who taught a third grade student how to spell his last name period

[00:53:00]
we have students who at our school we have a problem with the tendons so we have those students who come to school simply because they know that it is peed so if we can support our school in that then I feel we have done our job so just want to ask you to continue to support us and let's keep our PE program strong and going thank you very much good evening Dr Pearson's of the board and superintendent reading my name is Brian Funk I'm a physical education teacher elementary schools for a pretty long time and I just wanted to say thank you all again for

[00:54:00]
your support of physical education being that I am at cochiti were an alternative schedule so I'm still on my Spring Break and I was able to make the meeting yesterday so it was great to hear how supportive you all were of physical education I also want to provide a little bit of background into the way that schools were able to get extra funding for our physical education programs I know that was a concern yesterday that there was no idea of how schools received this and it just seemed like it was randomly kind of selected when this money did become available School's application process to determine schools who would benefit mostly from additional physical education most of the schools were Title 1 schools as far as I know all of those schools are title in schools and I don't believe their status as changed nor has our funding for this program changed either I also want to reiterate what was talked about yesterday in terms of

[00:55:00]
supplant and not supplements the current funding formula for APS is what is supplanting our schools whether it's you know 300 and Below gets a halftime teacher population 300 to 500 or 600 gets 1.5 and so on and so forth that's what's funded through APS the state has additional money which we're trying to get back for some reason for those extra physical education positions that are being talked about being eliminated right now so I just wanted to provide that information that it was an application process done back in 2008 to select the schools that were at the highest need so thank you very much good evening period thank you for the opportunity to speak to you on the importance of

[00:56:00]
additional physical education in Title 1 schools my name is ginger Koenig and I have the honor of working with an incredible group of students and outstanding staff at Barcelona elementary school and I'm a proud ATF member Barcelona students are in line with the 25 to 30 percent of New Mexico's children that are overweight obese and quite frankly struggling to stay fit very few of our students have the financial resources or transportation to attend classes or Sports Camps to get the much-needed exercise learn about health and fitness or Master basic movement skills unfortunately Barcelona Elementary School in the South Valley will be facing a reduction in PE classes in the next year of staff and our students present and future will be compromised

[00:57:00]
I urge you to keep the current number of PE teachers to help improve students health and wellness as well as assist in their academic performance thanks so much the next three Monica OK Google Barcelona Elementary School I love my job I love my students I have been at Barcelona for 6 years and I want to stay when I teach physical education

[00:59:00]
report for physical education my name is Margaret Hornbeck I teach at Cleveland Middle School I would just like to share some positive moments about physical education I had a student who I taught over nine years ago I ran into her mind running shoes she had said to me the reason she's still running is because of PE another student I taught I ran into lifting weights and she said look at me I still work out because of you teaching us about the health-related fitness components I also have another student that I saw his whole family at the gym they all said Thank you to me for getting their whole family working out I have invited parents to school for National bring your parents telling me their kids wanted to borrow by boat and arrows the parents also wanted to come back to pee I have had students talk about nutrition with me on a daily basis I have had students who want to improve their nutrition and get so excited to

[01:00:00]
tell me each day when they have improved their nutrition I have another student who wants to beat me at a plank every day in my class she often goes home to her parents and she works out with them and again she is the first in her family to work out and have her parents work out on their own I collaborated with a classroom teacher for the Olympics and for the first day she had told me everybody was here because they were so excited to get out and be moving he is not only life-changing but it is also a place where students can be kids thank you for letting me share some wonderful moments with the board and please come out and join me in my PE class or any of these other peaches thank you thanks again for your support

[01:01:00]
Tracy Villarreal and Joelle Villarreal good evening I actually live in Elizabeth District but I'm always here talking about Del Norte and Hodgen Bel-Air McKinley area but tonight I just want I just I'm sorry I said I don't hold it again because just seems like I mean there's so many challenges and so much happening so I just wanted to thank each of the board members for all the time and energy that you put into serving cuz I know it's every day and it's

[01:02:00]
play hours every day and you've given up family time and you've given up probably being able to go to the gym and do some of the healthy things you'd like to do and probably you've had to grab some quick meals on the go but I just on behalf of what I think are probably thousands of people who who never you never hear from a lot of those folks you hear from people that are complaining or have a have an issue or problem or but I mean there's thousands of us that just appreciate your service and I also wanted to just say I don't know the names of all the administrative word for an English major but the people that serve in administration there's some new faces this I have not had the opportunity to meet but the same thing you know

[01:03:00]
you're appreciated you appreciated for your patience and your ability to hear a lot of different comments many of which are not complimentary because people don't know the whole story and that's so that's I just want to say thank you tonight so hi good evening and unfortunately he's so devastating he still talks about the Family Fitness so I just wanted to say I mean even on my son still too but on a more serious note I am my son does go to Cleveland Middle School and as you guys know about two weeks ago there was very tragic accident in front of the school they were having a

[01:04:00]
carnivals all the kids were in there raising money for a charity and things like that and so the situation happened and my understanding is that they are going to be building a light a safety crosswalk light there and I know that they want to have it installed before fall but my question and my hope is that you can help out the city cuz I know that bear Keller was asking for some funds be appropriated from APS for that so that's why I'm here if you ever gone down that road even when the lights are on it is very people unfortunately don't pay attention and then also things do happen after school and it is just a crosswalk there's nothing to stop traffic there for those kids so thank you for your time and I hope you'll consider that are you going to the board my name is a child that goes to Cleveland Middle School and just

[01:05:00]
do you know I don't miss Armijo I think I'm in her District but our school is actually under Mr Garcia's District but I basically wanted a ditto off of what my wife was saying there you know that that accident that happened there it was completely preventable and I think that you know we're at a day and age now where it seems like our kids safety seems to come second hand to a bunch of political interest there and I mean this isn't dealing with guns this is something you know a lot more simple than that is being able to cross the walk to get to school and you know I think people need to take into consideration this isn't a very young as 11-years-old across one of the busiest intersection not just in the city in the state of New Mexico and it is dangerous me and my wife we don't even my kid is asked to be able to write to school we get

[01:06:00]
worried about that he's tried it a couple of times and it just very very old I mean you think about it all day is he going to be okay when he comes back it is a dangerous crosswalk much less when people are doing events I know that at the very least I think that there should be something out there when when when when there are extracurricular activities when you've got a whole group of parents there there should be somebody there but you know what I would ask for is is not just that light there was a gentleman that I was talking to out there that was talking about you know what the area really needs is like some kind of a catwalk that goes over there some kind of OverWatch and I know that's a lot of money when people are looking at money but that child's life is worth more than that and I think that you know when you look at it in the context of our children you know we owe it to them to keep them safe and I think that you know APS I think I'm sure would be up to the task I'm not sure how the funding goes for this or how you know APS phone or excuse me that the City of Albuquerque from what I heard on the news on the news was that they were hoping to get

[01:07:00]
what kind of fun to hear from APS to help them assist with that I don't know the the inter working of of what that would entail but I would hope that if that is able to do that that you please a lot what you can to be able to do a project there because those kids do deserve more than that and it is in a very dangerous place thank you very much that concludes thank you we're going to the superintendent Street report hi I'm sorry board president Dr piercey board members community members and staff over the past two years 8 p.m. has been partnered with network to transform teaching this is a grant and it's working to bring the accomplished teaching body of knowledge to Pilot schools the pilot schools in APS that are with this grant are Aztec homebound

[01:08:00]
Cleveland Middle School El Dorado El Dorado High School Manzano High School Atrisco Heritage High School Volcano Vista High School Egypt Ross Elementary School Mission Avenue Elementary School next gen Academy High School and Zuni Elementary quite a few schools this grant involves eight other states and two districts that also are using the accomplished teaching body of knowledge grounded in the underlying principles of national boards to positively impact student outcomes the body of knowledge includes the five core propositions the architecture of accomplished teaching and the national board teacher standards across the country teachers are experiencing the same positive results as the aps pilot schools by using the body of knowledge the school base problems of practice have pinpointed student

[01:09:00]
which have led to Greater Student Success school-based activities have included data analysis classroom observations new teacher support and Ed Rising just to name a few recently the network to transform teaching teams met for their final learning session to plan ways to sustain this important work that's the issue we have some wonderful opportunities we have to figure out how to sustain it and keep it going specially for programs like this that are that seem to be very positive with support of the associate superintendent Dr Gabriella Blakey and three national board certified teachers the team identified ways to the body of knowledge to more teachers in APS so that's exactly what we're trying to do this work has shown us that when teachers are able to identify their students needs to a Common Language it is the most powerful form of collaboration and has the biggest impact

[01:10:00]
one student outcomes and I'm so glad we had the dancing today because on April 3rd 2018 this week the tribal Summit meeting was conducted with approximately 42 individuals in attendance all tribal leaders in New Mexico were invited including Governor's Lieutenant Governor's Tribal Council delegates and Navajo Nation president's office State leaders and local leaders of organizations that work with Native American Youth the purpose of the meeting and it was here was to share information about federally funded programs such as Title 1 title 2 title for that's enough titles as well as promising performance outcomes of the students in APS after five-minute presentation from each of the senior executive director of the programs Summit participants

[01:11:00]
had an opportunity to discuss cultural relevancy cultural sensitivity and funding and this was the wonderful part about this the various program leaders responded to questions on specific topics including English language Learners bullying prevention student-led conferences and concerns about cultural insensitivity by using the terms at risk and poverty versus using at risk and and poverty to describe a student groups versus terms such as at promise and culturally rich I thought that that was a very interesting point that they brought up in addition the Navajo Nation president who came all the way from

[01:12:00]
Window Rock shared information about initiatives that were taking place on the Navajo Nation such as stem and environmental projects and stress the role that youth have after they returned to the nation upon graduation from college he expressed the hope that the Navajo Nation and APS form a strong collaboration collaborative relationship and quite frankly his Hope Is My Hope and we're certainly going to move in that direction the President also shared that a Bitcoin this is a new one for me that a Bitcoin was being developed which will depict the national the Navajo Nation she thought that was very very interesting so wonderful Summit on March 1st we begin use of an online registration module for existing and new APS parents and Guardians to review and update student information

[01:13:00]
this as you know we've been working on for quite a while and we're really gearing up for registration for next year the online registration module is a self-guided process which provides APS with the ability to control and manage registration within Synergy the module replaces the paper-based registration cards that we've used for centuries and reduces processing times eliminates paper forms and helps to ensure data accuracy the student Information Systems Department is working to train School staff regarding the use of the online registration system as well as how to promote online registration during pre-registration and other parent involved events the student Information Systems Department is working closely with APS Communications to promote and make online registration module visible on the aps website and in the Albuquerque Community the emphasis

[01:14:00]
over the next few months will be to increase the number of parents that have parent view accounts so that they can use online registration and currently the district has 35,000 parent view accounts and since the release of the online registration module we have seen an increase of close to 5000 additional parent view users and that was has been just one month in addition as of March the 30th this makes me happy as of March the 30th more than 7,000 online registrations have been submitted by parents and Guardians and I think this both very well for the future making life easier for our families I'm excited to see how this new Endeavor continues to make a difference in meeting and the growing needs of our of our students and families report thank you

[01:15:00]
thank you for dinner I will go on to our special issues we have a briefing regarding the consulate City Schools 2018 annual legislative and policy conference that's by our own board secretary Yolanda Montoya Cordova I get to talk again okay I just president Piercy and members of the board thank you so much for the opportunity to attend the conference in DC it was great opportunity for me as a new member coming up and some of the major takeaways that I got from that were not only beneficial I think just to my knowledge and understanding of school district's whole but it was really a pleasure to be able to meet with other school districts that have similar size similar issues so I really found that very beneficial the major takeaways of the conference everyone was really focused on the budget at that time because it hadn't been passed so the the

[01:16:00]
it was still under consideration and so there was a lot of like concern about what was going to happen but since then some things have happened we have a budget so that's good the surprises or I would say the things that I took away from the conference that were I just I just really I was very touched by some of the conversations and this was one around DACA and it was opening up with some concerns from a student who actually was a student with one of the school districts and was talking about his experience as a young man and realizing that he wasn't undocumented until he didn't know that he was undocumented until about middle school and he realized that he was undocumented because at that time he wanted to play sports and could not play sports because the school district that he was in couldn't cover him with the with coverage for the healthcare so he was excluded from that but my takeaways from that it was a great conversation some really

[01:17:00]
excellent points were made by the young student and one was how grateful he was that his school district actually had had a prominent place on their website around immigration and DACA information I went back and looked at ours and we do have some information up there as well what they had listed for him was not only numbers to places to get more information but also to organizations that supported immigrant families and immigrant students so I thought that was that was really helpful it was good information they also talked about the importance of ensuring that students and staff are aware of the circumstances from where are immigrants are coming from and really getting a really good grounding in understanding the political Strife for the nature of the countries where students are immigrating from and what that means for them just personally and what they bring as a result of just that trauma from the countries that they know

[01:18:00]
the countries of origin but also just creating a richer understanding for students and staff about what that means and having a little bit broader discussion and understanding about some of the different countries that were hosting students that are coming from different countries so all in all I was I was really impressed with that particular presentation I was also real impressed with the presentations around males of color work and wondered you know about our own mentorship program because I know that there was some work that was going on and I'm new to the board so I haven't maybe it's just doesn't come across me it's not visible to me at this point but really was really impressed with the work that was going on in Florida around the Brother's Keeper project and expanding that and having a real visible programs around mentorship for young males of color in schools and the difference that that was making it was it was a wonderful present

[01:19:00]
and so for me it was just you know what is apses role with regard to males of color and what kind of work are we doing to support that more broadly because I think there's definitely an opportunity and I know there was some work that was coming out through the Department of Health at that time around males of color and when I was just at school health I know we had a small project that was focused on actually engaging young men of color in in the city and it was a partnership so I'm just wasn't sure where we were with that let's see the presentation from the Department of Education was entirely focused on Essa they talked about the Essa plans and so much of the focus was on the process that they were using to review and the fact that there was still some plans that hadn't been completed but I wasn't I didn't

[01:20:00]
Emily come away with anything big from that presentation there was a lot of conversation around safety as a result of just the issues that had happened in Florida with Parkland there was a lot of agreement on the need to use restorative practices as part of the resolution to so a lot of the school districts were talking about that the resolution that the schools were being asked to to adopt that they also adopt a restorative practices to that and just have consideration for that and there was also a lot of support a large amount of support for improved safety that didn't include Army teachers so those are my major takeaways from the conference it was great thank you thank you Administration or the audience

[01:21:00]
I've been to this conference several times it is really a good conference and I think part of the deal is the legislative interface is obviously extremely good with the council great City Schools but also the equity aspect is always disgusting great detail at these these conferences because that's a large part of the urban District issue is equity and what we're doing about that so you know a lot of times but you know like the males of color for example we talked about that but it's really a lot about hispanic it's a lot about African-American it's about a lot of these different areas and so it's not like you've only focused on males of color it's a lot of focus on all these areas so and a tremendous focus on English language Learners and it was hard to pick like a session to go to so I was like going to another one so I could just sort of there was a lot I agree with you that was a lot of focus on on equity and

[01:22:00]
and a lot of Focus 2 on school performance people were talking about you know performance and ways that they could look at that more broadly and look at it more equitably as well to and using things that were making more sense to to districts but there was a lot of good banter and a lot of good discussions so it was very helpful yeah and one of the things that you like it may not be aware of but you know they've developed of course the kpis the key performance indicators and those are the original ones they did were in the maintenance operations area and facilities and we are we are strong participating in those things we have a lot with the special education issues we have a lot with the African-American other kinds of things in terms of equity issues and just for the audience to say it was our district that actually mentioned when they were doing good American studies and research and so forth that we suggested you know

[01:23:00]
there are some similarities in those but there are some differences and so they actually took that on as a special task to do to look at the Hispanic area and find out just exactly what the data was telling them about that area so it's a great organization and I think again these conferences are important and I think it was important to get a new board member there even though I would have liked to have gone but I had other duties and I think it's great so maybe in the future we can have other board members go to some of those things you know because I think it's an important organization and it's important to get everybody kind of familiar with how they work so other comments from anybody else

[01:24:00]
you know we have very few opportunities to to mix with districts that are as large as we are and the problems are very unique and so it's wonderful and thank you for the it's not a flash drive what is it you said okay so thank you for that because it's going to be very useful so I appreciate that thank you for bringing that back great okay we'll go on to the next one which is the discussion of the child finding

[01:25:00]
good evening for president Piercy members of the board and a superintendent Reedy what you have before you are proposed changes to a procedural directive as a result of a ped complaint the PED complaint centered around parents requesting a set of parents requesting that an IEP for student be held at a school at the school site and the IEP was never held at the school and as a result the parents did file state complaint against the district for not doing that as part of our defense we looked through New Mexico Administrative Code idea and really there is nothing in those two documents that reference that if a parent requests an IEP that one must be held although it is

[01:26:00]
I need to follow through when a parent does request that there's nothing in the laws that state that that needs to be that an IEP needs to be held upon investigation after we presented our information and responded to the complaint the investigator who is an attorney for the complaint you know understood what we were saying but as a result the PED has still required APS to review our procedural directives to ensure that they come out with New Mexico Administrative Code as to when an IEP needs to be held and when revisions of an IP need to be need to take place or need to work at the school level the information in the red which is on the procedural directive in front of you are the changes that we've proposed to make

[01:27:00]
make as a result of the settlement from the due process I'm going to have our amazing executive director for compliance Cindy Sue who walked through those changes with you thank you period thank you for the opportunity to talk with you this evening in front of you as a associate superintendent Sanchez mentioned are the proposed changes those changes are in red and indicated as track changes in addition to the two specific areas that we were asked to take a look at and determine whether or not our current procedural directives included those I also made a couple of other changes to the procedure directives starting at the top of the page are older current I should say procedural directives talked about having to provide a free appropriate public education to students with

[01:28:00]
disabilities who reside within the Albuquerque Public Schools boundaries and that is actually not correct it is not only that a child has to have a disability but also has to have a need for special education so I revise that to say must be made available to children with ineligibility as defined under the individuals with disabilities Education Act in addition to that I also made another reference into the the second line or the second paragraph indicating that that is something that's required in idea further down on your page is the first section of the two areas that we were supposed to take a look at and determine whether or not this information was included in our current procedural directives and that had to do when IEPs had to be reviewed and revised and what we added in that section was that anytime there is a lack

[01:29:00]
progress toward the annual goals of a student anytime that the results of a revaluation are made of available to us anytime information about the child is provided to or by the parents as well as the child's anticipated needs another matters those are instances in which revisions and and review of IEPs must occur further down on the same page we also talked about or we indicated when an IEP must also be conducted in that is within 30 calendar days of determining that the child is actually eligible for special education we must develop an IEP and on the last page is the other area the second area that we were asked or required to take a look at and that had to do with when IEPs have to be in effect and the two examples that are

[01:30:00]
play it on your sheet or have to do with children who transfer from either in state or out of state and so there's a clarification in in that those two paragraphs as to what to do in each of those situations so I thank you for your time and your for consideration and if you have any questions we stand for questions and discussion you might have any comments I don't know if it's just easier for me just to give you the corrections then just to try to go through it I think it's probably easier that way don't you okay I was looking at the other two pages that aren't you know that we're leaving how they how they are there was a lot of there was a lot of bullets

[01:31:00]
so I was kind of confused so let's just go like to the the first paragraph that is in red and it's you know for any student eligible etcetera etcetera and then it has to address and then you had there was colons everywhere else but there wasn't there and then there aren't like bullets there so I don't know if you wanted to change those to bullets or if you just wanted to change them to numbers cuz it's not like a consistency there so I was just kind of confused about that the way in which it's actually indicated here's the way it's actually written in idea but I'll be happy to change that to bullets and so that's there's consistency if you want to do it to make it consistent as long as it's consistent with numbers

[01:32:00]
whatever with the colons and and things and then the I mean I did have a question on that also on that first paragraph and you had what would be the three bullets or numbers and it says the results of any re-evaluation we don't really need the word conductive cuz the evaluation obviously has been conducted and then the one I was confused I'm not sure what it meant is the child anticipated needs so aren't the anticipated needs address in the gold in the IEP the antique the anticipated needs can be addressed in the gold but that's as a result of talking about what the strength of the child drinks of the child are what the specific services are that the child might require so it's actually it encompasses many aspects of the IEP that then

[01:33:00]
are culminated in a goal as well as delineated by specific services at the child might receive okay I was just was kind of confused about that one and then on the first bullet on that one you have any lack of expected progress I just think lack of progress would probably work a little better than adding any okay let me think and then one thing that I think is just easier that I think more people kind of understand when you were talking about how often you have to review and you said periodically but not less than annually I think the best way to say that I think most of us do is at a minimum annually I think that just makes it kind of open to however many meetings you would have instead of saying periodically but at you know but not less than annually

[01:34:00]
and then the bottom the very bottom one on that first page and read where it starts with a meeting I know you talked about qualifying and having eligibility so and I'll give this all to Brenda it's not changing the meaning at all but I think if we say a meeting is hell to develop a child's IEP which is what you're talking about having the meeting to develop their IEP and is conducted within 30 days of determination that the child qualifies for special ed I think that qualifies probably is the term you I mean you're the special ed people then saying needs I think qualifies is probably what would work better than needs and then if you could tell me just on the bottom and then it goes to the to the one up at the top so I was confused if that that went along with this one with the

[01:35:00]
who won the first page the very bottom one and then there's the one on the top so I was really kind of confused if that was just part of that sentence or was that going to be a separate bullet that's actually a separate bullet okay okay and that one I think too if we say in accordance with the child's IEP special ed and related services are made available to the child as soon as and I was looking at as soon as possible and if you want more flexibility and that's up to you they say that uses to provide flexibility that they say as soon as practicable instead of as possible so it depends if you want to have that flexibility because it's like that might have been some of the problem that you were talking about so that's something that instead of as possible that might be better and stuff and then just the word state in some of these

[01:36:00]
Sports and some of these paragraphs shouldn't shouldn't be capitalized okay and in fact they are capitalized in the New Mexico administrative code in identity ok

[01:37:00]
I do feel as though we are able to actually comply with the 30-day timeline I know that however we do face some challenges at each of those schools particularly our headteachers who are responsible for scheduling IEPs in a timely manner and and sending out notifications as required under idea to parents and so between scheduling and actually doing the paperwork they do face some significant challenges with trying to to not only do other duties but in some cases also teach you know throughout the day so I do see that as probably are most difficult challenge of the things that we are working with

[01:38:00]
with the associates is looking at release had teachers one of the biggest impacts that are Elementary had teachers have is if they're in schools that have high transfer rates where this has to get done within a 30-day deadline and they've got a full teaching caseload as well it really it does make a difference in in how what their work looks like and so we are having conversations particularly with some of the zones that might need a little bit extra support how many do we still have teachers having to step in to write IEPs for children that are in in classes without certified toes for to do those extra duties

[01:39:00]
what is the time frame to get the determination that you actually need an IEP in other words there's a screening process there's something that happens and so the question is and it's frequently the case is somebody says hey I think my child needs something okay maybe you have what is the time frame for that determination

[01:40:00]
it's been working on those kind of things I don't know whether you're comfortable in putting some kind of a time frame in there or if if there is such a thing but I do know that I've heard complaints about that in other words we contacted the school and nothing's been done now probably not totally true probably have done something you know what I mean but but to a parent they may not know that so the question is what's the process for saying or something somebody contact you about something who gets back with a parent and tells them exactly what the time frame is for the determination and that once that determination is made yes or no if it's a yes then we have 30 days to actually develop the IEP I think there's a difference of I think people say 30 days from the time I tell you I think I need an IP so I need one by 30 days and I think there's a difference there so I think that communication is is what may be the issue many times

[01:41:00]
absolutely you know there's two pieces there's a set piece which is where you start to use suspect that a child might have a disability based on a lack of progress in the general led curriculum and it's the school's Duty then to complete the set referrals and do interventions and that was usually take up to about 6 weeks and document those interventions they do need to meet with the parent on that so that so that the parent knows that the school is implementing those interventions to interventions once that set file is completed and that students still does not continue to make progress with Tier 1 and tier two interventions which often include differentiated instruction and more individualized instruction for First Student then that is signed off on by the principal saying that indeed they have made every effort to support the student and then that is turned in to us and then

[01:42:00]
what we do is we put them on the list for testing once the student comes up for testing we meet with the parent talk to them about the evaluation process and then the parent gives us permission to test and that's when the clock starts ticking and that's called informed consent with 60 days to complete that evaluation then I think one of the things that is confusing to parents and we've been working on this because what we're seeing now is many more parents filing based on failure to identify as the parents I think are feeling that if they send a letter to a school and say I want my child evaluated that that is what's going to drive the evaluation in fact there's nothing in ideas that states that we have to even evaluate a child if a parent request that and so many parents are under the impression that they can write a request in

[01:43:00]
we would test within you know with the latest issue that we're working on is the parents said well I gave permission to have my child tested how come he wasn't tested within 30 days and so one of the things that we've realized is an outcome of this and we're meeting with the associates tomorrow is to talk about the whole process is a system the side and the intervention side is a general Ed consideration it's a general Ed activity we don't get involved until that sat packet has been turned in for an evaluation and is completed by the school and so what we're looking at is training and training and child find Our obligation to fulfill child find obligations in Our obligation to if we suspect that a child has a disability in a school that it is our child find duty to support that child

[01:44:00]
who sat interventions in parents are invited to those meetings so that they understand what the process is that's exactly what I would like to see documented another I don't know where we have that information actually documented but I think if it needs to be a procedural directive it needs to be something that you guys can reference because I think that's part of our due process to say this really is how it works this is why we're doing it this is part of the idea process so they understand what role individual people play they have no idea who in fact is they get confused with that so we need to have something that's fairly simple for them to understand like your step one two three and then you have to have something that's kind of the more details

[01:45:00]
I see this is what the time frame is kind of this is what the steps are who's involved and therefore they have a point of contact and they know what kind of Step they're on I think a lot of times parents just don't know what step they're on you know I'm on step three or is there a step 3 you know I don't know that and and and and and so I think that would help a lot in terms of our due process first of all so when we get lawsuits about somebody saying you didn't do something say well this is our process and this is where we were and so that'll help a lot I think in terms of of a lot of these special education issues and it applies to give it a place to you know all of our special education areas and know you guys are working on it so I just whatever you can do to document that and really make it really precise I think it really helpful

[01:46:00]
and and then it just talks about child's fine and I'm saying okay I'll just try to find stuff that's not really everything I'm interested in and so whatever you guys can do to kind of say what what is it we need to really put down without putting down all of idea be you know please don't repeat I dab but you know something that really summarizes what we do so I think that would be good if we can do that and who works with overseas the process and the associates and so we're working on that yeah that's good and I appreciate what you guys do because I know it's a very very complex Jerry it's difficult and it's not easy to understand that the regulations are all over the place and so thank you for what you're doing and I know you guys can can do that well so thank you thank you

[01:47:00]
I just need to add that we will be submitting this information to the New Mexico public education department by April 9th so they've given us a deadline of April the 9th so we will make those revisions good thank you very much appreciate it we're going to board member comments first of all I know there's still some people out there and I just want to let you know you know who APS is by the programs that we get behind and I for one and somebody who's behind music behind having been a teacher I understand that that keeps a lot of kids in school having asked my students what's your what's your favorite thing at school and they would say PE and recess

[01:48:00]
those were I don't I'm not saying never but a few times I had somebody say science or math but it wasn't as often as it was PE recess so I know how important that is it's and I look at it that my children were able to be involved in club sports but having taught in areas where that wasn't a possibility the only thing they have is what you all provide them so I am behind you and I think that we need to put money behind our children because I know all of you will be fine you're going to be fine you'll end up having a job but the people who end up suffering are our kids and that is not what I will ever be for I will never be for our children ever not having something that they deserve to have that their parents may not be able to provide them so I want to thank

[01:49:00]
love you for coming I think that was just wonderful and I hope that we can we can figure it out it seems like we should be able to buy what a lot of you a lot of you said tonight so thank you for staying and listening and know that I am a gigantic supporter of PE Music Arts I know kids have to read and all that stuff but we have to get them at school and we want them to also be there so that's important I looked at the list of schools and it was and thank you for letting us know I thought that's how they had chosen the schools that they were titled when I looked at them and they were all titled when schools so it wasn't that it was a hodgepodge it's like oh we'll just give it here and there so I hope that we can do whatever we can to make sure that we keep you know I mean our budget is going to reflect who we are so I want you to know that that's who I am so I want to there's a couple of things that people said I think it was Mr Goodale that said equity

[01:50:00]
isn't it isn't equal and we know that it isn't so we need to make sure that we are Equitable all the time with our kids however however that takes shape we need to make sure that we do that another thing I think one of the one of the women I don't remember if it was Susan I mean her PE I think she said she had ADHD or something and he turned her into a successful person well why don't we want this for all of our kids cuz I think that's what it does so and I think Monica said it's a fun and healthy way to learn and I know that from my kindergarteners my first graders my second graders my third graders you have to make learning fun like I've said I taught kindergarten most of my career and they love kindergarten the best because that's how you should be teaching by doing and that's what Pete teachers do they are out there doing so I'm behind you

[01:51:00]
add today I spoke to I was at the spring budget workshop and I think Dr Bernstein is gone but she had called this they were talking about for those of you who weren't weren't there they were talking about the teacher pay and the two and a half percent raise and the minimum salaries so what they said you had to do like Barbara believed she was right is you have to get to the minimum everyone has to get to the minimum and then after you've got to the minimum because I understand that that bill passed first and so after you get all of the teachers to their minimum salary then the two and a half is above that so now we know where we have to have to go so good for teachers so that's that's a good thing for them they also did say though when it came to the minimum salary the two and a half percent average pay that the school district

[01:52:00]
could decide how to Divi that out so you could say we need to keep our level one teachers so we're going to give them more like will give them their 2% or 2 and 1 and maybe special add we need to make sure we keep them so it can be done however however the district decides to to divvy it out it doesn't mean that every single teacher has to get the two and a half percent it just has to be an average of two and a half percent so something to to say yay for teachers I think it was great that little pouch was a little one the cutest little thing dancing so I love being able to celebrate celebrate our cultures and we know that every day history can be made with aha winning that Championship so that's that's a good thing today I was speaking I was at the spring budget workshop and

[01:53:00]
I met this legislator there and he wanted to introduce me to to a young lady so I went over and started talking to her and he was telling me about this idea that he had never thought of and so he was explained he was explaining it and he was like well I never thought about this I never thought about this and he's like and then she's you know she's going to be graduating so I'm taking all her ideas and try to put it together for next legislative session and it was about background checks but she had this phenomenal idea of how to make them wonderful and so he said yes she's going to be graduating and how many days and she said 25 days or something so I thought she was graduating from college right because of the things that she does you know the senator was telling me and I was just like oh my goodness and she's going to be graduating next dress like congratulations from what college and she's like oh no I'm graduating from Albuquerque High so our kids like when you see that and you hear

[01:54:00]
you know that we don't have to worry and she was telling me you know what our class of 2018 we are the smartest class ever and our teachers tell us that we are so smart they don't understand why we don't have to study because we just get everything and they don't understand like we don't have to do our homework because we just get it and we just can pass all of our tests and we're wonderful and we're going to Cornell and Stanford and Harvard and they've never seen anything like that so that's what we all have to look forward to is those kids being able to lead us soon and I think that we're not going to have to worry so thank you all for being here tonight I have to give a shout out to Zone one for the Spanish spelling bee open Pandora

[01:55:00]
let's see crosswalks I know it's an issue and not just Cleveland but other other schools around and it seems like middle schools in particular because the assumption is their older students and they they can take care of themselves more of it especially Wilson has a real issue with traffic and been so it's you know it's something that that we should maybe try to really sit down with the city about because it's a joint city and county probably has some money to and so we should just work on on figuring out how to address some of this needs there is in front of screens so much of the time instead of kids manipulating and building and doing all sorts of things inside they're sitting in front of computer screen time

[01:56:00]
play time there are two different things and they need both of them without a doubt I am going to put out a little bit of a challenge and I brought this up yesterday at the or whenever we did Finance is that yesterday a long time ago if we really cared about kids in the state the way that we would find schools is to say every school should have this number of peaches so they can have every every day we have this many music teachers and art teachers the class size would be this we need the library's counselors social workers and that's what it takes and therefore this is what we put into the school budget and the stadium and not a distribution formula

[01:57:00]
but that's not the way schools get funded in this state the way schools get funded in this state is the legislature decides this is how much money we're willing to spend on education however it gets Justified the and then the state Equalization guarantee is a way of dividing it up and and so what comes to districts is based on you know enrollment and all of those things but it's a division formula it's not a funding formula and then the governor can decide to veto this or that or whatever so what we need because we keep saying we look at these needs and we say well of course we're committed to that we need to find it we're committed to pee we need to find it there's no doubt and I'm not sure where I mean I keep listening and I know there's issues around supplement and I think

[01:58:00]
you're in good shape I think we serve came out of the conversation yesterday feeling like that's not an issue and so I'm not sure exactly where there's money that we're giving back it's more an issue of are we putting that money where where was designated to go and I and I have the feeling from yesterday's finance committee meeting that we're committed to putting that money where it was designated to go the issue is we need to be a political force and we need to explain to legislators that there is need beyond what we get funded for because the reality is we're still at class size waivers we're still at giving schools for next year they're full of declining enrollment instead of reflecting what we know students really need

[01:59:00]
and that's based on what we get from the state so I mean I feel like for me I'm committed to making sure we have PE and that we maintain those programs but we say the same thing to counselors and nurses and Librarians and we need to be a political force together to say picking one program over another is not acceptable it's not okay and the only way that we will change that and turn it around is by being the kind of unified political force that can't be ignored and so every time every time we have one group of people come to present and it's and I mean the argument for peace is compelling there is nothing in the argument for PE that doesn't say we have got to do this we need to make sure we've been together so that when we say this is a compelling need

[02:00:00]
for every single one of those programs across the board we can do it and the legislators and the governor that hear from us feel that feel our pressure on them to make sure that happens so don't don't stop fighting you know just just keep going to continue this into election season next legislative season we've got to be able to fund the district the way it needs to be funded thank you Google

[02:01:00]
pleased that you have been able to organize and work together to come and make your case but as board member Peterson said we need to make the case to our legislators the number of folks who don't understand what you do and how important what you do is to the young people and their families your stories are inspiring so much to say and it does come down to adequate funding you know since 2009 when I first joined the board you know this was a huge issue you know and comparisons were made in terms of studies that had been done about what were we in terms of funding in our state well we got comp

[02:02:00]
play the Finland another countries Scandinavian countries were in fact they don't do the standardized testing and young people are encouraged to play up to around 8:00 7 Weil they learn to read it's an interesting it's an interesting juxtaposition if you will in my mind to say what's wrong with this picture what's wrong is we're not organized and we have to get to know our neighbors and listen to them and explain to them what the challenges are that we face that you face was very heartening to see the young people you know take on Washington in the ways that they did with social media and other things and I'm hopeful that that will be Trend at continues you know

[02:03:00]
also I've had as in board member Mueller out of coins concerned that she expressed my grandchildren say you know next year when I get music or next year when I get art you know that there's something wrong with that in terms of our priorities and especially glad for the for the opportunity to hear it from you but also for us to try to think it through as you explain it to us the information around of obesity childhood obesity and kinds of things that families are facing that are directly related to poverty and it's almost as if everybody's on chips and whatever else people drink so sorry

[02:04:00]
we're in a tough spot and I think that you have allies here but we need to really begin to figure out what it really means as we organized to be a better school district I think that we have to use the resources that we have well and I think you have a group of people here administrators and Leadership who are committing to committed to doing that but they're still they're still challenges and New Frontiers and one of those as I tried to say other comes with the other day yesterday is that we don't know how to have these conversations and we need to get better at it so one way we can ensure that is that you're at the table so fight for your place at the table help us help you and help us learn from you and we will move forward that's it

[02:05:00]
I was thinking about 2005 and I'm looking over at Chris Muir there was this big old fight at about that time around school health and coordinated school health and physical education was right at the top of the list on that and so I think it's just a lesson is what we can't become complacent with it because there was a big old fight at that time there was sort of an influx of additional money and additional energy around we need to have more physical education because that time Public Health was you know it's it's alarming there was all these issues around obesity and the fact that we needed better nutrition and we needed lots of other things to help our students with healthier weight in just Health General Health and well-being so it's I'm finding it like hard to guess now I'm starting to get old you know

[02:06:00]
the fact that we can't become complacent about it you know we have to continue to have the good fight around physical education in the importance of it physical education for me for my perspective and the education that I've had since I've been here in New Mexico working with the public health department and with school districts physical Ed is part of school health and it is the it is definitely that important place and I love when you describe because it is definitely all the things it's about nutrition it's about social emotional Wellness because that is a place where some kids actually become better just by having that social social emotional interaction that is their therapy and that's the kind of therapy that they need a lot of students in the lot of young people don't need a counselor you know they need that opportunity to be in play and to have that opportunity to problem solve on the playground so

[02:07:00]
I will continue to put up the good fight on that one because I definitely have committed myself to school health and Dr Muir who's here is taught me a lot about physical education and so it's not and it's not lost it's not lost education on me Chris I can't see her face she's looking at me going anyway so just just we have to just keep the fight I agree with that we can't become complacent on it I wanted to say superintendent read he said something really important in her report and it really resonated with me and I want to link it to also to our to our wonderful dancers but one of the things that she mentioned was this whole notion about language and labels matter and how we how we tend to ascribe labels or lab

[02:08:00]
listen to children and to groups of people having been a person who came from an at-risk community and was an at-risk youth or lived with an at-risk family you know it becomes it's very detrimental and so I like you know taking time that understanding that what we say to and how we ascribe and how we're describing our communities is really important because it does tend to ride with those children and something that you can easily become and believe yourself and so I really got buried in that report but it really resonated with me in the reason that it resonated with me was when that one young man came up and introduced himself and he said I am a Pueblo Indian and he said it was such as pride and and he is you know he should be proud of that and and so I just wanted to say thank you for mentioning that

[02:09:00]
and then I just want to say I had an opportunity this week to also attend the ribbon cutting ceremony for pajarito Mesa and their new playground and so as we're talking about kids having an opportunity to play but also having places to play that are safe and so I just wanted to thank the school district too for being part of that that effort just to see the families and the children and the playground is absolutely incredible and having grown up in this community and going out to the Mesa when it was just you know like dunes and you didn't do anything out there except like shoot rabbits and watch the coyotes but now it's like it's got this beautiful playground out there and the nice shelter that we've put up there so that the children have a place to go for before and after school so it really made a difference I could see the community members were very proud and

[02:10:00]
I was very proud to stand in support of APS in the work that they've done so I just wanted to say thank you thank you very much member Patterson thank you for your report and you know what I really like that Jim poems for a physical education and so I'm not going to repeat what has been said I think there's enough support here and enough has been said that you have our full support you know we have the educational Corridor up in

[02:11:00]
where we have Volcano Vista hillerman and the elementary school that lends itself to a lot of traffic and a lot of bodies going across a lot of students going back and forth and I think one of the things that may be helpful and this was about to my attention is that maybe what we need to take a look at is doing an assessment of the drop offs and the pickups of all of our schools there's some it was pointed out to me that there was some areas there could be problematic and I think maybe this is an opportunity for us as a district to take a look at that I don't need the crossword clue things that we have control over right now some of those bushes that are really high that are 710

[02:12:00]
hi maybe you need to maybe need to cut down we need to cut down so that you can you can see our children walking through the side by the sidewalks or crossing the street and so I just wanted to take a look at it I think we need to take a look at that and then I just want to thank Janet for always making our day she always seems to make you know thank you so much for the compliments and four you know supporting all of us I appreciate that very much and then you know we have some phenomenal students in our district participate in the fact that you can get up there and present to a group of evaluators of being one of the bilingual portfolio evaluators

[02:13:00]
I am and to listen to we have out there in terms of our students you know you translate you take this information and you do it in English in Spanish and and you present before this body of people who are evaluating you and I think we have some outstanding students as well as the teachers the principals and and those organizers I was able to actually went to West I was invited to be evaluated and it was actually organizes all of this in the teachers there and the principles that they bring from some of the other schools and somehow so I just want to give a shout out to the heart and do a lot of work and I'm really proud to be a part of this thank you thank you

[02:14:00]
he is a varsity baseball player for Valley high school so every single day he is active throughout the summer and so ever since he was in kidding and he is now a junior so and they beat up by the way last night so he's 17 years old

[02:15:00]
play Activision his entire life so thank you for that and I'd like to take the rest of my board comment and and do a moment of silence for Eliza who is the young girl who died tragically crossing the street at Cleveland so I know we've had a lot of discussion about her tonight but you know it's impacted all of us and I got a call from from mayor Keller last week and you talk about absolutely impacted him as a father and as someone who's responsible for the children in our city just like the rest of us so just please know that he was impacted just as much as the rest of us so I'd like to take the rest of my board comment to have a moment of silence for thank you thank you thank you

[02:16:00]
put comments Barbara Peterson and chief did meet with a person named Lars Council who is the Department of Homeland Security assistance special agent in charge and we talked a lot about some of the collaboration potential on issues that we might want to work with in terms of of the Homeland Security in terms of ice as well and you know how to mentioned before probably a year now that when I came back from one of the great City school meeting had suggested that you know what he did is he went and he collaborated with hey we need to make sure we understand make sure that we collaborate on that so there aren't any collaboration or any communication

[02:17:00]
and so I think Mr Council was very receptive to that very receptive to making sure that we can get an understanding here got to be careful how we State those things because he has his own upper level supervision kinds of people but I think we can get a pretty good discussion on that going and so we suggested that we have another meeting with the superintendent Reedy and with some of us to actually go through that a little bit and make sure that we understand what we can say publicly but what we cannot say perhaps publicly but make sure there's an understanding about how we work with our students and make sure that our communities understand that so I like that discussion a lot and I wanted to communicate that to the boards at that that's something we want to work on and so we will have a discussion on that with our and he said he has control over the

[02:18:00]
nothing from Sequoia North and I said well what happens South and he says well there's a Las Cruces person who works on that and I said that's okay but I says we need to have a full New Mexico understanding of what we're doing here and so to maybe have even this extended towards the Las Cruces folks and make sure that we have a really good relationship here because a lot of the people in the homeowner security do some great stuff and there's some some bad stuff that's going on that they are actually trying to address and we need to support them in that you know there's a lot of stuff in the drug culture there's a lot of stuff in other things that are very good things that these people are doing and so we need to make sure that we understand you know that relationship really well make sure we understand what our policies and we made it pretty clear what are role was and that we needed to support our students and our parents in terms of what we're doing and

[02:19:00]
and the idea being is that there's any issues let's go to him and say hey we got an issue here and get it taken care of because there may be some things that lower levels that don't happen exactly the way we want them to happen or even he wants them to happen and so we need to make sure that we got that point of contact so I think that's one very important thing we also a few of us Barbara Yolanda because their districts are are impacted met with the New Mexico ped on our MRI School restructuring plans today I thought it was a decent discussion I think we came away with some reasonable actions in terms of good luck guys over the next few minutes and I think we do have maybe a path forward and so what we need to do

[02:20:00]
and so that challenges is to write it down in a manner that the public education department degrees so that'll be done in the next few days I thought the board budget Workshop that we had yesterday was very good I think we got some good understanding and particularly with regard to our rpe program and where that's going I think we do have some process things that we need to put down in terms of how we allocate extra funding and not for the program and we I think put that forth to as a challenge for our for our staff to look at so I think we've got some path forward and some of that activity so I look forward to getting that out to you guys and appreciate it very much of those kind of things in terms of the Cleveland issue you know I

[02:21:00]
gray definitely the Cleveland area there is an issue but to follow up with board member of Garcia this is a more systemic issue this is not just at Cleveland we can go to McKinley we can go to Madison we can go to almost any of our schools and there's a crosswalk there guys that isn't covered and so the city has to decide how they're going to do the systemically not just put up a light or something at Cleveland and call it good that's not what we need to do we need to analyze where are these issues are I think you mentioned Volcano Vista and those areas there are a lot of other areas where we have issues and we've got to be cognizant of the fact that this is not our property guys this is not APS property and we got to be careful with who does what and who funds what we've been working with you know I think they'd like us to cover all the roads outside of APS and everything else we cannot do that we are not fun

[02:22:00]
did you do that so we have to be careful about what our role is what the city council is and still make sure that our kids are safe so I think it's a bigger discussion and I think we need to contact the mayor mayor Keller who's our friend and also our counselor people and say look we need to have a larger discussion here about this and this is about our kids it's about a lot more than even our kids say the truth there's a lot of different places probably where we have these kinds of issues in our city because we're looking at it in a volume since we can make it like cheaper per area that we need to cover so I think that's that's an important thing you know what the people here in the didn't tell you was I was the one who wrote that letter about living in a gym

[02:23:00]
just let you know how was that guy my dad was a music director at a small in a small town Rifle Colorado

[02:24:00]
learning things

[02:25:00]
this is how you attribute what I call the abstract academics to the real world and we have to start thinking more of that way you know people in Shop people in home Mac people who are doing the culinary arts if you don't think that's science at work you're missing the point you're missing the point I've listened to my kindergarten teachers in music who are teaching about locations of countries the kind of style of cultural music that is being played in those countries the dance that are being used they are exercising their kids in those things they are having them do they kind of like that that's what you're doing in the physical education program a lot it does not just about running around the track and getting a little bit of exercise it's much much more than that it's what I call

[02:26:00]
play academics and so these are the things that are important to the kids because they are learning about the real world they're running about something they like to do you know if I've often said if you go look at recess and you watch kids out there it is a creative Innovative self-organizing group of people out there they will reorganize and reorganize and group and play games in 20 minutes and we'll do that about four different times if you just watch him and let him do it those are the organizational team building skills that we keep telling people are important in leadership why not emphasize those kinds of things as part of our normal thing we talked to the dentist

[02:27:00]
or at our 3mri schools and all they can say was all that wasn't actually educational I wasn't actually learning that wasn't teaching it is teaching guys it is educational it is academic learning it is applied academics and so I want to emphasize all the time that what we're trying to do here and I think the superintendent is doing this very strongly in terms of our academic and so forth is we are working on what we mean by applied decorations in the whole contact list of the child and what we mean by the child actually being an important part in addressing some of these root cause things these things so it's called an extended condition kind of thing in Cleveland's of all the possibilities here because they're just going to be another

[02:28:00]
they need to be safe from the time they

[02:29:00]
leave their house to the time they come into the school that the climate of fear that our families are feeling around immigration is real and that it is not okay and so when Dave says collaborate I feel compelled to clarify that it's really a matter of clarification what really is Isis position what really and truly can we say to our families that we really and truly can Implement and where is that line and it's really an issue of clarifying and communicating and I just I have never been more proud of sitting at a table to hear someone talking about our responsibility as a district to the students that come to us and so thank you Dave thank you very much

[02:30:00]
play great compliment and I want to say to my staff I'm really proud of you guys I'm proud of what you've done for our MRI schools and we're going to make it work we're going to make it work no matter how we have to do it but we're going to make it work so thank you keep working on it and we're going to we're going to make it work so this board is behind you I can guarantee you that okay with that will announce the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday April 18th 5 p.m. actually we're probably going to have one on the 11th based on the discussion today and the next Barbados education will be 23rd special one will be able to get we may have a special one on the 11th so just alert board members
