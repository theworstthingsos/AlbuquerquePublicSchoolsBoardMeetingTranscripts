[00:06:00]
dance with College and Career skills along with internships apprenticeships and job opportunities but I'm also here as a parent of a beautifully creative child who has struggled with their own mental health due to bullying I brought my child to data during their 7th grade year because I felt supported there myself and I saw the culture and community that data and its faculty or striving to create and I believe in that Vision my kid has access to amazing electives and classes that value and engage their creativity and the school also offers a robust counseling staff that includes trained peers faculty and even an Innovative partnership with a local counseling program to teach students lifelong skills that are beneficial for their mental health my child and I have directly benefited from the support curriculum and community that thrives at data and I see this Direct

everyday on the students that I teach their who say that they have also found a culture of support opportunity and acceptance within our walls I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you guys here today and thank you thank you thank you ma'am next speaker is large Kingston Edwards you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking hi my name is Lar

[00:08:00]
did in other words I'm a junior at the public academy for performing arts and I just like to play something to show how much the school means to me

[00:09:00]
thank you baby good evening

[00:10:00]
unfortunately I can't show my dancers today it's impossible in this space and it's fitting that that should happen because that's something that we are changing and in our space at the public academy for performing arts in 1980 these Linguistics there is a lack of in Johnson wrote this book metaphors we live by and in metaphors we live by they discovered that what we already know intuitively and that is that metaphor is pervasive in our language and it affects everything we we perceive about the world and you know and there's all these a metaphorical categories that we that are integrating to our language for example argument is war right that's that's a metaphor that's ingrained into our language so an argumentation which is what I'm trying to do right now is making argument for my school the metaphors that are giving to me through the language already that that's in bed and English language is a metaphor for War I need to defend my space here I need to make an a case against

[00:11:00]
what if what if it wasn't an argument for War what if there was a different metaphor we live by maybe it was dance and what's cool about that when we think about a metaphor for dance what changes the way we conceive of the world around us it changes the way we approach arguments it's it changes the way we see ourselves in a relation to others and that's something we're doing in our space and that is a beautiful thing unfortunately it's being silenced by the structures that were that were that we're giving here all right so I can't show the dance to you but I encourage you to seek it out because when you live by through a metaphor of dance it changes everything thank you our next speaker is

[00:12:00]
Chris Brown you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking hello my name is Chris Bonham I'm representing charter school first I'd like to thank the board for your time dedication and allowing me to speak my love runs deeper 2004 just a couple years after its creation and in a PD we had they asked us to write one word describes family is the heart of everything that we do we use those relationships to push kids academically to support him with SEO program and like all families we have the kids best interest at heart and see when you have four thinking of menstruation hardworking teachers and staff in conjunction with families and communities happen in relationships

[00:13:00]
I've had many students ex students that have actually entrusted me with their kids to me that is one of the highest honors over the last 20 years I've seen this girl and adapt well always staying true to his mission and we have some amazing things planned for the next 5 years so I stand here in front of you today asking for your vote for the New York Charter let us show you what a family can do thank you thank you our next speaker is Gail Stewart and she will be on zoo can you hear me we can okay so much thank you for this opportunity to provide public comments on aps's that's the first school on your agenda tonight

[00:14:00]
my direct and anecdotal knowledge of Ames dates back to the early years after it started in the mid-2000s at all times since then my direct and anecdotal knowledge of this charter school has been that it actively seeks to emulate a private school for academically high-achieving students through the use of federal and state dollars without adherence to federal laws assuring the educational rights of students with disabilities if you look at the second item in your agenda packet concerning aims you'll see the executive summary page 3 of the summary provides student demographics at Ames compared to Albuquerque Public Schools while APS student population includes 19% students with disabilities Ames have 0% this is for both the reported years 2122 and 2223 it appears to statistically impossible

[00:15:00]
charter school with hundreds of students has zero students with disabilities this can only happen through the intentional manipulation of the composition of the student body based on excluding or counseling out students with disabilities according to the demographic report there's also 0 students with English Learners in the same time period the federal government has made it very clear that it violates Section 504 to exclude or refuse participation of students with disabilities and accelerated programs such as Ames has APS as the chartering Authority does not insulate itself from legal liability for disability discrimination you are cognizant of this based on the self-reported demographic of the school thank you thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Leora Kennedy you have two minutes once you begin

[00:16:00]

[00:25:00]
one reason I think Mountain mahogany should continue to be a school is because we have both Gay Days both gay days are are when every Monday either middle school or elementary school goes to the both gay yeah I really like both gay days because instead of just like saying about setting in a classroom and learning about nature from a textbook we can actually like experience it and sometimes we get to see porcupines and stuff and once I even saw a beaver at the school and we see lots of turtles which I really like yeah I think days are really nice learning experience that

[00:26:00]
are there schools don't really have because yeah yeah that's why I think of mountain mahogany should remain a school thank you for your time thank you Andrew you have 2 minutes once you start sorry are the elective we have Garden 3 times a week once a week also the teachers are really awesome and people who need

[00:27:00]
extra support or extra Challenge and learn at their own pace also via a wonderful and the Spring Festival is where we walk to school that to show what they've done their thing we also have we also have back to school

thank you board members for this opportunity to speak my name is Jenna Perez and I'm an administrator at Digital Arts and Technology Academy if you've been to our school and I and I hope all of you get a chance to visit you'll know that data is more than just a school it's home to a very very unique group of students who felt like they never quite fit in anywhere else I think we're all pretty familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs and we know that students cannot learn unless they feel safe and understood and I think we do a good job there at data our students are artists their Engineers their musicians their filmmakers actors and writers they learn valuable Career and Technical skills that serve them post-graduation they're encouraged to grow and explore before their time with us

[00:29:00]
is done when it comes to Student Learning I sit in spaces with some of the most brilliant and Innovative Educators I've ever had the privilege of working with in my life we are working diligently to move the mark for our students we know that we have work to do we're not perfect but we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to continue to work hard to serve our very unique group of students thank you so much for your time thank you ma'am our next speaker is Michael Wood followed by Miller Miller would you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you for your time I'm Michael Woods teacher of 16 years Adam doesn't like School currently lives about 10 minutes away from our property this semester is moved out of his house twice to his grandparents house in town and makes the 30-minute commute to our school his freshman

[00:30:00]
more year he made a regular routine of spending the first hour of the day in the social worker's office most of those first two years he spent looking down at the ground his junior year he took my music class it wasn't sunshine and rainbows and we spent a lot of time in tutoring sessions to get her to pass the course but he found a purpose and a connection he started looking up now and his senior year he started to band got some new friends that I introduced him to and get this he actually even got a job with the security company that does security at our school Curtis loves school he lives about 5 minutes away from the property Curtis has friends he's on the basketball teams is the first in the Albuquerque Symphony and it's working as an intern at National Labs Curtis began a role model is a role model student for youth in government and even became the governor of New Mexico through yag all the activities he put his participated in have given him connection and purpose

[00:31:00]
I asked that you renew the East Mountain High School charter for two reasons one I am trying to build a school for my two children every day I come with a purpose of making these four green Tuff Sheds better in terms of teaching and connection and two for all the students we serve the High Flyers like Curtis you dream of going to Georgetown University and more importantly the struggling students like Adam or simply glad to have a school that they feel a connection to thank you sir our last speaker is Miller Miller of 2 minutes once you begin thank you everyone my name is Miller million I'm a junior at East Mountain High School so at MHS doing tonight to express who they truly are our Charter School believes that every child has a unique voice and we are committed to helping them Discover it we offer rigorous and engaging coursework designed to stimulate young minds but also creating spaces to Foster collaboration and creativity

[00:32:00]
your students don't do not just sit in rows and memorize they work together on projects so real world problems and explore ideas as a team I would say that several classes offered at emhs try to build thinking classrooms this creates a space where students are working towards a common goal to understand the contents together for my own personal experience East Mountain has given me so much in terms of Education opportunities and experiences you're all three of these I have been able to accomplish New Heights and strive to become a Ford thinking leader as stated with an hour mission statement I'm prepared for a wide range of college experience is because of the impact that the emhs has had on me please resume the school for another five years so students can become students can benefit from the schools amazing faculty and programs thank you and board members that concludes public forum thank you to all who spoke tonight on behalf of their

[00:33:00]
school we will be considering for Renewal Chief of Staff Johanna King and Dr Joseph Escobedo senior director of charter schools will present on behalf of Albuquerque Public Schools Miss King you have the floor Madam vice president board members and superintendent Blakey this evening we bring for your consideration the renewal of 7 Charter Schools each school is represented by school leaders and members of its governing Council all but one are currently APS authorized Charters the first beer consideration the Albuquerque Institute of math and science at UNM is currently authorized by the public education commission but is seeking approval of a 5-year contract with APS representing the school tonight is principal Academy Walton thank you Miss King do I have a motion on item for one to consider the renewal contract renewal

[00:34:00]
contract and performance framework for the Albuquerque Institute of math and science at UNM I will move to approve for the renewal contract and performance framework for the Albuquerque Institute of math and science at UNM this is board member Jackson and this is Crystal a second is there any discussion on the issue I have a question so after reviewing the documents that were presented to us School in particular the school executive summary the academics are outstanding at the school and I would expect them to be given the demographics but my question is this

[00:35:00]
should I wait till I think I'm coming up now that my question is this what strategies do you have in place to improve and to diversify your student population so it's more in line with the Albuquerque Public School population demographic

[00:36:00]
currently we have about $800 kids in that Lottery and then the lottery is actually run by computer I have nothing to do with that and nor does my staff so it's all it's all my parents but they have to do they have to get on the website and see how to do that but again so I have a phone

[00:37:00]
to recruit a variety of parents we hold a public meetings for anybody who wants to come we also will answer questions about any kind of curriculum that we have we have tried to diversify as much by just having us totally back off and so it's it's parents interest that allows parents to actually like I said through the website but I know through another Charter School who designed the

[00:38:00]
questions application in a variety of languages is that something that aims has tried we do not because we are totally hands off the parent is interested in entering their child on the lottery and other than the lottery for the website since your hands off with the lottery selection which it is a lottery what marketing are you doing in order to promote your school to different populations and different communities absolutely none we don't we don't actually entice anybody to come into my school like I said we have an 800 population of students that are in the lottery we choose about 300 and when I say choose it's a machine thank you may I say just one statement I think Justin clarification for the conversations being

[00:39:00]
when I look at the paperwork that's presented to us I do want to recognize that over 70% of the population is minority so they I feel like they have met that qualification based on the database submitted generally when a parent is interested in the school they ask other parents and what I'm saying is the racial makeup of students is 50% Hispanic 26% Caucasian 22% Asian 0.3% Native American and 0.2% black I mean it's it seems to be balanced especially based on the fact that your your school has it extremely very good reputation or

[00:40:00]
proficiency rates and for preparing students for for college and college or career and I think one thing that that I think needs to be highlighted is that this is the choice that the parents and the students are making to come to your school and the reason that they're making that choice is because of the extreme rigor and extreme academics and I think you you attract parents and students based on reputation for the proficiency that you are able to to produce my assumption is you're able to produce that kind of proficiency because of high academic standards that you create within the school so it it does seem to me as though the the the balance that is being sought seems to be there but it's also

[00:41:00]
it's by the choice of the parents and the students not because of Any I don't want to see what's in the word besides manipulation not anything that you've done on purpose thank you Google for students with disabilities we do have a special she handles all those kids she's excellent so I don't know what to tell you I do know that we have a special ed students and we give them services and they have a piece and I'm happy to show that to anybody that wants to see that

[00:42:00]
so I can point out I think so the information that we have sorry madam chairman thank you so when we're looking at the the information on our data right here it says students with disabilities it says 0% but in very small little letters up at the top it actually says students with disabilities is 0.22% and the English language Learners is 0.25 percent so it just didn't show up in the graph so you do have English language learner students and you do have students with disabilities and you are providing them Services yes within federal statute laws yes we are and we have we are scrutinized frequently and so at no time have we ever been found to be out of compliance that's in 25 years okay and so if I might do a follow-up because

[00:43:00]
why is there an asterisk and why is it at the top and not included in the graph I'm not certain where you're looking at I have several graphs okay so I am on Page actually there isn't a page number to 3 page 3 of the school executive summary was just what the graph produced and we noted noted it up until summer okay thank you so I have I guess the question is for you the other executive summaries have had grass

[00:44:00]
IEP compliance and whatnot so a chair and the board member Dominguez actually we are one of the very few authorizes that are in the country who actually do the special and compliance so the public education commission and public education department do a cursory overview of monitoring through State reporting but we're actually Hands-On looking at IEP compliance at a very granular level and a

[00:45:00]
Janella Sturgis ever Benavides yes they're still talking about subpoena Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes okay thank you very much for Accelerated learning including name change formally joining us from the school or executive director and a Phillips and governing council president Molly Chavez

[00:46:00]
do I have a motion item for 4.2 I moved to approve the renewal contract and performance framework for Archer Academy including the name change which was formerly Los Puentes charter school this is Crystal a second and roll call please for the vote sorry not time for that so we're going to discuss and talk about this a little bit before we take it to a vote so any questions or discussion please open the board I will say something I don't really have a question it's more just pointing out that you serve the exact population that we are focusing on on our golden rules so I guess I don't have a question actually now that I'm just seeing your grass that there hasn't been a growth in student outcomes

[00:47:00]
speaking of that I just want to know what your barriers are because you are exact population and if we could support in any way we should be doing that in all schools so I just want to know what the struggles are and what your plan is madam vice president and board members for us thank you for that question that is the exact definition of our school our barriers consist of number one or Mobility rate or average Mobility rate is 46% and so we engage students that have been out of school for some time or have for any number of reasons not been able to make continuous progress on their high school education or even earlier we serve 7th through 12th so when when we receive a student and they spend less than 90 days with us you know before going on to another school or you know completely

[00:48:00]
I'm going to school and coming back we have been implementing different instructional practices our Focus going forward is the learning acceleration and would that will allow us to do is to present the grade level material to all students instead of going back to the level where they may be and trying to remediate going forward we are presenting the grade level with just in time supports and Remediation this is a process it's going to take multiple years we have seen both as you can see in several areas mathematics being the most challenging we have also implemented an early warning system and that is thanks to the support that we received from APS that's utilizing our Title 1 funding so this addition to or programming will help us just have an earlier school of of the interventions that a student will need

[00:49:00]
proficiency another barrier husband you know we we have engaged in aggressive turnaround over the last four years since our last Charter renewal and along that process we have seen some staff turnover and identifying the right Personnel who know the content who have a certification endorsement in mathematics and is able to satisfy the demands that the school presents for working with a population of students that need those behavioral social emotional and academic support in order to move forward it has been challenging we have made tremendous progress in that since we continue to pursue the professional development opportunities that are stuffed required in order to continue to support our students

[00:50:00]
and we are lifelong Learners like our students so you know we are pursuing that continuous Improvement through all of those in any additional measures that we need to ask the opportunities present thank you and this is the comment that I was going to start with but I thought it was better for you to share all of that so thank you one concern that I do have if we do not renew this contract is that you do have many students who do feel like they were pushed out of traditional schools and you provide a safe space for them to go and continue their learning or just to get their feet you know back on the ground so I am in support of the work that you do and like I said I feel like we as an APS Charter we can support you with different things so I'm just pushing the renewable because I do know that that's it's a hard spot and I've been to this a couple of times and I'm seeing the work that

[00:51:00]
what do you say thank you for that any questions I have a question so I was looking at the members of your governing Council and I was focused on the the time on the council and it's a pretty big Spectrum so you have one member who's been on for 19 years and then one who has been on for 2 months and so I'm just curious what are the terms how are they Chosen and what do you attribute to the person who's been on there for 19 years well I can speak to I believe it was I do not know the page but over the last probably four years and I'm very hesitant that I am the president now I'm going to throw this out by as you hear my story for many people remember she passed away about 4 and a half years ago maybe about 4:00 and then the gentleman who was the vice president pass

[00:52:00]
play about 3 and 1/2 years ago then our secretary passed away two years ago yes so we're not going with that Trend so we had a really a huge turnover with our with our board and so it was a rebuilding phase over the last few years to get us at least back up to where we needed to be for our bylaws pretty sad that we're back up to 8 now and really that's the impetus that started with some of the turn 18 year this is actually her last month with the board she's she's moving on she was one of the founding members with probably a couple years after the school started and it really was due to death that we had turned over thank you

[00:53:00]
thank you for being here so I'm looking at the assessment results and I see a lot of 0% but then I also see for example on the New Mexico Masa measure of Student Success question mark and this is in the school executive summary that we have you've got Hispanic students in 202324 coming in at 25% proficient in English 0% in math and then 28.6% in in science and give them the demographics that you work with

[00:54:00]
I know that that's an accomplishment that the 25% and so what I've got two questions what strategies can you implement that that weave those productive moments with the areas that are challenging thank you so much for that question or fortunate opportunities for us the charter school to be able to to put out or initiatives in order to support her students measure the progress and then we aim we do it through strategic planning starting with the 90-day plan every year we do it with their long-term strategic over the next five years

[00:55:00]
so one one of those strategies is to provide professional development for teachers for example just because you're certified to teach a subject doesn't mean you know the standards and just because you know what the standards are doesn't mean that you can teach to the death of the standards so a strategy that we are focusing on starting this year and going forward is to ensure that our teachers are understanding the tasks that are given to the students in order to provide the rigor in in that task that is presented to them that is comparable to their assessment so I supposed to just saying well the students are doing well and they support their Assessments in the classroom and then we have to wait until they take the state assessment and then we have to wait until the results are published and then we can revisit our teachers are working collaboratively in their professional Learning Community to collect student work

[00:56:00]
not only to analyze with the students are producing but also to ask in their reflection of their own practice what is it that we're asking the students to do there is a publication that has guided our work over the last few years by tntp it's called the opportunity missed and it speaks us to students that are typically marginalized and how schools are saying well here we're going to take it easy on these kids these tasks the graduated with a 3. 5 5

[00:57:00]
you can improve our instructional practices in order to support them through the attainment of those very lofty goals and so my follow-up is what changes are you going to make to your finances to reflect that kind of direct instruction that you're talking about because in reviewing the other contracts your direct instruction percentage is 38.3 and I won't name the other school but another school is at 68% and I do understand what you're looking at we are very small charter school and you have our membership numbers we are working in the 100s some of

[00:58:00]
these numbers that you look at for example the direct instruction under function of 1,038.3 % is due to the fact that we've been able to leverage additional funding sources most recently we have had Esther funding that we were able to go to salaries for instructional staff as well as CSI we are in CSI status for graduation rate as well as other supplemental funds that we do count on for example we have a gear of New Mexico program where one of a few sites one of two sites to receive that funding they provide instructional stuff funding as well so even though you may see that 38% out of the operational directed to instructional staff we leverage with additional and supplemental funding as we can so that we can make our budget work for students we do carefully and strategically put the dollars to to work

[00:59:00]
benefit of our students and will you revisit function 2300 and 2,500 at all yes those administrative costs yes absolutely the administrative costs goes you know the central Administration goes to the executive director salary and then expenses and purchasing that is required to conduct the administration of the school being a charter school we do have to administer entire our entire operation and the Central Services also includes all of our contractual services like business office and and others so yes we do revisit on the board is is really involved budget and I know it's hard because you're small it's small and enrollment but the percentages

[01:00:00]
are significantly higher in your administrative costs then some other schools and so I can't help but note that as I'm hoping as a possibility where their can be some change absolutely and I am confident that you know once some of those funding sources like Sr was so huge funding source that we're able to bring in those were the covid relief funds that we were able to code and just to ensure the health of the you know the cash balances that the school has we are able to leverage with those funds are now gone those have expired and so in the future you know that should reflect the percentage of just as well of the operational funding that is used in how it's applied thank you

[01:01:00]
I have one question with your Mobility rate at 46% and your enrollment of your students at what is it 118 or as little higher than that that's at 120 days anyway how many of those students from stay in the longevity of those students from 7:00 to 12:00 stay with you to complete graduation yeah that's my question for the current graduating class of 22 percent of our students have been enrolled at least want this from 9th grade on 22% of students in the graduating class of 2531 students are continuous for their entire High School experience and this is another initiative that we have

[01:02:00]
we've done marketing and advertising but we also have really looked at her internal practices initiatives student support behavioral incentives to attract students to make us their choice we do know that students who will start with us and don't continue with us I review the data on the graduation report I know that they don't do well I know that the student is the state with us do and so we are hoping to continue to communicate that message there are some things that are out of our control to retain the students but that is definitely a goal that we have that is ongoing to help them stay here and make us their home until graduation thank you okay one more and this one's for our senior director of charter schools so what evidence does APS

[01:03:00]
have to justify the projected improvements that are listed on because you do have a difficult population and so what yes what's the evidence for suggesting that in 202526 Reading will go up to 30% math 15 science 3585 years ago we had two or three schools going to turn around and this school because of change in leadership and following the center for school turn around really focus initiatives they have really turned the corner

[01:04:00]
when you when we finish the next contract I think we're going to see some significant games okay let's go ahead and move on to our 4.3 item and this is considered approval of renewal contract and performance framework for Digital Arts and Technology Academy joining us from the school or executive director Lisa Marie and

[01:05:00]
McDonald's contract and performance framework for the Digital Arts and Technology Academy board member Jackson and this is Crystal City social justice with

[01:06:00]
listen to develop independent thinkers and those who claim their agency and so I'm looking at the demographics and they seem to represent a portion of the most vulnerable demographics in the targeted population of Martinez and Yazi lawsuits and Page 8 of the executive summary also shows you have a great graduation rate for some of your students so I also looked at page 5 of the executive summary citing SAT scores for 11:00 Raiders so what strategies are supportive learning systems are in place for I think it's on the 9223 student scoring not proficient in math and 49.4 % not proficiency

[01:07:00]
reading correct and thank you for the question and thank you for having us here and I appreciate that and I just would like to before we start to say a special thanks to the Albuquerque charter school team Roberto Vasquez and pcsa I've been doing this almost for 20 years and I've worked with them along the way and their support and guidance and willingness to help us become a better school to serve our students and families throughout Albuquerque is phenomenal so I do appreciate that and I appreciate your continued support looking at math that is one of our biggest concerns and one of our largest issues that we're dealing with at the school we've already started to implement a different approach to that knowing that we are seeing the residual effects of covid as the students are moving through education so for

[01:08:00]
sample this year we have our students that are in Algebra 1 in that class not in not for two periods we do 90 minute blocks but they are in that for an equivalent time of approximately 2 years so dedicating that time towards those Algebra 1 students to build them up and to bring them to a place where they have a better understanding and more Proficiency in Mastery of that subject we just started that this year and arrange the schedule to make that happen we're very very eager to see if that's if that's going to bring the results that we hope it will we also adopted a new math curriculum last year HQ I am on a different and acceleration both online and of course workbook textbook opportunities students and parents can access it from home so we're hoping that will also help to address that for a special

[01:09:00]
vacation population we also purchased IXL as an additional supplement for those students so they can continue to work with that if we do pull-out sessions but also from home to help practice those basic skills that so many students I think we're missing and have been neglected as we've gone through these these years after covid so that's that's where our time and energy is going I would say if there was a right answer or a perfect curriculum to buy if you guys know that please tell me cuz I really appreciate it but I believe in the dedication of our staff one of the things that really is driving us this year and will continue to drive us throughout the next five years is transparency not only with you not only with the state not only with parents but with each other we've come to understand that the silent approach to teaching a teacher in their classroom you do good you stay there is is not what our students need

[01:10:00]
so we have a weekly collaborative meetings between departments and teachers so we all know what is happening and what we're covering in each of the classes because it is a shared responsibility it's not just our Math teachers that are responsible for math scores we all are same thing with reading social emotional development whatever it might be and so we're creating a system and a practice where that's what we do our CTE teachers whom you heard from from earlier are reading and Math teachers are Humanities are stem everybody has math and reading goals so even our in our elective courses are teachers are discussing with students about reading and about writing and having them do those things not necessarily teaching us an English class or teaching a math class but using those math practices using those reading and writing practices so the students understand that those core skills apply to every aspect of their life and

[01:11:00]
just when they're in the math class or just when they're in their English class that sounds great thank you one final observation again I'm looking at the finance page and I see 57.5 % in direct instruction and I can I can't help but compare that to some other schools that have 68.4% at other schools 5% at data and so I'm just and then School administration those administrative costs $2,400 item 2400 is at 12.30 supposed to 4.7

[01:12:00]
I guess what is the plan to reevaluate I think what we have to do is take a look at and we do I mean we we put what we can to direct instruction and as stated before I lost Fuentes a lot of the Esser funds were used for student support and social worker and extra counselors part-time school nurse all of those costs and they were from Esther so I don't know if that's reflected in the numbers that you have due to those past two years using funds so wouldn't come out of operational supplemental so I expect those numbers to change the reality is is that we are not funding are administrators we are finding our students and we work to ensure that we can have as many staff whether they're easier or counselors or anything else on our staff to work with our work with our students

[01:13:00]
one of the things that was very difficult due to funding of last year is is we had to cut some positions and I did not cut counselors and I did not come social workers I had to cut direct instruction in order to make budget for this year and that's a reality I think that many Charter Schools face as well as the additional administrative burden the reports HR all the things that happen where were APS is fortunate to have Departments of of people taking over and doing that it's 34 of us taking that on and in many different areas I'm not complaining by any means I love what I do I love the people that I work with and more importantly the students and the family that we serve but yes I hear you and yes we are going to take a look at that and ensure that we

[01:14:00]
we always find our students and what we can do for them and thank you I just want to know too that I'm comparing a comparable enrollment at school with a comfortable enrollment to to your circumstance so I appreciate that thank you of course you have a higher population of students with disabilities then the traditional APS demographic but I also noticed in your IEP compliance you went down a little bit this year can you just give us some background on that yeah we do we've had more and more students with disabilities are families coming to seek us out and I think you'll see that with many charter schools that maybe one that want to have a smaller class size and I think that's

[01:15:00]
it's it's more of a one-on-one operational system that we're able to support and in terms of our IEP compliance I can tell you that 23 years ago we were not in a good place we did not have the compliance that we needed to have we were not we just weren't doing what we needed to do and of course as the Director of the school it's it's my responsibility I trusted the the individual that was in charge of that department and had assumed that those things were happening even though we're having conversations and constant conversations with with Dr Espinosa and in looking at that and and going through what we had we understood that we had an issue and so we are on a corrective action plan and we work closely with APS we have an entire new special education staff and

[01:16:00]
it works for 2 years to ensure that we have the policies and the practices in place that we need to have to stay in compliance and to serve our students and we are no longer on a corrective action plan that's due to the work of the school and also to the guidance of Patricia Espinoza thank you you're welcome all right thank you so much for being here with us we're going to go ahead and take a vote on this roll call Josefina

[01:17:00]
as for the renewal of the approval of renewal contract and performance framework for East Mountain joining us from the school are executive director Trey Smith and governing council president Glenn Huseman thank you for approval to accept the renewal contract and performance framework for East Mountain High Enough for discussion questions

[01:18:00]
and what you're doing out at East Mountain like it's your chart completely just exceeds all expectations so great job on what you're doing out there thank you for that we're pretty excited about her ambitious goals going forward to anybody so data on Page 6 for the New Mexico assessments plus Native Americans and Asians and Hispanics are in an upward Trend however black students are saying a decline what systems analysis have you performed that that

[01:19:00]
strategic or Mission specific goal this year is how we want to see Improvement for groups from Fall to Spring and so we're taking a fine tooth comb to that data as we speak something we're pretty excited about we elect to give the PSAT to all 9th 10th and 11th graders both in the fall and the spring and so we're not just relying on that one and done junior test to determine proficiency and we actually just got a results yesterday

[01:20:00]
16% compared to where they were in the spring so we're already seeing massive improvements that actually puts us on track with our goal and so that's one answered and I give to you we also have a highly involved Equity Council that meets monthly that reviews the data from that lens as well and looks at our our subgroups in the Aussie Martinez subgroups to really see what additional supports do those students need in that team is made up of our social worker or principal or Dean of Student Success or special ed director and they're always taking an extra look at that to see any extra support that students need yeah and you well so I don't know to trust someone

[01:21:00]
waiting on this one on page 9 the illustrations of special education compliance show and exceptional outcome so what system or strategy do you have that accounts for your outcomes special education we're really proud of recently because we made some pretty big strides over the past couple of years definitely with our special education director's work with Patricia and the aps office this is you know where a school that is very connected to the Charter Community and we know that having a Tricia is like a blessing and an honor in the APS school system so we all need to know that because my special ed director knows she can call her everyday and get a quick answer and so we've had we've seen great improvements there I think a lot of it is because we're starting to think more strategically about special education how we're doing better actually placing students in

[01:22:00]
on a pathway to get caught up in our special education director just I think working with the aps team is doing a really good job of staying in touch with the most recent recommendations how to be better with our federal compliance and it's just a team effort to our our Special Education team is made up of three teachers a special education director who do a really good job of meeting students where they're at working with teachers giving a combinations etcetera I mean is there an opportunity to have I know you guys are busy but do they ever come together similar similarly enrolled schools to share like strategies that are working

[01:23:00]
we actually had our special education coordinator training today where Albuquerque Charter Academy shared with their colleagues their path from coming up there out of their corrective action plan over 2 years so yes there are opportunities also we have cheered our schools to mimic the school's performance framework so high school of Distinction so we will be going to document two or three good practices every year so we can spread that good news

[01:24:00]
what was there any information that we can get from that middle school edition from or maybe it is a question for you just because I'm interested to see how you're doing yeah yeah so we needed that approval quickly so that we could actually go figure out how we're going to construct the facilities to to figure that out so that's where we got the approval last year and now we are on track for a fall 2026 beginning of our first sixth grade class and so now we're on the path to get the financing to get that done and getting the word out that there will be a sixth grade option thank you it just have one question it's for the governing body special education for eastbound thank you for the question so as a board

[01:25:00]
the executive director has done a fantastic job presenting to us as a council essentially the initiatives and goals as they tie into the Strategic framework and so the executive director brings that to us as a council we discussed it openly we offer our own observations constructive criticism and then of course we work as a team together to ensure that its implemented correctly so I would say our role is in collaboration with the executive director and in collaboration with the faculty and staff at Eastmont high school thank you thank you anyone else's approval or cheering of East Mountain High School because I do think that you guys are really serving in Need for for APS

[01:26:00]
so if I may I want to just highlight something and then I just want to ask you a question about it first of all it has been alluded to but I think we have finally found the the the charger that is putting 68.4% of their budget directly to direct instruction so I just want to highlight that I think that that is hey I just think that that is something to be highlighted and and Kudos that needs to be given to you and the question that I use me as in the performance framework I did notice that all the performance Frameworks that have been submitted to us yours is the only one that added an additional missions specific goal under the academic performance framework and it's specifically for

[01:27:00]
an increase in the percentage of college-ready you're starting to measure their sat performance and so I just wonder if you could speak to speak to why you took that extra step to add that to your performance framework and how confident you are the that your students will be able to reach that goal thank you happy with just two goals and and to be honest it a lot of it comes from knowing our you know I've been there 18 years and knowing our faculty in that data and of itself doesn't really energized faculty and teachers day today what does is the work on the ground and so we know we wanted to really data-driven goals but we also wanted something that spoke to the leadership and the SEL that are teachers work with our students every day so actually had the order of the gold not so important except we want to go number one where it is but we have a third goal related to leadership

[01:28:00]
because we have a really robust community service program we do a senior seminar experience where all of our seniors are doing internships and work experiences and we wanted to capture that because there's so much happening that isn't just reflected in the SAT and so it was kind of important to me and I think to our faculty as well to have a goal that spoke to that because that is our mission Forward Thinking leaders and how do you measure leadership that's a difficult thing and that's so we wanted to have a goal related to that in addition to our SAT related goals thank you so my question is specific to the East Mountain High School racial makeup and so we've got 4% Native American 27% Hispanic and 68.6% Caucasian and so I'm curious how how does one become a student in your school so you smell in high school you know kind of at the base of the crest up there off of North 14

[01:29:00]
Sandia Park Edgewood to Harris Cedar Crest our makeup of our student enrollment is actually more diverse than the communities we serve and I think going forward we actually have a plan because with our expansion we'd like to offer better bus service and we're going to do like a pickup service from some more remote areas and actually coming from Albuquerque and so I think going forward that will actually help us increase our amount of diversity as well but in the in the meantime we're happy that are because it's just you take the students that get in on the watery so you have the lottery you have to follow and the fact that we are more diverse in the community I think is good and also the fact that some groups are performing at levels higher than the state in the district I think is speaks to the experience they have when they're on our campus but it's also something we see getting improved in the future

[01:30:00]
I forgot to ask how how I'm just so impressed with both you and South Valley Academy I just have to say with with the the direct instruction or at the Student Success numbers right 84.7 with you all 84.3 South Valley how do you manage the school with 4.7 per cent of the budget as opposed to you know we heard 12% earlier and it does take a lot of work on our effort and I do I would give a shout out to our staff and faculty at our school a special who are wearing so many hats that it's our Spanish teacher who was all so our ELO coordinator it is our

[01:31:00]
dean of Student Success is also our coordinator and doing discipline as well I'm the executive director and I'm actually teaching an elective class right now so an entire 90 minutes of my day is going to teaching a class all of our teachers band together to take on extra tasks and I think that's why that percentage is where it is that we're proud of and it's just because we have a community that believes in the school the average 10 year of our faculty is over 12 years they'll get there they don't want to leave but it's and they do more work and but they do more work because they believe in it and I'll give SVA their due to they've got a 1.8 on School administration I'm curious to hear that anymore

[01:32:00]
thank you Google yes yes period do I have a motion on agenda item 4.5

[01:33:00]
contract and performance framework for Mountain mahogany Community School Iowa City Kansas OK Google we did

[01:34:00]
analysis of our data we use the framework that the state will be using that Awards points for students who are nearing proficiency not just students who are proficient or Advanced something that's very relevant since the student population we serve is 35% students with IEPs and that does not include gifted students so for many students they come to us many grade levels below their grade level and so one of the things that we really focus on is helping students make progress from wherever they come to us towards grade level proficiency so we took our past two years of academic data and then projected that forward for the five-year performance framework assuming a 2% annual growth so that would explain the 21% of students support yes yes thank you

[01:35:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:36:00]
technically considers me a superintendent my salary is under Central Services and we don't have any other licensed administrators as a part of our staff to you thank you all right you got one I'm just curious about you know what in 2023 2024 and then New Mexico and African American to start with and then our students who are native American and African American are generally under 10% so that could be five students

[01:37:00]
yes yes yes Campbell president

[01:38:00]
remove that we consider approval of the renewal contract and performance framework for the public academy for performing arts board member Benavides I was looking for a discussion for 432 thank you for the opportunity this evening and thank you for the question I do want to first before I answer your question say thank you to our partnership with Albuquerque Public Schools it's an honor and a privilege to represent the premier performing arts school in the state of New Mexico and have partnership in the portfolio with Albuquerque Public School

[01:39:00]
today at this moment we have 444 students okay but as a School of Choice sometimes students don't enjoy singing and dancing and that is not their cup of tea and that's perfectly fine because of how he incorporate arts in our Core Curriculum that it's pretty demanding sometimes singing and acting and playing instruments so as soon as you go to another school at any minute I don't know why but okay so to Connected questions and and it's about diversity I've got 0.3% Native Americans 31% Hispanics 677 students with disabilities and 0% English learn

[01:40:00]
English as a second language Learners and and so I'm just wondering do you have plans for diversifying the the student population and within that this is the second question students with disabilities don't fare well and so I'm just wondering if there are strategies in place for improving both the diversity and students with disabilities absolutely thank you for the question those numbers are very close to Accurate so close it's kind of medical to even to say but are English language population for example it's going to be probably one of those stipulations where it's so little that it doesn't appear on your crap but we actually do have about 28 second language Learners most of our second language learners

[01:41:00]
did you come with us to our school with pretty moderate proficiency so we're looking at 3 and 4S on the axis as opposed to newcomers one and two right so they're they're very fluent in casual and they're speaking but we do want to grow their academic language proficiency as for students with disabilities are population is actually a little bit more significant than you mentioned that's what right in front of you we have 81 special education students that make up 18% of our student body and in particular we have 60 students that have a 504 plan that's 13% of our student body so overall 141 total students with a recognized disability that brings our population to 31% special services not including gifted so we have exceptional students some of them are twice exceptional and what we find is that Arts can be a great equalizer when you're performing the ballet you don't necessarily know who has

[01:42:00]
ocular because it can be a great equalizer and as a part of our mission we're looking to close achievement gaps and to just really engage students in the process we know students that enjoy coming to school and have that outlet you know at our school three times to four times a day with our Performing Arts electives they're going to be more likely to show up to classes and to engage in the class work and I think I left out a part of what you asked me would you repeat something I didn't answer well just diversifying your student population I'm looking at 31% Hispanic but I mean you've got you clarified the other two areas the special education but it's special students with disabilities and I think he answered it or you're there are plans in place to increase proficiency of them absolutely and actually we're pretty proud of

[01:43:00]
have our special education growth when we look at our internal data year by year we see that our students with disabilities have improved in their Proficiency in 21 to 22 we were at 7% proficiency and in the following year it grew to 21% proficiency although it's not everybody we're having close that Gap that we are happy to see that growth in regard to diversifying our population some of the things we like to do is get out into the community we would like to have all of Albuquerque understand that we love performing arts and when you need a performance call on us to represent that particular our talented faculty prepares our students very well so some of the things we've done for example is perform at the now I'm going to forget since we're all staring at different areas cultural cultural performances so we've had Orchestra and band perform

[01:44:00]
Indian Pueblo Cultural Center we can certainly make more connections with our African-American colleagues and with the city and the county in particular connections with the Asian Community would be wonderful especially as it comes to to dance and sharing celebrations so when we have performers come to our school to share appreciation and culture I think a growth area would be for us to follow up with them when it's time for a lottery to open hey don't forget it I think there's definitely room for looking at bridging cultural gaps and being a part of the city to a greater degree well I love your hands on approach thank you very much so my question is specific to the person of students who have enrolled in college in the fall after graduation and so it's a pretty high percentage for 2022 2023 82.5% and so I'm curious if you have any data about those students and their graduation rates from

[01:45:00]
not just yet but I can tell you the evidence I have every day when I walk in the door of my office is I have graduation announcements from students as they graduate from Papa but I have three to four of them that have also come back to give me their college degree their college announcement know what the 50 pictures and two of those are returned to the field of Education which is quite lovely so some of our graduates will go on to pursue professional opportunities in the Arts joining companies for example and some of them just have a general appreciation for the Arts at a minimum so when I look at specific data about who has graduated from college I do not have that but it is a part of an alumni list that we keep as they graduate from Papa as part of senior check out we put them on our alumni list and give us current information and that's

[01:46:00]
a spreadsheet we can use to reach out and again a couple years ago we had our 20th celebration and many of our alumni came back to perform at the national Hispanic Cultural Center ranging from Member a member of the current Albuquerque police force to performing artists to digging out the good old guitar from the garage to rock out for a time to connect with them thank you I just have one question I'm really glad it's more of a comment you mentioned twice exceptional how many of those kids are gifted and you out of your exceptional lunch I I couldn't tell you on a test if they were gifted okay but I do know that there are many talented students that come with that drive to practice and to engage I could tell you that

[01:47:00]
encouragement that whether you've had experience in the Arts or you've never had that experience if you put in the passion and the the time and dedication there really is no limit for our students in in my opinion gifted I don't have anybody that I can speak to that I'd like a gifted Musical test but we have gifted students in the hallways definitely thank you thank you very much all right let's call for a vote and now let's go yes other than you did talk to you tomorrow yes and I love your intentionality about recruitment Courtney Jackson yeah yes thank you congratulations

[01:48:00]
okay we're going to go ahead and consider approval of the renewal contract and performance framework for South Valley Academy so joining us from the school are co-executive director Jennifer Gable and Chantel Quintana and governing council president Robert Beatty I moved to approve the renewal contract and performance framework for South Valley Academy

[01:49:00]
just double-checking $598 enrollment is that right or are you be on 600 now they're currently sitting at 600 on these students today 277 or classified as English Learners and 119 have IEPs 119 198 piece an interesting I have a question the last and then I have to go and I'm just curious if you've done any kind of analysis or

[01:50:00]
about that and the sat sat so I know my understanding from our data specialist who is here also is that the SAT has changed a bit over the last few years so that's part of what we're noticing in the trench our interim assessment data and WEA map data actually is showing growth overtime so we're hoping to see the SAT data once it's stabilizing in terms of what they're asking the students on the test we're hoping to see that Trend go up as well so does that mean an adjustment and curriculum or like what you're teaching at what's the shifting so we have evaluated our approach to the intentionality of instruction so we this last school year

[01:51:00]
focused on ensuring that our curriculum is State approved and aligned with those standards and metrics to help increase the overall performance of our students and then just doing deeper Dives in terms of collaboration and communication within our cohort teams that support our students at the high school and ensuring that the intentional supports are integrated into the cross curricular planning the unit planning the grade level discussions and then the holistic approach to each of our students so our goal with the encompassed approach to the collective curriculum the intentional conversations and supports in the classroom as well as we are proud to say that we have approximately a school life we have I believe the numbers were 23 level three teachers 21 level 2 teachers and 12 level 1 teachers so our level 2 on level three

[01:52:00]
teachers and we have some phenomenal instructional coaches that are supporting our teachers across both high school and middle school so we hope to see those Trends increase and I do want to also add that all of our sophomores take the PSAT so we can dive into that data as well a little earlier and that all of our 11th graders take we provide them with sat preparation for all of our students it's not just if they want to it's part of our College and Career Readiness to help them on get additional support looking at how they did on either their PSAT or a practice test to see what they need to work on to help them improve and then we support students and retaking as well and your school administration

[01:53:00]
so we work hard I mean I'm sure all schools do but yeah we wear many hats and and hearing Mr Smith describe it I figured you all must be wearing lots of more hats like last year I am co-taught literacy class with our our least English proficient students with one of our English language experts it was a blast the kids are fantastic and it was one of my favorite parts of the day thank you because I feel like you're a model for service and I do have a question as it comes to special education and if you can just give me some background on your IEP compliance and transition compliance

[01:54:00]
so we'll talk to him so we are not so we are working very closely with the BCS mimosa and the special education department on based on our corrective action plans so we are working to ensure that that compliance is met through instructional supports training for our special education staff and ease who join us and so we're making sure that all that we do is an approval of APs but also in alignment with making sure that we're meeting our student needs and our family needs so a couple of approaches to that is ensuring that our students understand their modifications in accommodations and understand what their IP means for them or ultimate goal is that those students can learn to advocate for themselves in a more productive way so that they're able to be able to access or advocate in the times of need as well as ensuring that they can speak to what their plans and goals are and we're working very closely with our structured

[01:55:00]
so each week our grade level teams meet or anywhere from an hour to 2 hours to talk about students specifically who might have IEP students who are in the mlss OR tracking process and ensuring that are intentional supports both instructional and socially emotionally are that holistic approach to supporting our students so that in turn we can see successful academic games for our students yeah so in a little context so if a few years ago you'll see sort of the drop off in the data you're probably looking at in the executive summary right so we had a lot of turnover and our special ed Department both in leadership as well as in teachers and our education assistance and that turnover has continued each year which caused some problems we're not making excuses for just sharing sort of the facts and moving forward at this point but that was a bulk of the the

[01:56:00]
working hard to set up systems that no matter who's there we're going to make sure that the systems are in place so that no matter who comes on board whether it's in the highest leadership of the school and special education whether they're a teacher in EA or a general ed teacher they're going to understand expectations and make sure they're following what needs to be followed to make sure that we're in compliance with their IEPs mp3s and a phenomenal support for us last last designation School for students with disabilities with the new data we have now moved to the traditional so our students are demonstrating progress and growth now we will focus more intentionally on that compliance piece and we've already dug deep into that just the school year alone and working really so we're very fortunate for that support and we hope that the Stars will

[01:57:00]
it's three years so that's pretty young bored or governing Council and so can you speak to that at all sure

[01:58:00]
cast actually buy the founders if I would be willing to step in and so we are rebuilding the governance now and being quite strategic about it we're looking to add somebody who really has a lot of experience in special ed and we better days a business manager so that we really have a strong board understanding of the finances I've added somebody who has a career from CNM to to have a connection with secondary and so it's a rebuilding from a difficult time and moving forward pretty quickly and so I would be remiss if I didn't ask this question and I just want to make sure that this is the the proper information so this is the charter school where there was the Box

[01:59:00]
the most important thing to me absolutely and so what supports were put in place after that event to you know honestly support the students who may have seen something heard something or just lived through something that's very traumatic so as a school we very much take our pride emotional learning is a focal point for all of our students when that incident happened we were fortunate enough at the time to have a school Base clinic on campus that was in support of so that was completely Behavioral Health and they had several license therapist and support in addition

[02:00:00]
fortunate as a school to also have four social workers on campus and we also brought in community members to have restorative conversations a place in space just for the community to to voice their concern or their feelings or their thoughts or emotions so there was a lot of strategies and and supports and platforms available for individuals both staff students community members to have a place in space and then those intentional supports vary based on each of the needs or are students are stock market to stop right in and and measure the needs of students and direct them to the appropriate individuals to have that space and place to get the support that they need to make it through the school year thank you Jose Dominguez yes

[02:01:00]
