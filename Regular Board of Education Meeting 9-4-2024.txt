do you have 2 minutes why don't you begin speaking them thank you very much good evening Madam superintendent Madam president and members of the board and thank you for this opportunity to speak and again I just wanted to encourage all of you as you have time to participate in some of our Del Norte activities and tomorrow morning will be providing our breakfast treats to teachers and staff and everybody there you're very welcome to swing by and say hello between 8:00 and 8:40 and then on Saturday we have the opportunity of recognizing some young men who are now in their middle 60's State football championship that the 1974 and will be at Melanie's stadium for seniors and

[00:06:00]
and then in doing a little research both on APS history but Del Norte history I discovered that in 1964 a starting teacher salary was 4,600 but that attracted a lot of people to come from other states because we paid more than Oklahoma and I also discovered some real estate information about how the property was acquired and it looks like it was a land Exchange in 1955 with the city of Alabama state department but I found a letter addressed to John Miller and this is in 1955

[00:07:00]
56 after 45 years as superintendent John Milner died on September 5th 1956 it only been not been the superintendent for like 3 months and he was 76 years old and Mr Hawkins and I have our birthdays today and I'm 76 years old so I'm saying oh my goodness John Milton and I have this in common and I was standing in the shadow of the giant of APs again thank you for what you all do and hope to see you again and thank you very much for this public forum I'm here with concerns about students being

[00:08:00]
80 degrees or more and expected to not only learn but reach optimal student outcomes how can our teachers ensure their ability to learn and perform while attempting to address their physical complaints hydration and ability to focus when pressed about this issue our school board president recently said the school board is really focused on student outcomes and are one employee which is the superintendent student outcomes as she refers to our based on the accumulation of learning experiences and interactions with peers and teachers over the years I hope our school board and its president are not taking two on their responsibilities

[00:09:00]
a student's families and teachers to ensure that each student is guaranteed a safe and healthy place to learn this includes classrooms that are properly cooled and ventilated if we expect our teachers and students to be ready for teaching and learning on day one then we should expect that the learning environment is also ready on day one the first weeks of school shouldn't be focused on Survival this has been lost learning time how many classrooms still aren't properly cool period and what is your plan to stop this from happening again thank you for your time or next speaker is drillaud although I do not see him

[00:10:00]
show me to move on to a Daniel Tafoya Mr Dafoe you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking my concerns are retaliation towards volunteers teachers staff members and parents coming to HR or going to principles or anyone blowing the whistle on issues I'm concerned that there's no communication between the Board of Education APS HR principles and the managers of the principals and I'm just concerned about that because there's a lot of retaliation teachers and staff members are afraid to make complaints to anyone because of their fear of being in trouble so that's what my concerns are and I would like to see that address more because we're losing substitution teachers that way that's all I have to say thank you thank you sir Ward members that concludes look for thank you to all of our

[00:11:00]
next up on our agenda is the considered approval of the consent agenda for this we have items 5.1 through 5.7 is there a motion to approve the consent agenda and move to approve the consent agenda for items 5.1 to 5.7 this is member Jackson all second this is supposed to write thank you dot please consider approval of resolutions submitted to the New Mexico to be submitted to the New Mexico school boards Association to be considered for the association's 2025 legislative platform are presenter singular this evening is Jessica Martinez with our government Affairs team is Martinez you have before

[00:12:00]
Miss Martinez real quick president I just wanted to let you know before Miss Martinez starts that what you're going to see in front of you are the resolutions for the nmsba resolutions for the Year this is for the school boards Association which as Miss Martinez will explain is different than the administration resolutions that you will see on our legislative platform next month and so these are written on behalf of the APS school board to present to the nmsba for consideration to be approved into their platform Miss Martinez president to nmsba each year the New Mexico School Board Association calls for school boards across the state to submit resolutions to help form the nms priorities for the next legislative session

[00:13:00]
adopted by the full board the resolutions for the 2025 session are due to the nmsba next Monday September 9th the resolutions will then be reviewed by an nmsba committee for prioritization and then presented to the delegate assembly for consideration at its annual convention in December the superintendent's cabinet review the nmsba list of legislative priorities and shows nine that most aligned with APS schools and guardrails to be clear as Dr Blakey stated these do not represent the district's legislative agenda District leadership is currently discussing its legislative priorities for the 60-day session and we are scheduled to present the legislative agenda to the board in late October it does not require board approval in the same manner that these resolutions tonight will require your approval I'd like the board to know that staff questions about the inflation stabilization draft resolution prompted us to rewrite it to

[00:14:00]
reflect how the issue impacts APS a copy of that updated resolution with Redline marks was linked to the q&as shared with board members and posted yesterday we also have included a copy on the desk for your review in addition we noticed that the resolutions didn't specifically mention a focus on student outcomes so we are recommending that we add aware as statement that reads and you also have a copy of this up on the desk whereas prioritizing student outcomes is essential for our Educational Systems success and the board's primary goal is to oversee and supports that directly enhance these outcomes while the board vote on these resolutions as a group amendments to the resolution or removal from the list can be made during discussion and reflected in the final vote the first resolution concerned inflation stabilization which is tied to guardrail one wrap around support systems and guardrail 2 and portable allocation of

[00:15:00]
resources the second resolution concerns educator retirement retention preparation and compensation this relates to guardrail to for the Equitable allocation of resources next resolution is culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and materials fight the guardrail 3 for high-quality curriculum and instruction the next resolution is flexibility for Extended Learning programs related to guard rail one for wrap around support systems the next resolution pertains to the local authority of school boards and this is related to the board's priority of student outcomes focused governments the next resolution calls on the legislature to provide sufficient funding which is related to guardrail 2 for Equitable allocation of resources the next resolution concerns District operating reserves and is tied to guardrail 2 for the Equitable allocation of resources the next resolution pertains to staff and students safety which is tied to guardrail 1

[00:16:00]
for wrap-around support systems and finally the resolution regarding unfunded mandate ties to guardrail 2 the Equitable allocation of resources these resolutions are discussion and action items and Dr Blakey and members of her cabinet are cured to assist with in questions that you have great thank you Miss Martinez so certainly appreciate the work that the staff put into developing these resources as well as the inclusion of the Clause related to student outcomes I also wanted to know that we have an additional potential resolution up on the dice as well which is specifically related to student outcomes and so I would propose that considering that the majority of these are nmsba priorities and not yet the district priorities we take the questions that we submitted that were submitted and received in advance and just proceed to vote with no further discussion or dialogue is questions were already submitted

[00:17:00]
and would propose that we include this additional student outcomes focused governance resolution on the list making it you said there was nothing to make it 10 that we are submitting forward that summer I will move for approval of the resolutions submitted I think you can have a discussion and a second so I will move for approval of the resolution submitted to the Albuquerque Board of Education on behalf of in Mexico school boards Association okay is there a second fails and we can proceed to 6. 2 2

[00:18:00]
you can have the motion you can have the second and then go to discussion and dialogue however since there is a motion on the table if there is no second it automatically fails and we'll proceed so that's where we're at we will move to Tennessee to could you clarify for the next item on the agenda which would be agenda item 6.2 consider approval of Board of Education Retreat for the purpose of understanding the board's role in improving student outcomes thank you Miss Martinez thank you so to move fast 6.2 so this was the request for a board of education Retreat and so I am the presenter this was requested by member Dominguez at a

[00:19:00]
this meeting and so we agreed to put it on the agenda for additional discussion tonight the priority again is ensuring that the retreat is focused on the board's role and the board's role in understanding student outcomes there were some additional topics suggested by the executive committee which are listed here which include team-building clarification of Board of Education roles finding out what supports are needed by board members sharing the top concerns board members are hearing and a training on special education and so this is a discussion and action item so I'll just go ahead and open it up all facilitate the discussion for each board member to share their perspectives and we can go ahead and have the discussion and the vote so we'll go ahead and just start at the far right here with member Domingos do you have questions or any discussion that you'd like to share related to this agenda item well I have comments about it yes and I'll start with

[00:20:00]
behaviors change and that begins with me in concert with my fellow board members and what happens on the board as we were instructed by our student outcomes Focus governance coaches what happens on the board filters down and I am permeates out to the superintendent to schools I would of course I'm in favor of having this Retreat because I believe we need to just like we ask schools to improve their school culture we are also required to improve our board culture one of collaboration and which is the foundation of team and this

[00:21:00]
circles back to the importance of board rules no one organization owns best practices best practices listed by the National School Board Association and mirrored in the New Mexico School Board Association handbook for school board members are useful and indeed critical to note and put into practice the Council of great City schools has been helpful and providing us a framework and mostly guiding the initial rollout of student outcomes Focus governance however there have been missed ups and I think it's important to have honest conversations about those we allowed an outside organization or

[00:22:00]
coach to dictate too much of our work for example in January the majority voted on this board the majority voted for three committees and yet on the advice of our coach we allowed policy committee work to be interrupted and we fail to comply with our own governance manual section 4J we gave our very own governance and only recently did policy committee members invoke our right to set an overdue meeting for September 9th and only recently have we had conversations about the need to address the role of committees and the

[00:23:00]
chairs and we'll have more of that conversation on Monday a committee meeting that I'm looking forward to I think that we're all looking forward to and so I don't want to get too wordy but in terms of team building clarification Board of Education roles we are overdue for that and so of course I'm in favor of having this Retreat so that I can hear from fellow board members what special new board members sharing their top concerns I remember my first year feeling like we were playing the Whip and I was always at the end and in listening to concerns of the same feeling so Retreat would help thank you

[00:24:00]
play I Remember You I am for a retreat and I just really want to stress the reason for that is you know when we look at the especially reading AJ's book that he cites that there are three critical tasks of the school board and that's listening training and recording I would think that if we're required to do that for our community and required to hear them out because we do create these goals and guard rails based on the voice of the community I also feel that on the level of the board that we should also be listened to we also should be trained and then we should also be reporting with one another what some of these critical issues are but we haven't been given that platform and so that was one reason and addressing that we do need a retreat to come together and to speak on behalf of

[00:25:00]
what we're feeling and going through but I know many times we set the presidency of being that in order to have this Retreat it has to benefit student outcomes but I really think if we're going to look at it don't behaviors then I think that's a start because we are the ones in the leadership role and that these issues of not being heard and not having a voice and also not having the control we need as a board can be silent in the midst of trying to maneuver the student outcome Focus governance the progress monitoring and that we're we're doing those tests because it is the format that we need to address but I feel in between those particulars were losing sight of the humanity of of really reasoning that the people here also need to be heard and not just told what to do

[00:26:00]
so I think that this Retreat is needed thank you thank you I remember we're going to be this thank you I'm definitely in favor of having a retreat I think it's needed team building absolutely as long as all parties are operating in good faith and promise to do so clarification of Board of Education rules I think that would be very helpful as would sharing top concerns board members are hearing I would like more information on finding out what supports are needed I guess I'm just a little unclear to me by supports and then training on special education which I think is very important but I don't know that a retreat would be the environment for that specifically but it could be so just some more information on that and I think that even though we are focused on student outcomes I think that everything we do as board members Retreats training conferences we attend while it might not directly

[00:27:00]
be focused on student outcomes and indirectly is because our goal is to become productive board members to improve student outcomes and everything we can do to facilitate that process is going to be a worthy Endeavor so I am 100% in favor of doing this but I would like more information on what supports are needed defining supports as well as training on special education thank you great thank you and so we will go through and just get initial comments and questions and then I'm loading your question for additional information about what the support to be so we can Circle back around and dig into that particularly if we are going to do a retreat I think it's really important to know not just the what but the why in the house so we can definitely get to that remember still I'm sorry I forgot to call on you to begin with but you yeah I am actually excited for a conversation around having a

[00:28:00]
mostly because I feel like there is sometimes fear about talking about certain issues with our fellow board members because of rolling Quorum so I think of this as a space where we can come together and talk about our vision of philosophy on how to make sure that we are focused on student outcomes so not only are we getting to know one another and be able to have a safe space throughout the retreat where we can talk to each other and kind of delve into some of the things that we've been hearing from Community but also opening it up as a space to talk about what is our vision on our philosophy to really focus on student outcomes especially with this new governance model so I know as a new board member I have some questions that I would really love the inside of all board members especially those who have been on the board before me to really make sure that I'm understanding my role and also just finding a place where we are all United right and all figuring out the same way that we want to tackle APS as the big

[00:29:00]
so I'm excited and I'm hopeful and I do agree with a board member Benavides is comment on maybe the special education training can be a part from it as a separate training and I also wanted to offer up an idea that I had that could be something separate from the retreat but it was an environmental justice kind of just like a tour of the city and making sure that we understand as board members that just like Heating and Cooling effects student outcomes so does their environment around the students and where they're coming from so I would love to have a conversation about that in the future as well write thank you remember Jackson thank you I guess I'm kind of surprised by the the reasons behind having a training or the sorry a retreat

[00:30:00]
I kind of believed that the reason for the reason for the retreat was to just team build maybe to come together as a board but what I'm hearing is that it seems to be almost an attack on our student outcomes Focus governance structure that we have invested I'm effort resources Blood Sweat tears into putting forth a new governance structure that quite honestly is working it is working for our schools it is working for our students it's working for the administration and so it's I'm using the quote that nobody owns best practices and yet do not come Focus governance is a research-based continuous Improvement model for school

[00:31:00]
so it it it it it it it it it it sounds like this call for a retreat is more to pull this board away from do not come Focus governance which we we've invested five years or 4 and a half at this point and we've invested in it this this is what we are doing and so I I just I guess I need to kind of wrap my head around why this is why why it feels like there's an attack as far as like the trainings we've had three trainings to date on do not come Focus governance we individually have budgets we each have 4,000 that we are allowed to use to put towards training that if there's anything that we still have lacking from our knowledge base we have the opportunity to go

[00:32:00]
boats and to to find that individually and we should use that that is that is that is a generous gift that is given to us to to use those funds for individual training we have a coach who is available all the time and to answer any questions that we have and we also have nmsb training that we are actually required to go to so I don't know that it's not that the opportunities are there because they very much are and I'm also very concerned based on it seems like what I'm hearing is that this is potentially a call to pull away from the ethos of do not come Focus governance in which we have actually for the first time developed a system that is aligned

[00:33:00]
where are school district and for the first time there aren't seven different people telling the superintendent seven different things and then expecting her to figure out which one I mean that's a judgment call which which of those seven voices is more important the essence of students is that no one voice is privileged over the others no one voice is allowed to dictate how the board works no one voice has the the privilege to to enact policies or movement forward we act as the board and the only reason that we are now able to act as a board is because we have student outcomes Focus governance

[00:34:00]
as far as the the the the the discussion about how we can share the top concerns board members are hearing I thought that there was a committee that is supposed to be working on that that there was a committee that was going to put together some best practices procedures on how we could gather information so that if there are certain concerns that you guys are that we are all hearing we have a system we have a process to do that and I I'm just I'm almost I'm almost shaking because we've come so far we've come so far from the chaos of what was here before and I'm really concerned that there's an effort to move us out of sosg and back towards the chaos so I'm not convinced

[00:35:00]
about a retreat but I think I've said my what I want to say right now may I say something for president let me have my say and then we're going to circle back around to have the discussion and to dig into a little bit of follow-up does that work okay hearing to listen to All board members I'm hearing a variety of different concerns I'm hearing a strong desire for a retreat I'm also hearing a desire to be heard and I certainly want all board members to be heard and to be listened to and to be able to represent our community because that is our function and so I think part of the challenge before us is figuring out the right solution to the right problem and so if there's a problem of board members not being heard I'd like to dig into that and understand a little bit more about what that is remember Dominguez

[00:36:00]
the policy committee we can certainly talk through that a member don't worry too much mentioned being silenced so we can talk through that as well cuz I think it would be helpful because I'm not completely opposed to a retreat if it's going to solve the problem that is being put on the table I think I do have some concerns around the costs associated with the potential Retreat and I appreciate member Jackson noting that we have 4,000 and one of the things I was wondering is maybe we ought to consider the full board budget and when and how we use that budget collectively so if we have a budget that has 28,000 for training do we still want to continue to divide it at 7 Ways and do 4,000 in each member gets to do it or do we want to say we're setting aside 5,400 to Retreats a year or do we want to say we're targeting specific resources towards specific topics that have been identified as areas of need across the

[00:37:00]
word across from majority of the board for example if five members identify they need a training on special ed then we can dedicate specific resources and so I guess the question for me too then is just cost benefit in return on investment as well and so I do have a question for board services at all just see it as I continue to talk but potentially you can answer which is around when we do develop the board office budget and what is the flexibility to reallocate funds where within that obviously the board offices budget includes your staff and so we're not going to be getting your salary but understanding when in the timeline we we could consider that because I'd like to know that if we're doing a budget that we have funding for it and so that's just a question that I wanted to put on the table as well in terms of cost I do think I appreciate the desire to get to know each other better

[00:38:00]
and I share that I also think that the best way to get to know each other is through the work and we are elected officials so we do the work in public in fact we're required to do the work in public so we do have to post and invite the public to our Gatherings and so just want to be mindful of that as well I will say that over the course of the last month partnering with member benavidez and member Jackson on the state of the district address has been tremendously helpful to get to know them in the context of the work but also to get to know more about what's happening in their personal lives and so and what their juggling and so again I think it is in the context of the work that we truly get to know each other and I don't want to create artificial Icebreaker activities to get to know each other I was just talking to my son about this and he was just sort of complaining about the first week of school and like why do we have to squeeze each other's hands for 20 minutes

[00:39:00]
and I sort of feel that and so I just want to make sure that if we are going to do team building it's for again for the right purposes solving the right problems that we want to solve and then the last problem that I heard was just clarification of roles and so that is also something I'd like to dig into more in terms of where is there not yet clarification of roles so we can talk through that and make sure that if that is something that needs to be addressed in Retreat we're bringing in the right resources for it so I'll just say I'm on the fence because I'm not clear on what is the problem that we're trying to solve the last thing I just want to acknowledge is that we are down one member at this meeting and so just putting that out there that we're missing that perspective as well for what it's worth so we've all had a chance to go through and state where we are at I know member I wanted to hop back in I know remember this post some questions around

[00:40:00]
what types of supports are needed I have questions around how the time would be used and what problem we're trying to be solved and then the questions around just bored Services budget and could we create a budget that includes Retreats and postpone Retreat until we have a budget that includes it and are clearer about how we're allocating our professional development money is that something Dr Albert did you're able to answer now around the timing and maybe superintendent Blakey yes board president and I know our massage is here as well but within the budget for the board office we could do budget transfers to move most of the money around that's not in the category of personal so you could review that budget and we could submit butter budget transfers to move money to other areas and so the timing for that is that just like whenever or at the store

[00:41:00]
bring him to the next board meeting so we would need to have a understanding of what are all of the funds that are movable so I just sort of said 4,000 * 7 is 28,000 but there's potentially other stuff in there yes we can review that yeah like a proposal of what you need so we can put the money in the correct categories and I think in the Q&A there was an answer on potential cost was like okay so we do have a potential cost and then if we wanted to allocate funds for sports training we could discuss that

[00:42:00]
thank you for that I'll go back to member I swear to God to get in with your question or comment and then we'll try to dig in a little bit more on the specifics of what we're talking about here thank you yeah I just wanted to acknowledge board member Jackson's frustration and clarify at least from my point of view that it is not a call for retreat does not mean an attack on all the work that you have done and I do you know appreciate the commitment that you put into that work with student outcomes Focus governance and and the manual and everything that we've done I think for me when it comes to the training and the conversations that I have it feels in personal and I think in order for me to really understand our bored as a whole and making sure that we are not just one voice right we're an entire board an entire like movement of things that are happening as a governance in APS that I really want to make sure that I understand everybody

[00:43:00]
point of view especially when it comes to student outcomes Focus governance and I believe that the trainings that we have had and the time with our coaches hasn't given me an opportunity to really feel like I have a grasp on what I'm supposed to be doing or how my other board members feel like they are doing what they do and one of the things that I don't really like that you know it's is it is what it is is the rolling Quorum right but like I can't I feel like I can't know what's happening and all seven districts at a time because then it's rolling Quorum or if I have a question and I want to get everybody's perspective it's really important so for me it's more of opening a space where we can have that dialogue and what I've gotten from the trainings is that board member or board meetings are not the place to do that because we have to stick to an agenda we have to stick to whatever the business is and there is no conversation amongst each other so I would be open if there is of how calling it a Rhett

[00:44:00]
we have some type of board meeting where we talk about these things but my thing is I think relating to the word like I feel censored or silenced is that we're so structured on what we have to talk about that it feels impersonal to me sometimes so I don't want it to feel like an attack on student outcomes Focus governance but I do feel like there could be another piece that we add into that where we do develop those relationships and how those conversations where it's more personal and we are talking about our community on our students and what that looks like from not just this business model hopefully that clarifies a little bit of things but that's just what I'm feeling great thank you for that I'm going to turn back to member Domingo's for any additional discussion but also again you said we allow our coach to dictate our work and we give over control of our governance and we've now in both our rights to have a committee meeting if you could just share a little bit more cuz I want to make sure we're fully

[00:45:00]
understanding that and how it does I guess maybe you responding to member Jackson's concern about a retreat from student outcomes focused governance so you know first I'm sorry you heard the my critique as an attack on student outcomes Focus governance and I want to reiterate that the Council of great City schools has been very helpful and providing and mostly guiding the initial rollout of sfg and I'm bored and I want that to be clear whether it was intentional or not at the first

[00:46:00]
on this board to have a a policy committee on a committee chair voted you know by majority shortly thereafter there was a meeting where the suggestion was made that policy committee could move toward being an adult committee and so then all of a sudden you know there was not a need for a policy committee down the road and we'll start rolling it out or rather allowing it to fade and we just have at home address policy so you know we've not met I've never called a policy committee meeting until recently and it required

[00:47:00]
three of us going in and talking about it with the superintendent and with Chief of Staff for me that's problematic I think we've gotten over that we've got work to do there's our governance manual is a good start but it needs it needs revision and review and we've started that and we're going to continue it but because of because of because we did not the committee did not weigh in on the calendar of committee meetings and we were never approached about this concept of phasing out

[00:48:00]
we had no say about when how often we were going to meet that's problematic because now it's September and we have some some work to do will get it done but we're if I understood correctly the calendar is set and we cannot change it so there was an agreement to have meetings every other month but the last one was in March committee meetings have been canceled since then without my knowledge or without my input rather and so now we're facing September meeting I'm trying to understand the problem that we're trying to solve with the retreat and so what I'm hearing from you

[00:49:00]
is that you feel as if you were silenced by not being able to have we were silenced yes so the problem I think we need to revisit we need we all need to have a firm understanding of what our governance manual says okay which is helpful so governance training and I guess it's helpful to hear that there was a misunderstanding on the role of the policy committee and committees considering that we started the committee diet process last year and have a full implementation calendar that dictates when will continue with that but we hired a superintendent in between so I hear that I can do a better job communicating or implementation calendar and where we are next with sosg and so I've noted that I'm here also that we could use some training and this is all so remember I still got on

[00:50:00]
she said I don't have a glass of what I'm supposed to be doing and so that could be both s o f g refresher but also can understand what's the governance review learning discussion outcome that that you're looking for I think it's just there's a lot going on and I think it would be helpful to go through that manual together because we're going to get started sooner than that because I don't think you go through the whole policy or through the whole government's manual in one city I don't find that as a helpful thing and so I'm glad that the committee has started that review

[00:51:00]
now I'm sorry but there was a separate meeting with three members of the committee we went to Super we asked for when two members came to me and said why aren't why isn't the policy committee meeting so well you know I have tried to put together a meeting but we can all three go to this meeting and set an agenda and so that's what we did the three members of the committee met with the fourth is what I'm understanding and and two of these members are brand new they're trying to get there I understand that and so again I'm trying to figure out what is the problem we're trying to solve I'm getting that some of it has to do with roll right

[00:52:00]
and also lack of understanding of a quorum and I think this relates somewhat to member of Sword against questions and concerns also because the issue with rolling Quorum isn't an essay of G issue it's a state law issue so if we're coming together to talk in four or more period no matter what the about board work then that's the Quorum so if we come together in a separate meeting with the superintendent if we come together in a retreat that's still forums so it's not something I just want to tease out like what's the misunderstanding or what's the relative to our role in relative to sfg because that's what she doesn't have a anything to do with Quorum so that's partly what I'm trying to understand here okay so where's the Quorum with three of us meeting three of the four member committee's so I want to

[00:53:00]
back to member Tom burrito to just respond to the conversation and then also there were questions around well I had a question about when you said you've been silenced I'd really like to understand I think right now that I'm going back to clarify with Courtney's issue about us coming again so if you that's not what Our intention my intentions were I do have a problem with the council and the line between our local control and when the council gets involved in some of the decisions that the board should take on where are those boundaries it's not so much the sosg framework it's just the permission and the

[00:54:00]
understanding when we are in this is an example in an ad hoc committee meeting we're formalizing we're moving we're talking about what we need to clarify and what we need to get done the work that needs to get done but then in the midst of it we get a it's the one up to you need to allow the coach to come in so they can participate and give their input and how we would direct this ad hoc committee when I feel like those kind of lines when is the council getting involved in board work where the lines were the boundaries because I feel we need to as a board do the work that's needed and the council is there but they but but that's also the question on local control of the board what are those bound

[00:55:00]
and how do we but then I think I brought that up to you a little bit more to about the roles of our coaches and what they're getting involved in because I do have a big concern about that and I think I have addressed that with you concerning the coaching and so it's one of those lights subtle moves or it feels like our work and what we're doing is not going to be hurt unless we have these coaches come in and help support and do what's needed to turn our work around I don't like I I really don't know their purpose and that's another thing and I brought that up to you about the coaching roles and what are they supposed to be doing cuz I can tell you right now I've only had one coaching opportunity with our coaches other than that I had nothing as a new board member

[00:56:00]
you're dumb and they haven't turned out or either they were canceled so and that was one thing you were going to stay with what was her role and how do we clarify that and so it's one of the things that the new board member I'm trying to figure out just as Janelle is where is our role in all of this when we haven't been trained to were just told to come in and learn how to formalize questions and do the running Parts as we move along and so in our running along we lose our voicemail gets lost in the process but it actually is a new board member when you can't figure out where is my where is my sister had that conversation about my role as of VPN that's not part of cancel it's part of our governments and how do we

[00:57:00]
so that's what I'm talking about how about having a voice okay thanks thank you for that and so I think what I'm hearing if I could repeat back to you is just looking for Clarity on the role of the coach and the purpose that's okay you haven't been trained so could use additional training and where is the line or the boundaries between the council and they're involved in a decision yes yes call start with an apology that you're feeling silent because that's certainly not the intense and if that's the impact of this work then that's not the way it should have been so all of that and I think our coaches will as well I think I have

[00:58:00]
is that our coaches have been pretty clear that at the end of the day we make our own decisions for our own board and they provide coaching which we can choose to accept or not accept and have proceeded with that framework in mind but also acknowledging that we did vote to adopt student outcomes Focus governance model and we did commit to working with the coach and we did commit to a two-year calendar and we did commit to the different dimensions of sosg and so that's all the Integrity issue for me and I think we're what I'm hearing from Member Jackson as well as if we've committed to this and if we've committed to being student outcomes focused how do we navigate the the change management around it how do we make sure every member feels heard and valued and so I'm going to continue coming around to the other board members to continue to allow for discussion but I just want to summarize sort of what I'm starting to glean about the problems here and potential

[00:59:00]
so certainly it sounds like s o f g refresher in terms of what exactly is the role of the council what is the role of the coach what is the role of the board members of the board members it relates to s o f g and so we could do an Sophie refresher I'm hearing the need for a potential public meeting to discuss what we're hearing and this has been something that's been on the I think particular discussion discussion for the community engagement committee as well acknowledging that we could certainly add a meeting to our monthly agenda of meetings that is just public input that and so we have a lot of flexibility there in terms of how we use our time we could add a meeting with optional for board members or two members at a Time come and listen to the community like we control our calendar we can do that and I know that's been on the agenda for the hot Community engagement committee after we got through our superintendent search and our

[01:00:00]
but I so I want us to continue to think of the right solution to the right problem so that's one thing the other thing is hearing the need for specific training on specific topics and so member Jackson did mention the 4000 that we have and we can each sign up for an attend our own trainings I do also want to acknowledge that the district is available to provide voluntary workshops on specific topics and so if there is a need for us to understand Federal programs in more depth or special education in more depth the district can put together a training for us we need to act as a board in requesting that training that's the point that it can't be one off member saying I want to learn more about this topic and the districts goes and does that we only have authority and acting as a board and so if three members need training on a particular topic that's fine the district can offer that but we need to be having conversations again around the Youth of the districts time

[01:01:00]
but I just wanted to say that voluntary workshops are trainings around specific topics are always available as an option from the district from the superintendent and she's not okay I think I'll just summarize again better understanding of Sophie and its role better understanding of specific topics through voluntary workshops I want to dig into the point that number on the table around how do we understand what's happening across the district so I'm putting a pin in that to come back to it but I will continue our conversation with number Jackson thank you so much I don't have much else to say other than I think this is largely a communication issue and if we can

[01:02:00]
work together to facilitate better communication in some way I think that would be extremely helpful and I am most certainly not in favor of any kind of effort that I don't know exist to attack s o f g or to get rid of it so I'm very sorry to hear that member Jackson felt that that was and maybe it's been said another environment that I'm not aware of but I know that that's not my intention and I really honestly don't think it's the intention of any of the board members and so if you all disagree with me please feel free to say so but I am sorry that that's what you heard but I don't think that that's what's happening here so thank you remember Jackson thank you for thank you to everyone for that clarification cuz we have to stick with do not come to focus government

[01:03:00]
so I think the only other couple of comments that I have is that in this might go to the notes that you are taking as far as the governance structure of student of what we're doing is again kind of what I think I'm hearing is a misunderstanding or not a full Embrace just yet of the difference between a role our governing role versus legislating and so to draw that out a little bit we we act as a governance structure meaning that we oversee the superintendent we do that by representing Division and values of our community that we have painstakingly

[01:04:00]
drawn out from our community and are now represented on our walls what I think most of us thought this role was going to be myself included when I ran 3 years ago was that I was maybe going to be more of a legislator that I was going to sit up here and give my thoughts on any particular issue and we would fight it out and if my argument was thinking enough I would win and that would be the the role of the of the district moving forward but that's not the role of school boards our role is to improve student outcomes through division of values of our community by delegating to the superintendent so I think to your president

[01:05:00]
how is the potentially there does need to be another refresher on do not come Focus governance to really dive into what the what the true difference between governing and legislating or not advocating is so I did hear that the other I think the other thing is is and you mention this we we just came off of state of the district address where we stood in front of our community and said we are we are focused on student outcomes and so I just think we need to have integrity and and maintain that this is the this is where we are headed for the benefit of our students because we're not here because I as an IND

[01:06:00]
I am here because my community thinks that I will improve student outcomes the last thing maybe more to the process and to the particulars is I just will see that I'm just not comfortable approving a retreat until and when we have a document in front of us that says the retreat will be about XYZ specifically we know exactly how much it's going to cost we know what the exact specific purpose of its going to be we know who's going to lead it and I think this is discussion is very helpful and it feels like maybe this like we we needed to vent maybe but I am not willing to commit District resources District dollars District Human Resources until I know

[01:07:00]
specifically what that Retreat is going to look like so you know if it's possible that we can continue the discussion but I mean possibly we need to have a motion to postpone so that we actually have specifics about what this Retreat would look like thank you remember Jackson Remember to because I will come back around to you so we have a suggestion but not emotion must phone we I think have some consensus at least head nodding that we could benefit from an SVG refresher I think it would benefit we would benefit from a from a review of our board budget so that we are clear on what Financial Resources do exist period we

[01:08:00]
have this issue of a public meeting to discuss concerns and to discuss what's coming up in other districts member story you put that on the table and wondering if you would be okay if we pitch that over to the ad hoc Community engagement committee and you join that committee is you requested a thorough review over the governance manual and suggested that that can't be completed in the policy committee meeting I want to address this directly cuz I'm thinking maybe that's the substance of the retreat I don't know but if we are going to do a retreat or if we are going to spend a chunk of time working together aside from the sort

[01:09:00]
are there list of things that I've mentioned the voluntary workshops sfg refresher a public meeting about concerns would it be possible to do to make the November meeting full sorry to well trying to figure out how to make this work logistically I was going to say invite all the board members to the policy committee meeting the alternative would be just to put the government's agenda on a full board meeting and discuss but I want to figure out what's the right way to give everybody the opportunity to engage in this conversation that you're suggesting is needed around having a thorough understanding of the government's manual if having it discussed in the October and November policy committee meetings is insufficient and stop and then I have another question related to the how do we how do we do the team building which is the other topic that's been put on the table so I'm thinking we could roll the sofa the the role of SOS

[01:10:00]
and the governance manual together whatever we have not covered by September 9th I mean that's is September 9th on Monday but we're having a committee meeting and that's we are reviewing a portion of it so whatever is left after that but it is what I'm suggesting that you're concerned that the entire board doesn't understand the governance manual so if it's just a policy meeting then only four people are reviewing the government's manual so no no no I'm suggesting first of all it's mostly new members right mostly but I'm suggesting that we do the the role of government that clarified right along with the government's manual

[01:11:00]
are they not complimentary I guess they are complimentary but I was hearing about questions around how do we draw the line between coaching and decisions what is my role relative to the coach relative to the council that I was hearing as an optional SOG refresher for those who felt they need it separate from a board meeting to engage all board members in discussion around the government's manual so if there's concerns and I'm just I'm trying to respond to your concern around the government's manual needs a thorough review all of us together and that the November meeting wouldn't cut it so acknowledging that I think he does myself would not be in that conversation does it make sense to pull the government's manual into a full board meeting maybe we do a workshop that starts at 3 p.m.

[01:12:00]
what are the ways to address the problem that you're so I think in reviewing so there's a larger rationale to reviewing the governance manual that an observation that I've made we have for the first time what I will refer to as a working community members as a majority on the board in I'd say in the recent past it's always been retired retired board members who had this was their job and now the it's just difficult I think or given the structure that we have right now for working members working outside of the board to keep up

[01:13:00]
and so I'm rethinking some of the some aspects of the governance manual and I'm done I'm just talking out loud here ideas based on what I've seen that we need to accommodate in order to have a more Equitable representation on the board of our community we're going to have to think about how the workload accommodates working members so for example every meeting is an opportunity for onboarding for leadership capacity building for transparency for the kinds of learning that takes place on the board in order to build people's capacity to fill in

[01:14:00]
when to be to be in leadership roles and to have a more more depth and breadth on the role of board member and I guess that's that's why I think having the conversation about the role of sosg the council and the governance manual how how do we want to govern ourselves I think that's why I see a retreat or a hole board conversation on these topics says important thank you for that clarification is more helpful to the people with full-time jobs but this is what I'm trying to figure out

[01:15:00]
if we need to have a board conversation around our governance manual I'm hearing a suggestion from you that some of the processes and procedures in that manual they Place undue work burdens on board members just creates silos I think we need to find a way to get to the the point about communication who made that point was that you again what is the problem we're trying to solve because we do need to work in public as a public library we have to have these conversations we have streamlined our board meetings by having fewer meetings and putting more on consent and having board members some of their questions in advance with a particular timeline and we've extended that time line as well so is it is the issue that it's too much work or not enough time or too hard for people who are working if that's the problem that's a different problem than this is

[01:16:00]
I don't understand the problem that we're trying to solve so that we can create the right solution around it so is it an accurate summary of what you're describing here by saying working people on the board have a difficult time keeping up well I think so if she is part of I mean it's it's the framework and I'm not I mean I'm not and again I am not suggestion suggesting that we get rid of SOG I'm just saying how do we make it work for us for the vast majority of us that's what I'm getting in and having a conversation about that so I'm trying to understand what is not working and so when we end so when we review the governance manual it sounds like reviewing it through our committee structure is insufficient if that is the case I mean the committee has been

[01:17:00]
has not met yet in 6 but it's been 6 months so that has fed into that so that feeds into this feeling of being of not having a voice right that's correct but that was decided not by me I mean it was finally I finally insisted I guess on the September 9th meeting and so just that tells me that there's a breakdown there's a misunderstanding about what our manual says about the role of chairs

[01:18:00]
and so what so if there are changes that need to happen in our governance manual again what is the problem that we are trying to fall and if it is a full board problem then let's set aside 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours a full board meeting to discuss it and work through it together in public like we're supposed to do with public officials however if it's a different problem that we're trying to solve then let's find different solutions like the workshop topics like this so if you like a community engagement session to hear from our communities like something else like that's what I'm trying to figure out is the problem so if we're let's start with what what I heard and that is but there's a need for an understanding sosg we've captured that okay so to press that a little bit more what what under why can't we include what will we cover under that

[01:19:00]
well what I've heard is understanding our roles understanding where the line is drawn with the coach what is the role of the coach what is the purpose of the coach I've heard I haven't been trained I heard I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing so the purpose of it is to answer those questions that board members put on the table so under I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing I think a good place to start is what well let's look at our governance manual what does it say we're supposed to be doing yes which is what we're doing in November so is that sufficient is what I'm trying to get to right I don't I don't believe so especially because in November we're going to be looking reviewing educational policy is that correct those are our policies right there no problem

[01:20:00]
we're trying to to we're trying to solve the problem and I'm really sorry but what I'm hearing is that you didn't get to have a committee meeting and so we have to have a retreat I mean I'm sorry but that like that's that's what's coming across its it's that you didn't get to have a committee meeting for 6 months so we have to have a retreat because because we don't understand the governance manual but the governance manual has been published for a year now that you have to write the governance manual like I am sorry but we can all read the governance manual is right there we've all had the opportunity to read this so just thank you period and so I would propose perhaps we can take a motion to postpone to be able to get additional Clarity on what would be on the agenda what would be on the cost who is facilitating when and tie that into the additional information

[01:21:00]
station around the board Services budget hide that into scheduling and Sophie refresher coming back with all of that information so that we can continue this conversation holistically I think that needs to happen soon because we do have the government's manual on the November meeting which would mean that then goes to a depending on how many reads you want it to have December on consent so we have the ability to take it off consent we have the ability to make it a full discussion we have the ability to make it a workshop but I think we need some additional discussion again what we're actually trying to do so I cannot make that motion but is there anyone who would make the motion to postpone until we have a little bit more information I think that gives an opportunity for additional questions as well cuz I feel we're at the point where we are getting heated and I'm not sure that we're making any more progress

[01:22:00]
beyond the list of things that we've identified as needs okay so may I request then that when this gets hashed out the agenda for such a meeting or Retreat who will be in on that conversation will it be the executive committee know we do we have to do this in public so what I'm proposing is we come together and we have an opportunity we get a document that summarizes all of this information in the questions that we need There's an opportunity for questions and an opportunity for board members to submit priorities facilitators topics dates whatever that would have to be facilitated by the board services staff to avoid them then we come back and it's handled the same way that we do other meetings and questions and we'll come back and we'll have another full conversation about it so acknowledging just the timing the September 18th agenda was just

[01:23:00]
but not yet publicly posted so we could add it to the September 18th regular board meeting agenda following that the October 2nd is another opportunity to add it if that's not enough time I moved to postpone this discussion until a later date is there a second this is any additional discussion request clarifying questions we have a motion to postpone the discussion and vote on consideration of approval of Board of Education Retreat for the purpose of understanding the board's role in improving student outcomes emotion from member benavidez

[01:24:00]
yes ever been any videos of the motion carries for the purpose of board Services I think if you can capture the minutes the priorities and then we'll just have to work out a way to get questions submitted that will contribute to the development of agenda purpose timing budget facilitator are there other things that folks want to make sure I guess the handling of the the governance manual discussion are there other things that we need to make sure board Services is capturing for us in this follow-up document all right so then thank you we will move on to our next agenda item

[01:25:00]
I don't want to be a spoiler and spoil all the numbers but I'm super excited about the turnout the energy in the room the feedback that we received the positivity the media coverage and so I'm going to turn it over to our chair of our community engagement at hoc committee to share some of that exciting data around who participated and where we go from here thank you president Gonzalez yeah we had a phenomenal state of the district event and it's just so thrilled with the way that our community engagement and Outreach is proceeding because it seems like every time we do something our engagement with the community just increases so just some of the numbers well actually let me remind the board

[01:26:00]
our community that the community engagement ad hoc committee did set goals and which were approved by the board and those goals are one to increase student engagement at community events with an initial Target of increasing from zero in August of 2024 to 1,000 in August 2026 the second was engaging students and families from groups identified in APS schools One and Two from 0 in August of 2024 to 2000 by August 2026 and the third was that each APS board member must participate in four Outreach events per year starting in 2024 and ending in 2026 so what I'm really excited to share is that first of all in the actual room during the state of the district address we had approximately 350 attendees which is our I think our largest to date

[01:27:00]
add an event fingers and at any and we had 1200 clicks online so and I believe I heard that any one point we had around 400 people watching the live stream so I mean this is just phenomenal work and not only that the board did so I would like to thank the board members for their Outreach that they did to all of the elected officials tribal leaders and Community leaders but I would also like to really highlight the board Services office for all of the work that they did and continue to do to help with that that engagement yes I'm sure fingers clubs so to get to some more specifics we did go through a review of the online sorry the check-in we had 828 PS employees 622 Community part

[01:28:00]
7 elected officials 30 who marked as others 40 parents and 24 students so we're already on our way towards that second goal of engaging students as far as the demographics are concerned 33 identified as low income 24 ident as Native American 11 identities African-American 11 identified as English language Learners five students identified with disabilities and then we had 174 who identified or did not identify with with any of those above so again we had about 84 people representing one of our Martinez Yazzie an African American Target groups which translate to about 33% of the total attendance were our Martinez Yazi demographics so again we are really focused on getting out these groups that might not necessarily always come to those

[01:29:00]
so I think all in all just a phenomenal phenomenal attendance for a stage of the district and we will continue to to up those numbers for our community engagement and Outreach and as far as where we are heading moving forward we do have we are looking at first at some ideas on how we're going to continue to promote Community engagement and Outreach and I believe board member benefits is going to continue to help me in that aspect with how we're going to as we are out meeting with the community are we going to continue to improve to promote our vision and values and our goals and our guard rails some of the ideas include that we would all have Palm cards or that we would work on our own elevators Beach even simple things like we would have named tags so that when we go out to community events it's very obvious who we are and those are just

[01:30:00]
and then I did write down that we are going to look at calendaring a I wrote it as quote what we are hearing around the district and board member astorga I'm hoping that you've already committed I'm sorry you're already you already committed to help me with that so so we're really we're really going to continue to focus because the work we might think it's done but it actually never ends so those are just a couple of things that were looking forward to another thing that we're thinking about doing is incentivizing board members so if if you do your four Outreach goals or you do your 30 emails to elected officials you too can win a prize so something just something that we're thinking about just to incentivize so I think that's it if you have anything to add about fate of the district or

[01:31:00]
I think it was a fantastic event I was really glad to be a part of the planning I can't say that I I was a significant part of it and sorry about that but it was great to be a part and I hope that everybody who attended enjoyed it and I'm just really glad that your vision to uplift the district really seems to be catching I don't think Catching Fire but gaining traction I think that that's really important because as we have all said our students are listening and they need to know that they're valued and that we are working for them and I think that that came across loud and clear so it was great all around thank you and so thank you to the chair of the ad hoc Community engagement Committee Member Jackson and member benefits for your partnership and your work on that it sounds like you have a couple little bit more deliverables there and then as noted that committee will shift to be remember Jackson

[01:32:00]
focusing on the next event I wanted to thank all of the board members for your participation for your attendance for your hard work for your Outreach and your commitment to this work because the state of the district could not have happened without you all so thank you for that I just wanted to flag what's up ahead on the agenda for our board so coming up on September 18th is our next board meeting on that agenda we have guardrail 3 which is high quality curriculum and instruction and this will be on our consent agenda because it is on track also on consent we will have the negotiated agreement for the association of federation classified professionals that will also be on that consent agenda there is potential to add discussion to that and I think we would need to do that by when does get posted

[01:33:00]
October 2nd meeting September 18th on Friday Friday okay so if we're going to have anything we need to know by Friday period October 2nd is the next meeting after that that one we will do progress monitoring for goal one which is our early literacy goal member top your Romero is up next to facilitate the progress monitoring discussion so we will touch base with her to make sure that she gets the training and support to manage that so it is a reminder that all numbers are expected to submit their Technical and Technical questions in advance by the deadline and come to the meeting prepared with smart questions also on that meeting believe it or not is our Q3 so evaluation I feel like we just did our Q2 self-evaluation and so we'll go through the full self-evaluation rubric again that does include the time use monitoring and sober benavidez is up next to do

[01:34:00]
the time tracking and is already working with secretary historica on that so on the agenda will have member benavidez present the time use tracking and then I will facilitate the self-evaluation and again there will be deadlines around when people are expected to submit their self-evaluation rating so we have that information in advance and can have the discussion that we need to have and then the last thing I want to know in terms of what's ahead is October 23rd so we would have had a board meeting on October 16th that meeting has been canceled due to the council great City Schools annual conference but the items that would have been on that meeting's agenda are being moved to a special Board of Education meeting that will be held on October 23rd and that will follow the finance committee meeting at 5 p.m. on both of those meetings will be in person the items that would have been on that October 16th agenda but are now in the October 23rd agenda or progress monitoring of goal to which is math proficiency this one member Dominguez will be up next to facilitate

[01:35:00]
as well as discussing the aps legislative agenda will also be on that October 23rd meeting finally just wanted to acknowledge that Dr Albright is working with the Council of great City Schools to develop a system for tracking staff time use to support board meetings board members and board requests So the plan is to implement this system in the month of September and so we will start to get reports around how much staff time we are using and then that'll also be part of our self-evaluation for quarter four so with that we will the next Board of Education meeting is Wednesday September 18th 2024 at 5 p.m. in Allison Bruce King educational complex here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live stream to APS dot edu and with that this meeting is adjourned
