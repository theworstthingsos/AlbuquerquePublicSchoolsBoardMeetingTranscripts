[00:08:00]
will it be rain 51st in education and I believe excuse me we need to prioritize foundational skills Reading Writing Math and Science before introducing complex social Concepts at this age children are still learning about themselves and the world around them introducing discussions on gender identity can be confusing and may start from essential academic learning these discussions are absolutely out of the purview of public education I urge the board to focus on improving our educational standards and ensuring our children receive the best possible preparation for their Futures let's provide them with the tools they need to succeed and a rapidly changing World rather than introducing Concepts that may not aligned with their developmental stage or their ideals of their own family it is not a PSS job to parent my child it's mine thank you for your time and consideration thank you ma'am our next speaker is

Bella gardenia gordia followed by Mary Walker you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening administrators my name is charmella garage I am a former student and a mom of two APS students a teacher at La Quinta High School in a member of the aps African-American advisory Council the council's mission is to improve the quality of education for black students and to create an environment that posters of belonging and pride in oneself I come before you today to request that ethnic studies be offered at every APS high school either as a mandatory class for graduation included as a course that will meet one of the discretionary units or at the very least wave class size requirements were to be taught and to promote the

[00:10:00]
pause ethnic studies is a line to apses goal for which includes helping our students develop a mindset that is open and respectful of diverse perspectives promotes the sense of belonging builds compassion and connection with others by learning about and understanding not only what makes each of us unique but what makes us so similar to one another the lessons and activities and an ethnic studies class creates Community by strengthening the bonds between peers and with adults through those shared classic experiences this in turn Foster's resilience self-regulation selfie and social awareness skills and mindsets necessary for Life success and the cornerstones of goal for the cultivation of such will translate into increase attendance rates improved academic performance and higher graduation rates for marginalized students because they feel a sense of belonging at school and supported by their peers and teachers according to the 20223 b e a report

[00:11:00]
only 69% of African-American students graduate in comparison to their Caucasians at 79% and Hispanic 76% Piers African-American students have the lowest graduation rates in the state of New Mexico aside from students with disabilities at 67% in Albuquerque the percentage is even lower that same year only 59% graduated in comparison to the 75% of all students can you wrap up in one quick sets Okay so supporting ethnic studies can provide these supports provide the supports by teaching the Next Generation to understand and individuals or groups unique situation for and care about them he can help our students recognize our shared Humanity thank you thank you man or next speaker is Mary Walker by doctor I'm sorry each one of you for being here today and being on the

[00:12:00]
School Board serving our community did you ever make a decision based on not enough information but at the same time everyone around you whom you trust tell you sincerely it will all work out for the best that it's the answer to all of your emotional and mental anguish my name is Mary Walker Herrera I'm a special education EA at an APS Elementary School I'm an EA in a severe needs classroom before becoming an EA I was a substitute teacher for five years during those five years I substitute taught all over turkey and elementary middle schools and high schools open and charters in recent times the top of questions about gender and the option of gender transitions as come into our lives every age being affected especially the Young Elementary and Middle School age groups I have presented to each of you a book d

[00:13:00]
by Mary Margaret olohan in the book detransitioners are interviewed and each tells their story of transitioning from one gender to another and then deciding to reverse that process to go back to their original gender they all make warning statements that transitioning from your original gender to the opposite does not cure you of your hurts and anxieties nor Suicidal Tendencies we all need to know as much as possible when making decisions detrans is a position that has emerged from testimonies and stories from Young Voices that need to be heard as board members your listening and reading about detrans stories can impact your decision-making on policies involving transgenderism for children at the elementary and middle school as well as high school levels in the public school system in Albuquerque New Mexico

[00:14:00]
in closing I want to thank you for your time and attention to detransitioning reversing a decision made on a lack of information that has negative lifelong implication thank you our next speaker is Dr Harold Harold Bailey followed by looks like on Anya Taylor Swift special education teacher within the aps system for over 12 years I'm also presidents for the African American advisory committee in regards to the recruitment of additional African American teachers in particular black male teachers I think that the students in within APS need positive role models and black teachers can be positive role models

[00:15:00]
I was going to school back in APS back in the day I did not have black male teachers matter of fact I didn't have any black male teachers only in elementary school so but I came out all right so I mean black male teachers can be positive role models not only for black students but for all students I think that we need to I had this conversation with Madame superintendent regards to recruitment of black teachers at the historical black colleges and universities we had a very productive meeting so I like to express my concerns in regards to the the board hopefully we can do something about that we can Implement initiatives to bring more black teachers today PS4 system also during my time in special education I know that there are a lot of black male students refer to Black referred to a special education classes so I think that if we had additional blackmail teachers we

[00:16:00]
you're probably offset that Trend because a lot of my students they were in the level of specialty level but they were very smart and a lot of teachers are not trained to handle you know the 21st century student so if we if we increase the number of a black teachers I think that we can affect this trend so thank you very much for your time thank you sir Anya European my name is Anya and I'm a senior at La Quinta high school during my junior year I had the privilege to take ethnic studies today I'm here to talk to you about why at the next studies class is important at the next studies class is focused on learning about the perspectives and history of minorities in our country at the next studies is not just a class but rather a place to be proud of

[00:17:00]
our cultural backgrounds as well as learn from our classmates during ethnic studies my classmates and I were provided a place to share our opinions on current events affecting ethnic groups and have open discussions without judgment our classroom became a place of acceptance and knowledge thanks for our teacher mystery as predicted from the 2020 census America as a nation is becoming more diverse which is why we must teach our communities about the different beliefs and cultures in our community as Ralph Waldo Emerson once said ignorance leads to fear ethnic studies to spell ignorance and replaces it with knowledge and understanding without the understanding of different cultures and the history of ethnic groups in the United States racial and ethnic motivated violence will persist restricting legislation towards certain minority groups such as the lgbtq community will continue to be ratified

[00:18:00]
as a community we need to understand how the system affects various individuals so that we can create an equal playing field for everyone in this District thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Renee Pacheco followed by Mercedes igby you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening and put them in a private school because you are not doing your job if you were doing your job my children would be safe boys would not be allowed in the girls bathroom or their locker room teachers would be treated with respect they could tell the students know they could discipline them this would keep them safe how many guns do we need to confiscate how many lives taken in 2023 the Albuquerque Journal

[00:19:00]
where did that schools have seen more guns this year than any other year in APS it was supposed to be protection in our schools Benny a sixth grader at Washington Middle School with killed by an 8th grader with a gun APS has not called APD to trace the guns what is being done this year from talking to teachers and administrative from different schools they have told me that these five guns have been confiscated how about how many more have they not heard about how many more have not been reported see something say something is the motto but what is that going to do when students are bringing guns because they are afraid I also want to reiterate the guidance counselors and the bus drivers report from the last meeting this is sad that you are allowing this to be your legacy

[00:20:00]
under you your why your time could be made making more of a difference I pray that you hear these words but it affects you I pray for the teachers that they keep speaking out I pray for the children that they are safe I pray for the moms and dads that they realize what is going on and they speak up and we all come together to stand up for the truth and safety of all of us in the school system is mercedes's followed by Daniel Toya and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you good evening Madam superintendent Madam president and members of the board my name is and I serve as the coach hair for the aps African-American advisory Council and I said on the profiles and Pathways of Committee of this Council I'm here today on behalf of the council to let

[00:21:00]
billboard know that graduation rates for African-American students were 10% lower compared to all students for the 2022 2023 school year there was also a 6/10 decrease in graduation rates for African-American students compared to 5 years ago we believe the school board should be greatly concerned about the fact that African-American students are graduating at a much lower rate compared to their non-african-american peers we would like to see the school board have a sense of urgency about creating targeted culturally relevant opportunities and adequate supports to ensure that graduation rates for African-American students are greatly improved this school year and that they have sufficient resources to succeed in post-secondary Pathways thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak to tonight and I look forward to seeing what you all put into action to address this concerned thank you ma'am an extra speaker is Daniel Toya followed by Kimberly Arrington Woodley you have two minutes once you begin

[00:22:00]
good evening Madam president in board members this is my third time speaking about retaliation for substitute teachers last Friday a substitute teacher was fired again for retaliation for complaining about child abuse I was let go for filing a police report the police report was even done wrong I have contacted APS staff members and I'm being told no one sending me somewhere to another person that is none of my business I can't get involved go to Cali go to do this if that are substitutes are being retaliated against for reporting child abuse I reported by cases last year not one of them was improperly investigated I am reported to this year I was contacted three weeks later for when is it still when is this have not been contacted I am tired that Subs are reporting child abuse and all this stuff happening at school and instead of investigating against us in firmness we don't know

[00:23:00]
how to turn to no one at APS has helped any of our subs who have complained about child abuse it is sad it's sad that I have reported and come here three times and spoken about this and to hear that is still continuing substitutes are contracted by APS to Kelly Services but it's sad that we have no one to turn to for help when we see child abuse and I just it's sad that teachers are being abused bus drivers are being abused and it seems like nothing's being done if we can't protect the staff how could I stopped protect the students that's all I have to say thank you guys thank you sir our next speaker is Kimberly airington Woodley and followed by Mary Mary you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president and I extinguished board and superintendent Dr Blakey

[00:24:00]
my name is Kimberly Arrington Woodley I'm here tonight as a member of the aps African-American advisory Council I am a mother of past APS graduates and a grandmother of a of a current APS student I believe that our children are our future in today's world and they need the skills to navigate successfully imagine a world where our schools are safer because children use skills to mediate and negotiate problems instead of bringing guns to school or a world where our students see the harm that they have done and work with with victims to repair the harm and make restitution mediation negotiations and repairing our world are not inherent skills are children like adults and their Community have to be taught restorative justice practices is an on-time practice that can be taught to our children to give them voice and to help schools proactively create a

[00:25:00]
Community I asked you emphatically not to put restorative justice practices as something we might do but to make it a must do I want to Advocate that APS leadership Endeavors to teach teach adults and students restorative justice practices and by adults I mean the teachers in the schools APS could be responsible for creating a safer Community for our children's future please make restorative justice practices restorative justice practices the way we do business at APS immediately the lives of our children are endangered thank you and I have to do full disclosure I am a retired principal and an educator even today I educate I'm a teacher thank you thank you Mom in our last speaker is Mary you have two minutes when she began speaking

[00:26:00]
good evening Madam president superintendent Blakey and distinguished board members my name is Meryl Cady and I currently attend La Cueva high school as a junior I serve as president of the black student union a co-founder of the missing Student Association and as a black Muslim Arabic woman I have seen firsthand how misunderstanding and ignorance can shape the experiences of students like me especially when it comes to history culture and religion I'm here to advocate for the advocate for the inclusion of ethnic studies as a course in every single APS High School this course is vital not just for students of color but for all students in general it brings the light history and perspectives that are too often left out of traditional curriculums for students like me the lack of cultural education in schools love this constantly having to explain our Traditions are beliefs are identities while dealing with misconceptions and stereotypes I cannot tell you how often my classmates assume that my background is limited to the image of social media I have just last week I had a man tell me inside a bakery hearing one word of my hearing

[00:27:00]
what's me say one word that I had an Indian accent these experiences remind me of how deeply the system is failing to educate students in the diverse world we live in ethnic studies can change that it's a powerful tool to counter and build an environment where all students and understood by learning about histories and cultures of people from different backgrounds with a black and digits Latin Asian Arab or otherwise students can begin to connect with experiences and different from their own and that's what the true Learning Happens the inclusion of ethnic studies would also line perfectly with aps's broader goals particular goal for which speaks to Foster and open and respectful mindset promoting in a cultivating empathy and understanding students perform better academically when they feel like their identities are understood and respected this course could be the key to creating that kind of supportive environment I urge you to consider making this class available in every single high school whether I was in a requirement and elective or just a class in general and to provide resources to ensure that reaches as many students as possible it's time for us to move Beyond surface level education and create a curriculum

[00:28:00]
reflects the diversity of the students you serve thank you thank you ma'am for president Gonzalez and board members that completes public forum thank you Mr Gonzales next on our agenda is agenda item 5.1 which includes all of our student outcomes focused governance issues we will consider acceptance of the progress monitoring report for goal one interim go 1.1 and 1.2 related to early literacy are facilitator for this portion of the agenda will be board member top your own arrow and our presenters will be Dr Gabriella Blakey superintendent doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent of leadership and learning and Sherry Jetties academic officer remember you have the floor thank you so tonight we're going to be monitoring goal one and interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 measuring early literacy math post

[00:29:00]
skills habits and mindsets but before we hear our presentation we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I met with the team earlier this week in review the monitoring report and thank you for your time for helping me and going forward I do believe that all the criteria for an effective report has been matched but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks you may be missing one of the elements does anyone have any evidence that suggests otherwise so since everyone agrees that we have we have actually met the required elements and their present we will turn the floor over to the superintendent for the presentation thank you board member Tapia Romero members of the board when we approached making the goals the community told us that they want our students to be proficient readers

[00:30:00]
so the board of education has set a goal to make early literacy go one a top priority for a district the goal is to improve 3rd grade reading proficiency by 10% points in 5 years recognizing that Mastery of reading by this stage is crucial for future success this initiative specifically targets historically underserved groups aiming to increase proficiency rates from 27.3 percent in May of 2023 to 37.3% by May of 2028 to help us reach the school we are focusing on our interim assessments for first and second grade as our interim goals which targets to boost their proficiency rates by 6% of points over the next three years this comprehensive approach takes to ensure that all of our students especially those facing the most challenges can read effectively by the end of third grade which will lay the foundation for their ongoing education and success

[00:31:00]
received a video showcasing the growth that we've seen in this school it was also shown before our meeting this evening and tonight we are here to discuss go one or interim goals and any questions that you have for us that are left unanswered and with that I turned it over to Deputy superintendent of instruction Dr Gonzalez Madden president members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey Chief academic officer Sherry and I are happy to be with you this evening period

[00:32:00]
are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the bull to the board's goals and guardrails those questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time-bound so here we go guys let's roll so we will go ahead and get started and I will go ahead and open it up to the board as we go through our questions and I'm going to encourage the entire board to help hold each other accountable to ensure that we're actually following the guy that's placed in front of us to ensure that they're smart and I think as we work through this little really allow us to align our questions more appropriately so having said I'm going to actually go to my far left board members store if you don't mind starting a song of course thank you so on the goal one root cause analysis it states that we did not

[00:33:00]
exactly address the learning loss for students during online learning I first just wanted to thank you for calling it out and really letting folks know that and acknowledging that we have a generation of students that did lose learning during online learning and covid and everything that happened so thank you for making sure that that was in there and my question is that now that we know there is this Gap what is your strategy to track the outcomes of students who are affected by this loss of learning in order to ensure that we are preparing them and challenging them as they move upgrades Madam president of the board members historical superintendent Dr Blakey thank you for your question period and one of the things that we recognize is that while we are monitoring the third grade students from

[00:34:00]
there's work to do Beyond on this as we anticipate and set them up for success in relationship to the goals that lie in middle school and Beyond so thank you for recognizing that honest assessment in our cousin analysis in Falling short on 01 in relationship to some strategic measures moving forward is summarize I think of the word specificity we need to be really specific and when you need to be specific with our special education students for example and how do we look at progress towards goals every single grading period to make sure that when our students are special education students are achieving how do we help them in accelerate beyond that if they're not achieving how do we get back to the IEP table to assist

[00:35:00]
you can ensure that the plan that we have in place is indeed the right plan for our ale students what do we do systemically and how do we how do we correlate data points for example we know that we have an important measure with our interim assessment and iStation and access but we also iStation and namaza but we also have access and how do we triangulate those data points to build a plan for ell Learners to achieve in very intentional ways so we know that we have a strategy in place and that's great and I believe in the strategy that we have in place but what this strategy calls us to action on is being specific and specific by students thank you and I do agree that during the progress monitoring it'll be really great to see since we know who those students were that lost that learning during 2020 we can see

[00:36:00]
that growth through progress monitoring so I wanted to just call that out and thank you for your work and I do have another question but it's for interim you want me to wait no go ahead you could ask him so on page 5 interim go 1.1 you mentioned that teachers are receiving letters training as one of your strategies to improve early literacy have we seen any barriers with this model for bilingual and ESL Educators and if so other other models that we are looking at for those specific Educators I can take that thank you for your question a member of store president Gonzalez Dr Blakey Marissa the board it's nice to be here to talk about the work we as we've implemented letters and I won't say that I'm an expert in letters but I've been learning a lot about it recently it actually specifically addresses the needs of our emerging by lingual students English language Learners though I have to admit I can't speak

[00:37:00]
to it specifically if you have an expert in the office in the audience if some Miss wheeler wanted to come forward to address it but the letters part of the reason that we have gone with that with the state and they talked about how important it is to work with our bilingual and emerging bilingual communities and so the state decision to invest in letters and the subsequent roll out and APS is really been based in we know that this science of reading is actually considering all of the different barriers that different students would bring awesome thank you and I probably will send this question out to this is really one of the concerns that I do have with letters is if when we're getting trained and letters and it is in English the way in Spanish phonics are different right so being able to teach the letters in English is different than teaching that in Spanish so I'm wondering what the time constraints are for the teachers and if they have enough time to be able to transition

[00:38:00]
in a model so just thinking about that but thank you for guys thank you thank you board member of the board member benavidez thank you so my question is in relation to my clarifying question regarding the Lost learning time of the now 4th graders and thank you for sparking my my creativity and interest in this because I think board members to really good question about what's being done with strategies are in place to ensure that these students get caught up to where they need to be and I'm going to go further with that and say what strategies are a place where this to happen again if we have another pandemic and there is remote learning I think that that's something we have an address and it's really important to know that I'm president members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey that's a very good question and one that we all hope we don't have

[00:39:00]
take on anytime soon but what I will tell you is the work that we have done as a system to integrate technology into our practice in a meaningful way has been rather profound and I think something APS should be proud of in terms of how quickly they turn this around the integration of Technology into the curriculum doing classrooms and seeing that and how teachers have taken some of the lessons learned from online virtual education and incorporated into their practice even now is something that is impressive I will say that we have also had a couple of gems in our midst of the work that we have done at Academy High School and how that high

[00:40:00]
who has been able to give us some lessons learned and best practices to replicate system-wide in terms of a strategy we are also working to comprehensively look at the work that we do with our virtual high school and we have a task force in place to look at that to see how we are going to continue to incorporate virtual education at RK to 12 system what does that mean post-pandemic how do we continue to service students in multiple venues well with the high school Nuance of credit recovery which in some ways on fell to a virtual Space by default because of the pandemic so how do we offer diverse options for credit recovery inside and outside of virtual education that is a question I think that we will start to say we need to continue to ponder as we do build our

[00:41:00]
plans on I think of our site safety plan which incorporates different situations in terms of how we deal with circumstances that are challenging including and not limited to a pandemic so I'm something we can go back and look at for sure want to point out that you know our goals are very specific to the students that were looking at and I think that looking at these data it really does kind of exemplify for us the impact that the online learning had to Us section of our students who didn't have the same access to either internet to having you know a parenting with them or somebody sitting with them when they're in kindergarten to navigate online learning I remember just

[00:42:00]
reading a book to a class in kindergarten when we were online and I had such admiration for the teacher like how did the one little girl just started like opening her drawer and showing all the clothes that she had but I started thinking about how the teacher was trying to navigate like those formative years of teaching and as we progress in our progress monitoring to see gold too and the impact that the pandemic may or may not have had at the same level for older students I think if something happened and we had to do something similar again we are now very aware of those formative years and what that really looks like in remote learning and the impact that has had long-term on them you know the I appreciate board member historical pointing out those students because their fourth graders and we just because we're not monitoring fourth grade we

[00:43:00]
just not know that we have this bubble of students that is is now in 4th grade which my nephew is a part of and they are always going to be behind unless we really narrow focus on how we're really impacting their learning whether we need to provide more tutoring to them maybe you'll like how we can make sure that our fourth graders are getting intervention even though we're not monitoring fourth grade it's really important that we target our interventions at fourth grade based on what we're seeing the positive news is as you look at interim 1.1 and 1.2 you can see where that isn't happening now that these students have been in school but we can't let go of this bubble of students that are going to need more intense instruction before they get any further thank you thank you

[00:44:00]
thank you so in light of the data that's on page 223 of the report for Goldline monitoring overall showing that the outcomes for our Target groups decreased I'm curious if you could speak to what changes to the next fiscal year budget we can anticipate in order to address that issue board president Gonzalez were you talking about the goal or the interim goals the call so give him that we've had a decrease overall and we're hearing about the strategies what are implications for the budget and one of the reasons I asked the questions because in goal one specifically as we look at third grade I think a lot of it in is what I just kind of alluded to as far as our groups of students who were not given the same access to online learning that we're seeing that

[00:45:00]
packs of so when we talked about the budget and I see Miss Avoca eagerly waiting to come to my girlfriend which is a great sign I think that it is how are we prioritizing the budget for 4th graders and 5th graders for next year or fourth grade now so we have to Target like how are we going to Target instruction for 5th grade particularly for next year not just overall how are we going to reach that so go ahead so we have started strategically starting to plan the budget so starting not closer to when our deadlines are but actually starting earlier this year and we're working with the deputy superintendent the the office of federal programs and state programs so we can see

[00:46:00]
it's not just what is needed but how we can raise funds and how we can use funds more effectively and efficiently thank you madam president members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey I would like to elevate and just bring to life some of the work of the newly established federal and state programs office under the reorganization of Dr Blakey this office is really been formed in some ways to answer the question of return on investment and program Effectiveness and as we anticipate the budget approval process again this next cycle we only anticipate the question of how are we doing things differently how do we know what we're doing is working we have you executive director and Dr Blair who is taking this work head on and looking at

[00:47:00]
all we have taken federal funds as an example historically in Albuquerque Public Schools and departmentalize them not to bad intention but we've departmentalized them as opposed to making these funds District strategically aligned so how does Title One interception and title 3 and title 4 and how is there a strategic approach of deploying resources to the system and to our schools as opposed to having a title one initiative a title to initiative a title three initiative and so on so what's happening is our new executive directors looking at each one of these grants what are the plans beneath them how are they proving and yielding successful or not and having the heart conversations with the program managers under those grants to justify the work that they're doing then we align them within strategic conversations that we are

[00:48:00]
traffic to the goals and the guard rails that we are set forth to work on this work I think will come to life in the budget presentations that lead up to the budget approval process and I trust that it will be well received by the board because a lot of work has gone into what that sign says right here period change and that is a big example of how we are working to change adult behavior in response to goals and support students so just to follow up on that in terms of making my question time bound because I think it was mostly smarr the time frame specifically for these types of changes so you articulated that it's going to be integrated with the budget presentations I'm curious as you speak specifically to the role of the new director of The Office of state and federal program

[00:49:00]
and our next board meeting with the legislative agenda how how you're going to write that or what's the time frame rather so say it another way because ped has the black Education Act as Vanek education at the legal Education Act the Indian Education Act Etc which provides funds programs and staff at the state level and we're making our legislative requests shortly how is the work that you're describing that's happening with the new office of state and federal programs influencing that legislative agenda or what is the time frame rather for it makes sense I think so when I'm going to answer if I don't hit the mark let me know and I'll try to adjust what I would say is in terms of a timeline the charge to this new office is set of recommendations by the end of this calendar year so that we are able to implement within the new planning budget cycle from a staffing point of view

[00:50:00]
programmatic point of view and from a bunch of approval point of view in relationship to the work of ped the unified application that coincidentally now is uniform similar to the work that APS is doing the size of the Stars aligned and that the districts are now having to report not by Title by all of the above so we now have one application where Title One title 2 title 3 and so on is being strategically submitted so the work that we're engaged in right now is very good because we are now in a position to coherently respond and coherently work so who knows what APS was doing and responding but we're well positioned to submit the application that was very helpful in terms of time frame I do have another question do you want me to do it now or wait till we come back

[00:51:00]
so also in light of the data that we have showing the decrease in performance and then also the Q&A which indicated which specific subgroups are underperforming or outperforming my question is what strategies is the district using to engage the African-American advisory Council and how is the work and the recommendations that we heard from them being heard and integrated as a part of your response to addressing the gaps of African American students thank you for that question we are really delighted to have the members of the African-American advisory Council speak to us tonight so the relationship we value and as we look at that data we know that we're doing some good work and we know that we have a lot more work to do in terms of supporting this population of students and will know that

[00:52:00]
when are goal 3 I'm sorry goal 3 go one data that are African-American students were the ones that have the largest increase and so we are beginning to celebrate that and we believe that is part of our collaboration with the community and with the advisory Council that being said I think the the presence of Dr Bailey and others this evening really highlights how we can continue to collaborate to make sure we're providing relevant instruction the appropriate supports for our students we have a long way to go but we are excited to continue to partner and really you know from the programmatic side thinking a lot about what are the very specific ways that we make our curriculum culturally in linguistically responsive to all of our students and so that's a conversation we're having pretty much across the board not just with our African-American students and families but

[00:53:00]
play families are English language Learners like we we have much we can learn from our community I think additionally one of the things that Dr Bailey pointed out that is really important is in our staffing and really being intentional about how we are Staffing our schools and how we are recruiting teachers and based on talks with Dr Blakey I talk to myself Dr Bailey and members of the council we have started recruiting at the historical black colleges we had Mr Carruthers go recently to his alma mater to help us recruiting teachers and we're looking at how we can partner to support teachers once they're here which is another thing that I've been talking to Dr Bailey and Mr Caruthers about is it's not just recruiting people but

[00:54:00]
how do we not just the kids feeling a part of something but how do we ensure that the adults working in the school also feel connected to working in the school the council also when I was before I started when I was in my like restart time I met with the council and they had given me advice that I really value on recruiting or interviewing principles and they gave me some questions that they suggested that we asked and I did ask several of the principals when I was when I came on to be able to start hiring principals I used several of those questions in hiring principals when I was interviewing them because some of it isn't really like as tacticals as you know this this strategy some of it is just how are we creating a culture where we value people

[00:55:00]
and we create a sense of belonging for both the adults and the children and I think that is a lot of the work that we have to do and in listening to the public comments even about ethnic studies that's something we are working on as far as what I heard this evening was how do we make sure all students have access to it and we've had some discussions and Dr Gonzalez and his team are working on how do we make sure that when students are enrolling for classes that this there are same classes at all schools so that we can really see what the student voices in designing that instead of it being based on well this school you can take this class but not this school and that's also some of the work that the high school redesign committee is working on as well thank you thank you thank you so if you don't mind I'm going to be a little blunt

[00:56:00]
I am was not well let me back up a little bit the answers that came in under the instructional strategies related to Yazzie Martinez African-American and bilingual achievement the question that was asked was was related to the plan of action that has been developed and the question was was this plan of action developed prior to the release of the data or is this the plan of action now that we have the data and I am not convinced based on the answer that was submitted that that this is an a strategic answer to the data that we have so my question is specifically is it relates to go one what I'm trying to

[00:57:00]
understand is how did you pivot the plan based on the fact that the data came in below what the yes what the projections were showing because the the answer said that the plan was developed prior to the release of the 2023 namaha it takes into account achievement data and friends from the past two years but the achievement and the transform the past years were actually showing an increase and so the data that came in this year was off Trend but you're telling me that a plan of action that was developed in July of 2024 is the exact plan to address where we currently are and I'm not convinced that it is

[00:58:00]
I'm not making a suggestion convince me that the plan that you have is the pivot that you need to address the acceleration that we need board member of Jackson I'll start with the answer are you ready we'll see if we were going to say the same thing so these data aren't of surprise to us and waiting for the state data because of the 90-day plans that the schools have been doing so we have been able to see that we're not as surprised at the data that we saw for gold one based on the data that we had been looking at so the interim goals are the short cycle assessments and as you look at these days you can see this bubble of time where there's this little group that is lower in average

[00:59:00]
the other groups so even though they're growing so I'll point out 2021 2022 10.7 percent beginning of the year 14 percent 14.8% is their end that group on interim Go 1.2 is the 18.5 to the 18.3 these are the kids that then last year or third graders so they're the ones that are represented in the NASA so although they grew in 2021 from 10 to 14.869% so you can already

[01:00:00]
me that gap of where the students were already coming in late so even though they grew and and actually they didn't grow in 2022 2023 they were 18.5% and at the end of the year they were 18.3% so that group stage flat that's last year's third graders that are represented in gold one so based on these data that we had been looking at the strategies that were in place we're looking at based on the 90-day plan here are things that we need to intervene this year to and as we were creating the Strategic plan to address what we saw in the data so getting the massive scores wasn't it verified the strategies that were in place Dr Gonzalez do you have anything to add ditto I would just add

[01:01:00]
what president members of the board Dr Blakey that you raised an important process question that we have been talking about the table a lot about in regards to Preparing progress monitoring documents and the process and the sequence we use in preparing strategy when we look at Data before we're establishing strategy and not to the way around we can't be building strategy and retrofitting it into the data we need to look at the data consider the data identify the holes in the data so that we are able to build a specific strategy to respond to what's glaring in the data we also have stumbled upon some promising practices in terms of informing ourselves and one would be in any one of these goals what are the schools that are really achieving what's the story that we are able to tell from those schools likewise what are the schools that are really struggling in any one of these schools I think you saw an example

[01:02:00]
a highlight or a calling him a peak moment in terms of the video you saw before the meeting in terms of highlighting and replicating and telling the story of some of our schools that are really doing some work well and helping other schools maybe learn from their success and using our performance framework to support schools that are struggling okay so if I can just clarify what what you are assuring me of and attempting to convince me of is that the plan that is here was not created based on pastors data it was pivoted it was adapted because you were watching the 90-day plans and the short term assessment data that was coming in and as of July 2024 when this was created you already had

[01:03:00]
I'll be back thank you for explaining also with our kids with disabilities and that the the concern and how we want to pull up those particular areas of needs especially pertaining to the IEP and I do also want to commend you on the root cause for why are implemented reading and the comprehension levels are at a low just as Courtney was staying in this assurity piece is what evidence do you have to support your certainty that you will continue to exceed interim goals one point one and 1.2 goals

[01:04:00]
thank you for her answer to this question then you should repeat what I said Thank You board member so one of the things that gives us confidence is in looking at the trajectory in the goals starting with this year's first graders and second graders so it gives us the indication and looking at it now that we are on a trajectory of the students first of all coming in at a higher b o y which is the beginning of the year point so we can attribute that to a number of factors one is we do think that we're seeing success in the states investment in early childhood education because of where students are starting to come in when we see now in first grade in fact in kindergarten classrooms that I've gone to visit they can see where they can be

[01:05:00]
begin teaching from when they used to start teaching Justin individual skills based on that investment so that's one thing that we've seen in some of the data so we know that the the strategies that we have are research-based strategies that seem to be showing that they're effective as we're seeing in the interim assessments that then leads kind of to what board member Jackson's question is is what gives you confidence that this is going that will meet go one next time we review it so I have a high level of confidence that we will meet go one in the next set based on the strategies we're using that are research-based and looking at where are kids are second graders were last year so when we look at 1.2 the students this year that will be taking the Masa are the students who were at the 26.3% at the

[01:06:00]
end of last year which means that they were already over our goal in our interim and those are the students will be testing on the NASA this year in third grade thank you thank you about letters and and just request that we also need to look at our International students it's not just the Spanish speakers

[01:07:00]
so my question is how how will or how does the district align resources currently to increase and I'm referring to a question nine to the prediction here to increase annually the percentage of grade three gods in Martinez decision plus African-American students who score at the 80th president

[01:08:00]
question number nine says on page 4 in Figure 1 of the gold one report under evaluation of current performance the report States the projected performance of 3rd grade students will increase to 26.6% this is lower than the annual Target for 2025 did you adjust downward based on the current data if so do you also project that APS will not be able to meet the overall goal of 37.3 per cent by 2028 why are why not and then the answer is you state predictions are based on the most recently available scores annual targets were set when the goals were adopted to meet the overall gold the district will need to increase annually the percentage of grade 3

[01:09:00]
African-American students who score at the 80th percentile or above on iStation so how how do you plan to align resources to get there to meet your annual Target now or I mean in the current board member so it's behind like these numbers are humans little children and so this 26.6 is based on 25.3% on that trajectory however what we know is that because we do interim assessments which is why it's important to do them we can tell that the actual children that are

[01:10:00]
going to be tested or doing they did I mean I wouldn't say grades 266 but they did hire in their eye station now the 80% is alluding to the norm of the of the interim assessments grades the proficiency at 60% or higher the Masa is an 80% proficiency so that question is saying what we have to do is Target students who are between the 60% and the 80% because New Mexico has a high pass proficiency to be able to count as proficient so one strategy is through the 90-day plan that schools are looking at the students who are between when they pull their Ice Station they can see students that are between 60

[01:11:00]
1080 % proficient those students are the students who could be on the proficiency on the interim assessment but when they take the NASA they're going to show that they were not proficient so the first strategy is for schools to dig into the data to identify who are those students that are in the 60% to 80% the second part of it is being very intentional with our performance framework and how are assistant superintendents are doing walkthroughs in the school to really focus on the school level of the schools that are in the priority and emerging group to make sure that they're getting real-time coaching and finding out if there are things that they are missing that they need one of the things we're really looking at with those schools too is making sure that their staffed correctly that they don't have a lot of you know things that could be seen as not routine for the

[01:12:00]
students that then would impact them as well great because I got rid of another question I do but this next question is a future question may I do that now or related to yeah go ahead so how will this is come up in the conversation how will the intersectionality of our targeted population be part of the strategy for reporting data for go one for any or even go to I guess but we're focused on gold one so we have Native American students who are also specialty I feel like that gets lost in the reporting and

[01:13:00]
it's important so in the report that we currently give they are as the goal is written they are all together so you're saying is there a way to see them by subgroup so for clarification I want to ensure that the question itself is it related to the report because you're talking about a special ed a question right I just want to ensure that work it's about population and so what I'm saying it gets here and feel free to worry because we've talked about this you can have one student okay yeah because I feel like that's a really great question is there a plan to desegregate intersectionalities that students have

[01:14:00]
conversation right before the board meeting and I think what you're alluding to is the intersectionality of race and ethnicity and how it is reported and how you differentiate between how a student is reporting their race and how they also have an option to report their ethnicity and how you look at the data I think it's that it's more if there's a student who is Hispanic but also in special education they get lumped together as Martinez Yazzie but is there a data that says this student is both and this is their data versus so we have one student that crosses checks off the box for all Marvel characters like maybe in one two even three or four different categories and looking and how many of them

[01:15:00]
based on those students and giving schools a more comprehensive or specific picture of who these students are in relationship to the student groups that were monitoring is definitely something that we can take back and produce for the board and for schools that is not a difficult task at all so bear with me cuz I think it is information that is needed but I want to ensure that we're still staying alive with the technical versus Technical and I feel like we're we're drifting to the intersectionality yeah I think it's more of a strategy of how we're going to see the data next time we come around so I don't see it as being technical it's more do we have a plan or strategy in place to identify students who may be in both subgroups that are inside of the chance to see population

[01:16:00]
and also the numbers may be overstated because in and high if we're looking at each category pertaining to the subgroups of Martinez and Yazzie if we're only separating special ed students L special education and low economically disadvantaged if one child fits all categories and we're saying one but then we're reporting four how can we make sure that data is accurate president

[01:17:00]
helpful in terms of next steps and I wanted to just point out I think Dr Blakey superintendent Blakey said it in a really positive ways we just don't want them to be counted multiple times right so then our data is off like board member don't worry so thank you for developing that for us and hopefully that helps with your question yeah I was it was a strategic question any other questions okay so my question is related page six on where you mentioned the units of study we talked about you know making instruction more holistic but I don't see where we address how they will directly address the ELA goals and how are they specifically used in the classroom thank you for that question are being developed really to help us establish a scope and sequence of the progression of standards that

[01:18:00]
how to help a student be successful and and I agree in this high-level overview that isn't really reflected so thank you for the question I think when we are looking at those units of study and I'd be happy to maybe share an example with the board they are in development what their purpose is beyond the scope and sequence and those spiraling of skills is to really make The Learning Experience very very rich and so we know and it's sort of related to the conversation we've had around our English language Learners like all of our students who are coming potentially with an academic deficit what are the multitudes of strategies that a teacher has in order to address those so for example we have an expectation in our Elementary classroom so they'll be Hands-On learning that we're going to get the the multi-modal kids off the shelf and we're going to put them in front of the children because we

[01:19:00]
do you know that's really critical as a part of their brain development so that's the sort of thing you would see reflected in the unit of study is how those specific strategies those teacher moves that we would see in the classroom impact the specific skill that were addressing with the student thank you and I guess to follow up on that too back to the units of study is making sure how are we confident to ensure that it's being used consistently across the district from if we look at schools within the Northeast Heights versus West Side can you ensure that that is being carried through properly I think that's part of our work of guardrail 3 that we're looking at when we look at instructional materials were also looking at an instructional practice the goal overall all of the units of study one of the goals is to reduce variability across the district so that we're having

[01:20:00]
I'm not a standardized experience across the school but less variable one like we can count on if it's a certain time of year this is generally the standards and skills were addressing particularly in communities where we have high Mobility this is key if students are transitioning between schools not a president of the principle is critical and the support and coaching of the principal is absolutely critical and one of the things that we have done is we've worked on a principal leadership pool with an Associated scorecard which is basically taking into account the New Mexico principal evaluation process triangulated with the goals and guardrail set forth by the district so we have now a common approach for principal coaching regardless of the area of side of town you're in regardless of the level

[01:21:00]
I'm leaving what elementary middle or high and we have poaching support for our coaches with the idea of it doesn't matter who the principal supervisor is it's a common approach to accountability it's a common approach to principal coaching likewise really working with sharpening the eye of what our principles are seeing as they go into their classrooms to support their teachers with the execution of the use of piping instructional materials in the teaching of grade level standards and if they're not doing using those materials how are we District adopted how are we making sure that the materials they are using are high quality are we making sure that the standards the are teaching are great level and the investment in our principal supervisor assistant superintendents and our principals is something that is Paramount into work right now to really

[01:22:00]
limit the variability and ensure the accountability of the work because it's the voice of the community we're aiming to realize okay thank you I'll go ahead and open it up to the board if we have any additional questions that we need to revisit or you didn't get a chance to ask before we continue know okay awesome thank you so again thank you board members this was very productive and allowing us to have this conversation and I appreciate all of us doing our absolute best to follow the guide and what we've been instructed so now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we have a sad that we have had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them so

[01:23:00]
at this point board president I believe we could entertain a motion great thank you remember facilitating the conversation do we have emotion to accept the report I'll move to accept the progress monitoring reports for goal one in terminal 1.1 and 1.2 seconds is there any additional discussion all right yes yes Crystal Gonzalez and Dr Blakey for that presentation and the motion carried we will move on to agenda item 5.2 which is discussion on board time use evaluation and our presenter for this

[01:24:00]
the item is member Benavides thank you madam president and I don't know if we're going to be able to get the spreadsheet that I provided up on the screen oh okay wonderful look at this magic you guys are amazing thank you okay so I did a brief summary that I will go through really quickly but before I do that I want to give my heartfelt thanks to every board member because in the last two weeks I've had meaningful discussions with each one individually and it renewed my enthusiasm for this work and it also informed the way I approached the specific task so I want to thank you all on the bottom of my heart you've been very helpful okay so for July we had three meetings regular audit and finance and I told 144 minutes 16.2 minutes were determined to be student outcomes focused specifically goal setting and monitoring so in total for July 1444 minutes for the month

[01:25:00]
16.2 student outcomes Focus minutes 1278 other minutes which means 11% of our time in July was focused on student outcomes very low in August we have three meetings regular audit and finance and one Community engagement event the state of the district for a total of 424 total minutes 75.81 minutes for determined to be student outcomes focused specifically monitoring of gold 3 and interim goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 in total 424 minutes we had 424 minutes for the month 75.81 student outcomes Focus minutes 348.19 other minutes meaning 18% of our time in August was focused on student outcomes in September we have five meetings to regular one audit One Finance and a policy meeting for a total of 300 and 355.668 total minute none of which were determined

[01:26:00]
need to be focused on student outcomes however oh no this is not true so I was going to say we would have earned some if the progress monitoring reports for guardrail hadn't been placed on the consent agenda I've since learned that we do not count that toward our time so our quarterly totals are $468.68 total minutes for the corridor 92.01 of which were focused on student outcomes 376.67 were determined to be other meaning a total of 20% of our time for the quarter was focused on student outcomes now how does this compare to the last quarter it was $676 total minutes 20064 which were focused on student outcomes 412 word determined to be other and 39% of our time in the last quarter was focused on student outcomes so according to my measurements and methodology we did decrease by a pretty large amount 20% Discord

[01:27:00]
39% last quarter but you know we can always do better and I stand for any questions you all might have great thank you remember this for the presentation and more importantly for the work and I've also want to thank board services staff for tracking the time as well in our minutes making it easier for us to go back and review are there any questions from the board about this presentation and the data no I mean you sorry you actually answered the question I was going to say what were we in the last quarter and it's incredibly disheartening to see that we are at 20% that we had a 50% decrease in our discussions of students focused governance I guess not to put you on the spot remember benevita

[01:28:00]
just anybody from your analysis of this data what was the biggest contributor to not maintaining our 3940 percent well if we don't if it's on the agenda it's not counted if we're not doing it so if we are not setting goals and monitoring the goals then it's not focused on student outcomes and so it's a very narrow I guess definition of what we can count and I know it's designed that way but I think that it can be refrained in a way to say that yes it's 20% this quarter and it seems very low but we spent 80% of our time doing things that might not be directly related to student outcomes but are in directly related and so we're still working and I think that's good but

[01:29:00]
you know if it's not on the agenda if it doesn't come up in the schedule we can't do we can't make it up and we can't just put I mean if anybody else has any input I'd love to hear it but well like are you like referencing we had the state of the district address right obviously very important for community outreach and but counts towards our minutes but doesn't count towards our student exactly I don't have to just what member benefits was saying is what we really do count is the progress monitoring right that is our conversation on student outcomes so for most of the meetings I think we only had one in August that was actually progress monitoring so if there's not a goal that we're monitoring then we're not focused on student outcomes and that's just the way that it's framed so that's it's just a conversation that we need to have on if we want to put more progress monitoring on the agenda or if there's something else that we want to consider talking to the coaches about putting implementing in our time use because one of the

[01:30:00]
so yeah so I do think the other way of looking at it is not adding more progress monitoring to our calendar but it's removing more of the other and so what I'm seeing from this particularly in the month of September we're a lot of minutes certainly in a lot of meetings but not a lot of student outcomes and I think that's where we can hold ourselves responsible for our commitment to students and making sure that we are putting on our agendas and what we are having public meetings about is student outcomes and not the other stuff which I think is why we've established at Hawk committees and other means of doing some of that other work outside of public meetings so we're not using public resources which actually leads to my question which was around at Hawk meetings so we did have a conver

[01:31:00]
evaluation about how to count the ad hoc meetings and we haven't been counting them and I know then that Doctor Albright has established a calendar board Services office have established a calendar that is tracking or doing its best to attract the ad hoc meetings and so my understanding is because we are supposed to be tracking them and we're not I think we do need to go back and recalibrate so in reality are score would probably drop more it will it would drop off meetings but I do think we just need to include that to be really transparent and so just in the interest of continuous Improvement and learning and technology that we're all learning through this just would know that we we will and we can go back and calibrate on that training and so with secretary being responsible for the time use just asking that you connect with the coaches around them and we just figure out whether we

[01:32:00]
I need to tweak our well yeah take those with the the tool like we're missing it in the tool but also just the train maybe tweak the training for the tool that I think that's the other thing both yeah are there other questions I have a I have a question too in relation to what we're discussing here it makes me even go back to like the finance committee meeting that we have because I feel like the finance team is Apodaca and her team have been really intentional about aligning it to a goal and how how we are just in the budget to that and it's like how do we it would be awesome to get credit knowing that they've been made some adjustments to our budget and the presentation and what we're focusing on and I don't know if we could look at that in the future to get credit even though I know our finances are not long know I can definitely bring that up when I talk to the coaches okay

[01:33:00]
are there other questions number Jackson go ahead and pick up the floor thank you I think you make a good point member Tapia Romero is that specifically around the finance they've made a very intentional choice to make alignment to be efficient to bring things to the board that need to come to the board and so I went on when I kind of look at this I see you know like in September the finance meeting was 23 minutes right it was efficient it was on point we got in we got out because first of all it's required but we're doing business but it's aligned and then we have a policy meeting that's 182 minutes right and so I think oh and then a regular board meeting that's 95 minutes so like where can we as a board really focus on those meetings that are that are like our responsibility within our Realm

[01:34:00]
aptitude where can we really look at focusing so that when we're doing our business in public were being efficient and we're staying on task to what our goals and our guardrails are so it's just a comment because you know Mesopotamia I think you're there you are okay you guys have done a really good job about it we're aligned we're efficient somewhere else I do have one question I would we measure budget alignment with the goals how would we evaluate that so you'll know based on a student outcome and I'm looking at myself so you'll notice two on the presentation they started to attach like this is attached to go one goal to and from what I'm saying the majority of everything we're discussing now

[01:35:00]
disbursements and they're not attached to a goal but you're seeing the majority of the gender now she has included that with it and I don't know if we do a percentage based on like if we have 15 items and 10 out of the 15 have a goal attached were able to count that amount of time I don't know I understand what you're saying and I think it's very useful to have that information but there's no way to test it and so the way we I mean when we're monitoring we get that information from test scores from students we know that the interventions that we are providing are working or not working based on what the scores are and I don't think that there's really a way to do that with the budget and also further I think it if we were to find a way to do that then would we reduce the budget and that area because it's not performing I mean I understand I just don't know how we would test it I know that it's related but how can we

[01:36:00]
I think that we can revisit the other thing is we do have our Border guard rails on where we have committed to spend 50% of our time and so the other piece is around how we're evaluating our board guard rails and opportunity to have this conversation in light of that also which would type back to the sog framework too but it's just not directly pulled out so I think we could just figure out how we have that conversation other questions

[01:37:00]
superintendent Blakey brought this up earlier when we were talking about the belonging piece and that it is not really identified within s o f g but there are those needs when it comes to our kids whether we're looking at behaviors or some of these issues that are not really looked upon under this framework but how do we identify even if we're looking at adult behaviors how do we all do you use that belonging and that framework whether it's asking the coaches because it's one of the parallels that have to sort of work together but it's not because we're not identifying that so when you brought that up I was like yes that is another point that we're not addressing but it should be because of the work that has to initiate the whole child and so I'm just throwing that out there like what what can we do

[01:38:00]
1088 some of these relationship building areas the the framework of looking at even culture it's so some of these areas that really are concerning but they're not look upon within this framework I'm just throwing that out there I don't know if Dr Blake he wants to respond but I will say that we're not measuring belonging in the context of this framework however the district in the context of their strategic plan has a whole pillar around engagements and so that's the work is happening and certainly in the context of the Panorama is well we are only getting reports around perseverance self-regulation self-management and social awareness but they are collecting the data on belongings and it is all so on sapper by student group so just because we are not tracking it because it's not a student outcome doesn't mean it's not happening

[01:39:00]
I understand that but I think also based on our little quote down here when we're looking at adult behaviors it's also asking the question how is that measured when we're we're also looking at student outcome Focus governance and if it's it's also a question how our behaviors measured children and adults I'm just so I mean I think the answer is that that's why the first training is around adults and I am the Genesis of change and so that's why we have our guard rails for ourselves so we can certainly have conversation about that in the context of the self-evaluation I think in the context of our training conversation but is it really is to time you use I want to see if there are any other questions around the presentation or if we can proceed to the next agenda item enough to say no I can

[01:40:00]
just thank you for the question so an interim guardrail 5 point I think it's 5.1 5.1 5.2 and 5.3 we're looking though in those guardrails were specifically looking at staff and surveys that give us on our creating like a an efficacy culture for stuff because organizational culture School culture that's kind of the foundation the driver for a lot of these initiatives to even be successful is looking a step out of how the organizational culture is functioning or not functioning for both the adults and the children and in January we are going to which is I was going to tell you later but I'll tell you now in January we were actually going to start presenting our strategic

[01:41:00]
initiatives as board agenda items so that you all can hear some more specific initiatives connected to the Strategic plan that the team is working on that's not as embedded in the progress monitoring but is a little bit of a step up to see how we are moving on the Strategic plan that encompasses some more of the things that you were talking about and just as a finer point I think if I can try to summarize I think part of what to remember don't worry so is saying it's not just the belonging culture of APs staff but of our board as well and how are addressing that and I think that will come in the subsequent agenda items okay so thank you member of this again for that work and for that presentation and just want to know for the purpose of the meetings as an action item that secretary historical will be working with our Council of great City Schools coaches to calibrate

[01:42:00]
recalibrate and adjust our stuff okay so we will move on now option of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation for the year for year to quarter 4 so as we all know student outcomes focused governance is a framework designed to drive this boards ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes this is the process of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing behaviors with those most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes board members have been asked to individually complete the south of evaluation form for our board actions from the last quarter

[01:43:00]
board members have any questions about the process on time so the question was whether all members turn them in on time and six tournament on time one did not remember a story I just added herself with an apology but we all turned them in find Grace thank you for your personal responsibility there so are there any other questions about the process okay thank you then so I'll review the results for each of the six competencies of the sosg South evaluation

[01:44:00]
I'm doing so I'll share our Collective scores for each competency and then we'll pause for questions or comments before proceeding on to the next competency at the end of the review we will have a brief conversation about what we feel is possible for a goal for our next quarter we did receive scores from all seven board members the totals range from 42 to 69 across each competency again there were six there was not one of the six competencies were all seven board members agreed so we will go through each of the six competencies we disagreed but we're not that far off and we will begin with vision and goals so on Vision in goals two members rated us is having achieved a 25 and I'm just trying to get to my framework before I continue let me just scroll down okay two members rated us is having achieved a 25 which is meeting student outcomes Focus governance

[01:45:00]
five members rated us as having achieved a 35 so we're either a 25 or 35 on that one with the majority rating of 35 so let's go ahead and turn to the framework and discuss and so if you would like to argue since the majority think we're at a 35 if you would like to argue or make a case that we're at 25 can you just share whatever evidence you have to support your position I can start I put 25 but can be a 35 if the staff feels that they have roughly 80% authority over the internal that they're measuring so it didn't seem like it was a question for us it was more of a question for the staff so I just wanted to make sure that we all felt like it could be a 35 so I agree with the majority since that seems like everybody's on board with that can you just real quick where in the framework is the 80% on the blue gotcha okay thank you

[01:46:00]
so do the superintendent would you like to respond to that thank you board members for I do feel that we have control over the interims because we just changed them with the transition of superintendent and I felt like the board was very supportive of accepting the ones that we brought forward without really question over like trusting us with what the new instruments were based on the transition thank you so anyone else thinks is everyone okay with a 3518 as to why we could be 25 I already did a 2 5 0

[01:47:00]
did we do we feel like the last paragraph under mastering student outcomes Focus I have two questions in this blue column the board relied on root cause analysis and for me the big question was comprehensive student needs assessment and are similar research-based tool to inform identification prioritization did we I mean did we did that I was before we did our engagement events we had a script that has said I can't remember their was the analysis done of the data and then separately to that there was a root cause analysis that was done under superintendent Elders leadership that was completed so I don't have the

[01:48:00]
shells on the dates for the time of the contents but I do know that it was done yeah 2223 okay and maybe I don't know if you have any more contacts on that since you were also around century ago I know okay so then it was completed so one more question then the first paragraph the board used a process that included students parents period

[01:49:00]
students can they express ownership of the adopted goals and and I'm asking that very honestly remember Jackson so I can confidently say yes I do believe that that the community can express ownership in the adopted goals because of the extensive Community conversations and community outreach that we did in 2022 to determine what the goals would actually be the way I read this paragraph is the determination of the goals was the I mean how many did we have 688 the community conversations where we accepted the data I believe I actually were about to do a presentation in a couple weeks there were over 25 individuals

[01:50:00]
we went out to we had the community outreach events where individual board members would go out to community organizations to determine what what they thought our students needed to to know you know when they graduated so I would feel very confident that that two months three-month process that we went through prior to the current board members being here was the development of the adopted goals and I I see all of that I mean I agree with everything you just listed but is are they at a point where can they express ownership of those adopted goals because we did have those conversations and then we met as a board with our coach and synthesize

[01:51:00]
so I just want to know that five members did think we met that so we have to make a case that we didn't and I want to turn it to member benavidez who wanted to make a comment or question in response I think that's a really great question board member Dominguez and I think that I want to say yes I don't have as much experience as you do and I want to say yes but I want to say yes with evidence is recent as this evening wherein we had two maybe more students who spoke at public comment specific to ethnic studies and then they base it on this is going to help with gold for that's ownership that's advocacy and so I think that that's really important and that that that's one one example but it really does make the case for a certain part of the population taking ownership of the goals and that's critical what you just said a certain part of the population I wouldn't feel much better if we had high schoolers here expressing the same thing

[01:52:00]
across the district and and I mean it speaks it speaks to so the people I speak to are tribal leaders and Advocates tribal Advocates indigenous organization Advocates so it's it's a different population and I think there's just more room for helping them understand there's certainly room for improvement and I do think that'll come through later in the evaluation where we talked about conducting training to engage the community I also want to know that the criteria is about process not outcome so did we use a process did it actually lead to express ownership we have some signs of yes and I can say

[01:53:00]
play from what I've heard from my community and folks I've spoken to as well I think yes but certainly there is more work to do but I think just revisiting this did we use a process that includes students parents staff and community members I think the answer is yes okay so are we in agreement on a 35 okay so I agreed upon score for vision and values for this quarter is 35 for values and guardrails two members rated us as having achieved a five which is approaching two members rated us at 8:10 which is meeting and three members rated us as a 150 somewhere between approaching so let's just discuss including if you want okay please including evidence of what you have to support your

[01:54:00]
musician so why don't we start with the approaching column two members are you just there so we can go through the board has adopted in collaboration with the superintendent guardrails based on the communities values each guardrail describes a single operational action or class of actions the board adopted no fewer than yes that's yes the board adopted no fewer than one and no more than five guard rails yes the superintendent has adopted and collaboration with the board one to three interim Garden rails for each guardrail and each interim is smart that's a yes the status of each General is able to be updated multiple times during each school year that's a yes and the board publicly posted them for public comment prior to adoption that is all so yes any disagreement there okay so then moving into green meeting so we have to meet all of what we just discussed

[01:55:00]
and the superintendent has provided interim guardrail ending points for each year leading up to the ending date that's yes any questions about that all internet guardrails pertain to outputs or outcomes not inputs any questions about that was recently address thank you the board included students parents staff and community members in the guardrail development process that's all so yes any questions about that the board has considered adoption of one or more theories of action we discuss this in our last meeting we agreed that yes that's what's the Strategic plan any questions I don't have the notes that I sent to you just remind me remind me all board guard rails last from 3:55

[01:56:00]
line sight did do we have interims for every question she wants to know duration of interim guardrails do we have those listed for four and five the guardrails do not have the interims for guardrail 4 and 5 because those are new guard rails so the base hasn't been determined until we put the survey out shortly so then we don't meet that is that correct which I'm sorry the fourth one one two three four five rails with you now

[01:57:00]
so the question is do we need all board guardrails last last from 3 to 5 years do all interim guardrails last from 1 to 3 years that's what your your questioning and we do have that they last from 1 to 3 years we just don't have the X defined because we haven't done the first survey go with that information that last three to five years olds so interim guardrails of 4 and 5 we have the we have it listed as X right now to why but it does have from the year but we just

[01:58:00]
are completing the survey now to then but it didn't but we do have that it goes until all right so I think we're good any other questions on that one or comments rather okay next the guardrails interim guard rails and theories of action will challenge the organization and require change in adult behaviors any questions comments or concern about that one so then we are in agreement that we meet at least 10:00 so we'll move on to mastering so meeting all of the Pryor Stuff Plus the board used to process that included students parents staff and community members in a way that leads them to express ownership of the adopted guard rails and theories of action again this is process or do people feel that's a yes yes yes yes yes okay all of the interim cards are predictive of their respective guardrails and our influenceable by the superintendent and the

[01:59:00]
is measuring so we did have a conversation around predictability and influence when we adopted or when we considered the guardrails so and superintendent do you feel you have authority overly 80% of what the guardrail is measuring yes so we had changed if you recall we met with s o f g coaches and we changed some of the insurance that were originally proposed because we didn't have the authority over the interim so we changed some of them may I ask another question and so you're also confident that there's evidence of correlation between the interim guard rail and the guard rail

[02:00:00]
yes okay all right any other questions about that criteria all right to the last one in addition to the guardrails on the superintendent's Authority the board has adopted one to five guardrails on its own behavior and evaluates itself against them at least quarterly other people feel about that yes I think you know that it's an interesting question right and I think that we kind of that's that's what we're doing like right now but also what we did in the last conversation with the time you used to evaluation you know when I look at one of our guard rails being do we actually spend not less than 50% of our

[02:01:00]
I'm monitoring that's our board guard rail to we actually did just have a discussion about that where we kind of did maybe a self-reliant self-reflection on maybe we need to be a little bit more efficient on on our time use so can we maybe use this quarterly self-evaluation in a little bit more expansive where we specifically addressed the guardrails are owned by guardrails possibly and that's a discussion maybe we can have but I did I did a 15 because I think we do we do have the opportunity to evaluate ourselves at least quarterly maybe we just don't take that opportunity as often as when it's presented to us so I think that makes sense and I'll say the reason that I rated us as doing this is because we are treating the board guard rails as

[02:02:00]
so when I believe a board member has violated so I'm constantly trying I think when I believe that there's been a question or violation of the guardrails I do have a conversation with the board member and similarly staff have come to me with concerns about violation and I have the conversation with the staff with the board member and other board members have come raising concerns about whether we are violating those policies as well so I think it's in the context of holding ourselves accountable for not violating policy more so than monitoring our guard rails and so because there are a lot of conversations about that that's why I rated us as a yes however or and I would like to put it to the board to see I think that was a tongue and cheek question around is there another form

[02:03:00]
for that but I do want to open it to the board is this something that you do want to develop a process around a form around and we can certainly get coaching and do that so that's to the whole board I think the question there is evaluate so how do we do that so do you want that's what I'm asking do you want to create a process or do we add it to our board to this evaluation and when you say attitude evaluation let's not create one more form let's let's like integrated into something that's just speaking off the top of my head period

[02:04:00]
from my perspective that's how we are evaluating and tracking I am seeing some interest in wanting to further evaluate the guardrails but not creating a new tool so I just want to make sure that we're responsive to that I think it's addressed in the different monitoring and accountability and in unity and trust those are maybe not specifically addressed but it's implied and I think that were doing it with without knowing we're doing it if that makes it right right Define you know if it's not out in the open and easy for us to see it might be better if we do create a process but we have so many processes so I personally escorted a 15 because I do feel like we already have these tools in place to monitor our own behavior

[02:05:00]
we're doing one now we just completed one I don't feel like we have to add more to what we already have and these have already be different if we were already scoring off the charts on the others but there's still a lot of improvement that we need to make for ourselves so that's why I was confident and being able to give us the points for that area remember Jackson no I think you guys you make a lot of really good points and first of all can I just say you have a really hard job and I really appreciate what you do so I just want to tell you that when I when I look at what we do you know day in and day out I think that that is a really good point and remember benavidez I agree with you you know you just did a time you said evaluation that was literally an evaluation of guardrail too right and then we we

[02:06:00]
no guardrail one you know we will not act on assumptions about each other's attentions and will accept responsibility for our own actions not calling you out but you literally just did that and so I I think maybe this is a it's a lived process instead of a written process because I don't want another process either so I mean I really appreciate it really appreciate the conversation I feel I did raise us to 15 but I feel even more confident about that rating so so I'd like to propose that we accept accept a 15 as it seems that's the consensus of the board and if there are additional suggestions for ways that we can monitor our own behavior and evaluated against our guardrails at least quarterly I am certainly open to those suggestions and would welcome

[02:07:00]
the door is open if there are ways including how we might integrated into this evaluation and so is everyone comfortable with a 15 okay we'll move on to monitoring and accountability so for monitoring and accountability one member rated us as a zero and six members rated as a 10 so we're somewhere between not student outcomes focused and approaching with again the majority of 10 so let's just discuss and if you would like to disagree with 10 please provide your evidence maybe it was a 1000

[02:08:00]
is everyone comfortable with a 10 me I say why I was not yes absolutely good and this is not a commentary on anything it's just a process that I don't know was followed so for let me make sure we're on the same we're on community and collaboration correct we're on monitoring accountability oh okay monitoring an accountability let's see the board is not student outcomes focus of any of the following are true it's a superintendent email has not taken place and won't until next year and so what am I misunderstanding about that we have the process in place and we've passed the policy the superintendent just hasn't been in the role for a year okay so and I think in reference back this was that was the conversation we had on the last one because that was where I scored us differently and exactly what you said there and I think it was determined by our coach because we have everything in place

[02:09:00]
superintendent performance to be indistinguishable from school system all right so we will do a 10:00 for monitoring and accountability and move on to communication and collaboration so for this one one member rated us as a 04 members rated us as a one and two members rated us as a five so we're somewhere between 0 not student outcomes focused and a 5 meeting student outcomes Focus so let's just discuss again no that the majority rated us as one which is approaching so let's start with approaching as our foundation for those who thought that we are a five if you could make your case with supporting evidence that we're meeting all of the criteria in the green column

[02:10:00]
but with this quarter we got bumped the way I evaluated it we got bumped down to a one because we did have a board meeting that lasted more than three hours aboard authorized meeting that lasted more than three hours so that one paragraph alone bumped up from my evaluation to a one that seems like some compelling evidence is everyone okay with one's good with one so I agreed upon score for communications and collaboration for this quarter is one now I'm moving on to Unity and Trust two members rated us as a one four members rated us as a three one member couldn't

[02:11:00]
play between 1 and 3 so we are approaching approaching and meeting so either the one or the three the orangish yellow or the green let's go ahead and discuss including what evidence you have to support your position so should we look at the green column to the board has included language and its

[02:12:00]
is there anyone who would like to provide evidence that we are not in three if not are you comfortable putting those will be our number one scorer for Unity and Trust for this quarter is three minutes individually board members have rated us as having achieved one number is rated

[02:13:00]
1 to the majority consensus is a one which we are approaching student outcomes focus and let's discuss including what evidence you might have for not being in the approaching or one point comma is a one this gives us a total of 655

[02:14:00]
we have not been able to accomplish everything under the one the second paragraph under the 1-point column says that we tracked the estimated annual cost of Staff time we don't do that yet but yes we do we do so the board office staff and the administration overall have been provided training on tracking their stuff time so they are doing that in fact I just got the first report today around the first month time use and I'm happy to share that in a moment so we have the statues time for the month of September and the process in place to track for the rest of the year so the training has been done and it's in process and we according to our coach get the points because we have the process in place

[02:15:00]
and we are tracking the annual cost even though we don't have that number yet for the year so for what it's worth I'll share to do for the month of September the cost of Staff time is around $60,000 58,293 spent preparing for board meetings attending board meetings debriefing board meetings and other which includes which includes any other requests related to governance and supporting the board so we will continue to track this over time including by categories so acknowledging that what we can control really is that other and so now that we have data for September will be able to look again October of 2044 versus September of 25 for example which would matter more for comparative sake

[02:16:00]
so I'm sorry I didn't write down the number 65 655 increase 65 okay so this gives us a total of 65 for the last quarter now we need to set our goal for the next quarter so I'd like to hear from members of the board what you believe is possible by our next self-evaluation in the next quarter who will share their thoughts first 69 potential 69 so that's gaining 4.0 anyone else because last time we said our goal is 73 I think 78 yeah well I think like when I look at monitoring accountability that's where we can make a huge jump we can make a 10-point jump simply by having investing no less than 25% of our

[02:17:00]
total board authorized public meeting minutes monitoring the goals and we were already at 39% we dropped down to to 20 so like we could get back up to that 25% I think we could make that that 10 points cuz I think that was really the only thing that was keeping for me no we're never going to get there cuz we've got to do the evaluation never mind but we could still aim for 25% yes at least so we can pick up four points I heard someone to my right say somewhere on what happened on the 4th one from one to five which is on communication and collaboration yes and that's where we dropped last time because of the 3 hour

[02:18:00]
what are we going to mess up today while we're at 2 hours and 20 minutes we're not going to mess up today ok

[02:19:00]
so for communication and collaboration I did scores to zero and this is why and please feel free to clarify for me we're not student outcomes focused if the board did not receive the final version of materials to be voted on at least three calendar days before the board authorized public meeting during which the materials would be considered now I am referring to the September 4th meeting where in student outcomes focused legislative priority was added to our previously published legislative priorities and that may not make a difference I just need to know from my own understanding if there's an exception for for that or if that does fall within something that was that we were asked to vote on that was not the final version was it was not included in the final version 3 days before the meeting yeah so

[02:20:00]
so this is related to the nmsba resolutions and this is also related to a opinion that we've sought from our council with respect specifically to the open meetings act so we do have the response on that which was shared out with the board in the last at a glands that still leaves the question of whether according to this we had the materials at least three calendar days in advance and so I would say yes which is why I read it as a yes because we have all of we have the materials in advance and we have discussions and amendments within the board meeting around specific support items so I did not have a concern about this but I want to have other board members provide evidence and feedback reactions to board member benefits is question here as well I'm going in that I have the same same concerns same observation

[02:21:00]
we didn't have a chance to to look at that last minute resolution and so we weren't prepared and unfortunately we we didn't know what was going on and so there was a silence we tabled something we shouldn't have tabled but there's confusion because of that last minute Edition which was specifically a support items so I guess the question here is does that support item count as final version of materials to be voted on so would any other like to speak to this one any other board members sorry you have concerned the

[02:22:00]
of not having that material 3 calendar days prior and initially asking the questions of how did that particular documents not only got on the diet but there was no change in agenda there was also no mention of it in our approval of our minutes and so there were many things that were left unsaid and even though we were trying to address the question at the time that also is not addressed show on it was one area that I thought you know it's a concern and so I'm just throwing it out there and I do agree that we did not follow that process any other members want to speak to us

[02:23:00]
I mean I will I will see I am confident with the legal explanation that we had regarding the the document that it's a support document given the fact that it was approval of resolutions submitted to the New Mexico School Board Association that it was a support document that was added and so I mean I rated as a question because I'm but you know you know me I'm always going to fall back on the legal opinion and I'm confident about what the legal opinions said yeah I think the question I mean I think about this there are always going to be cases in which stuff is put in front of us after we've received the materials that have been posted online that happened in the last progress monitoring meeting because they were

[02:24:00]
edits to what the what was presented and so I think the question is how are we interpreting materials because if we say that it is not allowed to provide additional materials within 3 days of the meeting I think then we are providing an unnecessary constraints on the district frankly the administration to be able to give us accurate information and I think that's what happened with with that one and so just acknowledging that there's the issue of the agenda is being posted there's the issue of support materials but there's also the issue of like stuff needs to get updated sometimes between when we receive the materials and when we have the actual dialogue and so how hard and fast do we want to be on that is it at any time that happens and we're going back to a 0 well I think it also goes back into

[02:25:00]
behaviors you know we're going to work if it's also questioning 3 days before the board authorized public meeting you know if it was an authorized public meeting and then all of a sudden another documents inserted and you have to question whether or not our agenda was already out there prior to or having the meeting but then all of a sudden we have a new initial resolution that's trying to be thrown in sorry when you say you have to question whether or not our agenda was out there before can you just play with that means that we already had a preset agenda and we've already acknowledged that we did the due dates we got it in we approved it we all reviewed it prior to we get here so we're we're we're recognizing we have an agenda and we're ready to go for it but then all of a sudden it's switching changes if it's to add a supported document in

[02:26:00]
I think that also needs to be clarified in some way or another especially if we're looking at meeting these goals right so I guess my question is the switch and change right like I'm comfortable with us moving to a zero I just want to hear from the full board again the legal interpretation is that this wasn't a switch and change or nothing was provided out of line or against MMA so and it is common that we will get amended materials after we've already received our final material so that happens quite frequently and so I'm asking is that how tight we want to hold to this in terms of the interpretation of final materials is it every single thing that we're going to consider if that's the case anytime we get a new updated support document material interpretation

[02:27:00]
materials being the agenda and the support documents received in advance and so again this is open to discussion and I'm going to turn to member Astoria to speak to this and then I do think we've heard from after that everyone except for remember tap your marrow so I will turn to you next after remember story so I do not want to put us as a zero I feel confident and stay out of one and I do understand being given documents the day of we got one today for executive session so I don't want to put too much restrictions on that but I will say I do have concern because that day I was on Zoom so I had no idea what was happening so I would like to put a clause that we at least get materials that are added for what did we say so whatever at least an hour before so we have time to look at it I feel like something like that would be good just so we're

[02:28:00]
I had no idea what's happening so I stayed silent too that meeting and then we ended up tabling something so I want to stay out of one because I do feel like we do me all of these things and this was a learning opportunity for all of us to figure out what our limits are on that but I would want to say just for the board itself but maybe we can ask staff to give us some time before the board meeting if there's additional items to be added thank you remember well and I think it to add I'm comfortable at the one too because I understood I understand too that things have evolved with some of our items and the example I was going to use for tonight is our time you see evaluation what was sent to us was the report but we didn't have the final scores just yet until it was presented to us tonight so if we're looking at that there's going to be a lot of other things we're going to have to consider what do you mean you didn't have them until you saw so the report I have just

[02:29:00]
it has the the form but it didn't have your numbers that you presented till I saw here I didn't see it in my packet oh yeah no I sent it to board Services right right so that's what I'm saying that's an example of the type of thing that comes after which I'm fine with like cuz I understand that there's information we're all seeing at the time of the presentation so I don't believe it's going to be realistic to say that we have to have everything in its entirety at 100% to be able to not get credit for that I think if we have for lack of a better word like the meat and potatoes of it you know and then we add the sides as we move on it does and I appreciate it so all members have had an opportunity to respond to the question on the table by member and so the question is for communication and collaboration are we at a 0 because of the board not receive the final version of materials to be vot

[02:30:00]
at least three calendar days before or are we at 1:00 because we feel we did get the final materials and so we are currently out of one can I just see you maybe hands if any for those who think that we ought to move to a two I'm sorry 0.0 are we going to communication and collaboration so we are currently at 1:00 to a 0. 5 0 9

[02:31:00]
what time I will entertain a motion in consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation so the motion should read or state I move that we accept I hope someone's writing this down or I'll hand it to one of the people next to me I move that we accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 65 points on the student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation instrument is there a motion I move we accept the we accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 65 points on the student outcomes Focus self-evaluation instrument this is member Jackson thank you is there a second this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and a second is there any additional

[02:32:00]
yes if you know Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes are we good at the end of the day is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda which includes items 6.1 through 6. 2 2

[02:33:00]
next on our agenda is action items action item 7.1 is to consider approval of a board of education Retreat for the purpose of understanding the board's role in improving student outcomes and I am the presenters and just scrolling through the consent to get to that all right so as a reminder we had a discussion on September 4th discussing board training opportunities and Retreat we were not able to reach consensus and decided that we needed additional information and so we postponed sorry we tabled that for further information board members were then surveyed for their response to a variety of questions but including mainly what were the issues that we needed to receive training on the staff then compiled the results which were shared out with the full board and analyzed in this document here and then there's also below the bullets around the analysis of the survey responses

[02:34:00]
a response that's proposed by the aps Administration to address some of the board training needs I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to superintendent and Blakey to speak to the proposed plan of action thank you board president Gonzalez So based on the survey there wasn't really a consensus on the we did pull out the ones that we saw or that we have heard board members talking about that they would like more information on which includes budget facilities and operations charter schools and special education we also had a member that expressed a desire to learn more about high quality instructional materials so what we are doing is setting up venues in which we can go over these different topics with interested board members the things that we have planned so far are the community budget discussions so we have two sessions that will be in October one is on the 24th at Bruno and

[02:35:00]
the other is on the 28th at Jimmy Carter Middle School and this will do an overview of the budget information and gather public input on the budget for 2526 and as you know we're trying to do this earlier than giving it to the community after the budget has already been decided the second thing that we are organizing is an infrastructure bus tour that are Deputy superintendent of operations is working on this will be on October 29th and it will be a tour for Community leaders on the board other elected officials we will be visiting a newly rebuilt School the bus depot police Command Center in the career in Richmond Center and talk about how Capital expenditures work we also will be visiting the Food Service Center at that time as well the next one that we are setting up is a charter school meeting and that is set up for November 12th and we'll focus on the board's role

[02:36:00]
in renewing several of the aps charters in a time to answer questions on Charter Schools the other thing I spoke about earlier tonight is starting in January we are going to do updates on our strategic initiatives which will be given by staff to board members to see where we are specifically on our strategic plan and specific initiatives within their we are all in through those conversations you'll hear more specifics with things such as high quality instructional materials and we're also going to work with Miss Riser on organizing training for those interested in special education and if there are any other administrative topics that come up we will be happy to address it we also are going to be setting up small groups to talk about where we are with right sizing and specifically three of you that are new since we updated the right sizing before

[02:37:00]
we want to talk about where we are with it and then do when I was with board members that need to be updated on right sizing and for something fun well those are all fun we also will be hosting Employee of the Month receptions and so right now as you see like the plaques and on the website and the Billboards we recognize employees who are across the district who are nominated by their peers and we were looking for different ways we could do it to make it more meaningful and funds so we're actually going to do it every other month so combine all of the employees of the month and we will do reception for them before the board meeting and so that way you can come and celebrate the staff members during that time as well and so we're setting those up starting in October and you will be able to have some cake and meet some of our great boys

[02:38:00]
thank you Dr Blakey so just want to express appreciation to you and your team for being responsive to the board request for additional training and including cake so that's a win in addition to that we also shared the board survey responses with the Council of great City schools and the Action Memo when prepared indicated that we would be sharing the responses and that they would be providing an update on potential training so we have since received in our inboxes an email from the council great City schools and our coach with a proposed sfg implementation calendar that responds to the gaps in sfg training so specifically noting policy diet committee diet and one-on-one coaching as well as additional conversation and so our board has reached out asking each member to schedule a one-on-one to provide feedback on the sofa implementation calendar once that feedback is provided the great City Schools will update the calendar

[02:39:00]
send it back to the board and we will vote to accept it as part of our implementation goal so with that that is I think the summary here for this agenda item yes I just wanted to make sure because one of the main reasons that I saw a dressed in the survey and in conversations prior is the wanting to have more conversations for the full board and like team building and all of that and since it wasn't provided in this update I do want to say that in the ad hoc Community engagement committees we are working on doing like two-way communication events which includes the board members so even though it wasn't reflected here that is in conversations in the ad hoc Community engagement meeting so we will have some space for people board members to talk to not only ourselves

[02:40:00]
most of the community and I also wanted to say like what we just did with time use evaluation and with the self-evaluation is exactly the purpose why we wanted to retreat to have those kind of conversations and more so it's not gone and we're working on it and I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that thank you yes so definitely continuous improvement process and that changed to the ad hoc in community engagement was included in the consent agenda as well all right yes remember Jackson so Madam president just in an effort because I'm watching the clock right here and I would like to move to approve and accept the board of education training plan as outlined in the Action Memo this is Crystal all second it thank you we have a motion and a second to approve the proposed plan for training as presented in the Action Memo is there any additional discussion

[02:41:00]
question number two on that 101 coaching on the school board governance for any member who requested does it have to be one-on-one can it be more than certainly yes as long as we don't violate Quorum okay because my question what was brought up on September 4th were those crowded lines between local control and Council interceding and some of these responsibilities that one I wanted to quantify where is that line so I'm hoping Within These one-on-one or with more board members will that be addressed because it's concerned for me so I'm just saying that to you right now with these one-on-one conversations will the council provide that information on these guidelines or their initiative on whether or not and with our local control

[02:42:00]
horses their stepping in on certain areas because so I would say the council will be will provide coaching on whatever we ask them to provide coaching to is it relates to student outcomes yeah because I did have a question on the calendar so I'm glad you are addressed that that it can be changed yes and that's the purpose of having one-on-one conversations with each board member so how does that sorry thank you so how does that get disseminated to all board members that information so if you yeah clarifying the roles between Council coaches and local control so that's a topic of conversation to clarify I think any individual board member that requests or needs coaching and from the council

[02:43:00]
if you would like to do your coaching sessions in groups of less than four you are certainly welcome to do so and I think your question is how does everyone receive that how does yeah so how will there be a mechanism for sharing out whatever information we learn from those conversations sharing out to the rest if I'm a propose that if I'm a propose that the board member who does those trainings in order to create a process of learning can write a one-page or maybe and send it out to the board I feel like that would be good not only because we're disseminating information but also you're able to reflect on what you've learned at those trainings and that also provides a way for us to see how we interpreted the training which I think is part of the conversation that we're having having is

[02:44:00]
remember this interpret things differently so that might be a good way to address those concerns certainly there's nothing stopping anyone from summarizing any information they receive or training they receive and sharing it back with the rest of the board in fact I would welcome it so if anyone has any training information or coaching that you want to share you could send to Miss Albright and we'll find a way to make sure that it gets included in the Attic glands one more question yes remember don't worry too can we pick our coach can you pick your coach we have limits in terms of the coaching period so the email did say that there's a Ashley and Chandra and so those are who is available to us yeah that's right I'm out of those three yeah okay thank you any other questions or discussion before we proceed to a vote may I ask a clarifying question yes number top you know so I don't even know what you call them but

[02:45:00]
but you prepared is that going to be we're going to have to track all that stuff usage time or is that not that's going to be tracked so we're going to expect to see an increase cuz as we're using staff to do all of these things okay to do which everything that superintendent Blakely talked about with the so if it's newly created so she for example mentioned the infrastructure tour they were going to be doing that anyway if they're adding a training on charter school one that was going to be happening anyway okay so if we're adding a training on special education that is an addition per request of the board so that will count against our time for staff use Tracking not use of the public meetings time that's a good question all right Dr Albright we are ready for a vote and now let's go yes yes yes Crystal

[02:46:00]
Courtney Jackson yes so that motion carries and that brings us to agenda item 8 which is the president's report so in response to public forum comments although the public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue I do want to acknowledge and state clearly to each speaker who I'm sure it's still listening to know that you were heard and that we're working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that we heard were related to gender identity African-American and ethnic studies recruitment of black teachers students and staff safety and restorative justice in terms of upcoming meetings the Indian education department is hosting two Summits this week on October 3rd the annual fall tribal Summit will be held at burnoff Osceola professional development center from 8:00 to 3:30 on October 4th the 3rd annual Urban indigenous education Summit will be held at professional development center from 8:30 to 2:30 these are both really exciting opportunities to continue to engage with Target

[02:47:00]
what's the population is related to our goal but also to continue goals to continue to learn so please let board Services know if you plan to attend either of these events so we can track for foreign purposes I also want to give a quick look at upcoming board meetings so on October 23rd this is the reschedule of the October 16th meeting we will be monitoring goal to math proficiency and board member Dominguez will be facilitating that discussion so board member Dominguez please go ahead and schedule the training time with our coach and Dr all right will provide the facilitators guy and an additional support there and again acknowledging continuous Improvement We are continuing to adapt so remember top your Romero if you have any feedback on the process and how it worked for you if you could please submit that to me and Dr Albright within the next two weeks we will update the progress monitoring facilitation guide and that goes for anyone who is progress monitor facilitated in the past but now that number has had the opportunity
