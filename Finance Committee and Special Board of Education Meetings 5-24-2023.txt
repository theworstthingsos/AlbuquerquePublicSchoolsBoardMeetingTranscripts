Yolanda Montoya Cordova here they give me another Erica Danielle Gonzales Robert Peterson here in Dominguez here Whitney Jackson our first item for consideration and action is adoption of the May 24th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda and approval of the April 26th 2023 finance committee meeting minutes and before we proceed board member Jackson yeah I just have a slight Amendment to the to the minutes on page 8 the last bullet point just says liability I think that that probably needs to be expanded a little bit cuz I'm not sure the public would know what just liability means so if we can expand it to say liability of the district or the purchase of this alert system or something it just needs to be expanded so if the public

[00:01:00]
please let me know what the heck I was asking okay that's it so I will move to adopt the May 24th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda with the removal of consent from number 4D intro function transfers for Grant budget April 2023 and 4:00 at the bar I had that circle with an amendment to remove 4D and 4 FM from consent agenda and I would also move to approve the April 26th 2023 finance committee meeting minutes as amended and I'll second this is Peggy thank you very much so our next item for consideration and

[00:02:00]
action is consideration for approval of May 24th Finance items on consent agenda minus items for dnf if I could have a motion please I'll move for approval of the May 24th finance committee meeting consent agenda items with the exception of 4D and 4f call Second Place Crystal for consideration is item D which is consideration for approval of intra function transfers for Grand budget for the month of April 20th 23 this is a discussion action item and I'll turn it over to board member Miller going

[00:03:00]
okay and and my apologies Miss Apodaca that I didn't get these in last Tuesday whenever I had to have them in by my best friend passed away and so it's been it's been a very hard week so my apologies so I do I don't know if you did get the questions and if you have the answers to them or not and if you don't have the answers there's not a reason for me to go through them so much question to executive director of curriculum instructions to provide an update on on the okay thank you so I mean Miss normally one of them was it was on I think it's on page 7 of the document

[00:04:00]
on the intro function transfers for Grant Management so my question was just about the grading the 954,000 that was going to grading for equity and so my question was how many schools are participating how many teachers are participating and any results that you have of survey from parents students and teachers that they may have completed in support of the grading for equity and then what if you did do a survey what do the gifted students and their families and teachers think of this type of grading so those are my questions I'm sorry I'm just now seeing these so I'll try to be as thorough and accurate as I can be the initial pilot could could accommodate 100 years with the

[00:05:00]
with the amount of support we have at The District in my department we felt like a hundred teachers was about the most we can accommodate in the initial pilot but we had such a huge response from teachers interested in either learning more participating in book studies or participating in their own small group that what we've done is we've extended we were purchasing books and we'll lead book studies for people who are in that 100 Pilot or also there's an online course that's $150 that we're going to offer up to I think we can offer it up to 150 to take a course and it's $150 per teacher if they want coaching and feedback it's $200 so they can get a coach who will help him through the course and answer questions and so we're offering that to teachers and so that's kind of what everything that 954

[00:06:00]
to participate in in any work study groups that are outside their Duty day and substitutes if there's professional development that's during the duty day okay so the pilot still just includes the 100 and so then after it's like two years correct is it a two-year pilot September of 2024 but we're hoping to be able to continue a second year with just the capacity that we build additionally There's an opportunity for our team to go and visit a School District in California so that's part of this trouble funds would be so that they can go and talk to teachers who have implemented student get student feedback so that's that's in there and then

[00:07:00]
I know it's a pilot did you do a survey and most especially Target those AP you know gifted children and their families and see what they thought we have not done any surveying to the community yet okay just my opinion I think that's important to hear from from everyone so just just my thought there and then the next question that I have I don't know if that's going who that would go to is it's the same on the same page and it was about the summer principal Institute and how many principles were going to be attending and just kind of an idea of where most of the funding to pay for the was going to go to food to the presenters to supplies etcetera so then they used to call it Spike on Spotify

[00:08:00]
call program does is they put on this summer principal Institute I guess there's the spy and icon and I know that they have they have guests presenters they have they buy books so they do not buy food that I know for sure because you can't buy food with title to but I have not seen the breakdown of the budget I know that their budget for Spike on in the past has been about 60,000 dollars I believe that this year it's coming out of Esther's and that's that's why I haven't seen the breakdown of the budget for Spike on okay if you I mean if you could just give me whenever you get a chance if you can just get that kind of a breakdown of where you know where that was going on that would be that would be helpful okay and then I think it was on page 9 of the documents I think it was about it was about

[00:09:00]
financial literacy class budgeting for financial literacy class that will be offered for a Title 1 McKinney vento fsp families twice a week so do you have an idea of how many staff are going to be required to teach that class and how many families are expected I don't know if you have the questions there so I don't have to read them to you I do have the questions that is funded out of title one and I don't oversee Title One I apologize so I have no information on that course but I will forward it to you as soon as I get it okay and then I understood that like shine was not going to be used anymore so that you were going to be using something something else a different program so and then my last question is on the bar

[00:10:00]
the 2.972 million is that going to have to be spent on this fiscal year so its approval of the statement of budget adjustment increase of 2.9 Million my name is Brian Allison capital budget supervisor and I'm sorry can you repeat your question for me the bar for 2991 dollars is that going to that money going to have to be spent this fiscal year and what is it going to be spent on okay no it does not have to be spent this fiscal year and what it is as part of the sb99

[00:11:00]
use this to supplement ongoing projects within SB 9 those various capital projects I would they go to various capital projects on going in SB 9 at this time right I just was wondering if it was going to have to be spent this fiscal year cuz that's coming up quickly absolutely I appreciate it no it it does not we do typically do a great job of of doing what we can but at the time of this it's not expected to be in it will not be okay thank you so much I appreciate it if you have any other questions

[00:12:00]
at the beginning of the year I think they really had some questions about what is this going to look like a special for seniors there is concern about you know what is this going to mean for this the best graduating and at the end of the year now I will say there was one senior said it just made me check out and we kind of said okay you're seeing you and your second semester of school do you think grading for Equity was the only reason you're feeling shut Downs

[00:13:00]
students who are struggling a bit but some of them are students who were excelling thank you for remember Peterson I think that one thing we hope also is that it gives students agency in their in their grading and how those grades are reporting after after 12 years of working for grade working for learning is a shift in Outlook but it did seem like it was encouraging them to make that shift and encouraging teachers to focus on that so I can I'm optimistic about how it's going to go awesome thank you just on Foundation I think everybody already knows what I think and I think we should have the data and I've been asking that

[00:14:00]
for all the over 8 years I've been on the board still haven't you know still haven't got it yet but what has been spent or is being spent on foundations do you have an idea I don't have exact numbers part of the the expense is not just the kids themselves but the professional development and what we're finding is from teacher feedback and I will get you some if nothing else I'll get you some qualitative data from teachers on how they responding to the professional development around using the foundation's materials in their classrooms and it changes they're seeing in the phonics acquisition for early literacy so I don't have exact numbers I believe in the first year between kids and professional development it was probably close to $250,000 maybe more this year was probably a little bit more not as much as

[00:15:00]
was budgeted unfortunately because we budget for to max out all of our professional development opportunities so 3025 to 30 teachers per session and we don't always get 25 to 30 so the there's it hasn't been as much as we budgeted but it's still been it's been significant I just like to see some data I mean I know that it was around when I was teaching so I'm sure there has to be some some data out there and if it's good then you know I'd be like you keep doing that thank you thank you so I'm asking for emotions I don't have to have an answer tonight but I think it's something for us to consider as we look at the amount of letters training the teachers have done and as we look at a new email address still be inappropriate thing and how much should we invest up front

[00:16:00]
now if if it's going to be transitioned to replaced with with another approach and so that's that can be a parking lot issue that we should need to be thinking about if I remember Dominguez well and I don't know anything about foundations or letters but it seems to me that with a student outcomes Focus governance that is where we're headed what are the strategies and what are effective strategies and it seems to me that we've had some strategies in place for a very very long time and it's time to for those strategies to be worried and time for the data to come before us to make judgments about whether or not the district is investing

[00:17:00]
wisely and so yes I'll just leave it at that but those questions are important and the time is now thank you so I will go ahead and ask for a motion to approve items dnf I'll move for approval of interruption transfers for Grant budget for the month of April 2023 and do you want me to do both of statement of budget adjustment increase the bar of 2 million 972,301 I'm going to go okay so I'll do consideration transfers for the grant budget for the month of April 2023 we have a second

[00:18:00]
no just because I just don't have all the information but thank you Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes yes with reservations for the reasons that the board member Miller had gone just stated Courtney Jackson yes Crystal asked for a motion for item es consideration for approval of statement budget adjustment increase of 2,972,312,972.31

[00:19:00]
item for consideration and action is item VA consideration for approval of the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 2024 included including Charter School budgets this is a discussion action item and we have Miss Rosalinda Montoya our executive director of budget and strategic planning you have the floor thank you for president and superintendent Elder thank you for this opportunity to present to you the ATMs fiscal year 2024 budget I want to thank you and the rest of the budget staff for their hard work compiling this complex budget additionally thank you to superintendent

[00:20:00]
for his leadership and thank you to the board or providing us guidance and feedback on our previous monthly presentations was very helpful in putting this presentation together the budget team and I and extended team are all here to share with you the budget that we have put together the focuses on four goals and I'm going to give it over to this morning thank you madam chair board members super so in this presentation we will review are you around process or FY 2424 budget process and timeline or enrollment decline scg funding from fy14 through FY 24

[00:21:00]
FY 2324 seg 910 ft B5 comparison FY 24 revenue and expenditures without our reserve and FY 24 revenue and expenditures with the reserve or FY 23 initial on our way 23 adjusted budget versus 2410 where the increases are in our expenditures the amount of budget spent directly on board goals examples of Gould related programs APS Charter School enrollment in sccg comparison and the Albuquerque Public Schools 2023 2024 budget resolution next and this is our own budget and may is the month of approvals next

[00:22:00]
NR planning process timeline we have uploaded or operational or Grant and capital budgets into Lawson which is our financial system and we are formatting the data to upload into Peds operating budget management system which I'll be referring to as OBS we had our ERS student based budgeting project kickoff meeting as well as meetings with cabinet members and other stakeholders yesterday today and some more tomorrow and we are presenting our proposed budget tonight for board approval once we receive that approval we will post those budgets into open can begin the review of our budget to ensure that we have included all the legislative items in our budget and this review process usually takes a full month

[00:23:00]
disapproval or budget is posted so that the budget is ready to use on July 1203 next so we've seen this a few times in our prior presentations but I just want to continue to show the decrease in our enrollment because I feel that it's important since the state funds us on enrollment so are funded enrollment is based on prior year average of 80 and 120 days student accounts and for every student in declined enrollment aps's Financial loss is around 11,000 and operational dollars the next slide shows the seg funding in dollars that we have received from fiscal year 15 through 50 year 24 in the years from fy15 to 19 we see our revenue is fairly Flats

[00:24:00]
we then saw a jump and fy20 and a flattening and fy21 in FY 22 then we see in FY 23 and 24 on an increase again and this was due to the unit value increases that we have received and we believe that we will once again start to see that flattening in fiscal years is FYI physical years 25 through 28 like we saw in FY 4415 through 19 we project that our unit value will continue to increase but because our enrollment is projected to continue decreasing the revenue will more than likely stay Flats so in the next eight slides we will be presenting to you data through many numbers and percentages this next slide in is

[00:25:00]
sdg comparison for FY 23 and FY 2400 items that are included in the SEC and therefore affect the Sig in the second section you have the units that were generated from our enrollment for each of the items in Section 1 followed by what translates into the dollars for APS each of the items and section 1 have a factor assigned to them and that factor is multiplied by the enrollment in those programs to get those generated units in the third section we have the same information for FY 24 both in units generated and dollars received and in the fourth section you see the variance in units and in dollars for each of the items and at the bottom

[00:26:00]
we see how these all contribute to the final units that turn into our Revenue as our seg FY 24's increase over FY 23 final scg which occurred in April of 2023 is 12.3% or 99.1 million in an increase so although our units decreased are funding increased due to the unit value increasing from the 5522 to 6241 and in those variances it's kind of interesting to see like the units generated can go down but yet the money can go up and so that all has to do with the factors being applied to the units next on the next slide it shows our 24 operation summary without our Reserve

[00:27:00]
are total resources available to budget in operational in our operational fund came to $923.88 million and are expenditures into 928.3 million leaving us with the deficit of 4.5 million the deficit we believe is manageable as it can be covered by potential vacancy savings a possible increase in unit value which may occur again as it did this year and if neither of those materialized then we will dip into our Reserve next in our next slide we see the budget summary with our Reserve showing that even if we did have to eat into our reserves we will still be in accordance with aps's procedural

[00:28:00]
live of having a minimum of 5% in our Reserve ending with a balanced budget the next slide is a comparison of the district's Subway 23 budget compared to halfway 24 projected budget our initial budget in FY 23 began with the 10.3 million deficit and after that adjusted unit value we ended up the year with a fully balanced budget which you see in that middle column in FY 24 we are starting the year cutting that deficit to the manageable 4.5 million and then that last column with the percent change shows are revenues have increased by 12% but are projected expenses by

[00:29:00]
15 so as we continue to move forward and FY 24 we will work hard to bridge that gap between our revenues and expenditures and will keep you updated on the progress through continued budget updates throughout the year this next slide shows how that 12% increase of 99.1 million was distributed 40.2 million is salary increases 13.2 million went to the 11:40 instructional hours 8.4 million to increase the EA's minimum salary to 25000 8 million to site safety stipends an increase to the risk funds in the amount of 7.7 million a 1% Erb increase at 6.1

[00:30:00]
health benefits increase of 1.5 million and along with everything else listed here it all added up to 99.14% increase next I have the budget considerations and guidelines that were sent out with the budget call templates and I just wanted to remind everyone that currently all School budgets are 0 bass and and they're fully dependent on enrollment plus all legislated required increases and our department budgets are incremental staying flat from prior year plus any legislative increases next so when we sent the out the budget call templates on February 24th we asked the principles to be mindful of each of the four goals the board implemented in January

[00:31:00]
locating each of their budget lines and this data the data we collected is in this slide since this was the first attempt we know this data was subjective and believe with guidance as we move through the phases in our student-based budgeting project we can move to a more objective set of data the results of the data collected showed that most principles felt that they were spending most of their budgets on goals three and four and Then followed by one and then go to next on the next slide percentage wise we realized that principal's 7% of their budgets went into the other category we were curious to see what item spell into

[00:32:00]
the other other category according to principles next when digging deeper into the data we found that the 7% compared secretarial staff custodial staff supplies Librarians Library assistance principals assistant principals professional development and Contract Services but as you'll see on the next set of slides many of these budget items could have indeed been categorized into one of the goals instead of other and with that I will pass it over to renew for the qualitative side of this presentation okay thank you last fall we heard from the community

[00:33:00]
Additionally the fiscal year 2024 budget is the first budget since the board approved its goals in January and it's guardrails in March Rosalinda presented financial data to you and now we move on to what programs and initiatives look in our schools and classrooms that support the Portables honors guardrails support that APS strategic plan and most importantly student outcomes so the total APS budget thank you the total and it was very easy horses such as operational represents the portals and honors part of aligning our work involves

[00:34:00]
name the resources the people and the budget to those priorities the next slide focus on programs and initiatives and are tied back to the board bulls and guardrail our work here is to demonstrate that we have put actions towards goals guardrails strategic plan and most important student outcomes if you look at slides 16 through 17 we go over a PS4 one we have some new initiatives such as increased instructional time Title One interventionist and Ela curriculum also online tutoring we also have support in people in Human Resources such as reading resource teachers teacher support Specialists and we also

[00:35:00]
professional development such as letters training foundations training effective early literacy teaching English language Learners and reading interventionist PD we also support instructional materials such as Foundation kids Haggerty phonics astrida and lunetta curriculum and we have reading intervention programs such as read 180 and we have programs that boost literacy supports for again we have some new initiatives increase

[00:36:00]
curriculum illustrative math curriculum and we also have a partnership with MC squared out of New Mexico State University this is a partnership with math Educators teachers University professors administrators researchers all together to improve mathematics we also have supporting people such as math interventionist math resource teacher teacher support specialist and we have professional development and I ready and Spanish we also have math intervention such as 180 + 11 + 7/9

[00:37:00]
summer school genius hour and Explorer okay if we go to go three we wanted to make sure that there was opportunities for students so we have some opportunity such as 43 different AP courses offered at 441 different times we have 364 116 unique dual language courses and we listed some of the industrial certifications that students can pursue next golf course you're also we wanted to show some of the new initiatives such as the software we will be coming in June for approval of that purchase we also have PD for the software

[00:38:00]
and we will be monitoring data we have people such as Refugee newcomer supports Mental Health Providers will be Health Centers Substance Abuse Prevention is behavioral support specialist and we also have professional development such as a professional development non-violent Crisis Intervention training and we also have programs and initiatives such as school Gardens Arts and Music we also want to show that we are honoring the guard rails so we have some examples of wrap around support services that are available to students such as a counselors social workers Mental Health Providers attendance teams clothing

[00:39:00]
behavioral redirects and then next and APS guardrail to we do have Equity as Rosalinda said we are working with student based budgeting and we have been meeting with ERS we also had us at risk funding we also have expansion of Art and music and then if we go to guardrail 3 next we have high quality curriculum and instruction we had two adoptions of Odell a curriculum also of illustrative math instructional materials next and we want to make sure that we have boys and engagement here's some examples of some of the organizations

[00:40:00]
Community groups and we had Community representation in the Strategic plan and next if you go to APS Bart rail staff support we also had a staff included in the instructional material adoption in the calendar committee and several advisors staff groups this budget takes a big step forward and aligning our work our resources are people to the board goals honoring supporting a PS strategic plan also the guard rails and most importantly student outcomes at this time I'm going to hand it back to miss Montoya to complete our presentation thanks for all those examples so on the next

[00:41:00]
we have the New Mexico State Statute for charter school budget submission and I'm not going to read through that but just have it there for your reference and what this States is that charter schools have to submit their budgets along with ours and next is the summary of that information so in the first section you'll see all the list of the names of each of the charter schools and the FY 23 operational seg Revenue compared to their FY 24 operational list CG and then you'll see the increase or decrease in Revenue as well as a percentage of that increase or decrease in the second section it lists the 2% administrative fee that we received from all of the charter schools which ended up to 2

[00:42:00]
million dollars and that 2.2 million is listed on our slides 8 and 9 under other Revenue that it's included in that 19.2 million and then it's followed by on this APS Charter Schools comparison it's followed by enrollment for FY 23 and if my 24 and also has an increase or decrease in the last column which indicates you know if they increase or decrease and then the last portion just shows their school calendar and the little orange highlights it's currently working with the state regarding a waiver for their avoid 24 gold calendar and then the next

[00:43:00]
is a representation of all the funds including the reserve the total budget for Albuquerque Public Schools all funding sources is 2 billion 163,000,645,482 the biggest piece of the pie of course is the operational fund at 989 million or 46% of the pie and followed by Capital funds at 537 million which is 25% of the funds and then the federal funds come in at 3:04 million with 14% of the funds and that the federal funds include the answer for funds and then so on there's all the smaller portions including Food Services

[00:44:00]
and so on and then on the next slide is the Albuquerque Public Schools 2023 24th resolution and it kind of goes into a little more detail of each of those parts of the pie on the previous slide and so with that we present apses budget of almost 2.2 billion for your approval and that concludes our presentation and with that will stand for questions awesome thank you so much for the presentation and what I will do is I'm going to actually go down the line with the board and see what questions and comments we have specific to the budget that was presented to us and I will start over to my right with board member Gonzalez

[00:45:00]
with your questions thank you chair copier Romero I do have a couple of questions but I do want to start with just a note of appreciation for you miss Apodaca and for the rest of the team for all of the work on this including the monthly presentations getting us to this point it's been tremendously helpful and for that reason I think I have fewer questions then I might otherwise the first thing I wanted to to say is that obviously our top priority is improving student outcomes and it's hard to with the information presented in front of us to get a true sense of how or what likelihood this budget is actually going to contribute to the sun's contribute to any Improvement in student outcomes so it's more of a sort of a philosophical statement or question what confidence do we have that this budget is going to improve student outcomes if that is something you could speak to that would be great if not I would request that we revisit the budget once we do have the latest test scores so we can consider the budget

[00:46:00]
I want to see if there is any response to the question around connection between this proposed budget and student outcomes actually I'd like to take a stab at that if you don't mind I think that the budget office is probably one not the right person to answer that question it comes out of the people of the instructional alarm and academics that are building towards that I would say that what this budget reflects in the efforts that you just recognized of the budget office is in December we were given four goals and we are in the process of trying to build the infrastructure that will support those four goals and to that end we have a 5 year strategic plan that that does that I think this budget is more aligned to that work then it would have been a year ago well we didn't have the goals of the work that this board is set as a vision I will say

[00:47:00]
you may notice that there's a group of people sitting in the back that's the consultant company I recognized you I didn't forget you this is a consultant because they come in this week we've had our first round of meetings with them and we've sort of seen how the budget will evolve over the next two to three years and I think what you'll see next year is a different form different variation of what you saw tonight a little more complete a little more along the lines what you're looking and in the year after that I think you'll see a much really evolved version of what we tried I believe that what we've done is we have in the budget made people at least think about the fact that there are these four overriding goals that are guard rails that sit in and it's not just the schools it's a district departments as well it had to be a part of that and what you'll see over the coming months and the coming years is Daddy Evolution so I do feel better about this budget and the

[00:48:00]
it's aligned to what has been established I don't think we're a finished product by any stretch of the imagination but I do think you see those initial steps and US attempting to sort of shift the culture shift the structures and it really is a blending of two different structures and and I think you see that now I'm not there yet but a step in the right direction I can only think it will help so because yeah I know but I do we have the goals people responded to that these guys killed themselves to collect information to collect evidence if you would of of what we're trying to do it's going to take time like we talked about and you are seeing that initial evolution of the budget tonight yeah thank you so

[00:49:00]
what percent of the budget is special education I was trying to do it on my phone but I feel like I might not have all of the information I need to calculate that calculating has been very or increase and inflated costs on special education and potentially following the pandemic over identification of kids particularly some of those students that were most concerned about are named in our goals and I just want to make sure or get some sense of information around if our budget disproportionately allocates more funds towards something and what we would do about that

[00:50:00]
approximately 11% of our budget is for special ed I am sorry when we were calculating well you asked the second portion of I was just explaining why I was asking oh okay yeah that's good okay thank you on the budget presentation on slide 20 is information about level three and in particular some of the services that are offered within the district 43 different AP courses 36 IB courses etcetera and I just wanted to call out what's important here is the guardrails actually around distribution and so what information do we have around which students or student groups have access to these Advanced courses or Advanced opportunities just sort of relative to overall in the district there's this many horses so Madam chair and board member Gonzalez

[00:51:00]
I think like superintendent Elders stated that the entire focus of our district from the board to all the way to families is now going to be focused on these goals and how we achieve these goals and so it's a lot of alignment alignment shifts and mindset when we look at specific intentionality when we make certain decisions so specifically when we're looking at where are these AP classes and helped populated are they in in certain classes are effort for go three is going to look at how how are those classes provided at the schools what resources are needed and are there any barriers that are preventing any students from being a part of those classes and if so having those

[00:52:00]
patience to say how do we support the school to you know to to break down these barriers to allow these students to to try and so with that it's looking this lens has created an opportunity for us to hone in on what what do those AP classes where are they and where do they need to grow so that would be the next steps is just that assessment and then intentional building of program wherever we see there's deficit in board member Gonzales to your point for example the IB courses are only up at San Diego high school because of the only certified School in in in in in in and out in high school are going to be different across the city based on enrollment so we are trying to look at models of how can we if you don't have enough kids to make a

[00:53:00]
set one school could they somehow hybrid into another school's course and and take it those are some infrastructure things we've still got to figure out but I will tell you for example in the Dual language classes know the Navajo the Chinese and actually the German are all offered at CEC so those high school students could if they chose to take those classes could take them so it's going to be a combination of things like utilizing Hub Hub Hub courses and it's probably going to take a little bit of time to get that worked out but that's exactly why we put this in here and and anticipated that question because we recognize there's it's a difficult distribution based on student population who's taking it and we can continue to explore different ideas we recently had a discussion with Dallas ISD about their owners programs and in the past you had to opt in says if you get a certain score on their interesting

[00:54:00]
is it the tail wagging the dog in terms of horses are offered in certain communities because there are certain students who will take them versus a frame of mind that we offer all courses and all communities because we want to offer opportunities to all students I'm sorry that the efforts to Think Through how we analyze where those courses are and how we use more Innovative approaches including in terms of screening and gatekeeping to help expand that population and I think just I wanted to come back to my biggest concern for the budget approval process last year was largely around implications of the budget on Beyond Martinez identified students in African-American students and

[00:55:00]
I know last year we went through a whole process to try to figure out which programs were offered at which schools and which programs were getting cut at which schools and so I know that we don't have the most precise Data Systems yet but just to plug that I hope that we get that information because if we are going to be able to meet our goals we need far more precise data around how we're service serving those students and we are currently getting that's commentary not question my last question was related to go for and the offering programs initiatives that I see listed on the slides for Gulf War pretty concerned about this because as I read Gulf War increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills mindsets and have its most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness not make our student

[00:56:00]
how do you spell safer make them feel happier make them feel whatever I did want to go related to school climate but we have a goal related on some of these habits and mindsets and so there's no correlation between any of these types of programs and actually improving for example School Gardens does that do we know that that contributes to an increase in self-regulation no but we do know that focus on productive struggle in math might help and so really thinking through how we educate our school Community around how social emotional development is actually fully integrated with academics and not some separate thing that you do after school or outside of school and just curious you sort of refer to SEO software if I could get a sense of the overall strategy even if it's high level for how we are anticipating we might begin to increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills

[00:57:00]
Gonzalez I know that in looking at the specific language within the goal we I think it's important for us to realize that school culture has a lot to do with it and that's where it comes down to how we do business everyday and how people feel within our school buildings and so we have done a lot of work in building principal capacity this year surrounding you know focusing on specifically School culture you know Improvement data review Cycles how to increase just that awareness of self and others within the schools and so I know that that

[00:58:00]
has been the effort this year and it's going to continue into next year and so again when I think about the specific tool that's a dipstick for me that's to check and see based on the different intentional work that we're doing around school culture everyday and we're specifically looking now that the principals have had this professional development and it will go into next year we're looking at creating a leadership framework for APS so what does it look like what does it mean to be a leader within APS as well as you know just focusing on systems and instruction culture and engagement and alongside that is creating an instructional framework with visions of Excellence for ELA and math to couple with that so that Educators as well as school

[00:59:00]
leadership are working together with the same kind of focus on what they're trying to build so I think it's more of not a program specifically but it's how we are shifting and making principles aware of what they can do to improve their school cultures to make people feel happy and healthy and excited to come to school I would say some of these things specifically behavior management specialist actually are there to help build those skills in the kids because they're supposed to reinforce that and you can make an argument for some of these if you want to know more about the software and how it's going to be utilized in the audience and she she can answer some general questions I think about that if you if you want more detail I guess it was a clarifying I heard software to instructions on social emotional skills as in sort of like an curriculum what we're actually talking about

[01:00:00]
the measurement tool like a survey which is the answer to something I don't need to go into that detail now and take time away from the meeting but I think clarification as to whether it's a measurement tool or curriculum for SEL and we can talk later about that that's reassuring from the audience it's a measurement tool so and I would remember this was part of this process is helping to we're still working through SEO and what it looks like in schools right so our principals a lot of this was collected from principles what do you identify as ACL so this reflects their thinking so you'll notice there's Pete or peed around SEL and that will help us as we continue to Define it and I agree with you it's not just in a 15-minute section of time it's not just the counselors it has to be in the into the school and so that's going to take that's the one

[01:01:00]
deeper understanding of the idea thank you and then I just actually wanted to follow up on the AP courses and make sure that I heard it right so we do we know the demographics of the students currently taking AP courses in APS we can absolutely get that information I don't have that with me right now but we do have it I would love to see it thank you thank you thank you okay I have an idea for self-regulation conflict resolution language development go back to making kindergarten completely play base because that's what we did in kindergarten when it was not academic but rather when it

[01:02:00]
is developing all of those skills that kids need moving forward and I'll bet you if you talk to any teacher who has been teaching for longer than No Child Left Behind has been around they would say in Upper grades there is a noticeable difference when in student Behavior student's ability to self-regulate when we did this massive shift from from play face kindergarten to academic kindergarten and it would be it would be a huge payoff for everyone involved if we looked at appropriate Early Childhood instructions and I say that seriously period

[01:03:00]
when I ran for the board in the first place and I feel like the needle has not changed and it's really distressing and I know the pressure comes from other places but board member Mueller out again and top of your Romero I see nothing yet okay a couple of things just observationally I think I think it's good for the community to realize like back on page six increase calculator with the 99.1

[01:04:00]
is the increase in 71.5 is that is strictly mandated and the other 27.6 million is stuff we've got to do we've got to pay the utility bills and instructional materials so I think it's just good for people to realize that we have constraints that are mandated so one quick question on page 7 the number 7 was that the whole harmless money for decreasing what was that size adjustment number is coming here

[01:05:00]
formula that went away this was for school high schools below 400 and elementary schools below 200 thank you and that impacted Charters to write okay my big concern I mean there's always something that makes me wake up in the middle of the night all year long always for something that's happening on the board but the thing that woke me up this week is realizing what a bind we are on or in for elementary school teachers I mean there's never been parody for prep time between elementary middle school and high school and it has always been problematic but I know that there is a set aside amount for coverage of students for student safety

[01:06:00]
additional amounts to make sure there's coverage for getting kids on the bus and meeting them before school and all of that stuff but that does not do anything for your teachers need to set up a classroom and I mean even when it was pitiful in the past it was 15 minutes on one end of the day maybe and maybe 10 minutes on the other end of the day for those kinds of prep times but I just see a huge huge huge deficit in teachers ability I love the full days for collaboration planning those are going to be I think he's really well or potentially can be used for Department

[01:07:00]
but that's not how we give students feedback it's not how we give ourselves feedback about how they're progressing and it's not how we set up classrooms and make lesson plans and all those things and I'm just wondering if you if there's anything that you see in the budget that's going to help and I and and an ancillary question with this this here is my understanding right that this coming year we can cover the top schools but that money will completely go away so the school so that's really worked well for unless there's additional funding we can't continue that so I'll stop

[01:08:00]
be in place for one more year because they're being funded through Esser and is there any any thinking about how we address the day in day out planning and prep time needs for elementary school teachers it's it's on our mind it's constantly on our mind as well and some of the constraints that have been created we're trying to figure out how to function within them as well as meet the needs of our students and adults and it's it's definitely a struggle so but we definitely are working to identify what things could look like as far as you know I remember when I was a teacher we we didn't get compensated for Duty we had to show up 15 minutes before school and we had

[01:09:00]
to leave 15 minutes after that was just part of our contract and so this has really been quite a lift to try to figure out how to do that with a very tight budget and it does it looks like oh my gosh we're getting you know an influx of Revenue and it is tied up in salaries and benefits and so we're trying to figure out how how to function how to give teachers time but again there's certain things that have to be done during the school day and it's very it's a very difficult balance do we have any idea of class sizes for next year will it just be more of the same is

[01:10:00]
because what I think about in regards to for instance are a special education when that tier one instruction into your two instruction inside the classroom really hits the mark then there's much less need for those referrals but that doesn't come out of thin air that comes out of the teacher's ability to really plan for those students and to make the adjustments in curriculum that meets their needs and the two things that you have to have to be able to do that are time and a reasonable number of students that you really think about what what the need is for each one thank you is there any I mean this is probably a budget issue I'm just wondering

[01:11:00]
we see any ability to alter class sizes for next year I guess that's my question not in the current budget and not in the budget projections I understand that I somehow we've got to communicate and articulate what that need is because I'm serious I do agree with we weigh over identify but we will always way over identify if we can't meet those needs period and the strategies that you're using to address

[01:12:00]
School culture you mentioned a leadership framework and so immediately what came to my mind was I'm hoping that you can develop a leadership framework with the lens on reflecting the Martinez Yazzie black students in that we serve by way of Staffing and I know that's a lot that's a challenge but I'm wondering if that's part of that strategy if there are discussions happening around that with the leadership multiple components of

[01:13:00]
and with that is going to be that lens of our goals and guardrails as we're making decisions and so that's why I think we're really excited about this because we now have a very clear focus and intention and how we can allocate people and resources in a way that we didn't have maybe before and so I know that the people I'm sitting with the people behind me and I know you all are excited about this and the changes that are going to happen and you know it's evolving and every day we're meeting in offices and and partner thinking together like oh what about this and what if we did this and and there's just a different type of energy and so I'm very hopeful that yes in this leadership framework it's a framework that can be duplicative and we can really help as we

[01:14:00]
have principal turnover have something for them to work through and and strive to be but also they have the lens of our goals and guard rails and what we're doing through the Strategic plan so yes that is going to be part of it just jump in real quick so there is another element of the next few years in our work with ERS just this week I learned quite a bit it was very useful for me there's core principles to ineffective and of course the first is foundational you have to have a set amount of a base agreement of what it takes to make a school run and everybody gets that but core principles and that's where you start to see money is begin to shift on needs and it does you know the student in that way so

[01:15:00]
like I said this year's budget you see the the effort and the attempt to begin to think about it this way and now with guidance of the next few years I think you'll see a continue to evolution of that that budgeting principle there are some discretionary monies in the district we already had those out those monies are supposed to be applied to working with the Aussie Martinez students and each one had each school has tried to justification for that and how that looks I think in the future we may see more tomorrow

[01:16:00]
because that we have and I'll just leave it at that that's more of a comment and I want to revisit gold for the conversation around 4:00 and just a reminder that is on us because it's not well-defined and we're going to work on that and so it doesn't surprise me that that's that's a struggle we need to get it together we need to be accountable first Define it so that you can do a better job of aligning a presentation around that and

[01:17:00]
I'm just going to make I'm not going to go through all of this I don't think because I think board members Gonzales and Peterson have already voiced some of my questions ultimately and I know this is where we're headed how do we know that any of these strategies work and for me I guess the we have an incredible day so I was disappointed that we didn't hear at least a little analysis about strategies that have been in place for decades and those are things that we could have looked at but on the other hand

[01:18:00]
I also know that we have been incredibly busy establishing that infrastructure and so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm torn because I would have liked to have heard a report on even just a little bit on on those strategies that we've had in place for decades that's it and thank you for all the work thank you so much for the information that came in I appreciate all the work that song a little bit different I really appreciate just the the intentionality around the goals and I do understand that thinking back to the strategic planning where we're in design and implementation so it's not going to be absolutely

[01:19:00]
perfect in terms of where we're going to get and obviously as we get to a monitoring schedule we're going to see the inputs on that level and what the outcomes are going to be based on that in terms of goal for because I do agree with board member Dominguez that's definitely on us I think we we have a it's a nice goal I mean it's it's a good Vision to have but we haven't really clearly defined like the how and what we were going to get there and I just want to remind the team to that there are other everything that we listed in here reminded me of just like we went straight to just like social emotional supports and it's not just it's not the only place where you find it because I thought of just like some wonderful educational strategies that we have like Avid and Jag those are two programs also that are specifically designed to implement or to or specifically around mindsets and habits

[01:20:00]
perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy so those could also be places where we probably have some really good data around what that does and especially at that Middle School level where we have a lot of young people that are engaged in Ovid and what it does but you know how wonderful is it if an entire school campus was an avid campus right because I think it does it does have an opportunity to do that so I so I do want to say I'm not surprised that there was struggle with this because when I saw this list I also was like and it was like going back to what board member Gonzalez was saying to was like the distribution of like how does this all get distributed across the district because we know it's not available everywhere and coming from a district where often we don't have a lot of the things like AP courses I can

[01:21:00]
the apostate engagement is really low it's just some I know like at Rio Grande High School it's it's really a struggle and I understand that that it doesn't happen everywhere so I you know I understand but at the same time I'm concerned because the majority of our money we go back and we look at it people were throwing many and saying we're doing gold for and so I think we need to be really cautious board members because I think we've also set up I think there's just this expectation out there around go for and there's not a lot of clarity around what could be some of the ways that they could also measure their efficacy around goal for because we haven't we haven't defined that so so that's the only thing that I'm worried about so my question you know just to you all is like it's as you've done this and you're looking at it and of course

[01:22:00]
this money is going to raise his let's be really honest about 75% of this went to raises but how does it feel different in terms of like what what are you seeing or what feels different in the engagement with the schools at the school side how can you tell me that it's been you know what what's been reflected back to you in this process that you're having conversations or as the associates were working with with their principals at that level Madam chair members of the board and it was very interesting to watch our finance team presented to our principles on what the new budget process was going to look like there were a lot of questions like how does this work what are we doing how are we doing it and so it has actually been pretty positive as far as feedback goes regarding they now are having to think again more focused

[01:23:00]
on the way behind why they're doing the program they're doing why they're hiring you know to have lower class sizes or whatever they you know are looking at in this area it's it's just a different intentionality and I think it's positive we've heard positive feedback there's still a lot of questions so I don't want to negate that but our son Associates have done a very good job and working with the principals in asking critical questions and I really feel like again this is a really exciting time to do things differently and I think we're starting to see that shift so I mean are we seeing like there's a shift or like are some programs that were let go of and some that were increased as a result of this or are we pretty much just going to be the same that's what I'm trying to

[01:24:00]
in our curriculum and instruction Department I have charged Joyce and her team to look at all the programming and instructional materials that we have within our district and to say you know what is the use of user you know who's using this why are they using it how much does it cost is it effective are we not seeing outcomes and then let's look holistically because if we're doing things I say the school is doing this intervention program this school is doing this intervention program we have at the district level no way to collect that comparative data to see is it working and do we need a replicate that another school so we did the audit and there have been some programs that we are questioning at this point so that work is happening

[01:25:00]
and we are communicating with schools and asking them you know why do we want to why are you wanting to continue this are you seeing the outcomes that were expecting and if not then what is the rationale to continue so I don't know that that has been the conversation and and that started so that's it's not just more of the same it's why are we doing this and is it working and if it's not we need to we need to part ways and some of them have been difficult because there's some really good programs out there but maybe we don't have things implemented with Fidelity and so we're not getting the outcomes so if it's multi-layered and we want to make sure that we have all the pieces in place okay I appreciate that thank you for that response because I'm you know I mean that's going to be the question from the community right they're going to see a two-point one billion dollar budget

[01:26:00]
that's where it's at but it is also an opportunity for us to think about the folks that are in that building and are there things that we're going to do differently because we do have goals and and guard rails and this is just commentary I've heard a lot from the principals in my community how grateful they were to have the goals in the guard rails articulated for them because it really helps them as a leader to all so sort of push The Narrative of okay here's what here's what's the expectation for us how are we going to drive that but I am curious around you know is there is there a positive increase in like reading interventionist or math interventionists or we seeing are we seeing that as a result since we have a literacy in a mouthful I mean I was just it was curious about about how the budget was being thought of that way even at the site level to really

[01:27:00]
direct the you know the the push towards the goals in the guardrails that we had in mind so or never mind just to that end I think there's a little bit of that going on but not as much so early you made the comment that of the additional money is 75% of that was tied up in salary I don't think you were closed I think it's close to 94% 94 okay all right because if you stand corrected sister salary increases are 40 then structural hours at another 13 the EA's at another eight and a half you got to have the site safety site or employee health benefits substitutes differentials I didn't count utilities I didn't count instructional materials the Fine Arts factor and compliance all that adds up to about 9 0 4

[01:28:00]
if you look at it I think that's just salary yeah I think that's just paying people so the 99 million that was additional 94 million is tied up just in people so yeah I am in no way unhappy to see this additional money I think the easiest absolutely deserve that money and and I think the state did the right thing but you're absolutely right we need to communicate both to the public and to you that when we do ultimately begin to look at this this this this this this student base budgeting there's going to be a certain amount of money that is set and there's going to be an amount of that that is somewhat flexible and it is going to I don't know how big that's going to be that's part of the first step in the work is doing it on another diagnostic of our spending and getting a sense of what we've got we know we send the schools money that they can use as they wish I can't remember but it's not big and there's a reason

[01:29:00]
you could consider some of the federal dollars that flow to schools with special needs discretionary to an extent and so there are areas where we're able to do reading interventions and different programs but again a lot of that is limited and remember those federal dollars shrunk a little bit because they're enrollment shrunk and they're still they had to meet all the state requirements for these salary increases so they had to pay their people more so there was less money that you had said that it was 11 per cent from last year or is it pretty much similar to what we've been spending thank you

[01:30:00]
and so if I think about it from an enrollment perspective our overall enrollment is declining there are special at enrollment is increasing okay I mean I was just I was just curious about that from the from both sides of the coin thinking about special ed not being fully funded either or fully resourced in the way that it needs to be resource and so I just didn't know if you know how much of an increase we're having this year in special ed based on where we've been in the past but you can get that to me later just I was just curious about that I don't have any other questions thank you I have a lot of questions I'll try to go through them really quickly but first I just want to take us back like you know remember Peterson did like 20 25 years ago when we started you know kindergarten

[01:31:00]
me being a kindergarten teacher for you know 24 years or something and how much fun it was it was a blast and then they started they said what you know the kids aren't ready for first grade you know they're not reading they're not doing all the stuff that's not appropriate anyhow and they said we're just going to have full day kindergarten to get to it and we're going to make it academic and after I mean how did that work out I mean you just kind of look at kids and how it just affected them you know in lots of an emotional ways kids are five and they should just be having fun and if that's one of my biggest my personal biggest disappointment having been on the board for 8 years is not being able to turn back the clock to where kindergarten should be developmentally appropriate and I know member Peterson and I talked about that and wish that we could turn back the clock

[01:32:00]
that hasn't happened and I hope I hope it I just hope it does I will also kind of the same thing that that President Montoya Cordova talks about is we need to make sure that this budget like looks it looks different it should look different and I understand that most of it does go to salaries but we still have to to have that you know conversation about how it looks different and how it's really going to have an impact on you know on student outcomes so I'm looking through you know especially with a lot of them money going towards you know gold gold for and it seems like as a quarter of a said it's like really are we doing are we and you can tell me is go for all about

[01:33:00]
we're doing for the kids to improve the outcomes for the kids or is it more focused on with the adults are doing and so I and I believe that is also on on us probably it has to be but it should be all about those outcomes for the kids and not all these programs and dealing with the adults so that's just maybe not a question just putting that out there also the same thing I don't remember who said if it was I don't remember lots of questions I would like to know also and you can all get this all back to me is what is the current Staffing ratio right now in regular I mean I would like to know how that's changed in the last five years you know what what does that look like if that's something that you could could get to us that's what are what are we seeing

[01:34:00]
I think it's important for us to know as well also how many teachers if you could get this to me also how many teachers did we have you know in 2122 22/23 and you know what do you expecting in 24 and and this may be superintendent is are we still I know you said that when it comes to you know Staffing levels going down that we've just basically used attrition so do you believe that Trend will probably continue as well yeah to an extent but at some point you know we will probably have to get the point where we have to make some hard decisions that's not the goal you know that's not but that's always we'll have to watch it I mean the budget on a remarkably good job of projecting and giving us a sense of what's happening and we were watching enrollment

[01:35:00]
46 it's both the capital master plan in Richard's departments are both are tracking and given us projections on enrollment what we have it's something to ask us part of the planning and we recognize the enrollments going down for all the various reasons and I'm just assuming and you all can get me that is as enrollment is going down then the number of employees that we have is also going down is that true it has been yes ok Google who knows that but that would be something that I would like to to see it's like okay and I don't know you all know is it gone down like 5% between last year and this year and maybe the last couple years gone down about 11% so is the number of employees kept up with that as well the decrease so if I could get those

[01:36:00]
that would be helpful as well and then I mean and first I wanted to do this because I think it's really important is I just want to applaud the taxpayers out there and thank them for funding a 2.16 billion dollar budget for our 68,900 kids they deserve a big thank you I mean that is like over 31,000 per child was only like 22,000 you know a couple of years ago and that just tells me that our community cares about our kids and even though they are not seeing the student outcomes improve yet there's still willing to you know to find them because they believe in our kids and we all know it's adults that are failing the kids it's us it's not

[01:37:00]
kids failing themselves and so we need to do better because they can do better I know having taught in every quadrant of the city every child that I ever taught was capable of learning to read and do math without exception so we can do better than having 70% of our kids not be able to read at grade level and 80% not be able to do math and it is on us because we're the grown-ups in the room now I was looking at can you I think we've lost since 4:21 like 8800 kids so that's a pretty big right pretty big decrease I'm thinking about how many high schools you know 8,800 I mean how many schools that is and then I'm looking at our budget and I understand most of it goes

[01:38:00]
to you know you know pain people but our budget has increased like over half a billion dollars over half a billion dollars since fy22 I mean when I started on the board 8 years ago it was like one point three million I think or something around around around there so that's like a 31st increase in a couple of years and that is how can we see if you think about that by 2028 we could have a hundred percent increase budget could increase by 100% if we're increasing it every couple of years by 301% so I just want to know how you all think that is sustainable honestly yeah and some of the increase that we've had in the past few years of course was for the funds so we have had three

[01:39:00]
portions of Esther funds and that's the big you know that's why the federal has been much better than usual much of the bigger piece of the pie than usual so we'll start to next year that a lot you know Cliff that Cliff is coming so that will affect the budget and the budgets will start to look smaller again like I said it'll start to we're going to start seeing that flattening of this age we've seen it going up I think they've kind of like by increasing that unit value they know we've implemented a lot of stuff and have to keep moving forward with less enrollment because it's happening Statewide even Nationwide and we just have to continue working with that but that's not going to continue and we know that it won't even if they do increase the unit value within enrollment continuing to go down about 1500 to 2500 students per year it's bound

[01:40:00]
and even possibly at some point start to decrease once again so I know you're talking about that scg flattening that you are pretty sure that's what's going to happen and then these are funds are going to go away so like what do you anticipate happening to the budget in the next you know maybe not next year next fiscal year but the following year I mean what do you think miss me yeah our projections so far for the for the operational portion anyhow is is that flattening portion that we're going to just continue to be flat for at least probably the next three years or so because we're we're fortunate that the state you know has a strong strong income from fuel you know gas and oil oil help us or a few years but then the state's going to start feeling the same thing that it's going to be kind of a leg that's happening

[01:41:00]
right now economy is kind of booming from there infusion cuz every you know a lot of people have those funds to spend and so we know that harder times are going to come around for not only the districts but also for small businesses in the state and so sometimes they're going to be coming ahead and we know that that's coming and we're trying to have plans and be very strategic about what we're doing like not increasing FTE you know even within the funds we were very strategic and deliberate and not getting not providing stuff that's going to be you know continual recurring expenses because all that will have to come back on to operational and we just can't afford

[01:42:00]
sustaining what it already has pretty much and so we are looking at all that I've been doing some projections even increasing the unit value for the next 3 years and projecting the enrollment going down and putting it into these formulas like we have on page 7 you know all the little portions of where we feel it will come out and we're we're projecting out for that and trying to have to do some big decisions and big it's going to be it's going to be painful it's going to be painful and when you're just kind of looking and I am sure you do this all the time is that you're you know looking at property values and property taxes and oil and gas home you know what's per barrel today student enrollment like you said

[01:43:00]
play I mean all those things could lead to you know things not being a steady as they probably have been so I'm sure that's what you guys do everyday and that keeps you up at night it doesn't keep me up at night cuz I don't know how to do it so the let me see what else do I have maybe a question that I kind of didn't like didn't necessarily see an answer but I know it's in there when you're you know doing the budget is it in there are you really reflecting like the capital only Capital needs that you like you see us are enrollment is declining are you is that play any part in that in the budget and how important rightsizing you know staff and buildings is going to be at that plane in there and I'm just kind of missing how it's impacting the budget yes so we think about all of all of that together of course you know

[01:44:00]
each Capital does their own budgets and stuff but we do think of how are we going to do that and of course you know the right sizing projects is one of the ways that we're seeing that and then as the enrollment goes down it's probably going to be more schools that may have to be thought of as incorporating together or different strategies like that so there's there's a lot of different moving parts that that will affect the budget and they will affect each other right the capital and the grandsons and the shrinking all so all of those together are going to have to be thought of together and work together yeah okay now this is just kind of going to some you know board members have already talked about and I know member Dominguez did is like when you're looking at you know

[01:45:00]
good looking out the goals you know one two three and four and I would like to just really see and I know that you did point out I want to know like President Montoya Cordova does is what what is new I mean what are we really doing that's new when you say we have new you know a new math curriculum well that happens we go through adoption that isn't something really knew or I read is not something really new so I want to know when it comes to you know go one I want to see what the data is for read one 80 I want to know how many kids I want all this data the number of kids that are attending before and after school tutoring and how is it being targeted you know the online paper tooting tutoring is it you know what are the results for that those are things that are important and those will help show us if we really are putting the

[01:46:00]
I think those are things same thing for you know go to go to all those materials that are in there I just want to know what their improved student outcomes are how are we going to tie them to and then like I said many times is when we have so many things we're doing how do we know what really is working I'd like to jump in a little bit on that because that's going to all come when we get our monitoring schedule the calendar and when they come and they speak to a specific goal then will be able to see how all those strategies and all of those pieces are having an impact on that out I mean these are all the individual inputs that the district has determined would be the ways that they're going to use the strategies to help us to reach those outcomes so that's going to be coming yeah I can hardly wait that's

[01:47:00]
expanded it to meet every child's needs yet I know we're getting through those phases but you know we need we need more and when it came to Athletics which is important to a lot of our kids is if we want to when I talk to coaches from you know schools in my district when they're talking about helping student emotional providing that students emotional support social emotional support they can get so much of that from their coaches and I don't think anybody can and I've been giving me all the research that shows how important

[01:48:00]
it is but then I looked at I just looked at how Athletics it looks the same as it did last year I mean the budget doesn't look like it increased I could be am I wrong but that's from what I remember it looked pretty much the same as it did before it's not if there's not a big increase at all so I'm for increasing that and getting that music and more there were some increases in athletics but again it's tied up on cost they increase the pay for the officials which they have to do or we're not going to have any officials and then we won't play that then we'll save a lot of money because we won't play so it's everything's tied to a cost it's not you know we'd love to build it up and have a wonderful and do other things with that money but it's all tied really to salary and Athletics is good for we know what we do we go listen to music to

[01:49:00]
we'll see all of this is when it comes to you know looking at the guard rails you know wraparound Services how is that in you know how is that increasing from one year to to another how do we have more social workers and counselors I mean how we providing those and are we seeing a difference at all cuz we have to have more of them in there to be able to provide the services to everybody and I think it's the same thing for all you know for all four guard rails and I would just like to know on The Voice and engagement which is important to me is I mean what is a really new medium like some of the things that I saw in there were just things that I think we've been doing and sometimes you just have to do something different to hear

[01:50:00]
everybody's voice into you know to engage them so it's just something for you to you know to keep in mind I think I got everything so you guys can give me all the you know answers to everything later and I'll wait for us to start our monitoring for somebody thank you and so I'm going at the end so I will try to I do have these are my questions but I will consolidate and so I think so my first question

[01:51:00]
is what the first of all thank you you guys have really made a great attempted is different than last year and I do appreciate you making the first effort that first step of tying the budget to the goals I see that you did that I also see that we have some steps to go to kind of tie that bow right and I think that the reason that we can't tie the bow the reason that we can't get the direct answers right now also has to do with the fact that we don't have interim goals yet and so as my commentary My Hope Is that as these interim goals are developed what what is necessitated by that is that some of these Superfluous programs or you know things that's not the

[01:52:00]
the inputs thank you as we start to learn what is working and what is not working based on what your interim goals are I hope that some of those things will go away which then as we come to a cliff we've already kind of weeded out the items that aren't working and so I think my first thing is I wrote yes Exclamation point Exclamation point thank you for doing an audit I mean I'm I'm that's what I was also wanting to hear I kind of wanted to already see that so so it wasn't in here but I'm glad that you address that because that's what we need we we can't just throw spaghetti at the wall to see what's going to work we have to have the data and we have to know what is going to work and I think part of the problem of this splattering of programs that are listed in here is there was nothing to set them again because you guys don't have the interim

[01:53:00]
yes yes okay yes so I'll be looking forward to that over the summer to set those goals and so my first question though is what is our per pupil expenditure and the reason I asked is because board member Aragon just said 31000 but then if I look online it says 26 and then I look somewhere else and it says 10,000 and then our unit value is 6400 so what is our pupil expenditure that was actually open to address that when it was said so the 31,000 is if you take everything okay so you take all the capital you take all the Investments you take everything and you know we don't actually have all the money remember it's a six year we only get part of it every one every year and so and that money does not go into direct classroom instructions for maintenance that's for

[01:54:00]
when you go into calculating the money for the student you're really looking at the scg you really looking at a couple other inconsistency gets much closer I believe around 12,000 at this point it used to be 11 but it fluctuates from school to school because then you've got some schools that have really large special ed hubs right and so that school will have an incredibly High per unit value because you may have two adults per child you know based on the need so you can see a wild discrepancy we we we we do this every year for the state I know the last time we did it it was a range from about 7:00 to 7:00 seem to be the majority of the schools with the outliers being those special ed hubs

[01:55:00]
14,294 is the the aps average so does that include just

[01:56:00]
then you have to use the same criteria because what I get is this happened to me recently and a meeting well Denver spends 8,000 you guys spend 26,000 and I'm like no it's because they're not measuring the same amount and so it has to be the same measurement that's all most people don't include Capital when they talk about theirs per pupil spending they don't include the capital in it so that's why I traditionally don't I agree if you don't have a roof it's going to be a rough day so that's that's just how it is a lot of states do not fully operational expenses so

[01:57:00]
we look way high when you look at State expenditures compared to a lot of places but it's because they're funding a whole bunch of their operational with property taxes at the local level that aren't equalised sorry number two and I see I see the list but I think I would like to know and maybe just an example how is guardrail number two being adhere to in the budget and here's Let me Give an example obviously my district does not have a lot of fun I don't think any Title One funding but we know that there are

[01:58:00]
kids in the schools that have that need so how are like for example when I look at the gold one where there's reading interventionalists and resource teachers and all of that how can I look at this budget and go talk to my constituents and say absolutely guard room number two was addressed and and school ex is going to get what they need you can answer that question some of the examples would be the nursing program the free lunch program the factory to make sure that this goes back to the foundational element of a budget that their foundational schools that have a halftime library in and of a full-time library but they do

[01:59:00]
have a librarian some of that it may change as we move into this new system but that is how we stand now so there are those foundational elements that we have not broken from and there was talk about it there was discussion well we could save money if we put a rotation systems say for counselors and we didn't do it because of the guardrail so those are elements that come in I don't know if the associates have other examples if I'm covering it but when we look at things like at-risk funding that does not go to schools and so that's an additional amount of money that's given to certain schools that have populations of higher need as determined by the state and so they have these additional funds on top of what they're giving for their pupils to be able to hire interventionists or resource teachers and additional Council

[02:00:00]
where maybe others don't get that additional at risk funding so right so so I'm being 100% selfish here I realize that and I realize I'm at the end but for schools that do not get at risk funding and for schools that do not get Title 1 funding but there are still children that are in those schools that still need those Services how can we guarantee that guard rail to is being addressed for those students that I'm sorry whoever I'm looking back at Troy I don't know that those kids are getting the funding that they need and that the resources are being allocated so I think all schools get a form of that I don't think there's any school that doesn't get that risk funding for one two we have done things like

[02:01:00]
I said and you can look at little Behavior directors are a good example every school gets a behavior redirected with that program started it was not necessarily going to be at every school but it grew into every school and we've held the line on that so there are elements that exist for your schools answering your direct question your selfish selfish and and supports for example is across all the district and you get that so there are elements that that are there now if you want to say well did we get the same amount of counselors no did we get the same amount of Social Work Services probably not but at the base level at the base level there are people there on campus because of that

[02:02:00]
in regards to goal number for I don't think that this question got answered and maybe this is for you and Dr Muir is the definite what did we talk about oh that I wrote there's a splattering of programs that might not address School number four and it's because it hasn't been defined is that definition coming that's from us but we have perseverance definition of how we're going to get there and so it's been really difficult and this is been one of the goals that Ashley is

[02:03:00]
what part of our coaching has been coming back to us on this one that we we need to that's that's kind of on us so we have this very broad piece we've talked about different they've talked about different programs we would use and what we're going to have but we don't have an X and Y on this and we don't know how the X and the Y is going to get their whereas with the others we have at least an X and A Y we I mean we know that the tools that we're going to use to measure what we're going to look at and so that's what's been holding us up a little bit on this because we it's not it's not fully defined yet it's not and that's on us I think we've kind of created a little bit of a flux in this so that we can get we have to we have to hone in on this one and this is going to be one of those things that the council a great City Schools is going to actually do with us when we have our training coming up real soon that's going to be in person they're going to AJ and Ashley are going to get

[02:04:00]
we are looking at some tools that will help you as we look at how are we going to measure the school so we're looking at ways to do that I did want to respond a little bit you know we had lots and lots of things that schools did the same thing you know in terms of we don't know what they decided was in goal for because we didn't Define it for them yet and we didn't find it for the Departments yet and so we were looking at really sort of what the goal says in terms of what it is and I think what's missing and what we provided to you was really sort of descriptors of those programs that are strategies that we said will help meet the goal of so for example I'm going to go with superintendent adults behaviors that is absolutely a program

[02:05:00]
that works on students mindset skills perseverance all of those things that are in the goal because it's a program that helps to students to begin to understand their behaviors and how to adjust how to get the skills to do that and so we need to do a better job of defining those programs for you we have lots and lots of measures we don't have a single measure so I can tell you that every single program that my department said were part of Gulfport we measure them we don't have a single measure and so as you become more defined in goal for we can begin to look at it in that way and say is it does it really mean this measure or are we just measuring which is critical success of the program because of the program isn't successful why are we continuing it you know that's

[02:06:00]
implications whether its operational or grant funding whatever it is it has budgetary implications and is superintendent Elder said it's not just the operational dollars that are going down it's also the grant dollars because is salaries go up and grant funding stays level we still have to pay those extra salaries so we have less money for program implementation so we have to be very thoughtful and how we look at programs how successful are they in terms of student outcomes and Student Success not just wait felt good it is really successful because everybody loved that program and it really felt good which is everything good things but are they successful for students and that's where we're going

[02:07:00]
looking at what we need to do to meet your goal for how do we move forward in that direction we're doing a lot of auditing as we are moving into the summer and in the next school year to say what is there what's happening and how successful are these things we don't have that information for you yet but we were working to get there for you and for us because we need to know what successful what's not one of the questions we keep asking is what can we take off our plates we take the things off our plates that aren't doing what needs to happen for student outcomes and those are the things that we begin to take off our plates and so even some of those things that we put into gold for and I'll go to President we don't find those but is absolutely a program that happens in our schools supported by the district offices that

[02:08:00]
the needs of golf 4 and so it's not what we do at the district level is just some people's salaries to help support the needs of school-based health centers in our schools but we don't put any money into school-based Health Centers but it is absolutely something that's there so we are listening to you I actually liked the questions that got sent by the board because it helped frame some of the thinking about how we need to go forward and think about all of these programs that we have listed in here and again that was just a snapshot that wasn't even everything it was a snapshot to give you some ideas of things that were doing but we need to give you more information so that you can understand when we say Behavior does everybody know what they are I'm not going to go into that here no so how do you know that that's even a program that aligns to go

[02:09:00]
because we haven't given you that information yet and so we need to give you that information I think we might need Behavior redirects on the board I can help you with that just kidding just kidding okay thank you for that and and I again will selfishly speak for myself that as we start to slim down our programs you will have my support to do that because there's no reason for us to be paying for all of these programs I mean like we have we have in again I don't know what half of these things are but we have Outdoor Learning we have school Gardens we have we have four different seal things that are listed here do we need four of them probably not do we need one of them yes definitely so let's as we move through this and I am I hope what you're hearing is Maybe

[02:10:00]
play some more direction as to where the interim goals need to be as to what we're looking for right as as you guys move forward with that so those are kind of some of my philosophical questions if you don't mind me asking some very specific questions special ed funding there was not much of an increase how are we addressing the gifted needs as well as the special special education the disability needs with not much of an increase good evening education funds come out of our operational budgets so for special education most of our salaries if not all of our or all of our budget goes to the operational funds which also

[02:11:00]
resource teachers along with the materials as we look at special education again all of the salaries come out of the operational fund and as we look at the idea of be funding that is for all of our special education staff curriculum materials I'm across the district all of our resource teachers IEP Specialists and so on I'll come out of that are the needs for the kids being met through this budget I think as we look at it we're looking for special education every defining what we're doing we listen to the public is we were building the goals in the guard rails and inclusive practices was one area that we really heard we wanted to strengthen so as we look at what we're doing for special education with our budget we are realigning programs and supports so that they are directly to the schools and you'll see through our strategic

[02:12:00]
and it will be putting some measures in place that will give us that data and the direct support to schools for professional development and supporting students okay thank you sorry on page 11 where it has the areas of increase or any of these increases unfunded mandates from the state yes the actually probably the one that was underfunded I think we presented it in our March presentation to the board that was the minimum wage increase to the license

[02:13:00]
educational assistance salaries to 25,000 we were funded 3,000,375,600 and the cost to APS is 8,000,362,970 so that was an underfunding of 4.9 million okay page 15 the 7% that they're having to use other funds is this where schools are just trying to cover the cost due to lower enrollment where they're trying to keep why are they having to pay 7% to secretarial staff and custodial Stouffer slide

[02:14:00]
why did they put certain things in that other category and when they did what were they what what it was got it be Secretary of staff and all that cuz I think they open their minds they didn't feel it fit into one of the goals specifically but so they stick it in the other category that makes sense I was like why why why why why why not paid for okay a couple other things I'll just I'll send later like I'm wondering why we're paying for paper when I think that the nmped just like mixed that contract so wasn't sure why we have that in some of our goals but I don't know so that was a big question for us as well and when we reached out to the PED the rationale was because they didn't have the student engagement that they expected it wasn't

[02:15:00]
at all they reached out to districts to get kids engaged and there wasn't that engagement and so they decided we're not going to go in that direction we are working really closely to try to drive strategy behind how we implement it so focusing on mathematics in 8th grade specifically we saw Tony hillerman that they had like an outrageous number of completed Math Missions that they've already used and so it's we're trying to use it more strategically than just everybody try to use it we do want everyone to use it but we're not going to just leave it up to chance we're going to really try and be strategic about

[02:16:00]
with the guidance the teacher says you four are getting on here and you're going to work on polynomials go that that has some and then we're starting to see some schools that are like jumping on it there was another one I can't remember but there's examples are saying we're going to use this Desert Ridge Road OK Google I don't see anything on here as far as Plumbing electrical HVAC I don't see other CTE type Industries so I would like to see an increase in those type of Industry certifications this seems very specific as to what they are so I'd like to see an increase in some of more of the trades and I'm hoping we do have somebody that's in charge of that now correct that does not have for a year and she's doing a killer

[02:17:00]
we're very pleased with her she just did not get us the information that we needed in this particular project but but it's there or whatever there are no there's elements there's elements and it's there but it needs to be expanded and shoot fully recognize that in agree I will say that the elements of the trades you see a lot of students that are actually in dual enrollment where they're taking courses either through CNM and their enrolled in like their Electrical Plumbing and also HVAC so there's their Pathways for them to get to that and some of the schools are are using that as a way to get them started or I think they're still needs to be development and I it and I have talked a little bit about this is that the district is still you know needing to work out and clearly Define career Pathways and that's kind of like I saw that as part of your strategies on the on the Strategic

[02:18:00]
a huge improvement with Michelle at the at the helm in terms of the work that she's doing with the CTE Department with the and and just with just her the career pathway side of the work that she's doing we need to just have more because there are students that are taking these but we just need to increase the numbers well yeah I mean that's cool goal three like we need to have more industry certification I think the other thing is is fine arts right like we want to continue that we want to make sure that that is funded because you know I'm there are those those schools that are pretty ticked off right now that they don't that they have to wait another year so if if there is a way that we can reach out to the state by schools to say it's coming that would be great

[02:19:00]
they're going to be petitions coming if you haven't seen them already and that there are schools that didn't get funded and they're upset about it and you know they're going to point to our guard rails and our goals to say why they didn't get funded so we need to to focus on that as well and then student transportation you know I were hearing with the calendar and the start times that they are what they are because part of it is transportation and so you know however we need to fund that in order to I don't know we can't hire people I know all of the problems let's just make you know try to focus on that so that we can do what's best for our students oh yes just because of Transportation well that's part of the equation starts time

[02:20:00]
schedule so I get a lot of the board made this decision and the superintendent is doing this to us and I would remind everyone that the law changed and the amount of hours change unless we had a lot more days we had to add hours and so and it was elementary that was adversely impacted the most because it went from 990 to 11:40 so that's where the hours change comes now Transportation has an impact on that and that but really the only impact was was the desire to move the high school schedule and so somebody has to go first somebody has to go second and somebody has to go third that's that's how it goes and remember in terms of Transportation they reimburse us so whenever Mi we

[02:21:00]
so we can't necessarily grow the transportation department Unless somehow we have the capacity the buses and the drivers to drive more kids so when you say budget it it's we don't really budget it as much as we say we think we're going to get this much based on what we believe our ridership is and we believe these are the miles will run so we can project and then we go over it but short of more buses and drivers to go over we can't all right I'm done I'm looking forward to some insurance so that we know how this budget is actually going to play out okay thank you I know originally when we had our first meeting with

[02:22:00]
you showed me a graph that had like alignment of spending and funding and I don't see that graph and I loved the graph you know cuz it really showed kind of what the trends are and how we should be you know what we should be looking at are you able to talk about the graph do you know what I'm referring to yes that was actually the staff versus enrollment and we will be bringing that to you probably you know in the next presentation because we just wanted to fit to speak to in a focused on this year's budget and then starting next month will start bringing you like Maltese projections and kind of more of the strategy that we're trying to look at to kind of bridge that Gap and but yeah we'll be bringing that information we just decided to let it out because for this one since we really wanted to focus

[02:23:00]
1 years budget instead of multi-year okay I look forward to seeing that graph because it was very insightful and obviously that goes back to when we could go to enrollment like knowing this was our second biggest drop out of 8 years outside of when covid originally happened and making sure we stay in alignment with those Trends because it's not going to change and ultimately you want to make sure your Staffing is aligned with the Degreaser the decrease in enrollment and having said that and you kind of touched on it but have we truly projected out created a scenario of the declining enrollment removing all the extra money that we had what would our budget look like and that's one again why we just thought let's focus on this year

[02:24:00]
but yeah this year is positive we were only negative for that underfunding of the EA's that was really what caused our negative so we were pretty excited that we really do have a balanced budget but in order to keep on that trend of having a balanced budget we're going to have to make some really big decisions and of course our our biggest expensive is celery and so right now we're going to start we've been really starting to assess are actually what we budget because we think there's a little work in there we're trying to another project that we're starting is we're trying to get a new Erp the you know like now we have lost in we're looking for a new Financial system because currently we do not have position control and

[02:25:00]
it's really what's needed for us to effectively see how many positions are just out there that we could cut the positions without actually cutting people and so that's what we're really going to focus on next is looking where those variances are and trying to cut as many of those positions that we really don't need to be budgeting for because they either are no longer needed or it's just you know we have to reassess what positions we have out there maybe it's something that no longer reason why people aren't applying for it it's kind of we need to relook at it see if we can combine a couple positions and skill a position or something so we're going to look at all that next because I think that's really the biggest way that we're going to be able to keep the budget spellings

[02:26:00]
and I like the breakout of how we intend attempted to put the goals in kind of what programs are aligned with that and as we get a little bit more specific you know going forward I think it's going to be important to even like for our Communications team to make sure that they're letting the public know on how we're doing this and how the goals are aligned with the budget because we went to them for Community Support Community feedback but to make sure that we're continuing to follow through with how everything works hand in hand because honestly I was really disappointed we had a post to go out on social media about we want feedback for policy and reading all the comments on there were really really disheartening and part of me wanted to comment but I was like no I'm going to get into social media award and I don't have time for this but here in a lot of them saying well they don't care anyway they're not going to listen to us and it is because I'm like

[02:27:00]
how do we change that narrative how do we continue to get the information out to them to show that we do this for them you know cuz obviously I would say 90% of the comments on there were not favorable you know and to be able to address it and be intentional with how we're moving forward with our budget is aligned you know it's not just lip service but that we're really moving forward with the actions are matching what we're saying you know so that's important for me you know we can never communicate enough I don't know if it's a fun graphic I don't know if it's a video get that but it has to be short and sweet nothing we do is short and sweet you know but how are we going to make sure that every parent and every District did every level students included will understand the work that we're doing here because there's a huge disconnect still that's happening can I call you so on the sosg side of it the the other piece that's tied to this is still

[02:28:00]
the ongoing Community engagement piece that we must have so once we get our monitoring calendar and we monitoring some pieces and we're doing this the next big step that we're going to have coming up in June is we're going to have a community engagement team and so we're going to talk about that next piece of how we get back out to the community they were very happy with us when we went out and we started the listening sessions so now it's going back out to the community about where we are and we're going to do that part so that's I think how it's going to come about as well so that we can you know we can also be accountable back to to what we said we were going to do and this is how we're doing it I also think that in just watching some of the other boards that are doing monitoring and the way that they're doing it and the way that they take a particular goal and it's advertised because we also thanks to Christy Albright who's already set up our page and getting us ready for that that will create much more

[02:29:00]
this is where the budget is going this is where I expenditures are going and this is how the outcomes are coming about as a result of that so we're definitely still behind the eight-ball there's no doubt because I think people still doubt us because we haven't had a chance to really get past you know we have to get and we have to March towards that piece but we're almost there and I'm excited about the next Community engagement side so I am grateful that we're here tonight on the budget because I wanted the budget to be the budget and this is a really important piece for the community to hear how the budget was being built you know that it was it was reflective of the goals in the guardrails there was a lot of intentionality on that that's the first time we've ever done that since I've been on the board that it's been tied to something like that that kind of conversation so so I think we're starting to get there and we're going to have to

[02:30:00]
build that trust and we're going to have to build that confidence with the community still they're not there yet with us but I think we can get there right so overall like I look forward to our next conversations coming up sooner than later about what we're projecting going forward you know you hear that one scenario that phrase that's been said for years you know if you want to make sure I say it right if you fail to plan you plan to fail you know and we don't want to be behind the eight ball we want to make sure we're looking at and honestly I fully trust you and I think it's been said over and over again that the intentionality even the tone of this meeting versus last meeting a year ago as we've completely pivoted and we're in a whole new Direction and granted you know I'll say that's hats off to you and your team you know we have new leadership in place we're headed in your direction and it's nice to know that we're not in the same position we were last year anywhere close in my opinion

[02:31:00]
everything you guys have done to communicate with us and communicate more and probably even have to simplify it even more than what you've been used to in the past but none of your efforts you know are in vain and I appreciate what your team has done without a doubt but I look forward to you know being able to take a deeper dive into what's coming up because again a 2.2 billion dollar budget is enormous you know and how are we making sure that every dollar spent appropriately that were aligned with enrollment we're aligned with teacher spend because payroll is our biggest line item on there but everything is going hand in hand because right now I don't see it exactly the way it should be especially with the decreasing of enrollment that's happened over eight years but we're going to move there so having said that we will continue

[02:32:00]
I really want to make a pitch perhaps or bring to light that in order for our staff to do the important work that you do not only in finance at the district level administratively speaking but also in the classroom we have got to invest in high quality technology our technology is really and I know we're going to think we're going to replace Lawson or we're going to upgrade or but I say go for the gold because when when the technology makes your job so that is lost time and money

[02:33:00]
my only pitch to the technology Chief to make it possible to just invest in the best thank you before we wrap up board member Peterson and I will make a motion that we approve the budget but before that just one quick because you did such a wonderful job of serve laying out all of the vast array of things that we do for the Olson it just crossed my mind that Community Schools should be under many more things than just wrap around services that Community School calendar

[02:34:00]
so I just since this is such a wonderful list Community Schools should be a real vital part of that and the one other thing a lot of schools do have active student councils and I think that's one one low-cost really effective way of increasing student voice and some are really carrying that out but in some might just need some more support getting started but I'd like to see that and your voice and engagement at it on and thank you if I didn't say that before and I moved that if that is an order that we approve the proposed Albuquerque Public School budget for fiscal year 2024 including Charter School budgets this is Gonzales

[02:35:00]
