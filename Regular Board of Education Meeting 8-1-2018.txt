[00:18:00]
is that it you literally need to have eight arms and legs to try and push this button this button and reach the back and try and reset so Apple will approach them to make a device where it was one-handed and you could reset your Apple computer and they came out came up with some really incredible pieces to give to Apple and they did it with their 3D printer so anyways I just a little tidbit that was really exciting now they're stealth Makerspace offers activities and science technology engineering art literacy transformation and health so stop the creative space provides challenges that helps students acquire and improve literacy skills while using the model of inquiry based learning and we have some photos of them up there if you have ever had the opportunity to see this Makerspace or if you have it you're missing out it is

[00:19:00]
is a mini explora Museum over 450 students participate in this Makerspace and they join the Makerspace once a week for 50 minutes numerous schools have come to visit this and experience with hopes to duplicate it at their schools if you have not visited once again you're missing out this Best in Class program was the brainchild of Christy snow of Egypt Ross Elementary School her love and passion for her students to explore create and learn through Hands-On activities has truly in powered the students at Egypt to reach beyond their potential as the winner of Best in Class E G Ross Elementary received an additional 15000 Grant to further their efforts you can see they received their check at the gala we can't wait to see what they create can create and I just understand that they just finished almost spending that additional 15,000 so they are ready

turn our community four languages and oftentimes the same as having a deficit in his school rather than being the asset that he has he is for APS in our community thank you good afternoon Mr President members of the board my name is Tony by the Army teacher will be starting my 5th Year with APS next week my job is to provide the best education possible for any student that walks through my doors and the only way that I can do that is to get to know my students because when it comes to their needs they are the experts not us and I think that that knowing my students and engaging them at and and listening and actively responding by adjusting my curriculum to meet their needs is what makes my classroom an effective and positive learning environment and I think the same thing should be true for APS as a whole APS needs to listen to our

[00:34:00]
members and respond by adjusting what we do to suit their needs and I'm saying this with regard especially to our Refugee and immigrant students that we need to listen to the to the students in the community members and and let them take the lead to show us how to best serve them thank you I need to the next three speakers are Selena it looks like this Natalie's and Florence Emily Castillo hey Google

[00:35:00]
is that are not being addressed during their educational Journeys these students have been harassed by teachers and fellow classmates for not speaking English and for their immigration status additionally they have been removed from advanced placement classes and placed into remedial classes when their teacher finds out that English is a second language does today we are demanding equity for immigrant Refugee in a silly students in APS three transparent and accountable process that takes miserable outcomes and consideration for Success which are informed by students and community members and youth who are directly impacted and I do feel that it's important for APS to be held accountable for creating a program without the consent of the community good evening board my name is Natalie saying and I'm the ending generator at the New Mexico Asian Family Center I'm here tonight to Advocate on behalf of the communities that we serve in order to

[00:36:00]
what's the importance of creating a welcoming and nurturing environment for all students and to demand equity for recent immigrant Refugee and Asylum students in the district as the child of survivors of the Cambodian genocide who came to the US with little working knowledge of the English language I witnessed firsthand the difficulties that arise with traversing the educational system likewise many of the families we serve at the Asian Family Center are low English proficient not only do they have to struggle with navigating other institutions such as housing and employment they are so tasked with maneuvering the education system right here in Albuquerque it is hard not to see the association between the extra supports that ought to be provided to our recent immigrant refuge in Australia students and their families such as transportation and focus on Educational Learning and the possibilities for success in their educational careers thank you hello

[00:37:00]
my name is Emily Castillo and a PhD student in sociology at the University of New Mexico I'm also part of the ethnic studies research practice partnership with APS as part of the UNM side of that and first and foremost I wanted to address the travesty of the one minute rule when it comes to cutting off the youth that are here we never have students actually invited to the table or allowed to express their what they feel is best for their education and they're the ones that are in the front end of the decisions that we make so to have a we have an amazing opportunity here to share those experiences and we didn't let him have those but I do want to address the idea of the newcomer school not being geared towards high school students especially in terms of stem one of the things that has been found in terms of successful stem is that when teachers identify and incorporate students cultural and linguistic experiences intellectual resources for scientific learning they provide opportunities for students to learn and to use language and to think in ways that make

[00:38:00]
I'm very successful and I bring this up in terms of the New Mexico being a place for stem opportunities and we're not preparing our students and this is an area where we could be doing that through the newcomers engaging high school students thank you the next three speakers are Tony Watkins Janet Sayers and Martha Favela everybody approached me about helping to organize an education reform with political refugees for APS I asked what they wanted to get out of the we just want them to know that we were here said we invited every principle in the International District their board member and others administrators we had a good turnout of community members and other elected

[00:39:00]
outside of City Center on a hunger strike clearly political refugees are still not being seen or heard in APS this is in direct violation of APs family engagement policy KB written by Family Center for education and passed United States by the board in 2012 I encourage you to watch the press conference for July 30th if you haven't seen it yet the problem is named the demands are clear and there's a plan written by community members that would better serve political Refugee and immigrant students thank you and I met Martin and

[00:40:00]
2008 when I was a volunteer with Catholic Charities and had my first experience working with refugees that had come from camps in in Africa and and doing things with high school students that had no command of English at all but so Martin's going to speak and and my last 25 seconds yes the Del Norte High School alumni we're going to be helping at registration starting Friday and then next Monday and Tuesday I'm glad to say that the Chick-fil-A across the street from Del Norte is going to provide sandwiches and fruit for our welcome back teacher lunch which is on Friday August the 10th and and last but not least thanking Margaret Callahan in real estate in Carolyn Brown in capital planting and I

[00:43:00]
immigrant and Refugee community and all the families deserve an education quality education and I want to ask for access to different types of language culture in a program for new students for our children for our youth who deserve to be included is the price for 2031 we should be able to demonstrate the cultures and the language and how they can make this nation more powerful preparing young multilingual students to be able to come against different kinds of challenges and

[00:44:00]
any situation and for the language to not be a barrier for anybody that is Teresa poor 2017 I would like to thank you for the opportunity that you've given me today to ask you to take into consideration the opinion of people who are immigrants and refugees in this community so that we can know how we can find this new program thank you so much hey the next three speakers

[00:45:00]
and I can't read this one at all cuz it looks like it's just a signature let's see the address is UNM MSC who wrote that one OK Google

[00:46:00]
listen to serve to have access to Equitable education that includes being in my language and in a way that I can actually understand it not just in your minimum it is not enough to make a program that only covers k-6 knowing that middle schoolers in high schoolers are at the age where we began to realize and see what is actually going on around us and tend to notice all the barriers and discrimination thrown at us there needs to be inclusivity in this program the needs of immigrant and Refugee students must be taking into consideration most importantly the new programs must take into account nearly arrived immigrants who faced many of the same barriers and education as refugees students and I'm saying all of this because I truly believe that as students are just for more than a number in the system you want to create a program to help in the education of his being so not willing to make it in our language accessible to Immigrant and Ashley students are in a way that we can easily learn we need APS to work with us students and families who are the ones who should be sharing what this program should look like it's time for us to work together for our voices to be heard thank you

[00:47:00]
good evening the board Republicans to learn how to speak English it takes the support and encouraging today we are asking APS to please listen to the communities and listen to the agencies and everybody who's here to please develop a solution to develop a newcomer program that will that will make that if you just need to make friends need refugees and immigrants that have to go to college to become doctors and to achieve their dreams studying a program that only made sixth grade it's not going to help them it's setting them to fella it doesn't say them to a success we come here for Education we want to go back home I want people from home to another way thank you

[00:51:00]
Vicente and values a strong language access plan we know that believes perception relationship attitude and writing and writing rules that step and influence every aspect of our school functions Thank you period I'm very disappointed in aps's proposed newcomer program and it does not resemble anything that I recommended during my time as the Refuge point of contact APS claims of the newcomer program is being implemented being modeled after the newcomers school and Denver I visited the newcomer programs within Denver public schools and the aps proposal looks nothing like them

[00:52:00]
by giving only Refugee students the option to attend a school does not constitute an effective program transportation for students district-wide needs to be addressed effective newcomer professional development needs to be invested in for K through 12 teachers we can't segregate 6th graders into an elementary school all English Learners including Spanish speakers need to have access to the programs and high school high school students struggle the most priority needs to be given to high school followed by middle school and Elementary School students thank you to my community first of all I want to say thank you for the newcomers program

[00:53:00]
I just want to say this is not enough we need this for our middle school students for our specialty the high school students just this year I found out that five of my high school students that they dropped out of high school and they started working as fast food because they don't understand this speak the language they don't understand the materials and I want more support for my Refugee communities for transportation and that's it thank you good afternoon my name is Khadijah and I'm the founder of an organization called Vision Center advocate for African-Americans in African refugees in English I was a former state employee and saw first-hand

[00:54:00]
refugees were treated due to the language barrier so I retired and went to advocate for the African refugees I visit homes for the third graders out read the 11th graders so I tried to start a charter school but I was told by one of you not to start a charter school but to make APS be accountable for the education of these kids so I asked you is that not what this audience is here to do to make to hold APS accountable for the education of these kids thank you good evening

[00:55:00]
I'm here in support of all of in solidarity of everything that's been said I wish there was room for flexibility I think one minute so rushed that we really didn't do justice to the people that showed up this evening to get their points across and share their stories but in my short minute I'd like to highlight that you know I think in the future and now we want to work collaboratively to bring the best possible education to our students or our families and I think that's a shared goal that we can all kind of be grounded in but honestly it feels like it hasn't been very collaborative and there's a lot of people that put in a lot of work to recommend things that APS could do to support our students and our families and they were just changed last minute and we're dealing with that and that's what this is about and my he's amazing if you want to learn something he's on my Facebook live on my Facebook page I didn't encourage you to hear what he has to say because it really is important our stories do matter you know and just a shout out Mama's outside the office yesterday and a 12-hour hunger strike and it's pretty serious

[00:56:00]

[01:00:00]
time APS is the only educational institution in Albuquerque that students and families overwhelmingly choose year after year after year we like to brag about our Innovative from here to here from here to cancel

[01:01:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:02:00]
uniqueness of our Urban Suburban rural District by tailoring the needs of our students to their neighborhood superintendent rockelle

[01:03:00]
important friends from All Over America are taking notice and investing in our students and locally more of you are giving directly to our students in schools in fact the aps Education Foundation recently raised its first 1 million dollars clothes were resilient

[01:04:00]
we're strong we're inspired by other Albuquerque in Spanish

[01:05:00]
get on the implementation plan for the Next Generation science standards is a discussion item presenters are Dr Madeline Cerner mobile who is the assistant superintendent Equity instruction and support and Amy Bellagio who's the executive director of curriculum instructions we didn't have a PowerPoint president of my teacher advisory Council who are kind of my dream team Heather's from Desert Ridge Middle School from Jefferson Middle School Christmas break from El Dorado High School

[01:06:00]
so we wanted to remind the board that the standards were adopted through a rule in the fall of 2017 they've actually only been in effect for one month as of today the state adopted national standards as written with an addition of six New Mexico specific standards which are really just local illustrations of national standards currently 19 states of adopted the Next Generation science standards with an additional 20 States adopting the standards that are based on the Next Generation framework this represents about 35% of the student population in the US right now so when I tried to kind of summarize in simple terms what the Next Generation science standards were about with the key shift was for me it was from learning about to figuring it out so it's really an emphasis on

[01:07:00]
inquiry and constructivist learning around phenomena it's more of a change in an approach to learning and pedagogy than a change in the content or how we look at the content they're also three dimensions to the standard scientific practices cross-cutting Concepts and disciplinary core ideas which all combined to form performance expectations which describe what students should be able to do so when I started this process I realized that while I spent almost 20 years as a teacher I did not spend 20 years as a teacher of Science and didn't know enough to really make a good plan so I sent out a call to all of the national board certified teachers in the district who had an endorsement in science and 12 Bravo stepped forward to help me in this challenge we met for three days during the Spring we had two days

[01:08:00]
and they all said after the second day we really need an additional day and so I am deeply deeply indebted to these individuals who really worked hard at this and really put themselves in the shoes of all teachers new teachers inexperienced teachers teachers at all level to try and make recommendations so they addressed one key question how do we introduce introduce the Next Generation science standards to teachers and what supports do they need in terms of ongoing professional development instructional materials and collaborative opportunities the discussions were rich and range from General philosophies of Education in the classroom but there was some themes upon which there was brought agreement teachers need to have an easy way to buy consumables for their classrooms without spending their own money

[01:09:00]
teachers need more training and experience with project-based learning and inquiry teacher shouldn't buy instructional materials and tell we have a thorough understanding of all the standards and how exactly and what we need and we should figure out if some of the stuff we have will still work and redistribute it among schools and levels teachers need more time to talk to other teachers about science and some teachers don't feel as confident in their science knowledge as others and need some support and that there are lots of great resources out there in our community that we could leverage and take advantage of in addition to that there were some recommendations that this group made that were level specific based on the needs of elementary schools and secondary teachers some of the recommendations for elementary teachers were very similar teachers need time to talk to teachers at the school and they also need time to talk to teachers in middle schools and high schools so that they can

[01:10:00]
vertically articulate things they need time to work with the science kits before school starts so that they feel confident in using them they need extra support when they're a new teacher because science is difficult to teach they may need some Refreshers on science content and questioning strategies that are really useful for inquiry learning and they know that the kids that we have currently may not aligned well but they'd like a voice when we do choose instructional materials in what we choose there were also some recommendations that were specific to the secondary teachers they were concerned about the availability of high-quality instructional materials and teacher resources when they do find good resources they want an ability to share these very easily with other teachers so that they can maximize that kind of collaboration and online collaboration they want to make sure that administrators know that they're teaching May

[01:11:00]
look different so that when administrators go into a classroom and see an inquiry-based Learning lesson they don't misinterpret it is chaos they know that's what learning looks like they want high-quality PD and then that's more important than ever and it should include resources and strategies that they can bring right back to their classrooms so we used all of this feedback and lots lots lots more to inform our implementation plan for next year and I realize this is really difficult to read I'm hoping your copies a little more readable one of the things that I thought we should make you aware of is that the PED does have a time line for implementation which is exactly a month ago and I want to share that with you their plan is a little different than ours their plan was that this year all classrooms are teaching a line to the Next Generation science standards they have webinars posted online

[01:12:00]
play the PED website and they did continue to have making sense of science workshops over the summer in terms of Assessments and this will be in common with us because it's assessments are determined by the state the SBA is going to remain the same this year but there's going to be additional field test items that are added so that they can test how they what kind of items would be appropriate for the new standards end of course exams are going to be a hybrid that includes only the items that are common to both the old standards and the new next-gen standards and next year next year all assessments are going to be aligned to the next gen standards so with that in mind we have a recommended timeline recognizing that as a very large District I really felt like the timeline for the PED was not attainable

[01:13:00]
and would just encourage frustration on the part of teachers and students seem like an unrealistic expectation for a district this size so we have a recommended timeline that we're proposing which is similar for this year we're recommending that rather than all teachers teaching the standards wall to wall without any PD that they just experiment with inquiry-based instruction and Collaborative Learning this year that next year teachers take an existing science unit and modify it or redesign it around the new standards and try that out in their classroom and that the following year the 2021 years when we would begin full implementation of the standards across all grade levels with that said any teacher who felt ready and wanting to implement early certainly could but I really felt like we wouldn't be able to provide them sufficient enough support to implement

[01:14:00]
play for a couple of years across the state in the nation there's a recognition that there's a serious lack of high-quality comprehensive curricula and instructional materials that are next-gen designed as opposed to next-gen aligned so our state has partnered with four other states to co-design a curriculum that will be offered as an open educational resource for districts to APS middle schools applied and are piloting that curriculum called at Kennedy and Van Buren and they've already undergone 4 days of professional development with the state to around implementation of units in this new curriculum and it was really kind of exciting the other thing that we wanted to do to support teachers immediately is print out some resources that would be handy to them for as resources so this is even as we speak at the

[01:15:00]
what is with graphic enterprise system it's a set of the standards that are grouped by topic so clustered together in meaningful groups that somebody could design a lesson around rather than just lists it has some kind of basic information some explanatory information The Curriculum maps for all grade levels standards and we've had to hold off on printing because those were just released yesterday but those are being printed for teachers right now and just as an overview this this year our plan is to first began by training instructional coaches and principal so that they can have an awareness of this and begin to be knowledgeable conversations with their teachers as they want to talk about what implementing the standards is going to look like in their schools we are planning to develop some

[01:16:00]
short as my department some short PD modules that can be rolled out to schools in little bite-size increments so like a 20-minute 30 minute module so that maybe it's staff meetings or in department meetings people could do a little small segments of PD to familiarize themselves with it we are planning for a full day of professional development in January for secondary science teachers to begin this the elementary teachers are all implementing a new Ela curriculum and so we really didn't want to throw two things at them in one year but I think the secondary teachers are raring to go and then could help the elementary teachers in future years we're going to revamp our department website and put up all the great resources we can find so that his people want to explore that material is available to them and we've begun an ongoing process of reviewing any instructional

[01:17:00]
cereals that are made available so that when the adoption time does come around for us we will have a knowledge of knowledge about what's available out there and with that myself and my teachers stand for questions from the board thank you very much so what what does that look like so my understanding is that they are that the PED has elicited has gotten a bunch of teachers to come together and compare the previous set of Standards with the new science standards and look for standards that are in common and then look at the item Banks from the eocs to find test items that align to that so all of the questions that they

[01:18:00]
would have would be questions that they had developed previously but we're covering topics and standards that were common to both the previous state standards and the Next Generation standards okay well that's good I was just worried that maybe some people you know some teachers at work yet that would be difficult for the Student Center thank you again full stop

[01:19:00]
what's the score for instance in particular teachers have not had an opportunity to talk professionally about science instruction for a very long time in fact there has been a whole lot of pressure to block them from having that conversation so starting out with that approach of how do how do we teach and one of the things that struck me is how can how can we make sure that teachers like if there's one school where there are several teachers that are well-established and ready to step in and start teaching but I think he pointed out that there may be some schools that's not the case where there's maybe only one or two teachers who are ready what can we do is a district to make sure that they have an opportunity to collaborate with other teachers and other schools to because that will give them the tools to go back to their own School home

[01:20:00]
high school and health in that process so I have I have a couple of of hopes for that one is that our new STEM Magnet pathway that we have in the valley cluster has said that they would like to be early adopters of the standards and come on board early and that they would be willing to serve as a lab so that people could visit their school and see what that has looked like we've had some other schools and teachers some members of my team who have volunteered to be early adopters of this and share their learnings with other teachers one of my other hopes is that if we begin with the secondary teachers first who are people who are a little more secure sometimes in their content knowledge because they selected that content is their area of focus that those teachers we can bring them together with the elementary teachers to Mentor elementary teachers and that there could be some some kind of

[01:21:00]
learning that happens as we bring the elementary teachers on board is that answer I really appreciate putting the assessment part to the side and saying what's important is figuring out how to teach and we'll take care of the assessment when it's appropriate I also really appreciate saying teachers need a chance to mess with this before so I just I really appreciate the the course of project base learning is the kind of learning that all students are going to do that hopefully we can really

[01:22:00]
diverse group of students in that process also I think I think that's everything I have for now it's just I think from the board point of view it's really important that we kind of continue to hear from you so that as we're looking at budget as we're looking at instructional materials we're really hearing from the practitioners that we hear about things in a timely enough way that we can really respond to that to so will be will be relying on you a whole lot to to stay in communication with us so that's done well thank you I was just I just want to say thank you also for including the teachers in the development of it because I think it was you know that was really important but what I was noticing is I looked through the list it's it's great because you all so have teachers that are teaching in a variety

[01:23:00]
indicative of some of the issues of just where some of our school districts are and so I'll be really interested too and seeing how you know it's rolling out as opposed to some of like our different zones and to some of our issues which I think is really clearly associated with a lot of our public comment tonight too because I'm really interested in how the ELA side of it you know starts to to come on board and do students have an opportunity to explore and step into those opportunities as they feel ready to do that to get into maybe a course or explore a course with the teacher that is is teaching to one of those you know next Generation science modules so yeah I appreciate that like you know the feedbacks are coming back because I'm assuming there will be some challenges and it will be important for us as a board to understand what those challenges are so that we can know like what you know what are the things that we're going to have to take into account

[01:24:00]
and I appreciate your time and effort into that I don't have anything additional information and look forward to hearing from you again thank you so much thank you very much

[01:25:00]
but so the question of how you do cross-discipline kinds of Assessments for example is going to be interesting because students may know a lot more about one subject than another subject depending upon what they're taking and that doesn't mean that that's not what you want to do inside you call it cross-functional training for those of you and the ability for us to work between mathematics biology

[01:26:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:27:00]
are you working with the community cuz we got a lot of community people who who understand a lot about science in this community and so I think again with our ideas and Community Schools and those kinds of things work with our community we'll see a lot of energy around trying to say oh well let's let's try some of these things you know that you guys are going to be working on so I'm very very pleased with the idea of the framework in particular I like the framework a lot I'm not all excited about adding new things I think there was a great set of people who work this out so hopefully we in New Mexico will learn from all those people that are putting things in not just trying to make up our own thing and try to learn from that so as we get curriculum as we get things so hopefully that'll be good so

[01:28:00]
thank you very much appreciate the presentation will go on to Item B which is the briefing on the National Association of Latino elected and appointed officials did not have 35th annual conference and our board member Peggy Miller are gone I was there and is one of the members of the board so Peggy tell us what you learned or what happened just so everyone knows that this is just what I heard so none of this is has any of my opinion in there so it's just the facts as they were presented so I'll just tell you about a couple of the sessions that I went to because it'd be impossible to go through all of them I just I couldn't do that so one of them that I went to that I know is important here in in New Mexico and across the country was titled a strong financial future the importance of

[01:29:00]
Russian fund management so some of the things that they had several people speaking different advisors and they had the mayor pro-tem from Santa Ana California speaking and some of the things they said that were important were to go to a defined benefit to go to a defined contribution the promises that are made by the government their promises are made and we have this assumed rate of return which is the chicken or we have the pension which is the promise which is the egg and that's exactly how they how they said it so exactly then they talked a lot about the buying power of of Latinos it is the buying power is like 2.1 trillion dollars which is tremendous and in their Pension funds for Latinos it's like 2 0. 8 8 5

[01:30:00]
Latinos would control the money then they would be more able to control the agenda so a lot of why we don't have the political Powers because we don't have the economic power and then the Santa mayor Pro tem is Santa Ana her name is Michelle Martinez she she spoke and she was very Dynamic and so she talked about when she first started on the council she just was oh let's give give give give give give give give give and then you know what happened everybody knows what happened in Santa Ana so they're trying to get back to where they could because we know what happened so some of the things that she said is that the quality of life will diminish as raises are giving without money coming in obviously she said that taxes are regressive and they really do hurt the Working Poor she said that they gave raises but then they had to implement attacks so she stress being fiscally conservative

[01:31:00]
is doing the right thing but of the 6999 vacant Parcels half of them are owned by Santa Ana so that's obviously concerning concerning to her she said if we don't do the right thing our communities will suffer she also you know said just like us we know that most of our budget goes to salaries so her thing to tell them in Santa Ana was stop giving raises that was her thing is figuring out where we can cut she said what we do is when we give raises they are in perpetuity in the form of Pensions so that's what she said one of the things that she said if a federal judge was brave enough to put this out there that she would think that dumping to find benefits was the thing to do and she also said if you don't have a pension stability fund

[01:32:00]
I don't know exactly know what that is she said to create one so I know Tammy is not here but we need to see if she can talk to the pension people so our Erb Etc para she said one time funds can't balance a budget and we always know that we can't give raises from one time fun so she said in the Pension funds that we need to make sure we have Venture Capital private Equity public equity and to make sure you have a certain portion of real estate in your pension fund she said the most important thing is that we have a fiduciary responsibility and the return on investment is the main responsibility if you do well we all do well so to be and to be socially fiscally conservative but so we responsible then I listen to some people talk about some colleges and things that they could do in one of the most important things that this person had to say was

[01:33:00]
get transportation out of the way first cuz that's really affects that we don't realize how much that really affects a child's ability to learn if they can't get their got to get that out of the way first and then incentives need to be aligned around completion and this was more talking about higher education they talked about having the community everybody having one goal having everyone involved the business people being at the ground level which I know is something that we do try to do to use innovation funding to lower the cost use technology demand better having everyone held accountable and that education just doesn't just belong to school board members that it belongs to to all leaders which includes business State leaders Nationals just not us then I went to one about the opioid crisis which was it was very interesting there is this company called biobot

[01:34:00]
FedEx company and what they do and this was fascinating as they test Wastewater and as I said we all urinate sorry so you can estimate the opiate opiate metabolites I guess right so they just measure for drugs in their water so that they know what drugs are being used and they can send out the right resources so if you know what's being used and you can send out who you need out into the community so I thought that was rather fascinating to me so and they're growing too it's a small I mean it's a company that's just starting out but they do have some some small towns and that are using this and the addiction policy forums said that we have 21 million people in the United States that have an addiction which is it's very sad that we're losing a lot of our kids

[01:35:00]
so this one is kind of a hard one to listen to we lose 63,000 are lost to drug addiction a year so you think about a town of 63,000 people are gone and that's that's our future so that one was a hard one from the ages of 25 to 34 it's gone from 4% to 20% that are dying from an overdose 42,000 deaths from opioid overdose so one of the some of the things they suggested is doing more research we need to know how to treat better we have to expand prevention and education to keep from people from trying to drugs and one of the things they said which I personally said I wouldn't put my opinion in here so I won't but what they say is try to keep people from trying drugs till their brain is fully developed that is women at 21 and men at 2500

[01:36:00]
naloxone which is something that I know that we're doing and clean syringes work on child welfare recovery support as addiction is a disease and then we need to do something with law enforcement and criminal justice to reduce drugs coming into our country and of course we all know expanding alternatives to incarceration as we know many of the people who are incarcerated they just have some kind of mental problem or an addiction problem they're really not bad people they're not really criminals the federal bills that are out there right now are Kara and cures and then there's something called the Blue Prince project but I don't go into those the other one was strengthening session I went to was strengthening the educational pipeline for college completion and it's about a promise program and I'm sure many of you already know about it and I think that's a lot

[01:37:00]
is just making sure that first you know I think they have their first year that they have paid for and most of the kids at Cerritos College the president was speaking Jose Fierro or 70% Latino that take part in this program which is wonderful some of the things he said that leaders need to do is brand yourself successfully have conviction know your facts don't assume have integrity find your strengths Define who needs you have courage find forums where you can shine study in exchange ideas and manage your finances have a clear strategy and one of the things he said that we all need to be careful with when it comes to social media is understand what you should post respond to people in a reasonable amount of time and don't throw grenades using action-based posting so and your press releases should reflect you your voice and properly dis

[01:38:00]
and then one of the last ones I'll talk about was the census 2020 John Jarman the acting census director gave a talk about the census 2020 he wants to make sure that everybody knew that title 13 keeps a survey results safe and this is talking to a lot of our population that are there saying that they are fearful so he wanted to make sure that they know that it's illegal to share a person's responses with law enforcement or ice violating this law this is something I didn't know violating this law by sharing this information is a federal crime with a presence sentence for the person who does it up to five years and a fine of up to 250,000 dollars or both so this is also public information it is not government information

[01:39:00]
and it's been protected all the way up to the high courts and also data is immune to legal proceedings Census Bureau confidentiality is very high as title 13 requires that those who have access to this information or sworn to protect this information for life so there's one for life he said census is a tool to empower and not marginalized every survey has people who Skip questions and the citizenship question is the last one on the subway and he also said there's not support for the claim that this one question would reduce response rates the American Community survey data showed that those who didn't answer that particular question was 11.6 to 12.3 percent of the Hispanic respondents but there were similar non-response rates for other questions as well so it wasn't just this question the question was placed last to minimize the impact on census

[01:40:00]
bounce rates we talked about how much time they would have to remove citizenship question they were hoping the decision would be made by Fall otherwise they might have to reprint the surveys and that would add to the cost the cost for the 2020 survey though would be different as in the past as much of it will be completed online this time and not on paper across the world those survey results have been falling so knowing if we know this it's important to allocate funds to market the census since we know that people aren't responding to surveys as much as they used to and that we need to make sure to reach out to heart to count populations California of 90 million in census Outreach and we have the census forward funded already a billion dollars $500 million has been allocated and I think used already

[01:41:00]
conduct 42 focus groups and Survey 50,000 households to examine the attitudes they have about privacy and confidentiality and find out about census barrier motivators and get a communication plan and that's going to be gathered and hopefully by this fall they will come up with I guess the theme for the census and they're going to spend $200,000 on partnership plans and one of the things that they said if we're concerned about our heart to count population to form a complete count committee which is what a lot of states are doing and just form Partnerships faith faith organizations local County state level League of cities and the external parties and if people don't participate then they win so it's in everyone's best interest to complete the census and the quote that I got that I remember from those three or four days that I was there was from a child

[01:42:00]
Google was just asking people if I could ask for anything it would just be for you adults to listen and be kind thank you Peggy appreciate a lot of information do you know how was the criteria for selecting those individuals as far as what I remember him saying is that that was random it was that's what I understood that it was going to be random survey so in addition to the census form there's a survey

[01:43:00]
it's been sent out to see I think they've done that remember Patterson that American Community survey so that's I think done every time that they do a census from what I understand on top of that though the focus groups that they're going to have that something that's different it's a different so I want to share with you that I did receive the survey and in reading the survey if I don't completely I can be prosecuted for not completing the survey I don't know if anybody else has received the survey I was one of those people that was actually selected my household was selected so if we don't complete the survey we would be in severe trouble with my husband and I said that American Community survey what what Mr Jarman said is there and this is what he was talking about he was talking mostly about the census not about that survey so all I can say is if somebody Skips a question and I know because the last time

[01:44:00]
turn on my family was doing the survey there was a question that we skipped and so what they did is they came out to out to our home several times until we decided that we just finally had to answer the question and this took like 6 or 7 months and they just came out every month until we decided to answer the question but I I can't tell you if you don't answer the you know the that survey that you would be prosecuted I didn't hear that I did not hear that at all there's a letter attached to you yeah I would find that thank you so much you're welcome

[01:45:00]
what they were saying is that they don't incentivize they don't incentivize completion of your degree so there's no and there's there's no incentives there which I think is you have we're not looking at that the output we're kind of looking at the input or inputting students but we're not looking at the output so there's no incentives for them to take them out so it's a matter of trying to create that and that's really was talking about higher ed you're welcome

[01:46:00]
there's enough fear in the community that we don't need to add to it but with that said I think it is really critical since you know part of our part of the information that's gone out to the Immigrant Community is for instance you don't have to open the door if someone doesn't have a warrant that there are things that families are doing that they feel like they need to do to be safe and protect himself but the importance of the sense of is different in that we do need help but it is a federal responsibility and looking at the budget that we have in the state I think we need to keep doing everything we possibly can for the Federal Way

[01:47:00]
so thanks for the information right and then so everybody knows there is this if you go to the website there is something called Rome r o a m and that is something that I think that's New Mexico needs to make sure to use because it does give all the hard to count areas on a map for cities in and it tells you what areas are going to be hard to count so that would be important to make sure to get that information in this is just my opinion out there to make sure we know what areas are going to be hard to count in our city and our state so that is available for anybody it's for every state so you just go to the the website and its r o a m and this just gets hard to count areas on a map so cities counties and States know where to send their message so there will be places you need to send a message out for piano

[01:48:00]
places that might be harder for us to count like we might talk about you know like the Navajo reservation that might be more difficult because they don't have access to you know certain things that we may have in our city just so people in our community support passing on to the Council Office 2020 and the board voted unanimously other than just one board

[01:49:00]
pretty much okay great other comments at all well thank you thank you I appreciate it very much and I appreciate your participation in the Leo folks I think that is an important interface for us and so it's good to get information back and it's good to have representation there I think that's good for APS so thank you very much I appreciate it I will go on to the last item here which is a briefing on the 2018 New Mexico and the Board of Education director meeting and that's three of us some Peggy and Barbara and I'm going to start off with Barbara on the board of directors tell us anything that you think is important

[01:50:00]
has some very responsible managing of money so good things happen one of the priorities has been the scholarship program and so that's that's all good one of one of the big things that was decided was to go ahead and purchase right now the New Mexico School Board Association has its offices upstairs upstairs

[01:51:00]
and it has space for actually conducting meetings in business and so the decision was made to go ahead and make that purchase and it's going to be cost-effective because either the upstairs can be held on to invented out or can be sold and its its prime location so it seems like it would be a good a good purchase the fall Regional meetings are going to be for ours it's Wednesday October 10th in Mount Airy and the way that the regional meetings in the first meeting the topic is decided upon by the board by the executive board that are based on what request and the spring meeting the topic is decided by the by the beach

[01:52:00]
we had changes to the bylaws and the policy that mainly was just bringing it into alignment with like the names of current conferences in meetings that people need to go to the big the big topic that will be on the agenda for the December conference is a constitutional change that would prohibit nominations from the floor and of the board of the board of the group that the policy changes we were unanimous and saying that was the case because it's a Statewide organization without knowing ahead who's being nominated there's really no opportunity to learn anything at all about them and so the procedures

[01:53:00]
just saying if you're serious because it's a huge time commitment to take on those executive positions that we need to have time to know who people are to listen to their story to get to know them and to make informed decisions so that would be a change that would be voted on in the December meeting so that was really supposed to be an educational

[01:54:00]
play either either pulling people out from a board or of going around and approaching teachers separately without looking at the governance structure within the within the districts and there is really concerned about the disregard for the elected bodies so that was just discussed but no action no action was taken the associate the conference itself is to me the most valuable part is just having a chance to sit down and talk to people you know it's always really interesting similarities that has a whole other set of

[01:55:00]
add implementing the next-gen science standards a large district has one kind of obstacle just because of the size of the district and yet if you're employed the resources that you have for implementation a real difference and so just listening and thinking about the how did the the state is of information the last two conferences have had some opportunity for address and I think there's some really serious concerns for tribal governments the the over

[01:56:00]
federal law of state law of funding of local control all of those issues just really get augmented and Amplified I think for for tribes that are trying to really look at everything from Dual language programs to just funding issues and so I think that's going to be an ongoing conversation of how do we use the School Board Association well I mean something that I learned is for the session on guns on campus some of the things that I did not know is that the people that could carry guns onto campus that I didn't know

[01:57:00]
so besides peace officers obviously and the sros and people involved in ROTC but people that are in a class involved in carrying a deadly weapon or people that are older than 19 on and they're on school premises in a vehicle for protection of their self or others I didn't know that that was allowed so did you I didn't know that that you could carry it on in your vehicle onto campus but they said you could so that's an interesting one because I thought the gun-free zone would keep that from happening so that had me a little bit confused because I thought you wouldn't be able to do that if you had gun free zones that you still wouldn't be able to carry it on to the parking lot if that was a gun for it'd be interesting to find out if that I'm I don't know if anybody else was in that are you talking about

[01:58:00]
play older than 19 that's on school premises in a vehicle or typically not for law for protection of their self or others so it's basically saying anybody who's not a student if they're protecting themselves or others that they can so I just thought that would be a conflict with with gun-free zone fighting to get more clarification

[01:59:00]
I wanted to give a shout out to some APS schools when it came to growth and student achievement in math seven of the 10 top schools were APS schools so I don't remember them all I know like Desert Willow Northstar Hubert Humphrey Ames I can't remember Double Eagle that's why Jackson I don't I don't remember what the seven were but I just want to give a shout out to them because they deserve it so I thought that was awesome and then also student achievement in language arts Early College Academy was 87784.4 Desert Willow 76.3% so I think that that is a story that we often don't tell that we need to make sure that we do tell that there are really some good things going on out there that we need to Corrales I have to say Corrales cuz that's in my district

[02:00:00]
if there's been tremendous growth there and also Montessori of the Rio Grande so I'm going to give a shout out to them and it was the other thing that I thought was really fun we went to the color communication session I think that Barbara was was in there and it was I just always think it's fun to see what kind of a person you are and what the world's population is so if you can see yourself in this 45% of the world population is gold color which means you're structure oriented organized do you like order and rules respect and dependability are important you need to be on time you need to follow a plan or schedule I was not gold did you know I'm not 30% of the 30% of the population is orange they tend to be creative and active become bored and Restless with routine and structure they desire Independence and freedom that's me

[02:01:00]
15% of the world population is blue they tend to be communicative compassionate and pathetic their cooperative and like Harmony and then the other 10% is green they crave information data drives her soul and there's never enough data they seek a challenge and they enjoy exploring ideas so and this I want to leave you with went to the politics ethics and social media session did you go to that one did you go to that one day so whenever you're using social media be careful they said no right is without its limitations conduct yourself in a manner that reflects well on the district and remember everything you post remember the rule is treat every post as if it will appear on the front page not of a local newspaper but of a national newspaper

[02:02:00]
I just a couple of Impressions you know what I've been going to these meetings a long time it's kind of like being an adult for a long time and and I kind of heard a lot of the same things to tell you the truth you know in the meetings and I don't think that's bad necessarily because I think there are a lot of new people to come and you know we need to hear a lot of things and so I think that's okay for me I'm not sure I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do you know I've heard this a lot you know please don't post something if you don't want it to be you know your mom to see it but I did think that the you know the presentation

[02:03:00]
candidates who gave us a little bit of a Spiel on the education and I think generally speaking for both of them I heard a lot of similar things maybe from a different perspective in each one but you know a lot of them really said both of them both of them really said it's important for us to have a voice I don't think either one of them are interested in and totally revamping

[02:04:00]
effective on some things but pretty much we're very much I think oriented to trying to help education and not necessarily just fix it you know I don't think they're interested in just fixing something I think they're interested in how do we really work together and how do we collaborate so I'm looking forward to that I think it's part of it no matter who's the who's the real one who wins the election so it's good to hear from both of them and I think that's important for us to as they really have a voice in how that education process going to work and so I think from our perspective group you know we need to know how to do that and I think we're going to have an interesting transition so I think

[02:05:00]
we need to be proactive in terms of what we're doing and and what you know the state really wants us to do and how we can work locally here to to better our education so so I thought that was good and of course I love towels and the house is a wonderful place you know you have to drive someplace that's not a bad place to drive to and and I think just talking with all the different people I think that was what was really important and I would like to say that relative to the issue of not taking nomination from the floor I would like to take some personal emphasis on what I think is the right thing I got so tired of people nominating people from the floor and I had no idea who they were I had

[02:06:00]
no information about them at all and there's a little group here that that wanted somebody I said well we have a nominating committee here on the board they look at all nominations you have to fill out a little form and you have to put in a little resume and you have to say what you're about and so the people get a chance to read that they get a chance to hear about that and that's that's why we have a nominating committee the only time I would allow nomination for before and I remember I told you I would never run again if I do because I'm tired of hearing from people's you know part of being kind of responsible to if you don't know you want to run until the moment nominated that's a little late

[02:07:00]
you know I think you ought to plan it out you ought to decide because it's a commitment let me tell you something it's a commitment if you're going to commit to being a vice president that means you're going to have one year's vice president one year's president-elect 1 years president and one year after that that's for your commitment you better not you better decide that you want to be there and you want to help do this if that's what you're going to be your commitment so good job that's right Alexa

[02:08:00]
from this large District here so and they're the ones who meet with the staff at the nmsba and they go over all the bylaws and the various other things that need to be done and I guarantee you that stuff and msba is efficient very very good there is one of the best in this country and for the cost that we have is they do so it's just a great organization thank you very much and thank you for being until later okay so we'll go on to our apartment anymore

[02:09:00]
recommendations for our immigrant and Refugee brothers and sisters specifically the newcomer program I mean we have students we have parents we have Advocates and we have teachers in the room and I'd like to know whether or not their input was considered or if they were invited to the table when the discussions took place and when changes were made to the newcomer program I'd also like to mention to that I'm still trying to master English and you know four languages so I just I appreciate and I enjoyed watching you when you presented about transportation to last year too and that is always stuck with me and I have and I have had that discussion with other people since then so the issue around transportation and you know and and hearing from folks like Natalie saying who who was the speaker at our civil rights and diversity conference last year as well

[02:10:00]
I don't know if the board realizes the incredible amount of people that are in this room everything from Rachel white to to Travis to sorry both Tony's and I mean there is an incredible group of people in this room and I'm sorry I didn't name all of you that are in here but you know Selena I mean an incredible group in this people in this room today and I really appreciate that and it speaks volumes to have you be in the same room and share your concerns about about this program and and I really want to know more about you know what what are the recommended changes that you know Rachel brought up as well so I'd like to see more about the newcomer program and about the suggested changes that are being made and and how were involving this incredible group of advisors that you have sitting in this room

[02:11:00]
thank you thanks thank you very much I remember Patterson when I start this Saturday's thank you so much for being here and I appreciate this is probably the second or third time I've heard from you from the community or Advocates are here I heard from them on Monday and very telling stories but what I wanted to say is that you know APS does a lot of things for for our families for Children and Families you know we keep our children safe from you know ice we've managed to keep is away from our schools we have saved songs for children for LGBT for a dreamers if you don't feel safe you know where to go in school period

[02:12:00]
not to include the citizenship question on on the census 2020 so there's a list of things that APS does and so but one of the things I wanted to say is that I believe that our community needs to be involved the voices need to be at the table everybody needs to be at the table when APS makes decisions we always involve the community and some of those folks are here today and I appreciate that they're here they've taken the time they spent an awful lot of time working out in the community and we need to honor their voice I think it is incumbent upon APS to honor all the voices in the community that we hear from all the stakeholders when we make these decisions because together we can't do this alone it takes all of us and together I think we can come up with solutions that work

[02:13:00]
turn on for everybody and so I would hope that we involve this community this year and all of the other stakeholders that are not here today and I would hope that we all can work together I'm here to also support our community as well and thank you so much for being here thank you very much so first of all I just want to say thank you to everyone that came out for the public forum tonight because I want you to know that I do stand in solidarity for the issues in the concerns that you have but tonight I need to read a statement that I have to make because this is I would be remiss if I did it because I need to support my community so I'm going to trust the my esteemed colleagues on the board to continue to stay some things for you so the Albuquerque Journal included an editorial Sunday July 29th about the recent rulings by judge Singleton noting the state is violating the constitutional rights of students by failing to provide them with

[02:14:00]
efficient education and her order to lawmakers in the governor to put more money into the system the authors stated that the vast majority of the state's children can't read or do math at grade level in our proficiency ratings are downright appalling and unacceptable the editorial further noted the harsh reality that it takes a lot more than just increased funding to bring about success in the classroom and used Rio Grande High School as an example of how extra funds alone do not do the work noting a failure to improve scores at Rio Grande High School news to say I found the editorial concerning due to its negative portrayal of Rio Grande High School calling it a quote unquote chronically underperforming school and that all go give him a quote unquote dizzying array of reforms everything from Early Childhood programs for South Valley children no improvements have been seen me was portrayal of the school the community and the label

[02:15:00]
turn off Valley children more attention was paid to calling out the community the South Valley with a sense of degradation hopelessness and misery painting the community is one with many intractable problems Albuquerque Journal if you're listening words matter and your lack of attention to the bigger picture of Social and economic disparity is mean spirited improving student outcomes and addressing the gaps between majority poor disabled students and their white middle class counterparts does take effort but it also takes more than the quote unquote hard work and data-driven reform you mentioned it requires commitment to the school to social reforms that address affordable housing access to Quality and consistent health and Behavioral Health removing food insecurity and creating access to Quality and nutritious food as well as economic reforms that lead to employment with sustainable and living wages it also includes cultural humility that respects and celebrates families and various forms and fosters value for individual

[02:16:00]
the journal has a responsibility to promote fair and balanced portrayal of the South Valley Community media images and words do matter and a caution for some of your readers who have never interacted with families from the South Valley or step foot into a school or program in the South Valley to not Embrace what you call what you tell them about South Valley children The Divide between communities in Albuquerque continues to grow and it's no wonder the South Valley often feels the brunt of negative bias the negative impact of media bias and hurtful work and hurtful words his members of the community hard I know I live in the South Valley derogatory portrayals are demoralizing and reduce self-esteem and in worst case scenarios youth internalized these biases and stereotypes and through their behavior reinforce and even perpetuate their presentations they become victims of misperception I felt this in my youth and no youth today certainly feel the same the journal is aware of its

[02:17:00]
ask power to shape popular ideas opinions and attitudes you should become equally cognizant of your role as a mechanism of social change the journal can and should choose words images and new angles that give a fuller more nuanced Narrative of children living in the South Valley its culture its people and its way of life additionally South Valley children are individuals not a type of child your failure to address them as people first is appalling Journal if you're listening where were your stories celebrating Rio Grande High Schools accomplishments this past year did you know Rio Grande hosted a Statewide Summit for jobs for America's grads students from across the state and local Business Leaders and program leaders were there I was there and was impressed by the quality of the program the talent and flexibility of the school staff to host well over 100 students while maintaining a regular school schedule it was genius and did you know about the number of Jags students who participated in job shadow

[02:18:00]
today and successfully landed paid summer work experience I see an interact with the students from the South Valley daily and their maturity and professionalism while on the job is astounding or what about the percentage of apts completing AP exams at Rio Grande it was over 76% this year what do you know about these students from the South Valley why doesn't the general covered their story and what about an editorial about the bilingual Seal program at Rio Grande Rio Grande had 29 students completing the program and six of those students received a deal of Distinction I attended the end of the year ceremony and the students stories of personal Triumph resilience and pride of being able to preserve culture and language were more than the news where they were inspiring parents were beaming and I thought wow what a legacy for the school district and the community for the story about the increase in park scores for English language learners for

[02:19:00]
182018 why wasn't that why wasn't this covered what did these students from the South Valley overcome to succeed when I sought the appointment to the board one of my areas of Interest was continued negative perception of the South Valley and the harm it has on the psychic of children and their families in the community I vow to confront these perceptions noting that personal impact noting the personal impact these negative perceptions and bias I experienced as a student and a member of the South Valley when I was a student at Rio Grande High School children from the South Valley are not flawed nor are they projecting stop referencing South Valley children as a specific type of child it's irresponsible and damaging remember they are children and students first students from the South Valley and finally I challenge the journal to meet me at Rio Grande High School or any other school in the South Valley to do a quality story about

[02:20:00]
sing children hard-working staff and parents and a community dedicated to addressing challenges and Big Dreams for our children thank you thank you thank you period

[02:21:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:22:00]
testimony from some of you and from some students who frankly broke my heart when they said they wanted to be a doctor but they were still trying to learn English these are the hard conversations that we don't know how to have a staff member is my expectation would be those of you who are in positions of having relationships with the community to not just help the community throw stones but actually help us have that harder conversation we need you to help us to facilitate the conversation between our community programs Department I don't remember what it's called doctor's Department we need to have you help us help your leaders in your Department's where you work to sit down and think how we can go about bringing a meeting of the minds together

[02:23:00]
what time is the best plans or not exactly what is going to meet the need and we have an emerging need we have a world of you know several million refugees who are roaming because of war and economies that are Hostage to a failing economic and social order how do we Implement a thoughtful and I think I have to say in my understanding and experience as well intended we may be sometimes not real good at communicating why a decision was made in this case to focus on elementary students I don't know but certainly the need continues as you pointed out for other students so how do we move forward in My Hope Is that we can move

[02:24:00]
forward by trying to put down some of the strong emotions that we feel whether we feel defensive about the fact that you're not seeing what we're trying and how good the effort has been or whether we feel angry over the fact that you know this young person can't read I think we have to do better I just don't know exactly how we get there with your leadership team can put your heads together and help us come up with a constructive opportunity that will have to be created by all parties we need to work together when we need to move forward I can't imagine some of the stories that each of you have as refugee

[02:25:00]
are you in my mind at least for knowing five languages for being able to come here and say what you think they're still big challenges for us as a district because we have so many students who are undocumented who aren't official immigrants but who live like many do nowadays in fear and fear because of an unfair economic and social order and the racism that's being promoted in the highest Office of the land racism and it's wrong and we have to stand together we cannot afford to turn against each other but we have to stand together and try to come up with a way to move forward and problem so that's my comment for this evening and again I want to go back to you this one thank you for your leadership and your courage and for the class in the way that you approach things and say things

[02:26:00]
lucky for us we have you as a member on this board I would hope that you would submit what you read this evening to the journal to see if they'd be willing to push it you know I'm very concerned that what we have is a situation where the journal is our paper of Record newspaper of record our voices are not being heard there there's just a particular line that gets put out there over and over again and some variation here and there but for the most part it's a political line and I think that's a violation of all of our freedom of speech and I would hope that some lawyers some place will figure out how to challenge them for what they are not doing anything conversation and continuing

[02:27:00]
horrible things that seem to pass for normal these days thank you thank you thank you very much Peterson I'll just simply well I'll start by simply uniting with with the comments that other people have made I mean my two schools have Hawthorne and Whittier have been cast in the same light exactly is and Rio Grande High School Highland High School works hard to meet the needs of an incredibly diverse group of students and Hawthorne to be plastered by the Secretary of Ed is having failed generations of students it goes on and on and I over the last week because I've been part of conversations and

[02:28:00]
Where Do We Go From Here what does it look like how did we get where we are sometimes I think it's partly with the district not trying to do wrong but by trying to look at what's doable and taking on what's doable and seeing it from that point of view and feeling like going with the Lamesa k6 program it's I think what what was doable and I think that's probably one reason why it was formed the way it was trying to put it together and clearly it's it doesn't mean all of the needs that need to be made we can talk about how nothing matters except what's internal to a student between what resources available to them and I think one of the things that we have to

[02:29:00]
look really seriously at is how are we allocating resources within the district because it's it's fine sale kids can learn but we know that without the right setting and without the right supports that kids aren't going to be as successful as they could be and should be and so I think we need to really really start looking carefully for going to talk equity and I think we need it when we talk about Equity but it really means looking at resources in a different way until we allocate them because I think that's one of the barriers that I mean I've talked to the principal and they are absolutely committed and wanting to do right by the students that are there but it partly comes down to are their teachers to fill those roles are finding finding people we know that there are people in the community who have to linguist

[02:30:00]
make skills to support students whether they have the credentials that are needed to fit in a certain role might be something different and so then how do we figure out how to have people with the language skills to put together with people who have the content and academic skills of what's needed I mean it takes it's not as simple solution but we've got to figure out how to do it and I and there are definitely some Pathways that I think have been grappled with so how do we expand I don't think that personally I think there's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement for implementing there's some things like transportation that still needs to be worked out partly it's because without knowing what students are there figuring out

[02:31:00]
play play what transportation is needed you know we've got to see who's there and then figure out how to get kids there and how to support that what what we need to make available at Highland and at Van Buren in particular it comes down to we need human beings and with for human beings we need we need some the ability to stop the positions and I think the district needs to really seriously I think we can do it I don't think I don't think we have to be hostile I think there's been miscommunication and non-communication and horizontal communication going past people and we need to step back open up the door for sitting down and sorting this through

[02:32:00]
we have some resources with the Community Schools coordinators who are there we have some family Liaisons it's it's not too late to look seriously this year and I think that we can build continue building towards where we're going in the future and some of it probably is figuring out seriously what's going to be successful for students because what one student needs and what their vision for their future is maybe different for another student so for some students getting that diploma being able to get into the workforce and figuring out how we how we get some specific skills for one student maybe really different from a student that saying you know college a doctor I want to be a doctor I want to be a professional have a professional career and what that student needs maybe different and

[02:33:00]
we've got to we've got to open up this Pathways work to collaboratively with UNM with CNM with what we already have in place with things like Cece and College and Career and Early College Academy how can we how can we bolster resources that we have but most immediately look at what do we have it Highland and Van Buren in particular that we need to support for this year so it's not it's not there's not a magic wand it's not magic and figure out how to make it happen thank you first of all I just had forgotten to do this at the last couple of board meetings and I am so sorry that I have I went to

[02:34:00]
what's the graduation ceremony at the in the jail back in June these are a lot of people that are totally forgotten and invisible to a lot of us and I don't want to ever forget them so their names are never called out for a lot of people to hear they're not videotaped so somebody can see them and so I just want to make sure to call out all their names some of these young men and women are absolutely brilliant and if you would take the time to know them you would be very proud these are the names of the June graduates they did what they had to do behind bars in very difficult very difficult situations that many of us would never ever ever make it through their names are Daisy McQueen Andrea Thomason John brumitt Lee Brandenburg

[02:35:00]
play Moana soundtracks Craig Smith David spits and Nicholas Tanner and I'm very proud of them so I hope you all if you could give them a big hand because their families can hear this forever and I think this is something that that we can do better is our kids all the refugees and immigrant population deserve better than a minute and I think that's something that we are ourselves can decide to give longer than that if we're willing to sit here for 2 hours to listen to what's important for our kids I think that they deserve debt and my apologies that we didn't put that out there cuz I think that we could do that so I apologize to all of you

[02:36:00]
you deserve you even deserve more than 2 minutes so if we have to be here sometimes for several hours to hear about those concerns I personally am willing to sit here for that long so I'm sorry what I heard tonight is that when we're talking about people children learning another language we have been told anyway that it takes several years for that to happen so if we're talking about high school students they don't have several years some of those kids are coming they're they're already Juniors or seniors they don't have seven years with us they have that year what do we do for them for that year we're saying we're going to start with the elementary kids and I'm a big fan of Elementary children I was in elementary teacher but we're looking at these kids having to go out and then they're saying they can't go to college because they don't know how to speak the language they don't know

[02:37:00]
read what are we doing to them do we really want to destroy them I'm sure we don't but are we doing the right thing by this program I know Rachel white you're absolutely amazing I am very proud of everything you did I want to listen to people that understand I want to listen to all of you out there who understand that Community we should be listening to you we should be listening to the students they know what works better for them is that what we did with this newcomer program is it I mean you all know you know did we listen to you were you at the table should you be they're your kids it's your community it's our community it's our future I want to listen to

[02:38:00]
thank you and I believe that APS wants to listen to you so whatever we have to come up with then we need to figure it out so let's do that and I'm asking the superintendent to please let's figure out what's going to be best because I don't think that anybody who is here tonight things that we did the right thing and I think that you all feel that you were excluded and that's not what you should feel I know it the meeting that we are at a few months ago and we heard from a lot of you it seems like we didn't though because I don't know if anything that you asked for was put into motion it doesn't seem like from what I remember it seems like you were cut off that we didn't maybe want to listen to you anymore I hope that's not the case but I think that's how a lot of

[02:39:00]
do you feel from looking at your faces I want to hear you and you're welcome to call me anytime and keep on putting things out there keep on talking to the superintendent keep on talking to the administration till you get what's right for those kids because they deserve the very best they are are tomorrow and we can't just let them be out there and not be prepared thank you Google

[02:40:00]
what's the most of the public forum persons the one or two minutes is really not the place for a deep discussion it's not going to happen we've worked hard trying to figure out different mechanisms different ways to get a better discussion and more deep discussion in those kind of things and it's not going to happen in this kind of a context it's just not the right contact we need to have more of a given take not just speaking and then using we have to have more of a dialogue and this is not the right for him to have a dialogue so we need a better a better mechanism to do that and some of those things that we have those are better forums for actually understand I don't know whether the issue is with the

[02:41:00]
off the pilot were trying or whether it's just that you don't think it goes far enough in terms of other things and others I've looked at the plan myself and I don't I think there's a lot of good things that are going on there I think there's a lot of good ideas that are part of that now whether there's enough there or whether we're not doing enough in high school or not doing whatever I don't doubt that at all so the problem is just trying to figure out where to go from there in other words the ideas what do we do with the high school if it's not doing good well enough what we're doing Highland for example I greatly respect I mean I've talked with a lot and I think there's great things there that have been done so we're really working hard to work with some of the refugee programs so that's got to be a positive but the question is OK Google how do we how do we sustainable how do we scale it how do we scale a little bit more and if there's some good suggestions for doing that and and we have

[02:42:00]
I'm thinking about trying to do those things but but I don't want to make it negative about what we're trying to do is that if that part of it is okay in other words I don't know exactly but it looked like it was a pretty Sound Idea and it's a pilot but to try to put a lot of things together in La Mesa and we also have a teacher prep program me a a thing with you and him we're getting some internships and other things there so there's a combination of things that are going on at Lamesa that we think will probably be very good and it's okay program it's not just a case 6 K program and also we have it Van Buren so the idea is to try to get a cohort as part of the Zone I did was try to get a cold heart going from elementary school how does that work and can we make that flow so we've got to think more strategically and how we're going to try to do that so what we need to do is we need to make sure we're positive about that

[02:43:00]
get together and let's make sure we doing it not being negative about not doing something but let's get together and let's see how we can do that I think a lot of you had really really good ideas maybe maybe we didn't have enough time to talk about it obviously that's you know it's not enough time so let's get our stuff together and have some more discussions about this I don't think that means what we're doing right there and let me see is a bad thing I want to make sure we kind of understand the difference is if we're not doing enough and certain areas and that's that's part of it but we really have to get the Early Education started with our kids so that they will in fact progress and they will infect get to miss school in high school and be okay the high school kids let's talk about that we can't probably there's got to be some other kind of a combination with maybe the university with CNN with others with the business world because they don't have

[02:44:00]
you have enough time when you're there and let me tell you they're asked to do some things that are not right for those students for example if you're there for one the first year you're here you may come from an African country where you've had very little formal education that's not Muddy's got four languages that's not the case for a lot of our Refugee students a lot of them don't have a real formal language so they come to us that maybe a lot of formal education and yet the first year that required to take a writing and a math test in part that's not right we have a lot of students that are not Refugee students that are required to take part test before a lot of things here that are a basis for having problems that we need to resolve and you need to help us do that see that's

[02:45:00]
we have that doesn't mean we're doing everything right but I think the programs I saw there at 7:00 to see how do we really make this progression from the early childhood all the way through and Highland is there on the basement so the question is what do we do do that the transportation yes

[02:46:00]
we're going to have a cohort that goes to La Mesa and Van Buren we got to make sure everybody has transportation we got to make sure everybody can get that okay so if we can identify all that make sure that happens let's see how that works okay but I think the point is we do want your voice we want your voice but let's be cooperative you know the people the contact here you can contact Raquel reading I guarantee you will get you the right people Madeline knows an awful lot about this issue let me tell you something she knows all awful lot about this issue and she's working really really hard to try to make sure that we're working on this Equity part with our with our students we have put together as a board that are very much in favor of our protection students I think we've done a lot here

[02:47:00]
so let's be working together let's not be working against each other because we work against each other now we're not going to be making any progress okay so let's work together on this okay the only other thing I like to say is that I I greatly appreciate or remember I'm going to tell you a part of his comments I couldn't have said it better when we get compared in some way to Gadsden or Texaco or some other I just I can't even tell you how statistically that's incorrect and I have mentioned this to the general and they still continue to make these headlines we've got to get a different perspective and I'm not calling

[02:48:00]
anybody okay this is our time here this is our time here this is our time here this is our time here this is not your time this is our time okay so I'm telling you right now because it's important it's important for us to start standing up for who we are and what we're trying to do for our kids and that's where our people here who came to talk to us tonight they're standing up for this and we need to do the same thing we're working on how we do that and I think we need to be quiet but we need to provide the facts and information

[02:49:00]
lights out so thank you very much I appreciate all the board comments and with that we would go on to announcement of the upcoming board meetings it's next Wednesday August 15th at 5:00 p.m. and the next special board meeting will be August 27th at 7:30 a.m. alarm with that we are Jordan thank you
