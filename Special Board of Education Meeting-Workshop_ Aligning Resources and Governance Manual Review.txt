2024 special Board of Education meeting workshop on aligning resources and governance manual review agenda this is board member Benavides of second this is member Jackson thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please yes and before I do the roll call vote just a reminder to speak into the Mike's when you are speaking please now this toga Ronaldo yes other Benavides yes Brittany Jackson yes the first item on our agenda is item number 3.1 team building discussion and our presenter is Ashley pause our student outcomes focused governance coach Missy of the four good morning board members Dr Blakey I want to start today like I always do when we ever have time together and that's with moment of gratitude I think today more than usual is a very busy day for

[00:02:00]
a lot of people and there are a lot of things that are pulling our respective attention away from being here today and so the fact that you have chosen to be here this is how you chosen to spend your time into to to really focus on how you work together as a team and it is a it is profoundly meaningful to me as your coach and it is a testament to your commitment to students and the service you have to APS and that's not a that is not a judgment to anyone who is not here I know that they're very they're all they have very important reasons to not be here but I just want to say thank you for your choice to be here and with that let's get into our conversation so if you can each grab a pen and a piece of paper and it can just be a scrap paper doesn't have to be like a nice

[00:03:00]
I'm going to ask you to think about something and write down the answer okay so I want you to think about this question after my time in leadership with APS has come to an end what is the impact that I want to make on the lives of students what is what is impact that we want to have left what is the Legacy that was left of students so take a couple of minutes and write down your answer probably like 10:00 period

[00:04:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:05:00]
after my time in leadership with APS has come to an end the difference that I want to have made in the lives of students is yeah I'm just buying a little time while people finish writing after my time in lead

[00:06:00]
APS has come to an end the Legacy I would want to have to leave I would have I want to have left is improved life social emotional and economic well-being for APS students improve lives social emotional well-being social emotional and economic needs of students while being a student thank you thank you for going first Heather after my time with APS is over the Legacy I want to have left is I want the students to have felt supported understood empowered through their achievements to enter the post High School World knowing they can do amazing things I want these kids to leave here knowing that they can do amazing things thank you I want to leave is I want students to have known that their

[00:07:00]
is an experiences are important and that they were included in the decision processes that APS I want students to know that their voices are important and that they were included included in the decisions and everyone's going to share so when I leave when I leave when I look back on the Legacy that I let I want to make sure that I know that I have set up the system that get to give them every opportunity with with high expectations and success for Life After High School I want to set up the system to leave students with high expectations for Success After High School after school in college thank you next

[00:08:00]
there are children have the confidence and see value in themselves with the skills attributes and knowledge that they have gained to impact society that our students have the skills after attributes and knowledge to be successful in our community are capable and able to make decisions that they're capable and able to make decisions that they know that their valued thank you I want to see students learning and thriving so when they leave APS they live or they have what it takes to live happy and successful life happy and successful Lots thank you all for sharing and thank you for allowing me

[00:09:00]
to ground the conversation in in this it's important to remember why we're all here and everyone what are some of the common things that you heard students Student Success opportunity confidence this group really does not just this isn't something I'm just noticing now for the first time but as I have noticed over the time of us working together this group really is focused on empowering students and empowering the system to make sure that students are supported and it's a testament to your that is recognizing your goals you or one of the few boards that is persisted with a goal that I'm really does

[00:10:00]
focus on building The Habit skills and mindsets for students to be successful later in life and why did no one say to hire to buy school buses or to make sure that maintenance change orders are accomplished people in the community why does school systems existing successful in life is the United States so we're going to spend our time

[00:11:00]
today not just this morning but for the 4 hours that we have together talking about how the board can can do this how boards can effectively set up the system so that you are creating the Legacy that you intend to leave and so we're going to start by talking about just the more internal aspects and through a much requested topic of trust I know that I had shared a podcast with you all I know it was a long way and I know it has a little bit of a slow start and Stephen Amell is a very charismatic person but also it's even more puppy and so it is the reason that I share from him is because he has done probably the most like he has had the most accessible

[00:12:00]
research and probably the most publicized is definitely not the only Authority he is an authority but not the only Authority so I do not want to imply that any of that is the only way of thinking of trust but it is a way of thinking of trust and the things that are present in his conversation or present throughout pretty much every every type of trust research and team building and Trust research that I have encountered through multiple different capacities and so I want us to ground this conversation and this is really where I'm going to stop talking as much as start listening so in as you listen to this podcast they talked about a couple of things that I think May resonate with you all so I just like to hear from you what are some of the things that resonated with you or what

[00:13:00]
do you recall from the from that conversation was the part where they were talking about employee employee or relationships and how important it is for the boss to trust the employee and some examples he shared there but I think there was one around asking someone to do a presentation and trusting them that they're going to do their work and they're going to do their presentation and they're going to do it well and then the host sort of responded with like yeah it's my general practice to trust until you give me a reason not to and so that resonated I think just professionally also just as a parent in terms of parenting see dealing with kids but also I think our work as elected officials but also our work as

[00:14:00]
supervisors hires evaluators et cetera of the superintendent thank you for sharing your next and there were a couple of things first of all I was listening to it on one and a half speed so I wanted Steven or whatever his name is to take a breath but I think a couple things so in relation to he kept relating back to a story called clean and green where I guess it was like his dad had told him like had given him this opportunity that I want the yard to be clean and green and then he just he trusted him to do it and because he trusted him to do it he wanted to make sure that he responded to that and so he kept his yard you know clean and green until and it kind of talks about

[00:15:00]
Danielle was saying that his dad gave him not trust that he was going to do it and and just expect a level of high expectations that then his son lived up to so I think that that was that resonated with me the second thing that really resonated and it goes to kind of what we talked about that the Genesis of changed starts with me that and I can't remember the phrase that he used but it's that and the trust trust starts internally that you have to start internally and then go external and that there's lots of data on the fact that most people think will yes I'm trustworthy but then when you relate out to like your college like but they are not and so everybody thinks that they are trustworthy but are they doing or they actually doing the are they performing the actions that allow their colleagues to believe that they are transporting what

[00:16:00]
I'm actually going to come back to that and towards the end that this idea that like the I will attribute myself like more trustworthiness to myself than to other people so we will come back to that but yes thank you I thought it was perfect timing after some of the discussion that we had at the board meeting when they said let's not talk about government trusts because that's different and I feel like superintendent leaky was right when she said there's really never trust right in government and we have to work on that through our actions and that also connected to what you were saying is it's not just how do I trust other people but can they trust me and what is my accountability to being trustworthy to others and I think in this position that's something that that really is what I'm thinking about

[00:17:00]
what is I've been on the opposite side where I'm like being skeptical of institution and the system and now that I'm kind of in it how do I make sure that those actions are reflective of that trustworthiness that I want people to have with me thank you it's all good night so thank you for bringing up action because I think the you know I think we've all heard the term we judge ourselves and our intentions and people judge us on our actions and sometimes they're very different and we're sometimes not aware of that but I thought it was really interesting in the beginning when he brings up and I can't remember the three businesses I think it was three but one was Paul's Fargo and how like you said people are not trusting institutions now because of the things that they're doing and I'm not sure when this podcast was done but it seems like there's a really quiet kind of examples because there's so much mistress on such a large scale right now and it's almost seems insurmountable but you know here we don't have to be a part of that and we can be the exception and not the rule and

[00:18:00]
is very important and trust is a two-way street it's it's given it's taken and it can be destroyed and a very very short time and it's very difficult to get back and it's all about accountability so one of the one of the other things that we will hit on shortly is the side this idea of that like come back to that as well but then so thank you for sharing any other takeaways and anyone would like to share out so let's take oh yeah go ahead many stories and take that perspective I usually come from my own individual upbringing

[00:19:00]
how many times in relation to these stories and because of my upbringing the perspective of Portugal and Navajo and the self-identification of there's no self and that we determine this based on not only our words but also are who we are in that balance and Harmony within us and if we don't do that then we're the opposite and that we have to create that within our own lives first it's not going to happen out here or we can't portray it and and think that it's just surface and because it's really a deep identity of who you are inside and it's reflective of what comes out around you and you have the ability to change your environment positive or negative and so many times and in my life trust has been

[00:20:00]
broken so many times and to bring it back is not easy and I can say that with myself because I see deeply what is going on and not only in the world around us but what's going on in this environment so we're going to take a couple of minutes because so I want to stay with this for just a couple of months longer and so instead of sharing out I want to ask so I want to buy everyone to kind of lean back with your shoulder partners and share with each other some of the takeaways that that you heard and really resonated with from listening to that conversation on that podcast

[00:21:00]
and kind of just talked with your partner about how those apply to your your situation here in the room and so this is a great Segway board member so let's take a couple of minutes just and you can lean back you don't have to talk into the microphones but this will give you an opportunity to kind of share a little bit more directly and build that connection so we'll take about 5 minutes period

[00:27:00]
or something that that resonated with you that I'd like to

[00:28:00]
open the floor up for anyone to do that if you'd like and there's no judgment if you choose not sure I just really appreciated the conversation because it was on our individual cells and how we can start looking at ourselves and be like what as someone else interpreted that I might not have it was not my intention when it comes to trust so if that happens what is that process moving forward because it is difficult like we've all mentioned to gain that trust back but how can we start those conversations and that process so I think that was that was really good thank you we were just talking about and many times we don't recognize energy and we don't recognize the indivisible and that we have a tendency to think it's just physical and it's only what we see and as we were talking it was

[00:29:00]
in in in in in in my cultural beliefs in in talking about who's Joe it's there's this Dome that you have by the span of your arm above all the way from Seven directions and within that bubble is how you decide you want your life your environment and you want yourself to be trust can never be obtained until you trust yourself and that's the only way it's pushed out and it's the same way with love it's the same way with kindness and whatever exists in this Dome when somebody enters you can change them negatively or positively then the connection of all of these energies is creates the universal whether you want to call it theme whether we are all in that place of trust love then the connection of everybody can transform even the greater

[00:30:00]
but there are those who do have the power negatively to be a strong and those who aren't able to counter that will fall into line with whatever that person's energy positions themselves and and owns up to but then it's also one of those things and that's when I was talking to Courtney that's where you have to learn how to protect your boundaries if you don't protect it everything seeps into there and then you can't figure out who you are and why you are who you are my I love that you that you connected this because this is actually a common thing if you look at across cultures over the world global global cultures everywhere there is there's this idea that that is consistent even even

[00:31:00]
free like colonialism but before like there was as much as globalism sometimes we think the lack of Unknowing is a fear but then it's really who are we inside that creates The Knowing yeah and so the one I'm going to go back to the earlier the this idea of the fundamental attribution error that's not the actual language that they use but that's the kind of what is in the common lexicon now so this idea that I will attribute my own actions to like I have more confidence in my own actions because I know I know my own intent I know so I'm going to Tribute intent like positive intent for myself but then

[00:32:00]
when I look at the behaviors of others I'm I'm going to look at what I observe and so this is one of the things that he talked about is like there were in some instances some of the surveys that they had done they were like 40% Gap and if people yeah and people saying that I am trustworthy and other people are not or other people on my team or not and this is this is very much connected to what Ronaldo has just mentioned is that I am when I sit back and look at my own my own behaviors I frequently am going to I cannot decouple what I know my intention was with what I did because I know that that was my intention but I don't know what Courtney's intention was intention or Janelle's intention

[00:33:00]
so this is a very powerful understanding when you begin to and then going deeper into what board members don't worry to shared that my my willingness to trust others my willingness to love others my willingness to be kind that is I'm wearing that there is it is the aura around me this this bubble that I admit the energy that I met is going to show that and one of the things that they talked about actually I can't remember if they talked about this in the podcast or if it's from the book but they talk about how trust there's an ebb and flow that's connected to trust and that there are times when I can be very trustworthy and there are times when I can be very untrustworthy and and it really in people's experience with me is going to is going to be very greatly and so

[00:34:00]
that's where Recycling and patterns of your family it's where triggers occur that get you to go back to that lack of trust that lack of so it's that healing mechanism that you have to create for you and you got to recognize the Cycles you got to recognize the triggers that put you in this trust and then take that moment to pull away and deal with those emotions because your body is the healing energy that's telling you these things are wrong but if we can't listen and hear our body we're going to fall into the Cycles we're going to fall into the traumas we're going to repeat consistently what we've already dictated in our lives and all the only thing we're responsible is for what exists in that bubble and it's only you were not responsible

[00:35:00]
for anybody else told me I'm not responsible for anybody you and that's where the the the the the south of recognizing and the the pressures of trying to feel like I have to conform I have to do know just reside with who you are and be comfortable with that and know that I am fine but then deal with your traumas deal with what has to be healed because those things keep triggering and then also what's in these these systems dictate Our Lives thank you for that I want to stick with the with this conversation for just a little bit longer and so what are is there anyone else who would like to share part of what they notice from from these conversations Heather thank you I'm sorry I'm not speaking into the microphone and so I think Dr blinking I had a really funny conversation because first

[00:36:00]
started talking about institutions and how institutions say APS or state of New Mexico ones that were involved in maybe have mistrust and how do we as an individual cuz we're just one person in these very large institutions how do we try to change the perception that the public might have about it and it's really difficult and specifically for Dr Blakely because she can put boundaries into place she can make roles she can hire the best people but at the end of the day it is so large and she doesn't have a magic wand and we're dealing with people's children and their education and it's very individualistic and what's going to work for one students not going to work for another one family is not going to work for another and everybody has expectations we cannot meet every one of them she cannot do that it's impossible same thing with the state of New Mexico there are so many employees we cannot make sure everybody's doing everything they need to do all the time people are going to be unhappy in the public when they feel like they're not being served how do we try to change that it starts with us and we do the best we can

[00:37:00]
but then we started talking about how and this is something we both really agree on is why are teachers why are principles why are superintendents who are licensed professionals why are they constantly questioned you don't question our attorneys like that we don't question our doctors like that you know if my attorney gave me advice I'm not going to say you know what I don't like that maybe you should do it this way I'm not the one trained to do that work why should I question it that way you can question it but I'm not going to go to the community and ask for a survey of people who've never done this job what do you think my attorney should do in this case so we really what we need to do is really try to change within our power within the groups that we have contact with their understanding of what roles are and who has the training and the capability to do something and who doesn't have all the information and do it in a very kind and understand

[00:38:00]
when they really don't know what's going on or question in a way that's productive and not just accusatory yeah that was very long but know that I think it's spot on and it's it's one of the things that I want to that I want to name is that especially when so dealing with the community the community is going to respond in the way that they have always been trained to respond the way that they have been told this is and so if to be actually lead in this work that that we are all tasked with doing and it really does require that leadership that you speak of that retraining that re-education that so giving that clarity about rolls or about expertise or about just building that confidence and one of the things that that I have been

[00:39:00]
you know as I'm working with school boards all over the place and some of you have I've had this conversation with some of you I think a lot of you actually we are like our society in this nation and I think that it gets even more intense as we get closer there is just a general lack of distrust we've talked about it already this morning and that distrust leads to stability instability the only way that we as a society are going to be able to come back together and to to find any kind of peace or regulation is Define to be able to trust those local institutions like I am going to be knowing that I mean not trust by president or Congress or whoever and regardless of what

[00:40:00]
put the party is that I affiliate with are they affiliate with I mean not have trust there but I'm more likely to have trust the closer it is to home and so if I know that I'm going to go to my grocery store and they're going to have the the products on the shelves that that I need to be able to feed my family or to take care of my ourselves and I can trust that institution I can send my kids to school and know that they're they're not going to be getting the education that I'm sending that to get at that school and I'm going to trust that institution and the closer our institution is to a person the more ability they have to restore that trust and that's where that's not something that is specific to APS that is specific everywhere but it is it is an important

[00:41:00]
ask for leaders to really understand right now is that in times of complexity and Times of instability the best thing to do is to add stability in the way that you do that first and foremost is by building that Foundation of trust Ronaldo I think and this is where if you can get yourself to the place where you can feel peace at any time that message out there can never affect you and if you can feel balance in any situation that can never affect you and so if you're strong enough to get yourself to always resonate in peace Harmony and balance that message out there can't influence you and you would always keep yourself in Harmony and imbalance to not allow the fear to come in but

[00:42:00]
there's one thing I want to say and and this is where as adults we recognize so much with future and past children don't do that they are always in trust mode there are always in present moments they don't have passed and they don't have future we as adults entangle that into the children's lives and and and and if we don't get it right we can never get into that world where children are enthusiastic curiosity and where they love because we influence based on who we are and impose these children and we can't do the creativity they can't learn because they are in this place of present moments we got to change ourselves in order to get into that moment so y'all have heard me talk about

[00:43:00]
being becoming president to the patterns that exist in our lives in my life this is very very much so we talked about breathing and so if I'm breathing I'm aware of what's happening in my body but my body like if I'm not conscious conscience to my breathing I'm not going to stop breathing I have a pattern that's going to continue that in the same way the patterns that exist in school systems are going to keep they're going to keep driving us forward there's a muscle memory that exists here and in many ways this muscle memory pulls us back into those existing patterns and so I have to be intentional about changing the patterns that I want to change that's why we have this this thing right here should not comes don't change until he behaves change I have to be intentional about where I need

[00:44:00]
recognizing where change needs to be made and then making that change and as adults and this is something that I've been guilty of doing many times let me just give you a little bit of background of how this happened let me tell you let me let me give you the story about how we got to where we are I'm bringing that back into into into this conversation and so I love I love this connection that you've made that your children don't bring that back Edge and young people coming and coming on to these situations don't bring that back it's always good to know like it's good to know that have that institutional knowledge but that Innovation is going to come like the being able to rethink what's possible is going to come by maybe noticing it but not becoming a Slave

[00:45:00]
but not saying this is the way that it has to be changing that status quo in middle school is where they start to wake up and they start to realize that their parents their words and that that the scope of their own world is greatly affected by the time they get to high school they realize hypocrisy they realize the adults in this world are not speaking and saying and doing what they need to so then they start to question and then the recycling or whatever's in the family starts to hit those children and high school and if that's why when we don't change those things are repeated in the children and and that's why we are supposed to as adults do our own healing so the children will never have to take on our baggage so let's let's talk about healing one of the things that that Heather mentioned when she was talking about

[00:46:00]
do you remember exactly what you said you were talking about your noticing from the podcast and talked about when trust is broken do you remember that do you remember that piece and it's fine if you don't difficult it is to build trust and how easy it is to break it and it's almost impossible to get back yeah so the judge myself on my intentions people judge me on my actions which you've already said yeah is that yep that's it so thank you for letting me calling you so it is very easy to break trust and especially if I am if I am looking for a reason like if I am I'm looking for a reason to not trust and I'm not that is not a suggestion that anyone here is doing that but I know that it is a it is powerful in my own life where I am often looking for a reason to justify my

[00:47:00]
Savior and so when that when that mistrust happens when there is a when there is a lapse and Trust when you know maybe I have build up trust credits and then something has happened and they've and they've dropped its it harder to to get them to fill that bucket back up but it is possible and then the in the book Speed Of Trust they do talk about that I don't think they've got too deep into it on the podcast but I did share and we're not going to get deep into this conversation today but it is a thought for the future the idea of rebuilding trust and restoring trust I do want to this board to know that is possible and it is not as hard as we may think that it is I I

[00:48:00]
definitely and get to the place where I feel like I am it's just never going to happen but then when I get over that I'm like oh that was actually much easier and sometimes it's just a matter of having a conversation and getting over myself so I'm going to give you a I'm going to give you a framework to start to start this one and I also shared so in the email that I shared with you beforehand with all the resources there was a link to the Center for nonviolent communication and they are fabulous resource and it's built on the work of Marshall Rosenberg who was not it's not his some of it is his original work but a lot of it is his work that he is curated from investigating other other cultures researching other how

[00:49:00]
indigenous cultures for example how they restore trust and how they operate by consensus and do it very effectively and from other cultures and other successful organizations and do it in a way that is nonviolent so I'm going to give you this framework and you can you can go and watch that video it is a 2-hour video so I was not going to say go do this now but if you were interested I highly encourage it and it is much it is a much easier watch than the podcast was to listen to so this is it we need when I let's see I'm trying to think of an example that I can but I can model I'm trying I'm trying just because

[00:50:00]
I've got it okay so for this afternoon we have a conversation actually I'm going to you and Daniel because we were both talked about this so in this this afternoon we're going to talk about your government's manual so the you have a committee that's been working on this and so Danielle and I talked about doing a feedback charette cuz we don't have a lot of time but we do have a lot of work to do so how can we make that most efficient and so that requires you know having having all of the having everything printed out and ready to go and like posted on the wall so everybody can go through and like write down their feedback on the thing we will get that done but it was not done before today and so that was a need that I recognized but I did not meet and so there is an unmet need within this or

[00:51:00]
but in our group today so when I look at this situation at through the lens of feelings and needs there is I can recognize that there is a net me that needs to be addressed there may be some feelings that that people are having right now about about this need but when I become president to my own feelings and my own needs I need I am for this group I have a tremendous I have a feeling of respect I have a feeling of just like forever anxiety because I want nothing but the best for you and so when I become president to my own feelings I know I can

[00:52:00]
pinpoint to my needs and when I'm present to my own feelings and my own needs that I can think about your feelings and your needs and so through this their great power can there is great power in this when we start to think about restoring that trust and so well this may be a small a small thing to some of you may be a big thing to some of you the the size of the the lapse of trust is not actually the important part it's just the fact that it happened and so I'm going to give you the framework which I've shared before but as you know I'm not great at going off the couch so I'm going to so bear with me Courtney I said that

[00:53:00]
would have an efficient discussion today about the government's manual I did not completely follow through on making sure that everything was done to make that happen what you can expect from me moving forward is that on one of our breaks I will work with Christy to make sure that we get that printed out and posted around the room so that we can have that so have an effective conversation so I'm not asking her to say I forgive you I'm not at because forgiveness actually isn't it the the takeaway here is that I am acknowledging my where I drop the ball I'm acknowledging what I need to do and I'm making a commitment and then I'm going to follow through on that commitment so that framework

[00:54:00]
and I did share this with you in the email so you have it in writing I said that I would do this but I did not what you can expect from me moving forward is this if I really wanted to get into it I was I can get into like the benefit to me the cost to to use our relationship to our success and I think that's actually the full framework that we gave so that's that's one piece you can also build on this framework by talking about needs and the way that you can become most present to those needs is by acknowledging feelings so I want to

[00:55:00]
Ronaldo there needs to be in agreement also that when you want to get to this place of trust and many times we often forget that internal voice and then internal voices also telling you have the courage to bring it up but then it's also the other person to be in unison with that so that you can start making the steps forward but if you're not in unison it's going to be surface that's all you're going to do and you're never going to get to that place so really getting to true trust absolutely and so the message then needs to that internal message with you is to resonate to say this is what I have to do and it's not and but it's also and coming into agreement with another IND

[00:56:00]
you're just doing the surface and fulfilling whatever you need to fulfill and you move on but you never do anything more than that it absolutely has to be authentic so it's the same way I was saying with the bubble if it's not authentic and you're only going to pass it on the other people yeah because you're not going to deal with it and so then you so we're not really there's no purpose in trying to resonate with that until you resonate with it yeah but then that takes healing and it takes taking the space to figure out is it my past that I am in able to trust is that my too far in the future that I am able to trust because in the moment just like the children is where you make change happen but if we can't get there that means as adults

[00:57:00]
stuck somewhere and I appreciate you for bringing up courage cuz the courage to trust is like if you don't have that courage to have the conversation then you're probably not going to happen to know because a lot of us do want to do that trust but there's also this other part of how do we accept if the other person isn't ready or does it want to have that conversation so that it is genuine so what healing work do we have to do to make sure we're saying okay we're ready when you're ready and whenever that happens we can we can move on and I think that's hard right because it's important to have that those conversations in that trust and it's not easy for someone to say well not right now or I'm not wrong so how do we accept that and just be in that space one of the things

[00:58:00]
I was mentioned in the podcast was that the there so he talked about risk do you remember what the conversation about risk I don't know there are times where you do have just a boundary and you wait until that situation so and also he talked about so he shared that to trust so it is always there is always an inherent risk implied with trusting others there's also a risk with not trust like the best probably an even greater risk but we apply we actually have there is another cognitive bias where

[00:59:00]
find a greater greater deal of risk to the thing to the areas where there may be more discomfort but having so having that discussion and having the other person say I'm not I'm not ready like I'm not there yet but that I think that the fear masks masks what is on the other side of it and that usually in failure and I think this was actually the closing statement that he made was that in so whenever there is failure it usually means that there is Success just on the other side of that but it requires pushing through that to get to that place and this is another example we all can have one particular goal as we're sitting here but based on our past were this far from even being there because

[01:00:00]
read trauma whatever has kept us from even getting to this point some people may be there and that's one reason when I really like an IEP the people that are sitting at that table and you have a family there their trauma of how they felt in the system with school and all their way back here yeah and and so and then everybody's trying to dictate for them to make a decision to do you got to do this you got to do but they can't because they're too far away from their own healing from their own identity of foot trusted you know but we push people to be at this table to be who they need to be without recognizing we're all coming from different paths and and with me specifically trust and education based on my family I'm way back here but I'm trying to do my healing to get back to this place where I can be an agreement and

[01:01:00]
listen and give voice and make a decision if we're not able to sit at this table to make a decision just like I said with the about children if they can't because of the lack of skills the lack of not being able to read the lack of they can't make the decision that the teacher wants that the classroom wants because they are too far but it takes confidence and building in order to be able to speak and have the courage yeah because if they don't have the confidence and they can't speak it and they and not having the safe environment to know if I feel sick I am able to be free to speak but if they don't feel that we're just recreating the traumas we're pushing them even further back but they can't come to the table same way with families same way with teachers same way with stuff we have directives yeah but people are not in the

[01:02:00]
same place to be able to say I don't like it I don't want it and I don't trust it it takes the courage but it's all of these things in able to get to the same place that everybody may be at that moment absolutely so let's I want to I want to share this this framework for getting us from what you just described to into the space where you can where you can start to have those productive conversations so it requires to first become president to your feelings so if I take a breath I feel hungry I feel thirsty a little bit tired so those are all actual physical

[01:03:00]
physical characteristics things that are internal processes so I'm looking at my at the things that I'm feeling and I'm now I start to think about what my needs maybe so I need I probably need something different to drink than coffee cuz I think it's only making me thirsty I'll take care of my I'm not asking anybody to give me this is an example I probably need some I probably need to get some water some apple juice or something but what I actually need what I actually need is my true need is to have that first one I need I need I need to be satiated same with food I don't know I'm hungry but I don't necessarily need food I think what I actually need is water when I really get present to what it is that I'm feeling then I can start to

[01:04:00]
think about what my needs are the needs that are unmatched and then the same way that I have negative feelings at 0.2 unmet needs I may have positive feelings that meant that needs that have been met so when Ronaldo when I was just now when I was struggling with what was the next part of the next part of the framework that I needed to share you all with you all you actually spoke up and and delivered this very powerful message about how we connect with trust and that actually as you were talking it spurred what I actually needed to remember so you know I was feeling confused and when you when you said what you said about trust it meant my my knee for information and so I think

[01:05:00]
and so that's actually the framework like when this thing happened this is what I this is what I thought and this is what I what I need so I may have I may have a negative feeling I may have a positive feeling I may be triggered in a negative way or I may be triggered in a positive way and so when when I engage in more of those conversations about my positive feelings it makes it much more I have established a pattern of communicating in this way so it makes it much easier for me to communicate when there is some kind of negative trigger that happens and so when you get into a place of really like breaking trust being able to have those conversations in a way that is very very observational

[01:06:00]
takes out any kind of suggestion or assumption about intent and just looks at what has happened so for my kids daughter when you came downstairs and we're upset that you did not have your homework done from last night I thought concerned I need partnership I need collaboration I need to have that conversation this is the thing that happened so not when you did this it made me feel bad because that's not the conversation because that is actually applying meaning to the thing that happened but just

[01:07:00]
when this happened this is what I thought this is what I need it can also work the other way around and so if I see that someone is upset I may ask them are you feeling do you feel sad people angry and it's always a question do you feel this I've never telling I'm never going to tell you this is what you feel I'm gonna ask you this do you feel this when you say no I feel frustrated okay do you need partnership do you need connection do you need information no I need I need space so being able to the two big things is I'm not telling

[01:08:00]
what they feel I'm asking and giving giving them that ability to say no this is actually what I need but by taking taking the any kind of assumption out of it is actually the that is what is going to lead you to the ability to restore trust yes ma'am yeah this is where the internal voice if you're able to hear that voice that saying it's even like a teacher if you see a child crying or you see everything on the outside if the internal voice is saying they're in pain you need to go but when it's the moment you don't listen to that and you shut it off is the moment you lose the actual real intensity to connect and so it's even

[01:09:00]
if that person is in your life but you have the ability when you hear that to have true intentions and have true change occur if you act but you got to hear it here too so then it doesn't become action just to do it just to feel it just out just taking it from the mine and the intellectual piece to the heart then it becomes a true action but if you're only doing it because oh I'm just going to mimic and I'm going to repeat it from here then we never truly get to where it comes down to the heart to work becomes a true intention to create true healing thank you so much for sharing

[01:10:00]
all right before we transition I want to give everyone else an opportunity to to share kind of what your noticing from this conversation with you so about the what's resonating with me having like heard this message I didn't realize that I was doing it but I had to recently just have a conversation

[01:11:00]
and some parents to say this is what I'm feeling right now this is what I need from you and I don't think I've ever done that before I didn't realize that I had that I had that bad I was able to thank you for sure would anyone else like to share I will share this is so tight and I know it's really hard but honestly the best policy I want to see what they're supposed to do with other people and it's really hard to get there yeah and the more honest we can be with ourselves the easier it is to be with other people

[01:12:00]
but it's tough but it really is the best you have something to say you've done something admit it be honest it's real hard if anybody knows how to do it let me know or same or consistently do it yeah thank you and recognizing so much more of the system at play and those people who conform to that system because they don't have the ability or the strength or the courage to come against it and so in this work I have had to really learn how to put up my boundaries and because I'm protecting me I work too hard to get

[01:13:00]
take me to this place to where I can speak and say sometimes when I don't like things but I've also learned if it's not accepted I got to protect myself and I'm not going to allow that to enter into my space to enter into my home or it will affect my children or affect my family so I've learned to cut it off I've also learned that if people don't want to have those conversations then maybe we're not ready for it but I'm not going to allow that to affect me and sometimes I can be standoffish where I won't talk to people but I'm just like I'm sorry I'm protecting me and I've had to learn that especially when you're in these circles when everybody likes to say what they need to say they like to gossip they like to do whatever they need to do but it's it's just so

[01:14:00]
on recognizing I care too much about myself to put myself in these positions I'm 61 years old I didn't learn this to just come up here and you know be involved in a lot of other things because I have to Value who I am and I have to respect the lineage of my family and what they've been through honor it but also know I'm not going to be influenced by all of this outside noise that's occurring so and Trust was not easy for me and it's still not because I was going on because I've been there and I don't want to allow that and I don't want to allow that into children's lives

[01:15:00]
so I've just said you don't hear from me you don't hear from me I'm better off being silent then I am to confront somebody to where I can get emotional or I can get in the place where I can do some damage you don't want to do that so I walk away and so I want to I want to know it is I think the kind of the main idea here and what is this word going to get to a place where this team how are you going to get to a place where

[01:16:00]
everywhere board members do not feel bad that need to be silent where everyone does have the safety to to speak up and to share and to and to speak because you all you are elected officials you you represent individually very large groups of people and you have you all bring your representation as well from different facets of the society from this community and when I know that when I was an elected official in the times where I didn't speak up I was not I was I wasn't giving my community that voice I was I was driving them of their voice and the decisions that were being made and so that that is where the power is and why the

[01:17:00]
need to be this Board needs to be able to restore trust when these things happen but I also think it needs to be valued yeah I think that is if Community is what we represent it has to be valued on all levels but it's also the thing that we just can't change it up when we feel like we have to change it up but often I feel that with student outcome Focus governance we're all in this vehicle or truck or whatever you want to call it we see them we see where we're headed or cars not working properly and it's in and we got a wheel broken here we're all trying to tell the drivers capable of doing that because we're not in those you know we're not working together and we're not recognizing we do know where we all

[01:18:00]
I need to go but we're still like in the same thing with the table where some of us are just not there and we and we want people to just snap out of it come on now let's just get on board but then if we don't then we get very direct and how we want that done but we're really not listening to what's going on with the people and so we get stuck and we get frustrated and we get upset then we want control and that hurts us and then the voice of the community is no longer heard because of all of our own internal

[01:19:00]
what's on just material things we lose sight of our morals and our values pretty simple you have an opportunity you don't have to you don't have to share anything but do you have any final thoughts before we transition from the conversation for us to be able to start that process and stop right well I have appreciated this conversation this morning

[01:20:00]
we are going to we're going to take a quick a quick break and then we'll we'll come back so I want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity just to take care of their biological needs and as we are talking you're welcome to so we're not going to take a lot of formal breaks today just because we really don't have a ton of time but I want to make sure that everybody has the opportunity to to step out and not feel like you're missing anything so let's how much time do you think we need 7 minutes at the 35 Mark 9:35 okay I'll see you all back then

[01:21:00]
I want to

[01:30:00]
thank you baby thank you we are returning from our break and ready to turn to the second the next item on the Supreme Court clarification and the lightning resources great thank you so much so then this next part of our conversation we're going to transition to really understanding so giving you an opportunity to ask questions and understand some of the things just some of the resources that exist inside of the

[01:31:00]
framework and so you know to to do that I want to kind of ground this and understanding of where where all of this came from and because it's been it's been kind of a conversation or a question that's come up a few times so in the do not come Focus governance manual to know we don't have printed copies but I think everyone has a copy so there is a page in the manual of resources so it's a resources and research and so in that it identifies all of the research that really is found like that is the framework was used to the research that was used to develop the framework so if you think who's the students manual you'll remember like your you know you've got the the rubric at the front of the manual that he using yourself evaluation every month and it

[01:32:00]
does so it starts with a section vision and goals and then values and guardrails progress and accountability or monitoring and accountability and then goes into unity and trust and communication and collaboration and continuous Improvement so in each of these sections it is laid out from the board behaviors that have the greatest impact on improving student outcomes at the front and then towards so in those very first three sections about the goals the guard rails and the section that pertains to progress monitoring those are the three behaviors that are most aligned with school boards that govern in districts that are that are actually seeing improvements in student outcomes so the boards that are creating those conditions and then the sections after that are about the board behav

[01:33:00]
enabling those first three sections to take place so it is entirely possible for a board to only focus on those first three sections set the goal set the guard rails and do the progress monitoring but it is unlikely that any board will ever get to that 50% time use in their progress monitoring or 50% of their times that monitoring their goals if they're not also implementing the behaviors later on in the manual because those are the things that are enabling that to happen and so it is it is encouraged that the board Implement all of it but it is still your choice is a board for what to do and what to not do we just know that these are the behaviors that are the most aligned and so there wasn't like a group of people that got into a room one day and said like we just want boards to do policy diet

[01:34:00]
they really are the behaviors that by looking at boards that have really supports that do that that govern in districts where student accounts are improving and really calibrating for the districts like APS that have that are very large and have very complex demographic needs and just communication is very different for big districts than it is for smaller districts as I'm sure you were all very well aware and so your board has done a fantastic job at your implementation I do not want to I do not want it to get that message to get lost here and you're bored has been you have been really a model in this work since you started implementing this framework and it's not about the frame

[01:35:00]
necessarily it is about being a board that is intensely focused on how to not consider improving I also like there are a couple of things that whenever you have a transition and Leadership and whether its superintendent leadership or new board members come on it's easy for some of the just the like the the background to get lost so that's that's really the purpose of the conversation today so if we like if it's if there was any kind of there was research that said that you know board members walk across the dice five times and jump on one foot for three minutes that is something that's good job comes we would have looked into that and said like how what is this actually doing but that's not so it's not one of the behaviors but I want to so that's the first thing is that this really is grounded in

[01:36:00]
and all of that research is there I'm also happy to share share any of that but this is an overview there is work of so policy governance is one of the pieces of research that predominantly done by the Carver group and they they put together a models policy governance it is not specific to school boards but much of what you find in do not come Focus governance is derivative of policy governance but it is adapted specifically for to meet the needs of school boards and so that that really is probably the most like if you wanted to do any kind of that background any kind of background study that would be a good place to start also looking at I've already ref

[01:37:00]
it's the work of the center for nonviolent Communications The arbinger Institute in the book leadership and self-conception a lot of those practices are a really grounded in in War of like the mindset aspect of what we do and so the the trust building the team building the idea that do not come don't change until adult behaviors change that I am the Genesis of transformation that Integrity is my access to goals with Integrity being the standard of Integrity the engineering from an engineering standard that it's doing what I say I'm going to do to the degree I say I'm going to do it by what I say I'm going to do it and so those that's just kind of the high-level overview about where the framework came from that said it is a framework it is not a model and so think of a model

[01:38:00]
it's like a model car where it comes with like this is exactly but step by step exactly what you have to do to make it look in this this exact way and how you should paint it and everything and it's it's like 3/4 this is what it's going to look like when you're done this is not that this is a framework it is designed for you all have really be the ones the architect of what this will look like for you you're bored makes the decisions like the no point will have I ever said here's what you have to do or there are definitely times where we will talk talk through issues and I may give advice or suggestions and say Here's here's what you might consider if you want to be in the ultimately the choice is yours and so the way that you implement this framework is your is a decision for you want to make

[01:39:00]
inside of that just a couple of examples your goals and guardrails your goals are specifically things that so they are when we talked about the board being the representative of the vision of values of the community the way that you do that is by adopting goals and adopting guardrails the goals are representative of what the community has said is their vision and the guard rails or what the community has said or their values and so you adopted these things and say we've talked to you all week and you did this word had a tremendous engagement and thousands of people from across the community where they asked them what is it that you want students to know and be able to do and that's where these these goals came from so the board adopts the goals and says this is how we're going to the vision and then the

[01:40:00]
and then it comes along and says okay so I'm looking at these goals these are the vision of the community and so I'm going to accomplish these these four goals by achieving these interim goals and so superintendent has provided you all with her interim goals and this is those interim goals are specifically how those she is going to accomplish the goals and how the board is going to accomplish the the vision same with the guard reels the board is set the guard rails and said these are the things that the superintendent shall not do and these are not going to change when the superintendent changes or when a board member changes because they're derived from what the community has said is important so that the thing that will change is when you have a new superintendent they're going to come and say all right I'm going to I am interpreting these guard rails through these rooms so the interim guard rails are how the superintendent says that they're going to honor the guard rails there are a lot of different interpret

[01:41:00]
nations from above the goals and the guard rails a lot of different strategies can be pursued to accomplish these goals but the interim goals are specifically how the superintendent is going to those are the strategies that she's going to deploy with the guard rails the interim guardrails are the specific strategies that she's going to deploy to honor the guard rails is that clear I want to make sure that so other interpretations of what that may look like or what that may mean I may look at a guardrail and say this means something different to me but the actual interpretation is the one that comes from your superintendent and then there is a process of cascading throughout the district where the superintendent's cabinet will look at her interim guard rails and say okay these are the interim guardrails that you've said we're going to accomplish these interim Garden Rules by accomplishing these initiatives or programs or projects or whatever

[01:42:00]
whatever you call them strategic initiatives series of action these are these are the way this is how the cabinet is going to accomplish these and each level of that Cascade and you can anticipate for that to happen at a pace of roughly one level per year so you're not going to you just adopted the goals in 2023 but February of 23rd January 23rd so you're now like literally coming up on year two of these goals so you can anticipate that and I think that you'll actually have moved a lot faster at a faster click then what would usually be expected which is a great thing but I just want to make sure that I provide that level set I know that you probably know this but just to make sure that everyone is on the is on that same understand

[01:43:00]
you're going to see more and more alignment with the goals and with the guard rails as each year goes comes along and so by the time that you that these goals have have expired and hopefully have been accomplished and you set new goals and then you can expect to maybe even accomplish those goals much more quickly because that cascading has happened although there will likely need to be some shifting because they'll be new goals and new priorities same with the guards any questions about that before we move on okay I feel like that's it we're still kind of like the foundational conversation okay so as I mentioned this is grounded on this framework is grounded on research about what what is effective and when we talked about when you hear me say what is effective what I mean is how

[01:44:00]
effective so accomplishing our goal is a system the reason that we exist as a system to improve student outcomes so goals that are creating the conditions for that to happen the require a focus on governance the challenge with this is that most of us do not have any kind of mental model for what it means to govern when we get elected and it's not really common for the community to have any kind of mental model for what it means to go over and this isn't a bad thing it's just that's what we have experience with when I got elected I had been a manager I've had managers before but I had never governed and so being able to come in and immediately say like I know I know exactly what I need to do to govern was not it was not second nature to me so I had to learn about it and so it's if you have felt at any

[01:45:00]
in any way over the last year like what is happening that's normal and and I don't want anyone to feel bad or any kind of Shame for that and I want also to understand that your community isn't going to know that either so that's why the need for that re-education as we discussed that's why this is why having when the when the board goes through the process of engaging with the community to understand what it is that their what their vision is and you are very clear about what the goals are then you can make sure that you are all moving in the same direction like mentioned earlier and we're all in a car but maybe we're going to different places or our cars not moving and so the goals are the goals are specifically how the board says this is this is where we want to go on our journey

[01:46:00]
so setting the goals and then monitoring your progress toward the goal is just like when you're on a road trip you're you're not going to just get in the car and drive and never look at the speedometer or odometer analogy you're never you're never going to look at it it's not like you're never going to look at your gas gauge you need to know how much gas you have left in the tank you need to you need to be looking at the road signs to make sure that you're still on the right track and that's what progress monitoring it it's an opportunity for you to look and see are we still on track are we making the or are we making directions are we going in the right direction in the beginning of implementing a new set of goals and you really are even though you've been doing this for two years it really is still kind of the beginning for you all and it feels like it's been forever but also it feels like we just got started in a lot of ways and so making sure

[01:47:00]
because this is the first time that the board has ever got adopted very clear specific goals that says this is where this is exactly where we're going to go not we just want to improve student achievement but this is exactly how we want to improve student achievement it is natural that when you do progress monitoring you're not automatically going to say it's not going to automatically be like we are perfectly on track with exactly where we're going to be it is but we should be saying that we are moving in the right direction and I've been pleased as I've been watching your progress monitoring that you are starting to start that's what the data starting to reveal that you are moving in that right direction especially over the last year I think that that they had started to become more and more clear which is really really exciting for me as an outsider to watch so with all of that being

[01:48:00]
go to accomplish these three things requires creating the conditions for those things to happen and so I shared a number of resources with you before today and they so we talked about so I shared the documents that I shared were board work and superintendent work and how the board so how the board so the meeting agenda evaluation which gets into how the board is scheduling it's time and the conversations that you're having and your board committees and which is not I think that there is like white frequently this idea that the committee work or the committee diet is some kind of referendum on committees and it is absolutely not the board wants to have committees the board should have committees and what it is is a referendum on the board using its

[01:49:00]
and not to suggest that every committee meeting is a waste of time but the Board needs to be looking to see are these committees still working and moving Us in the direction of where we want to go is is this an effective way for us to accomplish our work and then the same thing with the policy diet and there is no point in there has been no point in the policy diet process where I have said like oh you need to get go get rid of that policy or like whatever the policies that you all chose to have and the purpose of the policy diet is to make sure that there are one there are not like new priorities or you're not like creating additional work with with policy and saying like hear our goals and then here's his policy that tells you to go do this other thing and it's a policies really are governing

[01:50:00]
what that they are creating clarity about how the how the governance happens and how how the goals in the guardrails are implemented and then you don't have you know Pages like $10,000 policies that you're going to have to review all the time that you want to have so few policies that you could probably review all of them and in a single board member term and then we get into one of the other things that I share was about effective governance so what is effective governance and what is effective meeting management so Robert's Rules of Order and Robert's Rules is not a governance framework and so if she is not a Robert's Rules framework they but they are designed to kind of goofy has been designed to go kind of hand in hand with Robert's Rules

[01:51:00]
so with that kind of high-level overview I want to open the floor and see what questions you will have about the different aspects of the work that I've identified and I have if you don't have any questions I have kind of some notes that are based on conversations that I've had with the our team has had with you all previously but yeah I just want to open the floor and see where you're at the survey that we all took about the government because I cannot find it and I would really love to see what they were I don't think so but that's going to be part of the the next conversation and for the 5.3 okay so I'm jumping ahead

[01:52:00]
I want to make sure I'm not missing anything yeah I don't know what the committee has what the committee is going to present on that but that will be part of the conversation I think the one of the things that we've talked about is our board guard rails and how we measure them how we hold ourselves to them how do we monitor them but also their relationship to both the governance manual and so I do think it's helpful to have some conversation about the guardrails and their relation to those things and I think also just the high news evaluation in part because of our commitment to spend 50% of our time on student outcomes I think we get caught up in what that means and what it doesn't mean and what we can do and what we can't do and what

[01:53:00]
swirl around all of those things and so just I think if we could just kind of double click on like the time use in particular and recognizing that time is a resource and how we allocate that resource towards our goals I think would help because I think to it's obviously related to the Committees and I wrote down what you wrote around our committee's moving Us in the direction that we want to go with a big question because I don't know that they are so for me that would be helpful just to spend some time there yeah so I'm actually going to hit on that before before the before going to the board guard rails because I think that actually informs like what how the board decided what their board guard rolls would be so the

[01:54:00]
the couple of things that I like the resources that I provided each of them really do speak to the board's use of time in your public meetings and so I will first I will clarify like what what do we actually mean by public meetings and so there is your New Mexico open meetings act that you know they it provides like exemptions for executive session like what is protected under executive session and then when you need to post meetings publicly so that's that's one one piece of it but specifically when you hear me talk about a board authorized public meeting I'm not talking about your open meetings act I'm talking about all meetings so what I mean when I say that is any board meeting that has been called by the board or

[01:55:00]
the entire board and that is not closed pursuant to the open meetings act and is not and that the board has the unilateral authority to choose whether or not to have so that could be your committee meetings it could be work sessions it could be work groups regardless of what you call them and if the board has authorized a group of individuals to conduct the work of the public then that is a board authorized public meeting so it's not a public meeting it's not public because of the way that it's like this meeting is being straight live streamed and that's great but that's not actually what makes it a public meeting that makes it a board authorized public meeting is that work of the public is being conducted in this meeting tonight

[01:56:00]
do we have to and if we do what is that timeline to put those meeting minutes out because we haven't really been doing that since the police so what is that possible so there are so there are two different things here there's one and what the New Mexico open meetings act requires and there's two what what is effective governance and so I don't actually have an answer on what the New Mexico open meetings act requires I don't think that you have to Most states don't require some states do but Most states don't require because I'm not at attorney I don't I don't know your I don't know the ins and outs of your open meeting some generals so I don't know the answer about what is legally required however the most effective boards regardless

[01:57:00]
of what kind of committee it is and whether it's an ad hoc or standing committee there will be some kind of reporting mechanism back to the board that is shared publicly so whether it is just a report that is accepted on the consent agenda or if it's something that's posted on your website however reporting back that reporting back to the board is important because it because of transparency so I would encourage you to make it as transparent as possible but that's not I mean that that ultimately it's a decision for you all to me a little more off the wall but um Off the Wall today

[01:58:00]
I feel at times and this is only my reflection of it that if you're you know with the horse and you have a guard rails that you know the little what are those called blinders the blinders that many times with the student outcome Focus governance and all the work that we're doing that we put on these blinders at times because we're not really looking at the world and what's going on around us because we're so focused on this that we lose sights of what's happening just around us and so we get caught in this busyness work then all of a sudden reality hits us and then we're all a little bit trying to figure out what do we need to do and that happened when as a new board member we didn't have the

[01:59:00]
but it's not tying in with what's going on here in the true reality so then you don't know how to stop for a moment figure it out because you're constantly going in this speediness way that we all of a sudden then get hit with something that that's supposed to be we're supposed to be aware of come January or whenever it occurred and then we're left with whatever the ramifications of it are because we've Let It Go for so long that but we're doing our still not getting our points we're doing all of those things yeah we're losing touch with

[02:00:00]
are community at times with what's going on in schools what's what what's hitting teachers what's safety is in our schools were and we're just yeah we focus we give guidance we give answers to soon but we're not answering these other things and the community sometimes gets very upset with us yeah so this is actually a really good question and a part of the reason that this Retreat is happening today is in response to the the the lack of I know that there was some some some onboarding and but that was developed by former board members former leadership and so they're not here so we're not going to get too deep into that but it is an opportunity to be able to provide a lot of that Clarity and

[02:01:00]
also what you talked about I want it so I want to address a specifically by talking about the difference between boardwalk and superintendent work and this the idea of 50% spending 50% of our time focused on those goals so the board so bored work consists of whatever the law has required of the board and whatever the board has required of the board so the board sets the goals the board sets the guard rails and so the board chooses what it's going to be and then you also have state law that says here are the things that the board has to has to do and these are the things that the board has to do and and specifically that the board cannot delegate to anybody else so for example you just had a pretty big vote on Wednesday and it was very uncomfortable

[02:02:00]
that you could there is no way that you could delegate that you cannot you cannot fully delegate that decision to your superintendent you as a board have to vote on you have to be the ones who make the final vote on the right size 8 and so it is absolutely expected acceptable and expected that and that you can have those conversations in your board meetings and but you also don't have to you can receive those you can get reports you can ask for that information and I think that one of the things that has happened is there has been kind of a is in the inside of not having like full understanding of what like what is not allowed that's one of the things that fell through the fell through the cracks and so getting those being able to ask for reports being able to

[02:03:00]
if you were to receive a report or have a presentation on right-sizing in your board meeting you absolutely should do that and if it means that you're not going to hit 50% for that month then you just make it up the next month or it's there are times when you're not going to be at 50% that is the aspiration 50% is aspiration that leaves the other 50% for all of the other stuff that you have to do and so so I definitely want the board to be clear that there is nothing that says that you cannot talk about any of this in your board meeting but it's just the term you use what is allowed and not allowed yeah and so then it's it's also the horse with these things where everybody tells you stay in your lane and then you're trying to figure out but then when something comes up and you're like

[02:04:00]
I don't know what's going on I'm caught and I don't know how to respond to community and then later on you find out there are a lot of things that weren't done and the responsibilities fell some on somebody else's hands but it's also with board and our obligations as elected officials it gets all tied in with us don't do that don't do that slap out of the hand yeah so the inside the right size and conversation there are aspects of our board work and there are aspects of right sizing that is superintendent work and so the board and what it really lies where it really lies is expertise the board and not

[02:05:00]
individual board members like you may have been actually I do have a board where there is there is someone who is literally a like he is a general contractor for like pretty large construction firm actually I served on a board with someone who was a general contractor for like Texas's largest minority-owned construction firm like you may have that expertise on your board but that is not why you're elected to serve on the board you're elected to govern not to manage facilities and that's not something that like that's not an S that's not so much that is state law that statue the the responsibilities and the authority of the board is actually very clearly lined out and state law and I think I think that Courtney and I had this conversation like very very early on when we when we started our engagement and it was around policy development

[02:06:00]
the board so I'm not going to rehash that policy so we're working on but there is a different so state law will say like the board has a responsibility to manage manage the district's aspects or assets and develop a budget and like the way that state law is written very much sounds like the expectation is that board members go and do all of these things but you're not literally in your on your campuses painting bathrooms or fixing toilets or hiring teachers or like that all of those things are delegated to the superintendent and so once something is delegated to the superintendent the board that has a responsibility to say all right superintendent this has been delegated to you it is now your responsibility and we are going to hold you accountable for whether or not

[02:07:00]
next time and at this this decision is moving Us in the direction of accomplishing our goals inside of that you still have it you still have you still have to know whether or not things are happening you got to know how the vehicle works but it's not necessarily focusing just on the one I got to know everything about what that thing is going on what's going on but it's great to know all the parts instead of trying to figure out oh you don't need to know that you just need a loud superintendent to do what she's doing but it's all so part of knowing what is the big picture how is everything connected so that way if you do go to community and of trying to give the answer you give them a at least a teaching moment to wear at least these are all the parts and this is how it works instead of saying oh I don't know or second guessing your answer then getting in trouble for later on for whatever

[02:08:00]
you said that not knowing how these parts work is a detriment to also trust is a detriment to also creating Unity it's it's it's it's it's one of these things that it's just like in special education if I don't know a parent they know their rights but if they could just know that they're going to figure out all the parts of the the machine and how it works but if they need to get specific then there's a way to get specific yeah but it's just not saying you don't need to know that yeah and so that's why the board and that's why the board rights policy so there are four primary types of policy that the board develops there is so your goals policy which are literally your goals your guardrails policy which are literally your guard rails and then my pointing to the right things and then you've got your governing policy which we're going to be talking about later and then you're delegation Pol

[02:09:00]
and in those policies that is how the board that is literally where the board says this is how we're going to delegate and you need to you as a board need to agree on what level of information you you need in Egypt from each of these pieces of Delegation that you do and so I think in some of some of your policies that I've seen it you know it'll say like the superintendent should provide a report on this annually or whenever like there sometimes it will actually provide that level of specificity I am indifferent to what that level is specificity is I would encourage that conversation to have with your policy director and with each other but you as a board need to come together and agree that that this is this is how we're going to go and that literally is what policy

[02:10:00]
policy is a an agreement of what it is how you're going to govern how you're going to delegate and how you're going to receive information and so all of these tools and resources that have been shared the way that the way that you evaluate and lay out your agenda for your board meetings there is if we had more time today I would take you through the process of actually like creating an ideal agenda like throwing state law out the window throwing out any kind of like past processes past ideas and just envisioning like if I were to have my perfect meeting agenda this is what it would look like we don't have that time today so we're not going to but I would love to take you out sometime if you if you would like to but that so when identifying what your meeting is going to look like how much time you're going to spend on the different items in your meeting

[02:11:00]
and then being clear about what you're going to spend your time on as a board that's through your goals and your guard rails and obviously stay at law with your committees so how much time are how are we going to authorize committees to utilize the board's time and this is an important distinction that because it is absolutely not there is nothing in the committee diet process that says that the board should not have a committee what we do encourage boards if you if your intention is to be the most effective creating the conditions to accomplish those goals then you are going to be very clear about how committee's operate and what happens in committees and what happens outside of committees and so I know the policy committee has been like a frequent conversation at no point have I ever said you have to get rid of your policy committee I think that's that's actually been

[02:12:00]
add a couple of times that is I've never I would never I was the chair of my own boards policy committee I'm not going to I'm not going to say that but the board does need to be clear about what the committee's purpose is what deliverables committees are are there to produce for the board and then they need to have so ideally they'll have a starting point so this is this is when the committee begins and then a stopping point this is when the committee ends and be clear about what happens after the committee ends so and the committee will report to the board and we'll provide a closing report on the board and that's final deliverables what happens if those final deliverables are completed at the end does the board does the board give them more time does the board say okay thank you for your service and now we're going to appoint

[02:13:00]
a different set of board members to go and complete the work you as a board have to decide what that what that looks like but I do encourage you all to be clear about what that is because it's inside of that like ambiguity where that that's where the lack of trust gets starts to get some you know because it just becomes this yeah and and then it's the lack of communication in trying to really understand this work is occurring and it is a different type of work and that it's yeah we have challenges but I think sometimes that that dialogue is never connected yeah and so we just continually stick to the guideline the deadlines yeah without even asking are we ready to meet that if not let's see what we can do to extend that can we do that but then many times the conversation because we are

[02:14:00]
oh they didn't they needed more time but they never had outcomes when really there was no dialogue with that committee and then the and it stays this way and so the when we're only looking at expectations and outcomes we're forgetting what is the processing getting there and what are some of the challenges that we are and this is why this is why it's really important and why I do I do encourage you as a board to be clear about those expectations up front because if you're clear about those expectations up front then when if you know exactly this is we're going to start on this date and on this date then this is the time frame that we have and then the committee can sit down and say this is this is the timeline that we that we

[02:15:00]
talk to complete our work so we need to do this this and this by the state and if you can't there should be dialogue yes and I think and you your board needs to you all need to decide what that looks like and so and that's where I'll call you in just a second so that's where the the recommendation for committee so most effective boards don't have these long-standing committees especially so the policy committee is one that is always like every single district there is discussion like some boards absolutely do not want to have a policy committee because policy is the main job of the board like Paul the board develops policy and so delegating it to a committee and often be frequently can be seen as the board kind of depending over

[02:16:00]
ownership of that work and taking like the most important thing out of out of the hands of the full board and then when it comes back it goes on the consent agenda and it's just it can get very complicated but those but those are boards that have really good processes in place around that boards that have those committees I do encourage that if you are going to have a standing policy committee that the board be clear of what the policy priorities so just like you have your legislative priorities every year that you also figure out what your policy priorities are going to be because then so what you don't want to happen with your committees is that you don't want you know one or two individuals to take up a huge amount of time for the board on things that are like personal personal agendas and personal personal things

[02:17:00]
I can point to a number of examples from a number of different boards I'm not going to but there are I think you can pretty much look at any board and see where that's the case and that's because we are by Nature elected we are literally elected officials so that's where you get pulled in that direction so without that the full board having that Clarity then it's just another opens up another vulnerability for the board so but I also don't think that it's appropriate for the board to say well no one gets to decide what the Polish you should be you should set your policy priorities and probably as a full board conversation before that at the beginning of every year so that you can kind of chart your course and if something comes up along the way then I identify it and say this is I think we need to add this to the policy committees deliverables and then have a conversation with the board is this is this something

[02:18:00]
the board wants to pursue and then delegate it to the policy committee but I also think that we need to also clarify what are the expectations as an official that's been elected to a position it shouldn't just be silenced I think there has to be a balance in that yeah but we're not being clear about that either and that's why the board the Board needs to have the conversation about it because they're so even though this board is comprised of seven individuals none of you not even the board chair has individual Authority you only have authority to act in a public board meeting when you were voting as a body and so you only the bot the board is who has the authority so no individual board member

[02:19:00]
it is this is in your state statute no individual board member has has authority to act on their own and I'm only saying that because when you go to the community and especially with Wednesday night's meeting community members will tell you you're an elected official you shouldn't allow them to do and say and be what they're in what they're doing to you but it's also saying but we have a framework and how we have to treat each other and but people but the community gets very confused on why aren't you doing this and why are you doing that and that the and we're saying well we got the framework but they don't understand that now but then they're telling you you're an elected official you got to do what we've asked you to do yeah but then when you have the framework there's you know and then the and then the people see you

[02:20:00]
and they're just thinking get your get your courage and get your bones up why are you allowing them to do that to you yeah and so that's when you're you're stuck in the position of asking yourself do I go against the framework because that's what we're doing or do I speak my mind do I say what I need to is it possible to do both yes what I'm saying because we're not we're not giving that leeway though you definitely have that leeway you definitely have that Authority information so that I can inform my community about this is what my world is now as a board member through this framework and that helped a lot because now Community they still come to me and they tell me these things but they understand my role in my limitations and I think that could be something that is something that we're trying to do now with the town halls that we're having in January

[02:21:00]
but it's really important because that piece exactly is our community doesn't know and doesn't understand and they are used to elected officials they're like we can just tell you what to do because you represent us and it's not always like that right and yeah especially when you're holding that expertise so I need to go to board member Jackson before we well you you started the conversation so I've been kind of taking notes and and I think where where something's getting lost is that exact we are elected a seven different people who bring seven different messages and we have this impression that we're supposed to and we are right we're supposed to bring our voice of the community where I think the connection is getting lost is

[02:22:00]
how does that influence the outcome of the goals in the guard rails and the superintendent's actions how do we do that and so I think what especially Janelle and I having worked through the at the governance manual one thing that you'll see as we come to that is that we're trying to increase the communication I don't want to say requirements but maybe expectations that we as board members have of each other of communicating back to each other what we are hearing from the community and that's not necessarily reporting back okay Gabriella this is what you need to do for my district it's we as a collective voice we are hearing this collectively what are we now going to do with that information that we have is it does it affect the goals or is this the collection

[02:23:00]
set of information that might be helpful to the superintendent or is it something that the board has to act on so hopefully as we get to that section of the government's manual you can maybe see how we're attempting to influence that but what I've always kind of realized is in it speaks to the policy policy governance versus student outcomes Focus governance policy governance is seven different people trying to create seven different policies based on their seven different districts and then hoping that one of us wins out and that creates chaos within the School District student outcomes Focus governance is the seven of us collectively are working on that and that and the way that we influence that is collectively bringing the voice of the community

[02:24:00]
because the community knows this and this is their voice and they are and and they know when we don't hear and listen they're they're also telling you you're not listening to your own goals you're not doing what you said you were going to do and then you're stuck there because you're trying to to do what you need to community it's so critical and it is like what we've talked about is looking forward from like the community engagement expectations because not only do we need to receive the information we also need to give the information and and it is

[02:25:00]
start training of and it's hard it creates tension like I totally get it I have stood in front of people really upset that I am not doing what they want me to do but it's it's a hard conversation but it's it's critical to us collectively being able to move the district forward and so I think on our way we have a community engagement Retreat schedule then January or we've got an idea for it in January maybe February somewhere I think it was before the end of its before the it's before the end of February because it's before the end of our our PSA with the council and so we will we will go really deep into this concept at that time

[02:26:00]
how are you I'm good thank you it's been a rich conversation it's good to see you I'm sorry that I didn't notice that you enjoyed this already have anything that you'd like to add I do I have a I just have an observation about Community engagement to piggyback off of both board member Ronaldo and Courtney Jackson's comments and observations frankly that the community is pointing to and that one is capital outlay

[02:27:00]
building conditions don't make for optimal learning conditions and we get that not only from staff but also from from a teaching and learning standpoint but we also get that from parents for the same reason so how to that's the challenge right we talked about addressing some key details that impact student outcomes and the other thing which is not going to go away and and so that was a big topic you know that the community is pointing to guardrail

[02:28:00]
or and they don't what's not listed up there are the interims so they don't know that the that we have very narrowly defined what which guard how we interpret that guard rail or how the administration is interpreting that guard rail and so I think this these two issues are with the community is bringing up if we mention the targeted population of the Martinez Yazzie groups that we that we

[02:29:00]
performative if we are not truly all of us engaging those targeted populations in each of our districts and I'm not saying that it's only those groups because I think it's an opportunity to expand out of those groups and inform the greater Chamber of Commerce greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce the Native American Chamber of Commerce the Hispanic chamber of commerce right I mean all these other groups need to understand what these two goals mean and how to bridge the disconnect right now between those targeted populations and the Greater Community so I just felt like I needed to share those

[02:30:00]
observations thank you board member Dominguez and so because because because Community engagement is it is not so it's not really what we're talking about today like I I want to be careful about not about going too deep into the community engagement conversation because we do have a separate Retreat specifically for this but I do want to acknowledge what has been said and specifically what happens when the community so you set your goals you set your guard rails what happens when new people in the community come back and say well I have this other concern and so the Board needs to I'm going to sound like a broken record The Board needs to decide what to do in that situation first and foremost once again and then but also

[02:31:00]
your goals and your guard rails are 5-year-olds and so your guard rolls should last the same the same length of time as your as your goals changing so if a you've engaged the community and those groups were engaged when these were developed and actually had a and they were when the when the feedback was waited and shared with everyone they actually were giving and almost a disproportionate like waiting so their their voice was waited more impact and that actually is reflected in the in the guard rails that you see so whenever you have issues like this that come up and what we call Whirlwind things that come up

[02:32:00]
when is a board member say okay I'm going to we're going I'm going to give time to this this group or I'm going to refocus in that area it is going to have the impact of taking Focus away from accomplishing those things that the community that the Greater Community has said is important especially where there is already that with your like specifically targeted groups have like their voice is carry the loudest and so the goals and the guard rails really do it's not just that they're like important things that we talked about but it really is what what the community has said is our focus and so when these things come up being able to the board has opportunity to provide that leadership

[02:33:00]
play this is let me help you understand and so you all again have to figure out what that's going to look like I see I know that a couple of a couple of people have raised their hands I do want to get us back on track with the main conversation because I know that we are like really running down on time so is there anything else so I want to reserve the remainder of community engagement discussion for our next retreat but is there anything else that is specific to the Frameworks that have been shared and the specifically around the the use of time real quick yeah it's been brought up that there are a deadline for deliverables and sometimes they can't be that I understand that well human beings we have very busy lives but I think that we really need to take personal accountability here and be honest with ourselves and say you know we can delay to clarify if we don't get that clarification we're still on the hook to provide

[02:34:00]
then we can say this is who we reach out to this is what we tried to find out this is what I produce based on the information I was given or not given that's totally valid same thing about delaying to prevent is depending on what the prevention is for I want to hear more people talk about this I want to get more information that's fine delaying to prevent to ultimately sabotage that's not okay so I think we need to be real honest with what it is we're asking for when it comes to a deadline that we can meet or not meet yeah absolutely yes and the only what I was going to bring up is just throw on the topic of community engagement how do you start rebuilding trust so I'm just throwing that out there for January yeah and then the other thing is with what we're discussing is Wednesday before Wednesday I had a different Outlook after when I read this

[02:35:00]
after Wednesday this is all of that this information was just more facade for me because of the feelings I was going through and looking at all the documents I was just like this are we just using this to hide that and not be real about what's going on are we just putting a Band-Aid over or whatever we feel we need to put a Band-Aid over what do you mean learning the information and having all of the particulars on how we need to conduct our business and do what's needed based on Wednesday meeting because of the distrust I read it and I'm like this isn't true

[02:36:00]
so it's also saying to me whatever I'm feeling and whatever I'm going through to really enable and move forward in that I got to feel okay with it but if I'm not feeling okay because of what happened on Wednesday and based on it being our framework and based it on it leading us into whatever needs to happen when life hits you and when you're sitting at a board meeting and you're seeing all of this play forward you are seeing the lies you're also seeing the lack of using it to create an image or an illusion that isn't real and I'm only saying that because that's where I'm sitting right now yeah and then we reading the documents last night I don't want to read them because I've already established in me

[02:37:00]
what are we going to do with this is it going to be our truth or are we just going to continue moving along in our on our on our road that are we going to really be serious about adult behaviors and that's not something of a continuously have brought up I think I'm trying to I'm trying to just understand what it is that you're that you're saying so because of the trust that so because of the lack of trust that you have are you speaking for the your team on the board or for the district or whatever you know but the reality of the world and the reality of where I'm sitting based on

[02:38:00]
prior to Wednesday and prior to a lot of things and then not getting your questions answered but just told to do this and follow through and do your job are you not getting are there not questions being answered this question that I have not had answered and I don't want to bring those up right now but my thing is that not only questions but it's also and this is the thing I'm serious about is these adult behaviors and if we have no evaluation on that and we're just saying adult behaviors change and then I don't even see it in our governance manual we get to these critical places of character and we're not addressing them because they're adult behaviors I just feel like we're just moving along and yeah we

[02:39:00]
so and then the trust comes in again on Wednesday so I'm trying to figure out when are we going to be serious about this okay so the Courtney so that that some of that sentiment was reflected in the survey that came across and not just from you and there and and I think Daniel brought this up we really hope that if we can get to it that that board guard rail number one there was a lot of concern around that and that that one needs to be strengthened or discussed a little bit as well as what are the how do we evaluate whether or not we're holding ourselves to those board guard rails and what happens if we determined that we are not holding ourselves so that sentiment I think maybe we can table for just a minute because we hope we recognize that in the survey and we want to have that discussion

[02:40:00]
we got to that point of the governance manual cuz you're not the only one to have said that and so I want to I don't want to I absolutely don't want you to feel like I am dismissing what you just said because I think that it is very important and I want to continue this conversation I also want to make sure that we take a quick break and get lunches we're going to so we're just going to grab our lunches and come back and go into work and conversation when we come back I want to transition to discussing the board guard rails the briefly before we do that I will I want to talk about what you mentioned about evaluation because we do have some mechanisms in place for you so we come back we'll do that how long is the presentation on the government's manual I mean I think we can do it in five minutes just like we can okay okay and then I do want to reserve so I want to reserve at least 30 minutes

[02:41:00]
after we come back for you to actually provide feedback and and really deliberate the government's annual so let's take a quick break just to grab her grab our lunches and maybe 5 minutes is that good okay perfect I'll see you back in just a few minutes yes

[02:50:00]
and there's remember Dominguez with us she is still on Zoom okay perfect and we are streaming so we are reconvening and moving to agenda item 3.39 so before we move to 3. 3 0 4

[02:51:00]
play adult behaviors change this is the thing that you all are probably tired of hearing me say by now but what is it actually mean to change adult behaviors and so we actually this framework actually provides a couple of instruments for the board to actually evaluate whether or not those behaviors are changing and so we've been you have you have the framework which lays out those effective board behaviors that are most aligned with improving governing and districts that improve student outcomes so you have your annual self-evaluation or your quarterly self-evaluation that you all you will complete your quarterly self-evaluation you go through it and that gives you really an opportunity to just identify like where where are adult behaviors changing and where do we still have work to do this is not a not a conversation

[02:52:00]
about judgment or blame or shame this is really just a checkpoint just to see if it is just like when you step on the scale and when you're trying to lose weight if anyone has ever gone through that experience you may have feelings tied to it but it is it is not about this feelings about taking just taking stock of where you are and towards accomplishing your goals just like with your progress monitoring and so this is a time for the board to be able to look and see how those behaviors are changing also tied to that self-evaluation is your time use evaluation again it's really easy to get caught up in that 50% like oh my God we haven't gotten to that 50% and as has been mentioned inside of that kind of like it's really easy to get caught up in the tunnel vision of are we spending that 50% of

[02:53:00]
and yes you're bored is you are most likely to see movement towards accomplishing those goals if you are spending the majority of your time in your board meetings talking about those goals because that's what you talked about in your board meetings are the same thing that's that everybody else is going to be talking about throughout the district so if you were talking about the color of school buses in your board meetings that's what people are going to talk about if you're sending the majority of your time talking about teacher evaluations or talking about the budget or talking about any number of other like very important things that happen in this District not suggesting it all that those things are not important but if that's what you're spending the majority of your time on and that's what the district is going to spend the majority of its time on we say what happens in the boardroom will be seen in the

[02:54:00]
and so if you want if you want your District to be spending the majority of its time on on whether or not you're not comes or improving then you as a board need to model that Expectations by doing it yourself and that's the reason for the 50% goal that 50% isn't going to happen every single month and that is that is normal I don't want it I don't want to insinuate that that should become that you should never spend the 50% of the time it is definitely the the goal to get to that point but that does not mean that if you have a big issue that comes up that you cannot ever divert some attention for the time being but you as a board need to decide is this something that is this something that is worthwhile for us to is it is the cost associated with that diversion of time is it worth

[02:55:00]
the benefit so does the benefit outweigh the cost oh board member Dominguez thank you for saying that because I think there has been a myopia that has set in on time usage and that 50% that has shut down conversation about other important topics and they're not related to the color on a wall you know I want to get related to slowing down and asking for some onboarding that often times is interpreted as well just go read something so what's important particularly for new board members is what we're doing right now is talking

[02:56:00]
how about an interpretation or you know questioning how do we do how do we get to that is it really important to get to the 50% or to allow us to ask some questions around around around will take the very real issue of right-sizing and repurposing what was the role of the board in that what was the history behind that into your point about how we arrived at the goals in the guard rails we have the Indian education well we have the next Navajo Nation superintendent telling me and my

[02:57:00]
Community engagement I have no way of checking with about that so that kind of History would be important to to share so that we all have that shared history right we all have an understanding of how we came to the goals in the guardrails and I know that eats into the 50% aspirational goal of time usage of those are the specific examples that come to mind where it's important to build a sense of unity about the history informing where we are and where we're headed and why we're headed in that direction so that's it

[02:58:00]
thank you board member and to that note so the question that you asked is what is the role of the board in this process and so there are like you have legal requirements that are that the statute plays out like what the role of the board is but then also the board so remember board work is what the law requires that the board and what the board requires that the board and so the Board needs to be clear on what those things are so it is if the board thinks that and when I say the word I'm again talking about the board not an individual board member but the board and if the board has decided that this is this is a worthy use of our time then the board should be able to spend its time in that way and I don't know

[02:59:00]
and we'll get into this in the the next the next conversation but if the board does not have a policy that that stipulates how many board members it takes to be able to put something on the agenda then I'd strongly encourage you to do that because that is actually how the board can do that can can ensure that the things that are important are are able to be brought up but also protecting your use of protecting the expectations that you're setting in the community and the things that you're telling the community you value okay so I want to so we talked about our time you and there's also a gold monitoring evaluation and that is really about the the way that the it is evaluating how the board is engaging in those monitoring conversations how those are you asking questions

[03:00:00]
in advance or is everyone engaged or is everyone prepared and are you asking those smart questions and again just like all of the other evaluations it is not that they are not there to be weaponized they are not there to beat anyone up on the border say oh how dare you not do this but it the the smart question framework exists to make sure that your conversations are Jermaine to what is being discussed so it is like very closely tied to your meeting management system making sure that the discussion that you have put on the agenda and your goal monitoring discussion is the thing that you're discussing and not going into going off into things that are kind of loosely connected it really is a conversation for the board to understand what the reality is for students and how the district is moving in the direction of the vision

[03:01:00]
so are we what is the reality and how is the reality aligned with the vision and then finally is the staff use the staff time use evaluation and so this is an important one because you actually have a you have a board guard rail that is specific to how the board how the board is using staff time and and so in general when you have a so when the board has not adopted a guard rail I would encourage that be an annual report and it's usually an estimate where they take three months of each each Cabinet member takes that they meet with their staff and they identify how much time have we think we spent over the last three months supporting board work so meetings at the board that's one-on-one meetings work

[03:02:00]
open meetings study groups like any kind of use of Staff time responding to questions everything and identifying what time preparing for board meetings attending board meetings debriefing board meetings and then everything else and then inside of those those four categories dividing it into two sections the first is time that would be spent regardless of how the how the board was engaging and the other is time spent because of how the board is engaging so if it is if you're responding to board questions and that's time spent because of the board and if it's you know Dr Albright and Gonzalez you know preparing the boardroom for the board meeting that they're going to be doing that regardless so dividing it up in that way again is not there to be weaponized it is not there to say and it's not done by individual board member either

[03:03:00]
now because you have a guard rail that is specific to how the board's time is used then you as a board can figure out if if this is a resource that you want to use to know whether or not that guardrail is being that bored guard girl is being honored from earlier and so with that I am now going to transition or I'm going to go back to president Gonzalez to transition to the next agenda item thank you we will now transition to the next to which is 3.3 the governance manual presentation and discussion

[03:04:00]
remember Astoria and I meant twice and to review the the governess thank you very much again I met at twice to review the governance manual the process that we took to do that was she and I had access to the survey that the board members provided and individually and collectively we reviewed the survey to kind of determine what some of the themes were that were coming through in that survey where there were maybe questions and then where there were things that board members agreed upon to either be deleted or revised so using that information we took an I want to be very clear about this we took the governance manual that we have currently

[03:05:00]
nothing that nothing that has any of the potential amendments anything that nothing that has not fully been voted on by the board so we reviewed the governance manual that we had that has been collectively agreed upon by the board we either inserted or deleted certain points based on what we reviewed from the survey and any of the other potential edits or changes like you know from Wednesday when we delay that discussion those and I think Christie's going to throw it up here in a minute when we review the governance manual those will be in a different color the reason that we felt it was important to only edit the document that we had in front of us was because there is a potential I don't I'm not saying it's there but there's a potential that some of the

[03:06:00]
sentiments that came back from the full board might be in conflict with some of the potential changes coming through the on the policy side so I'm not saying there is I just wanted to make sure that those were in different colors so that we could make sure that we reviewed make sure that there was alignment and symmetry between that so when that gets thrown up you'll see you'll see the changes anything you want to add about the overall process I think just something to like some background that helped me when we were going through this is reminding myself that this governance manual is a guide for the board and how we hold ourselves accountable so it's not something where we're putting in their how we're going to govern the district or how we're going to move upon the district but how we're holding ourselves accountable to our daughter

[03:07:00]
but I think that's important because some of the feedback that we got on the survey had a lot to do with things that we can discuss but might not be implemented in the manual because this is just for the board accountability so I will go through that as as we talked about some of those changes because we think it's important to to bring up but just some of that background is anybody have that documented in a PDF or anything that you could send to us because I really love to have it sent to you by email this morning so I think once you change it to view only it doesn't allow us to see the track changes because I couldn't see those either they're not in there yeah

[03:08:00]
can you just send it with everybody as an editor so that everybody can see the changes okay did you get it Josie I think she's resending everything

[03:09:00]
thank you for the food

[03:10:00]
okay so I'm going down to the background one thing I would like to just point out is I was acting as scribe it's not necessarily that I am the one who made all of these changes its that I was just described so it'll show that I put in all of the changes but this was not Courtney Jackson deciding this is how it should be okay so at the very top this is the background section you can just see a couple additions and some of those were just meant to clarify if you can go up just a little bit more Christy there's so at the very top I just added governance you know governance structure just to kind of give that some

[03:11:00]
more distinct terminology and then the next section is to Janelle's point about the governance manual is really about it's not only how the board governs the district but it's also how we regulate our own conduct so there's that and then the main point down at the bottom is that we added a simple statement added at the bottom to clearly delineate the policy-making authority of each entity that being the entities of the board and the entity of the superintendent if and when additional policies are created so and I think what we can do is if it's okay with you guys we can cruise through just Top Line because I believe that we're actually going to walk around and read all these more more in particular is that okay okay so if you go to the goals policy section that's the next all I did we didn't have the current goals policy in so we updated it to our current goals

[03:12:00]
if you go to the guardrails policy number two there were no changes to the guardrails policy if you go to the next page which is the theory of action there's just a note to make sure that that emerging stronger 5 year strategic plan I believe there's been updates to it so we just need to make sure that that the link to that is is accurate if you go to the delegation policy section that's Section 3 there were no changes that all in the delegations policy section and then if we go to governance to four so this is where the meet of it happened okay in 48 under governance commitment that statement the boards official and only connection to the school districts operation performance and conduct is through the superintendent that was a request to add that statement board accountability no changes for sea guard

[03:13:00]
wheels for the board that statement was added to there are requests from board members to strengthen this guardrail and we have a note that we would like to discuss this a little bit further that statement was simply added to kind of as an accountability statement that each board member will hold themselves accountable to the following and we in Janelle and I did have this discussion about agreed upon that it was important to maybe have that in there because we're agreeing as a group that we are going to follow these guardrails going to for D board responsibilities and Authority anything in pink was added at the request request to add those statements for E board membership requirements we updated the statutory training requirements

[03:14:00]
number four and we added that last statement at the request of a board member going to 4S there were no changes the last statement would you mind reading it oh sure you guys are going really fast I can board members will review the governance manual annual again that's important it was a lot of Need for accountability do you want to take over and there was nothing on for Africa on 4G again this was board member performance concerns there was some changes here and mostly again to reflect the survey results needing a process on how we handle board member performance concerns specifically how does that work if it's part of the executive committee right how does one report somebody

[03:15:00]
change at the top to include if you all are okay with it if we violate code of conduct policy state or federal law or Provisions within the governance manual so again making sure that we talked about that accountability especially with our board guard rails so that one has a lot of process which is why it's so long from 4 to 10:00 and we can go around the room you can let us know that as a process that you agree with but we thought it would be good just to be thorough because that was something that was needed for 4-H we did some changes here and if you can see first meeting was highlighted because there has been discussion on do we want to elect officers the first meeting or the second meeting of the Year based on what new board members have suggested

[03:16:00]
but it came to our understanding that we I believe it's statute that we have to elect officers the first meeting of the year but we can do the second meeting of the year is elected committee chairs so we put that in there as well but just so you all have that information that that is something that we are required to do for the first meeting of the year and then we also added in their new system that we have adopted which is making sure anybody is interested in who's interested in an office Position will put a written submission sitting their desire to serve as any of the officers and we also added a sentence to reflect the rubric that was sent out so we can have that resources as well when you're writing your statements we have some changes around the executive committee and the agenda preparation just a quick little sentence tweak

[03:17:00]
there are other amendments to the president's Rule and also the secretary Rule and that was the secretary rule I could speak on because that is something that for services is now doing so I will no longer facilitate or the secretary will no longer facilitate recognitions that's the board service is and that's what we're doing before the board meeting so like Employee of the Month things like that for I there was some changes at the bottom around the Committees so this is something that was also requested talking about deadlines and I know we're going to have brought this up and what we should do with deadlines are not met so if you can't read that he says task force made up of board members under community members brought together to accomplish a specific objective with the expectation that the group will disband when the objective has been completed or the deadline has been reached

[03:18:00]
each committee or task force will be will have a chair who is responsible for providing regular updates on progress and committees that fail to provide their deliverable back to the full board by the due date will be disbanded and the board president May create a new committee to accomplish that deliverable wherever shared the field committee should not be placed on any replacement committee and one thing to point out so the stuff that's in pink is the work of the ad hoc committee the stuff that's in purple is the potential edits from the policy committee board policy scope and development we added a sentence there the board should adopt and maintain a manageable number of policies so that the full board can review each policy at least once during every 4-year board member term which is something that we also discussed earlier today that Ashley had brought up just so we have that in writing and then we don't have

[03:19:00]
anything else until 4K which is the board president will ensure that meeting agenda items include only that according to board policy only issues sorry that according to board policy are within the boards authority to decide or monitor so going back to agenda setting right and what should be on agenda items should be an agenda item goes back to the issues that the board has control over that's one thing and then again we don't have anything all the way until 4:00 which we didn't have any changes for public participation board meetings but we did want to discuss some of this because there was some survey results regarding public forum and if we would like to change the sequence of how public forum members come to the podium so our understanding under the nmsba rules is that

[03:20:00]
we do have to have public forum but it's up to the authority of the board to decide how we want to do that right so we can do it anyway we can say students come first to the podium or it's only going to be people speaking on agenda items that we have things like that so a point of clarification so is it nmsba that requires us to have because remember that requires us to have public forum because the open meetings act does not okay and I can also bring where I found that it's on the nmsba like structure so if anybody wants that I can because I agree I didn't see that either so that was a discussion point if we didn't want to change that with that would look like on public forum the next one is four Peak Community engagement with the Board of Education we added a sentence at that first paragraph that says for more guidance on managing information or feedback from constituents refer to section for our which is the RFI

[03:21:00]
is that will hopefully be implemented and that is more because we didn't want to put a whole lot of information in this section because again this is just for like our knowledge and if we wanted to engage with community in different ways and see what it was if a constituent came to us and we wanted to request more information about an issue that they had brought to us what was that like what was that process to make sure that we're getting information on for number three the board service is office will summarize information correspondence contact information and comments received by constituents before providing the information to individual board members additional platforms were constituents may contact board members include let's talk individual emails the board service email and social media services so something that was changed their is that there was a sentence that was said Ford Services office will not be required to present Anonymous information to board members and with

[03:22:00]
play discussion we felt like some of those anonymous messages are probably the most important because they don't feel safe to share their information so he strikes that and we just put that the board Service Center or the Board of Services will provide all summarized information to us including contact information because I know with let's talk sometimes you don't get the contact information when we are emails those those concerns so that's some background that one and then the last one is for you the last sentence that we just added was the superintendent will provide a summarized update to the board member who submitted the concern if legally appropriate because again this has to do with employee performance issues which is not our responsibility but if we bring something to the superintendent that is a concern we would like to have just an update for our own knowledge and also so we can update our constituents if they're asking about this if it's legal

[03:23:00]
available so I know that sometimes I can get a little money is there anything that you would like to add more Jackson no I think the one thing that I would request I know we're running like we're running short on time is 4r which is the request for information policy is currently in the comment period it's in the 30-day comment period so I would encourage all the board members to go read or are right now and see if it makes sense if it's what like if it's the request for information for because that will come forward at a later time but but also as you're reading it in the context of the full governance manual is is it all making is it allowing making sense so that was a little bit more than five minutes I'm sorry but there was trying to find it but it was about seeking legal council

[03:24:00]
I'm trying to find where that was but again most of us were in that training with Tony and the process is is pretty clear is that legal counsel goes to the board President we all have access to them but there is a charge right anytime we see Google cancel we encourage charge and the process that Tony suggested was we push the concern through the board president and she necessarily doesn't say yes or no you can't contact them but it's a way for us to determine if we can find a solution in house before going and seeking legal counsel so I know that that was a question on the survey that I wanted to also just bring up can I ask him a question based on my survey response because I think that this is 45 is where the question came board members with the exception of the board president will not make requests or seek legal advice from lawyers or law firms weather in house or outside of AP

[03:25:00]
it's confusing I interpret it as unless there is full board approval only the board president can seek legal counsel if there is board approval a member or other members can seek legal counsel so is that so I think that's what did you just explain this I'm sorry I was trying to clarify when we had the workshop we all have access to legal counsel but because it ends a charge every single time the process is to go to the board president so that we can try and figure out information within word Services before seeking that cancel but we do have access to it it's just a call okay but if there's changes that you want to see in the wording of we can talk about that now and I think that it's maybe the the board the Via board approval what that what does trying to clarify is that on issues not

[03:26:00]
can't go seek legal advice because it includes a cost it and it's well I understand that but I guess I'm sorry I'm being super technical maybe we can discuss this at another time but if there was something that I wanted to talk to the attorney about and I know I can't do it you know I shouldn't do it I should go to the president if I wanted to bring it before the board in the board approved me is that what that saying I guess I'm curious about the process because it says full board approval what does that mean yeah no it doesn't mean that like if you have a question about something it's simply means like you would go to jail or the board president and say I have a question about this and I'd like to see legal advice then that's kind of where that like collaboration comes in is the board president would then be able to say well we've already reached out or and it's it's that

[03:27:00]
it's meant to make sure that there is that nobody goes Rogue and if we need to run it through chat TV right now so it's kind of just like we all discuss it and we all vote but sorry sorry sorry I'm not I'm not advocating for one over the other I'm just saying it needs to be very clear

[03:28:00]
so the code of conduct that is the that was like that huge pink section where we outlined a process and then I can have my question yes yeah that was in 4G so you know so I mean I have some reservations incorrect revisions attributed to policy committee work but here's my overarching question this is really we're not making any decisions right now correct because this is last minute we've not really we've not seen this is

[03:29:00]
this is for discussion only for member okay so we are all going to get this document where we see all the changes is that correct I mean and and when are we going to revisit what is the next the next stop the next step is that it goes to the policy committee January 6th that will be an opportunity to make direct changes since the board members as is the custom process can provide feedback the thing to clarify is when we provide feedback on our own governance manual it's not for board services or the superintendent to answer it's to go to the committee for the committee and the board to answer then it'll go to the February board meeting and I just wanted to ask you Christine I looked at the agenda and the governance manual portion wasn't on the agenda for policy Committee in January 6th so we can just double check that

[03:30:00]
will double check that thank you are there any general questions before we before we invite board members to go around and provide a specific comments to each item number to provide your comments on the on these items to the committee via email so I'm happy to do that is there a deadline because I'm I'm busy and so I hope the deadline does not

[03:31:00]
what's the deadline that's a simple question right now for remember and please make the deadline this is my only request I want you know time for thoughtful review of all this they're looking at their calendars right now to identify a deadline so we are proposing a deadline of January 2nd have all of the comments in and so then the ad hoc committee can meet on January 3rd to review everything and that would be fine it would just mean that the document would not be able to be part of the legal posting which needs to happen on January 3rd on January 3rd by 5 on January 3rd

[03:32:00]
so if we meet in the morning of January 3rd I'm sorry I misspoke that posting will need to be Thursday by 5:00 because it's a Monday meeting okay so bye so we can do January 2nd due date to quickly that would be helpful what if we postpone policy committee to January 13th we can make that happen period

[03:33:00]
give me the logistics of what that means so we would have until the following Thursday the 9th would be the deadline the 9th would be when the materials are posted I would like to suggest that if we if we move it to January 13th that we make the deadline for materials by like January 6th so that the ad hoc committee has we have yeah we can meet on the 7th and then we can have the documents in by the 8th so that is by the name so I was going to suggest that we give us till the 7th I think you could that would still give the ad hoc committee time on the 8th right can we compromise and say 5 p.m. on January 6th

[03:34:00]
so that we get the documents by the 7th I would like to hear from other members I think that that's fine as long as we get the document with the truck changes and I think if we can make it a PDF so that nothing can be modified I think it would be easier to send it out that way and also the survey results then I'm good since you're not in the room and you won't be able to see the feedback that so one of the benefits of doing the feedback shirt like they're about like the board is about to engage

[03:35:00]
they can see the things that other people are commenting as they're writing out notes so so that you have the same benefit of being able to read what everyone else has said I'll make sure that we take pictures of of the of the postings and send them to you so that you get you have that benefit as well thank you so I'm still I'd like to hear from others about the January at 5:00 p.m. is that correct is there anyone that does not agree to that deadline okay so that's good with everyone then that's what the board can do and then we will

[03:36:00]
whooping go ahead and move into we've got only got about 15 minutes left for the final piece so I want to make sure the dates are reflected in the minutes period I'm sorry I just want to make sure that we have captured in the minutes the time frame and deadlines that we just agreed to and the movement of the policy committee to the 13th it has been done and that you're going to send me some instructions so have posted the the printed copies of the governance manual around the room with the tracked changes and so I'm going to give everyone a sticky pad so you can go around and as you see something that you have

[03:37:00]
ask you that you to write it down on the sticky pad and then stick it to the paper and then we will record everything and and take those and share them share the feedback with the committee and so we will will take about 15 minutes to do this will come back at 9:00 or no I'm sorry 11:59 and close this out right to clarify that board services will take photos because we need to provide to Crystal and Josefina oh thank you Google Assistant

[03:38:00]
need to be changed I would like to see those results oh okay okay

[03:39:00]
do you have any interest in doing this stuff going to take pictures and send them to you right okay

[03:53:00]
to the group then you can do that as well who should they direct those that feedback to would it be the committee or would it be for board Services the committee through board Services okay that sounds great so are there any questions about this process before we close out all right I appreciate your your engagement this morning and showing up and leaning into these conversations it has been a pleasure to be here with you all and to move us into this just moving this board forward and starting to talk about the concepts that we've discussed today with that I will turn it back to board chair Gonzalez our next Board of Education meeting is Wednesday January 15th at 5:00 p.m.
