I would like to call the meeting to order Miss King may I have a roll call please Yolanda Montoya Cordova Peggy Miller Erika Gonzalez Peterson Jackson so our first item for consideration and action is adoption of the February 22nd finance committee meeting agenda and approval of the January 25th 2023 Finance Community finance committee meeting minutes however on our agenda we will be removing items for a and 4r off of consent so may I have a motion please I need to prove the February 22nd 2020 31st committee meeting agenda as amended and approved the January 25th 2023 finance committee meeting

[00:01:00]
item for consideration is item a which is consideration for approval of budget adjustments to existing Grant budget for the following funds this is a discussion action item we have items one through five listed I have missed Marin here who will be discussing it she's our senior director from Grant Management and I will actually open this up to the board for any comments or questions on this particular item okay so I just I had some follow up some follow-up questions about the family index so it was like a 3.6 million dollar total I think was with the grant was and so my question was there I got we got a list of what the almost 4 million dollars

[00:02:00]
spent on and there was like over like 60 different you know spins and I know Miss Mary and this is probably going to be hard it's probably going to be a program person that has to pray answer this question but with so much I know it's it's you know a brand new pilot so we don't have any data yet and it's I think a two-year pilot so I know there's not data and I understand that but was so much going on you know math rigor play Works MLS players World Avid Ark pbl World glasses a lot of them how are you how will they know what's working if you're using all of those as far as improving student outcomes thank you for your question that will probably be assessed at the end of the two years

[00:03:00]
as we are already aware that during the current legislative session there is discussion of additional funding in the continuation of the pilot and I do have executive director Penelope Bouchard I believe logged into the meeting and she might be able to provide a little bit more details on this particular initiative thank you mija board member of the board superintendent Elder so the other just to know in the list that you were provided when you asked that question these are pulled out of each individual schools budget call so what the schools have been asked to do is to align their program to their 90-day plan for looking at those outcomes so every school is not doing all of these things that you listed as I compiled it when I

[00:04:00]
admitted that but I think the each individual school will be able to look at the specifics of what they did at their school and how that impacted students at their individual schools if that answers your question okay and so you you believe that they have the ability to really delve into the dad that data to know that these program let's say one school has five of these programs or resources or you know Personnel that they'll be able to figure out up this one isn't working this one is working you believe they'll be able to do that at the end of the pilot when they do when are they going to not assess until the end of the two years so board member on the individual schools will be asked to compile the data they did last year in which associate superintendent Geneva collected that information we will

[00:05:00]
Publix being in program as soon as that's asked to report that out to the PED as soon as we have that document from the PED but I do know and understand from the associates that they are already asking individual schools to collect that data so for example if they have funded an interventionist what is the data for the students specifically that are seeing that interventionist okay okay well that's good and then another thing I know one of the things that was listed is that you are also hiring extra people who are going to be pushed into the classrooms to help you know with our students learning needs has that already occurred yes so all the positions are already in out in the schools and pulling that today and looks like direct instruction there's seven in that area indirect more counselor librarian Social Work type of positions there's about seven and then

[00:06:00]
very minimal about three in the the higher 2000 category Martin direct support so those are those positions are already in the schools helping to support students at a variety of different levels okay wonderful thank you so much thank you have any other questions on that particular item I'll move for approval all second this is Danielle thank you Google yes so our next item for consideration is for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars and this is for strategic resource planning this is a discussion action item and I will open it up once again to the board for any questions on this particular item

[00:07:00]
so I know I read the article I we are provided with an article about Blended learning and I read it all and I mean I'm just assuming that APS wasn't part of any of these of any of these studies I'm just making that a I'm just making that assumption that they are that they are were not part of it and I know it included studies from Europe and from Asia and Africa so I know that a lot of the studies that they that went into this medicine from other countries and so I was just assuming that APS wasn't one of them correct so you brought this out to us for for a reason so my question would

[00:08:00]
if you are referencing that analysis what does that have to do with you know with APS and how can we say that Blended learning is really doing a lot as it concerns improves student outcomes thank you for your question about which item we are on so we should are we on are you referring to item are 157 I think the agenda might have been reading so that I don't know what was item are which is your the questions that you have you okay let's check this is for district so Q is District special to the lab equipment and student teacher devices so that's what you're saying cuz on mine does yours

[00:09:00]
okay so I have the I don't have that one so I think it's a specialty yes item Q so then that's what happened I just went by my digital stuff how do we do that because we approved the other items we approved queue on the consent agenda we have to change our and then are we able to go back to queue since we've already voted on it on

[00:10:00]
I think we got it on the approved it right that's right but we did not pull it off already and then we will make an amendment for item cute I'll make a motion that we approve consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for strategic resource planning okay email address Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes yes yes yes yes so I moved to remove item queue approval of District purchases

[00:11:00]
Senator that equals or exceeds 250,000 District specialty lab equipment and student teacher devices from the consent agenda do we have a second if I have a roll call please okay so now I have a discussion for consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 200,000 dollars this is for district specialty lab equipment and student teacher devices this is discussion action and I will pass it back over to board member Miller at home for her questions well I already kind of asked it so or asked one of them do we need a recap or we know we were scrambling on that item so this order or request is to purchase Chromebooks

[00:12:00]
can iPads for students devices for our teachers and our EA's and then also to fund and Elementary School specialty Labs on so those are the purchases with the metadata that is shown it is a new this is a new era in education and there are not a lot of cities so that was about one of the one of the questions was is where is the data this is one of the areas where I found data on Blended learning on having devices one of our goals in educational technology is not only to have a device but also to be able to use that device in a respectful learning digital digital citizenship everybody has a device with them everybody can Google anything nowadays but how does the kid tell if that

[00:13:00]
is a true fact or a false fact so using that inside of a classroom inside teachers teaching kids how to use a device or the internet respectfully and intentionally so they can learn that is one of the reasons why we feel that we need to refresh and replace any devices that have been damaged or aged out and this is something that will be a purchase that will be needed every year if we continue with our one-to-one great and and I have no complaints whatsoever because we have to use technology you know that already that's how I feel but I read the study and so of course it did kind of concerned me a little bit and just I know that one of the things that was said that you just have to click so students know how to how to click and where to clicks so child can find the answer to almost

[00:14:00]
any question so are we really then teaching them how to think critically just because they can find the knowledge can they do that on their own you know or yes you know they can click but in as a child if you don't have a teacher to teach you is this you know how do you verify your facts it could be the same as if a kid was reading the National Enquirer compared to the post you know what where is that in between where is the where is that critical thinking of I know that this is not true or yes I do realize that these are verified facts so that's one of the things about integrating technology into the classrooms that we can teach those skills we can teach kids to use a technology in a meaningful way not just not just click here and here and then get the answer

[00:15:00]
add to that so I will say it is not the case that our teachers are just pointing kids to the internet and telling them to click here for the answer this purchase is for those the specialty labs in the and makerspaces in the Elementary grades which is a good thing so that the kids can get hands-on experience and it's all Guided by teachers show Marie was actually was saying and I wish we had this little video where we've gone out into the schools and and the edtech department has taught teachers how to help teach their kids how to use this type of equipment and she was just saying oh I wish I could show it to them but it wasn't part we didn't you know trying to be respectful of the time of all of this we didn't have a presentation on it okay love to be able to make that presentation showing you how our teachers actually use these right and so I mean

[00:16:00]
when you know I read through it and it said the performance of children it varied across across subjects so of course in kindergarten as a kindergarten teacher I'd be like not good not good for them when it came to to reading there was just a weak positive effect when it came to reading and we probably saw that during the pandemic right that that was just not the way to teach reading if it I think the hot the effect was largest with the Blended learning when it was used in computer classes which made sense and then it went down that one was a 1.0 g equals 1.09 and then the language and language courses you know went down and then in physics and then there was no really effects significant effect in biology and science classrooms so I thought that was an interesting thing that they said because I would think it kind of Might it would think I would

[00:17:00]
I think so but it didn't so I just wanted to just kind of just coming from being an elementary teacher that if this is the way we're going to go there has to be according to even this study a lot more research about the right way to do it because we are definitely not not there yet at all so I know that they said we encourage researchers to conduct more high-quality large-scale research with a focus on different factors when it comes to creating a blended learning design so I just I don't know who is there yet I don't know if aps's is there yet or not but I just want to point out that I think there's a lot more work to do and we need to look at you know grade levels and subjects when we come to if that it would ever go that direction it's not a direction that I would really want to go with the

[00:18:00]
our youngest you know our youngest children for sure so thank you do we have any other further discussion or questions just one clarification is this primarily maintaining and replacing equipment that we already have rather than opening up new things new programs it's a blend the majority of it is replacing devices that are already in place the only ones that are new are for the makerspaces and Simmons Elementary and most critical use with older people

[00:19:00]
thank you do I have a second a second thank you Miss king of Bible call Place Peggy Miller yes yes yes yes yes we're still talking yes thank you so our next item for discussion will be an update on the districts investment program for the second quarter of FYI here so if I can get a motion to approve our agenda items a through T excluding you with the exclusion of q and a second thank you now

[00:20:00]
item for discussion is an update on the district's investment program for the second quarter of FY 2023 this is a discussion item and I will turn it over to Mr Turnbull from accounting and you have the floor sir thank you madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder this is a quarterly investment report for the period of October 1st 2022 31st 2022 as you page to the reports continued by the Federal Reserve summary overview provides a breakdown of 42% on deposit at the

[00:21:00]
35 percent in treasury in 23% and local in the local investment pool the strategy overview shows the current Park total for the quarter at 493 million compared to 5506 million in the previous quarter of money market funds are at 202 million compared to $199 Million last quarter funds held with the local New Mexico 1775 as compared to 190 Million last quarter but reinvestments of 15 million was done at the beginning of January 2023 so right back up to 299

[00:22:00]
92.3 million as compared to 1.1 Million last quarter the rest of the report covers the compliance information and specific details on Holdings and now stand for questions thank you Mr Turnbull I'll go ahead and open it up to the board for any questions or discussion on this particular item okay if we have no further discussion thank you there you go straight to the point awesome so our next item for discussion will be Item B which is update on the fiscal year 2023 budget pre-planning for fiscal year 2024 and Es are fun update this is a discussion item and we have missed Rosalinda Montoya are executive director of budget and strategic planning you have the floor good evening

[00:23:00]
update to our FY 24 budget planning process as well as the Esser update in this presentation I'm like I'm not sure if it's running or not we have a copy of her okay so in this presentation I'm going to go over the year round process and where we are in that process the FY 2500 and then the other update next next so here is our annual process see you around on our calendar in an even year the 30-day session would end now in February and we would know a lot more about the bills

[00:24:00]
past in order to present on this presentation but as you know this year we are in a 60-day session and that will not end until March 18th next so as far as their budget planning process and timeline we are right in the middle of it all and but first I wanted to let you guys know that I am three other individuals of my stuff have completed the genomics coursework to receive the certificate in education Finance from Georgetown University School of Public Policy so that and then looking into an implementation partner we have had a couple of meetings with Ernest and are hopeful that they will be a good partner for us to transition to student based budgeting and

[00:25:00]
as far as the budget stuff we have been preparing our flight 2400 call templates which will be sent out to principal's this Friday and we will have our budget call workshop for principal's next week as well as office hours were any questions they have me be asked and the things that we have incorporated into this budget call template of course are just a few things that we know and they are celery related so we have made those changes in that template so that it will show the proper adjustments and then of course as anything from the legislative session that comes that may also need additional adjustments we will do that as needed and one of the things that I did want to let you know is that we will be reminding principles of

[00:26:00]
that you have set forth and will communicate that to the principles to be mindful of those goals when reviewing their budget we continue in our preparation of our department budget call templates and those will be sent out to departments on March 13th and we also attended the New Mexico and we're all districts in New Mexico participate and this is a great place for us to network and discuss the legislative items that we believe have great momentum to pass and what issues me they make Etc so it's a good networking event next I just wanted to put this slide in here just to as a reminder of the different fun types that we have here at 8 PS and

[00:27:00]
usually when I give my budget presentation update it is in reference to the operational funds and today I will be giving an update on our largest Grant fund currently which is Esser and next we have had three different funds awarded to APS today and I will give a brief overview of each of those so an escrow is the coronavirus Aid relief and Economic Security Act and the scope of this was primarily safe and secure continuation of virtual education services and continuity of education for all students and staff in a safe environment and the focus of the spending was PPE masks Sanitation

[00:28:00]
Technology support and laptops in this first award APS was awarded 25 million 981,991 and that was an fy20 and those funds expired in 9:30 2022 so those are already spent we spent $25,877 448 and 42 cents of that allocation then we moved on to sr200 virus responsibility supplemental Appropriations Act and the scope for this was the plan of safe return to in-person education to pre-pandemic educational processes and the focus for this was preparing schools for reopening upgrading air quality in school buildings

[00:29:00]
preparations taken for reopening PPE and of course testing for covid-19 and APS was awarded this in fy21 and that amount was $110,278 817 which was four times of the first issue and we are still in the process of closing out this one as the funds are due to expire 93023 so we're still spending out a lot of these funds concurrently with the newest and biggest funds that were given to us which were asleep at elementary and secondary schools emergency relief fund and for this the scope was addressing educational recovery and pandemic long-term negative effects

[00:30:00]
the focus was learning to address learning loss social emotional and Mental Health Services technology related to pandemic facility projects due to pandemic and safe operations of schools and APS for this third award was awarded it was awarded in FY 22 and it was for $230,326.78 and these funds are due to expire 93024 so one thing that I wanted to address is that each level of these funding of the funding has been more stringent than the prior one which has required us to really be cautious that all requirements are met before moving forward in order to achieve this we tried to get pre-approval from ped and we want

[00:31:00]
make sure that down the road when we bill for these purchases that we've made sure that they will be approved as we cannot afford to pay for any disallowed purchases through operational we also have had time a time of regrouping with becoming fully aware of all the items in this application as we have have heavy turnover of stuff about 75% of the staff that initially started this implementation or no longer here so we have made it a priority to become knowledgeable of everything that was in that application to keep everything moving and on track and one of the other box is that we've had had to navigate is one that districts are dealing with Nationwide and that's supply chain issues labor issues ETC

[00:32:00]
all districts are following similar requirements on their funding and this has been guiding us to use our funds similarly and so we are all vying for similar services and so this became very apparent to us in our training from a genomics when we were able to see firsthand all the issues arising for all districts they further warned us to be careful when moving forward on our spending to avoid spending on recurring costs with these non-recurring funds so we have been very mindful of this of this or Cliff that is going to be affecting us when building our FY 2025 budget next and then the numbers so we have I have

[00:33:00]
laid out kind of the way we are tracking it we have a dashboard internally that we track each of these areas and the buckets are in that First Column it's we have called them unfinished learning social emotional and mental health technology initiatives facility projects safe operations of schools and other allocations and at the very top of the second column you'll see that 230 million dollar amount that I had mentioned and then each amount that is dedicated to each of the following buckets in that third column where it says expensive those are actually here today expenses that has already hit and that's how much we have spent the fourth column is the encumbered column that is items that have already have a purchase requisition in place

[00:34:00]
we're ready to be spent upon so that leaves us with our remaining budget in the green column and so that's what we have remaining to spend before they expire in 930 of 24 and then the first percentage column is kind of for each little bucket what percentage has been spent to date and then the second one is the percentage of spent plus and covered today and so some of these are moving along nicely and a lot of them even though they may look a little bit like they aren't moving quite as quickly as we would like some of these like the technology initiatives some of the items have come before each day that to spend out their prioritize so then they'll get ramped up

[00:35:00]
moving on their orphans but I think with that I don't care if I could just add one more detail some of these items are actually going through the procurement process and as you know that could take some additional time so you will be seeing some of the additional items because they are large and they have to go through the procurement you will be seeing him to the border for approval thank you can I just ask a clarifying question mark you know which categories will expect to see those the one that I comes to mind is operation of schools and we are looking to purchasing a device that Dr Blakey has been really involved in and helping with the schools at the button

[00:36:00]
okay so I know we're going to have lots of questions on this one so what I'm going to do I'm just going to go down and we'll go one by one and ask our questions and open it up for a discussion for each item cuz I know I have several questions myself so are you good for remember Gonzales if I start with you will knock you out because I know you can have the fun ones knock me out so when you presented last year you shared a bit about the progress monitoring committee that had been established to track the progress of the spending and a couple of the takeaways from that progress monitoring committee were that the proposed plans seemed disconnected from cabinet level leadership positions and more aligned to Passion projects not strategy I'm curious if you could share an update on the progress monitoring committee and whether they've been any changes to the budgeted

[00:37:00]
you are correct there was a progress monitoring committee we did re-establish a committee which does include Dr Segunda squirm Virginia Rosalinda myself and we are actually going to ensure that Dr Blakey and are part of it and we have been going through the list of projects to make sure that they do online with the phones are more stringent than the prior the prior had more flexibility and these are more stringent because of the requirements related to the pandemic so we are having to go back with some of these projects to p e d to get there

[00:38:00]
and their recommendations so that has taken a little bit more time and we are working on modifications that might not have fit that model and also modifications for any expenditures that have their reoccurring that could hit the Esser clip so that is where we are in the monitoring committee and so just to clarify this monitoring committee that you described that where you're adding members of the cabinet is this now a different committee or National Committee or repurposed committee and is there still the committee of external folks to provide sort of that external lens on monitoring and some accountability yeah this is the committee she mentioned is kind of a repurpose committee as I mentioned that 75% of the staff had is no longer with us most of that

[00:39:00]
was part of that monitoring committee there was probably five of those individuals that were leading that are not there now we have put this new Committee in place while the legislative session is moving forward because Joseph is Cabela is going to be who kind of get that month original monitoring committee but he's so busy right now right with the legislative session that he hasn't been able to take over that but we still need to keep on moving forward so that's where this other committee that renette has mentioned is has taken control of it for the moment okay and then so just one other related follow-up then given that the about one year ago take away was what I said that things seemed disconnected from strategy and more about passion projects what's your son's of the shift that

[00:40:00]
you should expect from Passion projects towards strategically aligned and and sort of a range of money or a percent of the original budget or whatever is easiest for you to sort of project management I would say due to all the work that the board has been doing and and the goals and the Strategic plan I believe that this definitely gives us more of a gold to work with all of these so if anything was like a passion project we definitely want to make sure it's leaking to student outcomes and to the goals at the board has at the same time aligning it to the ground to ensure that we do get reimbursed for the funds so there's a lot of moving Parts but I think the overall is that it is related to student outcomes and

[00:41:00]
what would a passion project with these funds are and how it would be misaligned with our strategic goals board member Peterson I think that what the Committee Member that made that comment last year was saying was that she wanted to see more cohesion amongst the plans and things for her pulling together and that some of the projects really but perhaps did not align with other projects so it was a I don't remember the word passion project being used but it is but it's appropriate also it just says

[00:42:00]
most need resources and services following the pandemic was the other follow-up sentence there yeah and I was going to ask that question it's been a year and I have to go back and look I do know that we put a hold on some projects because of that concern and it may have been at specific I'm really trying to think of some specific projects I don't have one that's going to come to mine because I need one but I'll continue to think about it okay I appreciate that going back to the idea

[00:43:00]
about do we want those funds to be do we want portability in that or do we really going to be able to Target I need higher needs schools versus letting small amounts of money follow individual students to schools where they may not make such an impact and and so when I think about school-based budgeting is there any correlation with that and what does that look like in terms of how we make decisions about allocation is going to particular Schools Board member Peterson that is a great great question it's definitely something that we have thought about the budget office and speaking to Eros they are just going to read a couple of their experience they have been doing this since 2004 and if worked with over 100 school systems

[00:44:00]
they have been involved with student based budgeting for over 15 years and they have worked with most of the urban school districts nationally such as Boston Cleveland Newark Nashville Indianapolis Baltimore Atlanta so I I really believe that they have tackle this question and unfortunately we're not to that point yet but I think that that question is definitely on your mind and on our mind and I am very excited to find out how that is tackled and some of these huge urban districts because I bet it's come up before so very good question thank you I really appreciate the work I mean I think it is a good way of approaching the budget so it seems like we're learning and I do appreciate that board member Peterson my memory has been jogged there was

[00:45:00]
an example there was a summer curriculum for 4th and 5th graders and it was a space-based curriculum probably really awesome probably really neat but it was very expensive it was something we never be able to replicate it would have been a one-time maybe two times shot and then it would have gone away and so that was a program we pulled back on because it was trying to put programs into place hopefully we can continue a lot of stuff and we don't buy a lot of people we do have a situation we do have people on the payroll of our pilot projects with 8 Hour goes away the Bible 40 at this time so that's an example of something we felt we could fund and in terms of paying people

[00:46:00]
these people showed these demonstrable Gaines doing this work or it didn't work and therefore we're not going to support that anymore and and that's what we will move forward on but like so we had a curriculum didn't do the curriculum try to invest in stuff so we I mean how much HVAC did we buy I mean you guys are arguing about 16 million 32 million you know now and now of course you can't buy the parts right so now all the sudden there's been a big focus on school safety there's going to be some purchases around that that we're going to be able to do and those will last that will continue so that's the difference between the passion idea and the projects were trying to invest in thank you for that I do appreciate it one last question hearing that 75% of the human beings that were involved initially you're gone is do you have any analysis of

[00:47:00]
it may not be appropriate to share I'm just kind of curious when when there's such a large loss of personnel so I remember Peterson I can I think I've been talking about this for a year now I continue to remind you that many of our staff members are leaving some was retirement some was they could go someplace and more money and that was pretty much I was thinking about it that's mostly went somewhere else I guess but I mostly left on the terms it's just they were tired or they could more money and they work this morning so just

[00:48:00]
go to the recurring Costco what percentage do you think have are we spending right now on what could end up becoming a recurring cost yeah we have been evaluating a board member we have been evaluating that we do have plans for the ones that are on there a lot of it is I don't know exactly like the percentage it would sound like a small percentage but it's still a significant when we think of bringing it back to operational I believe that last count we have like 80 or 90 that will definitely be moving back over to operational funds and why that concerns me because you said that would be different difficult to do once this money is gone to get that out of operational so if you're talking

[00:49:00]
that is considerable yes it is significant but we have planned for this we had a plan where it was like fully the first year was like we're kind of waning ourselves off of it and actually this year I believe will be able to have already taken them into operational funds okay and again some of those are ft either going to go away just by dint of the money going away and by continuing to move out of the pandemic so hopeful social services and services those are things we like to maintain as much as possible but there's some some other positions that just and it's not sleep position so that's still affects it's still going to affect people that like remember Peterson alluded to is that it will affect people's

[00:50:00]
have a job right or get paid less because the money is gone so it's something you think about could have because it does affect somebody's it affect somebody's life and we have to kind of always keep that in our mind yes I appreciate that comma cuz we in the budget office are always thinking about this with any Grant however small or large because whenever it's not able to be paid through a grant it comes to operational and so that's the other reason why we're really being mindful of even if it's a good way to spend money that we make sure that it's going to be approved because that's the other end of it right we go to get reimbursed for it and then they say no this is just allowed and still have to cover it so we are always mindful of that so thank you for that because I mean running just using grounds it's like that's always what could end up happening at the end of the ground is somebody doesn't have

[00:51:00]
they're wonderful and they let us do things you know like this pilot but they end so just something to think about so when it came to the the Esser one that expired on 93022 so there was like 90 / 94,000 did that have to just get returned them yes okay okay and then now on the sr33 we have 110 million 278,000 so how much I might have missed it how much do we have left to spend cuz that has to be done by this coming September yes all of those funds have been earmarked they're already going to be yeah okay they're already unless something unusual occurs that they can't get an item or something that that will be fully expended by the time that it expires so I know that you said

[00:52:00]
they're much more stringent requirements which I understand so are you concerned at all that we could lose some of this money on the sr3 just because they're so stringent yes that is one of our concerns and you know because of course with this many funds it has really increased the workload of all departments in finance right cuz there's more purchases requisitions going through for chairman there's more transactions happening in the Grant's office and and we've been doing it with the same amount of FTE so it has been it is difficult and we're going to do our very best to make best use of these funds but we also don't want to just you know spend it cuz we have it we want to make sure that it's intentional and very targeted and is doing what was required of us from this

[00:53:00]
decades and we would get money and they would be like have to spend it by this while I don't need anything of a classroom filled with you know I've been doing this for 25 years or and so it was like but we'll lose it but you want to spend something just to spend it you want to spend it because it's going to affect our children and improve things for them so don't spend just to spend so then kind of my last question maybe I'll kind of wrap it all up when it comes to do you have like a department like spreadsheet that says this department got this much you know this much money this is how much they've spent they haven't spent I know you have you know this here just about where the money's gone but do you have something like that for departments and are there I will probably answer that before I go cuz I could just not have to go on yes we do this this

[00:54:00]
call spreadsheet that I have here is the absolute roll up of everything that we have we have multiple sheets that feed into this data and so each one of those sheets has a list of each item and how much is designated to each one as the grant management team has to set up all those approval processes for each department that spends it because each department you know has different approvals so in that process of setting up each of these we have a list of all those okay now do you think just because I've just been told this that there are some departments that are going to maybe have a really hard time spending part of it because of the requirements but there are other departments who could spend it that are you hoping to give some of that money from one Department to another that can really spend it and then are you thinking it may be a department that needs to know that they're going to get that money because it's going to

[00:55:00]
take a while to get whatever resources they need get the Personnel to do whatever they need to get done so is that yes we are doing this on a weekly basis we are contacting departments and making sure that especially when we see that the spending hasn't come you know started or something where wearing communication with them and asking those exact questions you know you you said you could use this money but maybe now something's changed are you able to give it back and we have had some departments have told us you know I can't I thought I could use to million I can only use one and we've brought it back in and and then seen how we could relocate it without first of all we try to relate it to the same areas that we already had focused so we don't have to change the application but we're open to that too but yes we are doing that on a weekly basis important member article I think one of the big challenge

[00:56:00]
this is the supply chain you know as Rosalinda had mentioned you know there's districts all through the nation kind of vying for the same goods and services so if there is a big problem I'm not getting something I foresee that it's going to be related to the supply chain challenges and I've been told that too it's like we need to do something now because of exactly that exactly that reason so you need to make sure that we are doing that so that we don't face those supply chain issues I think that's really important for us to do and that we are meeting needs because now we're seeing safety as we see like what's happening not just me but other schools that that is just a really big need it just is now that might have switched some in the last couple of years and so I think that that's an easy one I think anyway maybe not so easy for you guys but and I just

[00:57:00]
I want to make sure is that whatever we're doing is just really an alignment with you know meeting our kids needs and really thinking about student outcomes keeping our kids you know safe just doing always doing what's right by by our children and making sure it really is aligned with you know with our with our goals because that's what you know we're here for for the kids so I'm I'm sure that that's what you all are doing and thank you I'm sorry that you don't have enough people helping you thank you thank you thank you board member Jackson yes I will reiterate that sent it to you guys are working so very hard and I actually did write down a question of do you have enough stuff like I said our big so we do have to go through in our process primarily but we also have other

[00:58:00]
Avenues to the procurement that we can utilize State contracts or piggyback off of utilizing contract so cooperatives so those definitely have helped us because we've been able to find those contracts that have already gone through the procurement process and meet all of the requirements of the federal uniform guidance and and that's like having another staff member without having another staff member so that definitely but you didn't answer the question all the Departments yeah how many openings are in your department in mine I have three well and so I think the first thing that I just wanted to do was to Cong

[00:59:00]
delete you and all of everybody who participated in the economics certificate and I'd love to be able to hang on my wall that I went to Georgetown I mean that's where I got a certificate from Georgetown that's fantastic who here sorry to interrupt but who here participated like can raise your hands and Julianne myself and then Jennifer Lucero who is a compliance for us tomorrow I just I want to highlight that because what I Not only was it a lot of work for you to have to go through you did it because you're aligned with what we're trying to do and I want you to I want you to know that we appreciate that when we recognize that because it shows that you're you're working as a partnership and so

[01:00:00]
thank you for thank you for doing that for going through through that process so that was the first thing the second thing and this is actually to board member Peterson this isn't a specific list but it doesn't get specific like superintendent Elder did but their there is a some examples of the quote unquote passion projects that I can read right now if you want to just hear it's on the well it's not in this document it's in the document from last year if it'll take 36 minutes it will okay so it says this is true with my Jean directed at tier 4 support tier 3 support math Discovery Academy summer learning tutoring fundations computer science class stem professional development for new and novice teachers summer vibrant school conference 8 hour work day pilot and teacher loan repayment so that was just kind of the sentence that came after

[01:01:00]
the the passion that they are not intentionally targeted to those students or schools that most need the resources and services so what they may be but there needs to be justification for how they are just wanted to kind of follow up on that with with the question and then back to you guys so I noticed I did a quick calculation of the percentage of the artist spending and I got 40% unfinished learning 3% for social emotional mental health 9% for technology 12% for facility 22% for safe operations and 14 percent for other applications and so my first question is how did we arrive at that breakdown of allocations look more targeted why only 40% for unfinished learning why not more

[01:02:00]
Amber Jackson initially there was a requirement to spend a certain percentage on it and it was I believe 20% so we aim to get over 30 so the fact that we're at 40 is is pretty good the reality is a lot of the program that we had when we walked into this we got really excited because we had visions of really pumping up our Counseling Services being able to bring in lots of tutors partnering with with corporations it turned out the first off New Mexico doesn't have the infrastructure for a lot of that we pretty much hired everybody we could hire and that's it you know and we were done so now we're looking at like paper for example trying to bring in a national hospital but we're still over the percentage that we were required to spend I think what you're going to see when they you asked the question earlier

[01:03:00]
before they dip into their plans for sr3 so you looked at sr3 there you see it's a 0 but it's just because they're not finished yesterday too and then we'll give you what you got lined up for you and S3 so that number is going to change I think you'll see numbers changing facilities as a specifically around the concept of student safety of operations of schools because we've been pushed in that direction and so like I said the only number that was defined was that initial need to put a certain percentage into student learning and we'll try to continue to exceed because that's obviously the most important area okay so what you're saying is the percentage they will change okay so the budget

[01:04:00]
do you this be a philosophical question for you but in that document from last year there was a recommendation that the fund be redesigned as a comprehensive plan aligned to priorities and goals do you think that a year later you guys have done that and or are on track to realign this funding so that is directly affects and the you know the learning loss that the grant requirements board member Jackson I would have to say that that's our goal for all our funding you know

[01:05:00]
that's our goal to align it to the goals in the guard rails and student outcomes so I would say all of our funding should have that goal in mind unfortunately some of this was done you know prior to us being in this role Dr Segura is very involved in in this reallocation reset and she definitely has that in mind so I would say that it doesn't matter what it is we should always have that in mind going to that end up thank you and we've been spending the money for a while now so moving forward yes I think we'll try but like I said some of the limitations specific around literacy and math and student engagement a lot of that's going to

[01:06:00]
programming professional development on people I think PD is something we should be invested in I have no issue invested in and support for our staff and again including our principles and our teachers and I'd love to do more with City centers to have quite frankly around this ability to build a plan and to talk across departments departments and this concept of interoperability where we sort of work together and it's more seamless but again just reminded some of this money quite a bit of this money was spent prior to the goals thank you and my last question is actually not a question it's probably more of a suggestion so last year again there was a progress monitoring committee that involved community members and I would suggest strongly that community members be involved again in the

[01:07:00]
it helps with transparency it helps with accountability and you know we we want to make sure that our community knows how we're spending this obscene amount of money and so I think if we can have more Community involvement whenever possible I would just have that suggestion to kind of bring some numbers on to that committee for you thank you board member Dominguez so lots of good questions tonight and so I won't ask around repurposing committee people and where the 75% went but your point about Community participation sparked an idea is there any chance that I mean we have a community a parent right on the

[01:08:00]
finance committee or is it the audit and so mean is that someone who we can tap because she's engaged in numbers already right just an idea I mean it's because it's hard to find people from the community and I believe it's been something that has been discussed from

[01:09:00]
keenly aware that these funds are going to be they would be finite and that you were meeting deadlines so would you say has have you all always been mindful about not relying on or creating positions that we would not recurring costs I would have to say yes because like you said from the beginning we knew it was only a certain amount period and we have been discussing this and different like budget committee and cabinet so it is definitely something that you can't wait to the Future you have

[01:10:00]
to start thinking about it like yesterday so we have been mindful to it and I'm trying to come up with a you know a strategy a plan so when we do get to the end of it we don't hit that Cliff as it could be but being very mindful of it okay and that was my memory but it also struck me that the seems to be a culture in your area in budgeting because you deal with grants and those are all so they're not recurring so there is it strikes me that APS has had a finance department has had that culture of thinking already established and I trust me

[01:11:00]
Finance people think that way so I appreciate all that you do all that you're doing and yes congratulations on your economics continuing ed that's it thank you so okay my question is going to be around the sr3 funds and I guess specific around the safe operation of schools I know we said that there's going to be a percentage allocated for the pilot program I think we're starting at West Mesa for that button but what are do we have any idea of what the additional funds can be spent on because I know now it seems like the focus has been intensified for you know what's happening with gun violence District wide so how what is what are our plans to address that sooner versus later or remember top a little hesitant to jump in because I think we talked about this there's some

[01:12:00]
you're looking at that I don't want to get I don't want to make any promises because you know we're not at RFP we're not doing things but I'll give you an example there is a technology around the concept of weapon detection that isn't allowable expense based on the increase in violence Across the Nation and so we're actually going to have a demo here I think in the next few weeks that people can go and look and see what it looks like but it's you know it's a technology that's being used at places like Disney World and so because we Face real issues in terms of access and how many systems you can have at a particular school because I need to texting system is only working if somebody's there to monitor it and of course our schools have tons of entrances and you just can't have them at every entrance just can't so that's an example of something we're looking at and moving on pretty quickly we'll probably also looking

[01:13:00]
long-term plans as far as continuing this upgrade and and update of all our systems which is really very valuable so those are some examples I think they're probably I can talk about where I get any vendors excited when you say update of systems well I can talk about tonight you know okay updating all your computers one of the biggest don't get too excited I'm not doing anything but but that's an example of something that that we are looking at okay and and I think it goes without saying but I would just hope that we would have a greater emphasis on that to give some type of response and support to our students based on the feedback that we've been receiving almost at every board meeting email phone calls that we are getting you know I never want us to be at the point where we just say thank you

[01:14:00]
and it just seems like for them it falls on deaf ears that they actually can see the changes that we're making you know and I'm happy to see that we looks like we have funds to support it and so that doesn't seem to be an issue but I just want to I don't want to wait till 24 to spend those funds know we're not waiting like I said there's a demo coming up in the next couple of weeks I actually had an opportunity to see the system in operation last week and it helped me to understand exactly what it looked like cuz I kept describing it to me and it was strange but I understand it now and it is kind of cool it won't solve all the problems but it will help and there is no Silver Bullet there is no solution in it again I remind everyone this is not what you're describing specifically is not a school problem we're a component of the greater solution there's a bigger solution to this issue and it's a city state national issue and we're more than one part and we are right

[01:15:00]
but I guess my concern is to make sure that our district is doing everything within our power to do our part I feel that we are okay I just want our teachers and our students to fill the same cuz I feel like that's tends to be there's a disconnect there between how what we feel is appropriate and what how it's getting passed on to in the classroom and you know directly in our school so my My Hope Is that we bridge that Gap and that we help support them even greater than what they feel currently right now so my other question moving on from that can you just give me an example of what other allocations what categories would be under their Charter allocations are some of those and then the indirect costs there's some other we have some other updates but I'm trying to think

[01:16:00]
there's so many of them and remember what exactly in that bucket other than the charter allocations that's most of it okay thank you this was helpful this help and I think and I would ask that we probably make this something that we do talk about at least every other month you know so we can make sure we have some current and consistent updates so we're following through with it because it is a large amount and we want to just make sure that our community knows that we're spending it correctly but hats off to you all you guys know what I think of your team and mess up with a you know what you're bringing to the table and I have the utmost respect for what you guys are doing so I want to thank you personally you guys have seemed to and I feel like I say it over again like I'm a broken record but you have made it easy for us to I guess evolved with the new you know structure with student outcomes and I

[01:17:00]
in my opinion I felt like you were one Department that jumped on it first you know to make it to start making those changes so I commend you and your team for you know for doing that and keeping that at the Forefront of every decision that you're making and it's appreciated so thank you do we have any other board member Gonzalez I did have one follow up just going back to the budget cycle overall and you describe some of the changes that you're making in terms of your the call and the template and sharing the goals with principles which I really appreciate and so my question was how might the budget documents what we see look different this year based on these changes and sort of along with that what can we do when to help make it easier for you cuz I know sort of it was a little bit Rocky last year we definitely are going to work on our communication to the board and be able to present the numbers in a way that supports

[01:18:00]
Kohl's and also takes into account the guard rails so when we get our data and we're able to put our data together we want to be able to present it in a way to communicate to all of you in the way that you would like to see it because you're correct you know we kind of followed the way we've always done it maybe and and this is new this is new this is a new government data so we are going to work on when we get it to be able to massage it and put it in a way that is Meaningful to the board and if there is anything else from us that would be helpful would be great if you can share that thank you thank you okay moving on

[01:19:00]
so our next finance committee meeting will be held on Wednesday March 29th 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Milton Community Board Room of the Alice and Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Northeast or virtually at www.aps.edu so this meeting will be adjourned and it will now be followed by a special Board of Education meeting thank you okay so we're going to need to transition period here if you want to take a break down and his people need to come in and they all need to delete it was so cold outside

[01:27:00]
remember the room is Life okay I would like to call this meeting to order welcome to the Board of Education special board meeting so I would like to have Miss King do wrong call please Gonzales

[01:28:00]
so our first item for consideration and action is adoption of the February 22nd 2023 special Board of Education meeting I moved to approve the February 22nd 2023 special Board of Education meeting us yes Tony Jackson's approval of the consent calendar items if I could have a motion please I moved to approve the calendar items this is Crystal I will second okay please Daniel

[01:29:00]
yes yes and our next item for consideration and action is consideration for approval of the nomination for the New Mexico School Board Association 2023 excellence and student Achievement Award and Dr Albright you have the floor you vice president to celebrate a person or a group that have played an important role in improving student achievement this year the board members were asked to send nominations to the board Services office and we received two they were email to you on Friday and they're also in front of you on your on the dance the nominations are also welcome from the floor tonight I need you to

[01:30:00]
decide who should receive this award with that I stand for questions okay are there any any questions so we have the know individuals and so we have the community school coordinators and the APS school board and District so does anybody have any input or if you could let me know what you what you think I think if we go down the line that might just that might help okay because I think they are both worthy nomination so let me let me listen to the rest okay remember Jackson I would go with community school coordinator simply because I just don't feel comfortable nominating myself awkward saying the school board but I know we are kicking butt at the same time and really you know trying to leave the ship in a new

[01:31:00]
Community School coordinators are fabulous and what they do and their dedication you know to the schools and actually seemed to outcomes that they're providing so I believe I would go with Community School coordinators okay remember Peterson absolutely Community School coordination coordinators I think there are other more appropriate formats for recognizing the board this is the School Board Association nominations and they do recognize School Board in particular for particular achievements I think it is much more appropriate for us as a body to recognize other other out there in the community and dinner

[01:32:00]
so I agree with Community School coordinators I think that would be great and I would support that I was going to recommend that we did the selfless senior again and just pick randomly but I didn't submit that cuz I assume somebody else would so I just put that on the table as another option but I do like the idea of Community School coordinators yes the selfish singers are coming that's a different New Mexico School boards Association award that's their scholarship award and that's coming in a few months and I do believe that we had a recipient last year so they do it and they make you skip a year if you were awarded a scholarship the previous year so I believe we are not eligible for for student scholarship this year absolutely right sorry

[01:33:00]
in addition students are not eligible for this award their specifically we are specifically asked not to nominate students for this award okay no no no no no no no that's not true you got it ok Google

[01:34:00]
okay so then I just need a motion to it seems like to accept the community school coordinators to nominate them can I ask a question clarifying question real quick yes so would we just be getting one award then for the community school coordinators and they can be in Brian Garcia's office who coordinates the coordinators let me check I believe what they do is nmsba will provide one actual award that we can pay for additional ones so that's something we can we can decide whether I've lost track of

[01:35:00]
coordinators and how much it would cost for each one for us each additionally $50 and I believe there are somewhere around

[01:36:00]
wonderful so miss King can never roll call please Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes still tapioca Romero yes in a Dominguez yes Brittany Jackson yes yes yes thank you for coordinators thank you for all you do okay so we're on to our next agenda item so our next agenda item is consideration for approval to convene an executive session pursuant to nmsa 1978 10 - 15 dash 1 855 for the purpose of discussing bargaining strategy to collective bargaining negotiations between APS and bargaining units representing APS employees if I could have a motion that we

[01:37:00]
approve consideration for approval to convene an executive session pursuant to nmsa 1978 10 dash 15185 for the purpose of discussing bargaining strategy to collective bargaining negotiations between APS and bargaining units representing APS employees my second okay miss me I have a roll call vote please Danielle Gonzales yes yes yes yes okay so everybody's
