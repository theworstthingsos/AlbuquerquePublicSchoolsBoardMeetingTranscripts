[00:18:00]
I think our specialty something that I'm proud of because it's really a focus that is started by producer Sarah Gustavus which focuses on a couple things one is Partnerships so bringing in people like lower paskus to do as far as I know the only television series around environmental issues in the state to Antonio Gonzalez who's the host of national native news on colonic broadcasting to do not only the reconnecting to healthy lifestyle series that was mentioned in there but also the state of change stories as well another focus of ours is to really tell stories and underserved communities through the voice of those people in the communities but it's also about not just pointing out the problems we have far too much of that so we really want to focus on not only what's going that needs to be addressed but people that are using Innovation and new strategies to address that so one

[00:19:00]
my favorite examples out of these was a story we did for the reconnecting to a healthy lifestyle that was out at what's the name of the farm there near Flagstaff do you guys remember putting on the spot Loop farm and what movie The Farm but there is a renovated school bus that is a water filtration system that goes out into the Navajo reservation filters and cleans the water and it's also an educational component or the students learn about the process of that so that's the kind of innovation and solutions type of Journalism that were really trying to do and so you can see most everybody on that list is here there are a couple who are actually still at work taking care of us some other things and there's a bunch of other people that support us and lots of different ways that couldn't be here tonight but it's a team effort and we're so thankful for the support of APS and and the recognition tonight so thank you very much

[00:20:00]
I think the beauty of this is that it all comes down to education you are all Educators and thank you for everything that you do for the community so let's show our appreciation for these

[00:21:00]

[00:23:00]
so are one sign in speaker is Alexis Taylor I'm here on behalf of my son's name I had to remove my son from the classroom on December 11th 2017 when he came home with the large bruise on his left here my husband and I immediately contacted his bus drivers and his classroom so far I've received two conflicting reports from the administration one stating that starts left early that day

[00:24:00]
and another stating that he was never there at all the assistant teachers in the room informed me that Reese did not have an injury that they were aware of we took Reese back to the school and continue to be shocked by them stating that they did not see and we're not aware of any injury happening in their words he never even cried they even suggested that he came to school with this bruise that they supposedly never noticed speaking with the vice principal she took us to the nurse's office to complete an incident report since one was never started my husband contacted APD to make a report as we know the injury had happened while he was at school the vice principal told us to go home and they would inform us of the findings of their investigation once we were contacted by APD and made a report of the incident later that night we were contacted by detective with the crimes against children unit the detective called CYFD and a member of APD CSI to come to her home a full investigation was launched by C

[00:25:00]
do you have to be an APD we are also asked to go to a UNM child abuse Response Team exam the detective had set up for us at the exam Reese was fully examined the findings came with the decision that the bruise appeared to be from an adult pinching races here the doctor told us not to allow race to return to the school she made it very clear that her recommendation was to keep him out of the environment where the abuse happened detective Candelaria called and told us to keep him out of school until the investigation was complete the investigator wasd also told us to remove him from the school and then secondary placement called APS requesting the secondary placement she was told we had to make that request herself and they needed more information I spoke with Allison Owen multiple times and she said she would start on moving him however she would have to

[00:26:00]
get approval from her director after speaking with her director she told her she can no longer deal with us her director Bernadette Lucero Turner said Allison was to tell us to call Bernadette and Chaparral we spoke with Cheryl wise the new vice principal of chaparral multiple times starting in January she was completely unaware of the situation and informed us there was no incident report after quite a bit of back and forth she also agreed to give my son a secondary placement unfortunately Bernadette once again said we couldn't move him and he needed to have a meeting to discuss this further we tried to attend this meeting but when we showed up that day Cheryl wise was not on campus and the office had no knowledge of that meeting she apologized and said she had forgotten to call us to cancel we later found out that the director was at school however she went to a conference room and didn't inform any stuff that she was on campus for a list of all APS Personnel who were in contact with three on that day we were told because of the ongoing investigation

[00:27:00]
request had to go through apses lawyers and HR department to this day we still haven't received that information throughout this ordeal we were repeatedly informed faculty that we are following recommendations of APD CYFD and unm's cart Department The Faculty told us that since there was no proof that it happened there there was no need for a secondary placement even asking for temporary placement until the investigation was complete has been denied we were informed by Bernadette that she needed a copy of my son's heart exam which is a direct violation of HIPAA and a copy of the detectives report which isn't even available to us since it's still an open investigation however at this point we no longer have any faith in her actually helping her son because of all of this has gotten no therapy since December 2017

[00:28:00]
has been freeze to be given a secondary placement so he can continue receiving the education and therapy he needs in a safe environment do to all of this is no expired and we don't feel like you like we will ever be able to get him to help that he needs if it helps we brought pictures of the injury as well as a copy of Alexa OK Google OK Google

[00:29:00]
president Piercy board members community members and staff the majority of schools started Monday including our newest School Tres volcanes Community collaborative school for 600 students were excited to start the year using a blended learning techniques and focusing on technology throughout the district 84000 the district's 84000 students 142 schools and over 6,000 teachers we all focused on getting to know one another and begin learning together the enthusiasm across the district was absolutely contagious and the fact is that it was probably one of the smallest starts that we have had in a very very long time and all that preparation and hard work by the staffs and the schools and the Departments that offer

[00:30:00]
support really paid off and I thank them for the for the bottom of my heart I'm also thankful for all the people who have donated school supplies helping to provide tools students need to learn one tradition of gathering supplies specifically comes to mind the corporate volunteer Council of New Mexico made up of many organizations across the city filled a city bus with school supplies that will help thousands of our students this school year it is one illustration of how the community steps up to help students succeed with a nationwide teacher shortage we've done some creative things to fill teaching positions this year we have left no Rock unturned in addition to working with colleges and universities holding job fairs and recruiting across the country we have also recruited from other countries we've hired

[00:31:00]
33 teachers from the Philippines and more teachers coming will be coming in January and we've also hired six Spanish teachers from Spain to help alleviate that shortage we're still looking for about $125 regular education teachers and 160 special education teachers substitutes currently are filling these vacancies together with the help of the community and our education Partners we will continue to work to provide learning opportunities for all of our students and find the best teachers for the children that concludes superintendents report thank you thank you go on to Facebook a is the consideration replication of the negotiated agreement between the Board of Education School District number 12379

[00:32:00]
good evening board superintendent Reedy board president Dr piercing members of the board the district and Carla Montano president and Yvonne Rodriguez would like to request ratification of the tentative agreement for the secretary clerical Association tomorrow how many years so we're still at it and I just want to thank you all for having us tonight hope

[00:33:00]
call having a great evening it's a pleasure to stand up here and thank Karen rudess Works wonderful with us and I want to tell you a little bit about our negotiations we got 3.5 for the unit which there are 434 in there that we represent we also got a special level level level four that way they are somewhere else to go other than level three they're very hard-working I want to acknowledge all of them they're the first face you see when you walk in the school they work hard and they're very skilled people we did clean up in language yes so anyhow thank you for having us if you have any questions

[00:34:00]
434 are dues pain members one of the things that I saw is that you get your secretary's in clerical get credit for working outside of APs so does that place them on the salary schedule based on their outside work outside of APs yes board member Peggy Miller without experience directly related they will

[00:35:00]
move on the steps on the longevity in regards to their placement on the salary schedule EDC in the HR department sends out its own form and it has to come from the prior employer and it is sometimes really difficult to get those back if their archives have been purged so we do our best sometimes we need to even get W-2s from past employers but it's pretty standard in the fields so we get those for all the all employee groups actually right and then one of the things I was looking at and it didn't kind of go into detail is when there's a reduction in force you say that you negotiate the procedures for that so what what is that process we have unfortunately had to do that several times in the last 10 years and so it's clarified we've been through it but first we have

[00:36:00]
look at seniority in all of that employee group and then we meet with everybody who's lease senior and 6 years ago we did it we got all of them in a room and we of course froze hiring for those positions and then we tried to place them another positions and at the end of the day we didn't cut as many some chose to retire but we do have an outline process for that okay and then I was looking at the definition of like family so in the for the bereavement leave it includes you know many people you know to answer uncles and grandparents Etc but then when it came to caring for you know if you have a family member that's ill then that's limited to you know children spouse Etc so why is that different than it is for the teacher because I saw that it's different for the teachers we are just in the process of outlining

[00:37:00]
clarifying all of the leaves language so we've sat down with lawyers in the the unions to do that but we are following FMLA guidelines for that specifically care of a family member so that's why it's different in this contract but we are in the process of aligning everything at this moment so that will be cleared up okay and then one of the things that you have on the revised language under the memorandum of understanding is that an orientation tax force will be put into place so has that that is going to be starting this year then yes for rather excited about that because one of the wonderful secretaries we just recognized is now working with us to support that and we're collaborating on what secretaries need when their new hires to the district were working with Finance on that they did have a big training at the beginning of this year but we're trying to incorporate some other aspects of their job of their job into that

[00:38:00]
orientation okay and then I know there was a stipend for bilingual which I personally don't think is a whole lot I mean it says that you shall have a stipend 50 cents more an hour pay twice a year so how does that work I was just confused about what that meant exactly based on how many hours twice a year that was increased last year and it works because if they're moving around and if they discontinue those Services we pay it twice a year so it's added to their base salary rate okay but that is something that we can negotiate okay so then is part of their pace so it will be part of their I mean it will be all part of that though it's not separated the first space that are

[00:39:00]
you guys know everything that's going on at the schools I think that you are a wonderful I personally think that you are terribly underpaid in my opinion I'm sorry for that because if you have a wonderful secretary the climate is wonderful just because because because because of the people that are up at the front so I just want to thank you for that and as a teacher I just always helped you all to the highest regard so thank you you're welcome and so anyhow thank you so much for for that compliment we appreciate it

[00:40:00]
something and moving in the right direction so thank you for everything that you all do you're welcome we're still low yes we lost 8 years so even though it's very positive we're still behind and we're hoping for better times and when we talked about and this is true for every employee group when we talked about attracting new people that's one thing but we've got to retain experienced people and if we don't treat people right we can't retain them so thank you for hanging in for all these years you're welcome thank you move on to the consideration

[00:41:00]
when are you supposed to school district number 12 on the education Police Officers Association discussion action and the same folks are here to help us with that word president of the board I would like to present the police Educators Association tentative agreement for ratification tonight and Roy Dennis president of the group couldn't be here however I have the chief of police Steve Gallegos here to answer any questions

[00:42:00]
if you work 120 hours is considered overtime where did that figure come from I couldn't find it in here what was the starting point is there a change with it it was $200 last year it was 200 so we talked about that in various times this year and it's roughly 30 days of comp time and what happens is then they're not there if they have that much comp time accrued and we have such a deficit and we haven't been able to fill police officer positions it's easier just to pay the overtime once they're over 120 but we can change it back to 200 it's really not a big deal for us it's just that then we don't have anybody if they have accrued that much comp time so is a new recruit you come in and you pay maybe two 300 400 dollars for your uniform and I notice that they get

[00:43:00]
reimbursed over 26/26 pay periods and it's only $15 is there any way to do this up front give them maybe half of that for the uniforms board member Paterson we did that in the past we did up front the money to the incoming people however if they didn't stay long enough for us to recoup that money we were out that money so we do it in installments and I wish we could do it a lot easier but again we were losing too much money when they work so they get 15.00 period

[00:44:00]
do you know one of the things that's always in contracts is due process rights and and you know really writing writing out and being specific about what do you process looks like but I'm curious do you have any long-term goals for what kinds of support the officers in our schools needs what what training is either desired or given or if there's anything long range that you see should be in the contract in the future cycle we add to that and that's where that type of training comes in it all depends like right now it's active shooter training security at the schools that sort of the mandated training by by Santa Fe but if there's is

[00:45:00]
long term training that we do whether it be child abuse training update laws that change during the session a lot of his mental health that's a big one that's ongoing for it just goes on and on and on so we continue that training we updated annually and we continue on WE mandate what our officers have as well as Santa Fe and that's why we appreciate you all so much and why the officers that are in the schools do such a good supportive job for students and staff thank you so thank you Google how many police officers are there covers we have 54 officers within our departments in the unit as well alright I don't know that

[00:46:00]
Union people that's through the union so I don't know how many of them Paid Dues okay but I can get that information tomorrow and then I just wanted to say thank you I was reading something and I thought this was it touched my heart it's of the primary purpose of employee evaluation she'll be the Improvement of performance which is what it should be and I appreciate that period I think that's really important the one thing I was looking at the annual leave that you can accrue 10 to 222 days I guess based on the years right is that how you do the first year you have this many and then it just kind of goes up is that how that's done there's two calendars so the CSA is 183 day calendar and that's the 10-day cruel and then you're around the officers work the

[00:47:00]
256 so that's the 22 days and then the sick leave they can accrue up till like 10 days and that's is that for everyone as well or is it based on the number of days you're in your contracts on the number of days hours you work okay and how where did that come from is that just what like APD does and the sheriff's department and 10 days is pretty much a standard 10 to 22 days to weeks for and then the other thing I was looking at the kind of surprised me is when I was looking at degrees like if you have an associate's degree you'll get out of 10 cents to your hourly rate like give me a break a bachelor's degree 50 cents an hour and a master's degree 20 cents and hour

[00:48:00]
I mean you're trying to make yourself better and learn more and more like a school district and that is what we do for people that I mean take care of our kids and take care of us and I so appreciate police officers I think you guys I mean the secretaries have a different job you guys have something else to do that is as important keeping our kids safe and that just that just pains me that you guys are my heroes you know so and I'm sure the union thanks you for that because they do come to the table wanting to push more for degrees and I understand that it's something that I think is positive and we should continue to work forward to do that and that's every year they come up with that and I understand and we're going to work a little while they do like when you come out you have an associate's degree about your degree what is their pay increase for each of those levels of Education it is quite a bit more

[00:49:00]
so she did mention she was running late and I thought she would make it but she hasn't shown up yet so I'll move forward president Dr

[00:50:00]
Percy board members the union and the district would like to request ratification for the tentative agreement with the teachers bargaining unit anything special that you want to bring up here we've worked on a lot of different things this year it was an exceptionally well bargaining team for both both members and we felt really good about that Ellen mentioned several times with finance that this was the best year ever we haven't negotiated raises in a long time but when we did in the past this was probably the best year we ever worked together on it and we collaborated on this new salary Matrix because the old one was outdated it was broken and in the past on board members were concerned with the steps because there were iniquities amongst steps so we have moved forward in correcting those those arrows but it's going to take more changes in the future so we are looking at that we're also considering

[00:51:00]
are there ways to look at pay as far as credentials and how we do stipends and all those things because we do a lot of differentials and statements for little things but perhaps we need to refocus on how we're looking at that and as well as the duty day so we had a lot of really productive conversations around those types of things and otherwise the language is speaks for itself I think if you have any specific questions I can answer them specific questions

[00:52:00]
but

[00:53:00]
how far is are you looking at A4 employees assigned a two or more schools Howard deciding that we've been doing evaluations jointly or one principal can select or the teacher can select so we've sort of let the teacher drive that decision because one can only be entered into the PED website schedule to address the schedule at the high school yes what that's about is currently high school you have to have so many credits to graduate from high school but by the time seniors get to their

[00:54:00]
every year they've already pretty much covered most of their credits so their senior year they're rarely on campus full-time the union would like to make sure that those kids remain on campus more of their day so we're looking at how those credits would be considered I know partial credit has been part of that conversation so we're going to create a task force with a curriculum and instruction and look at those senior schedules and what's happening with them and so so if you have a senior who has only one class how are you going to keep that senior in class if they met all the credits I mean it's a very difficult situation to have more credits isn't the answer so that's going to take a lot of conversations

[00:55:00]
it was left up to like you know interpretation so I mean it just it just kind of it just stuck up for me at that one it's like so if a teacher thinks so and then I wasn't clear on what does it mean by this is a non-binding and this is this list is non-binding and attended for planning purposes

[00:56:00]
it's only so it just means that the list that a teacher identifies students that are potentially failing it's just a list for planning purposes it doesn't mean that they are in detailing or well if the teacher grade something in the after that date of the list they can change it but we did have that language several years ago because the we need to have that for graduation purposes and some teachers were waiting to the 11th hour and then then they didn't they weren't supposed to graduate it yet we thought they were graduating so that language has helped that if hasn't been an issue and then I just I just want to say I love the idea on the memorandum of understanding for the advisory for the task force to structure and the purpose of the advisories for the middle and high schools because I think that's very much needed at that point in terms of I think there's a lot that can be done with advisories if they're really meaningful and there's a lot of Engagement for students

[00:57:00]
about what we're doing with that with that advisory time part of the rationale for to revisit that too is cuz we've had them in place for 7 years or so now but we've realized that high schools are doing it differently from middle schools which makes sense but we want to revisit that topic and and sort of review what we're doing and those are the only comments I had other comments OK Google how many teachers teachers 60s and everybody covered the bargaining unit is 689.99 and 1574 voted I don't have the union pain members right now but I can get those I'll get those to the board tomorrow on for all the bargaining units and then I go to what kind of that was one of the things that I had seen about keeping those seniors there I personally think that when you're trying to keep someone there that work

[00:58:00]
really hard they got everything done quickly I mean if we have kids that can get all their courses done by the time they're you know Juniors I mean we're punishing them by trying to keep them there some high school some kids are not meant to be in high school they just Excel out in the workforce or in colleges and high school is just not for every kid and so I just have a hard time trying to keep somebody there who did everything that they were supposed to do and now we want to tell them what you did everything but we still want to keep you here I just have a really hard time with that I just know too many students that want to get they just want to get out of high school it's a tough time for a lot of kids and if they can do it Karen and I think we should we should reward them give them their diploma and let him go on and that is why we wanted to have a task force because there were differing views and but we're always willing to collaborate and have the difficult conversation around those

[00:59:00]
and then I was looking at the middle school differentials and so it was going to be even if it was a smaller school that they were still going to have it was on page 7 under the new language article 6 that they were going to every middle school was going to receive five differential so it's not going to be based on the size of the school and what was the rationale for that because they still have those positions even in those small schools it doesn't mean we eliminate that position so in all fairness they deserve that differential as well I'm probably not going to find it it was talking about that there was going to change the hours of exactly who it was and I don't have it written I just wrote myself a little note but they weren't going to get a loss of pay but they were going to be working

[01:00:00]
last days and I can't remember who it was who was that was it the diagnosis correct so we don't need them working that many that long until the summer because in the students are gone and and they've been able to do the job I mean it is a busy job but we thought that would be a good way to give them a boost and salary because they are drastically underpaid as a group as well and that was the rationale for changing that we have talked about doing that for several years and we finally thought that this year with the change in the salary schedule that we made and the Rays and the changes that we've sort of made all over it made sense to make that move this year so it wasn't enough schedule Etc

[01:01:00]
play no cost because I think there was like three different task forces right are you asking the test for his cost any is there any cost right okay and then sorry I had a lot of questions I know one of the things I was looking at was when it was talking about an article to and it was talking about professional association for all employees that belong to different Association this applies to the people that are covered in this teaching the contract by the teacher contract it doesn't apply to other employees and other bargaining units but they are treated in similar ways that was my question I know we're just talking about about

[01:02:00]
the teachers in who's covered but I just want to make sure that the same thing held true for for others as well and let's see one of the things I was looking at is I was looking at some of the differentials for like the coaches and then I saw like football I'm not a big football fan no offense to everybody who is but I saw him get paid a whole lot more and then the cheerleading coaches as well and I mean I'm like I just kind of wondered how do you come up with who gets paid more about how many kids are on their team we talked about that a lot this year because we looked at the differentials and we actually changed the

[01:03:00]
how much more time intensive and the season is longer and that's how it evolved however marching band is equally a lot of time and work because they attend those football games and that's why we distinguished made that difference in the contract so that was part of this bigger conversation that we're talking about as well on how do we look at all these differentials long-term and try and create some Equity among these positions based on time and then we also talked about you know what about these teams that make it to you know they keep winning which is more time too and some other districts actually do it based on the size of the teams and if they're winning team like Texas has this down so we're looking like we're looking at different options for that long term as well I think that we need to because the Sports you know if that is important to you as if you're on the football team

[01:04:00]
I just didn't get that I still don't I still don't get it so I just think we need to look at that better because it looks like we're saying something is this is sport is more important because we're paying this coach more exactly and that should never be the case cuz every sport should be as important as the next one so and then I just had a question on about the Federation training workshops and conventions and it said they'll be 40 professional leave days at full pay by the district how much does it cost us will most with this bargaining group nothing because none of them are full-time teachers okay so they do that on their own time and then I was looking it's on page 19 different colors on here and it was talking about

[01:05:00]
about the career pathway system for the three-tier licensure system so they'll be able to move from one job to another another job is that basically without any reduction in their current compensation level so that doesn't matter if they if they were getting paid a lot more being a social worker interpreter or whatever and then they come down to becoming a teacher or not come down because that's not coming down this change positions to become a teacher so then what I just want to understand that so board member Miller Arizona what this was referring to as we've had a lot of teachers that want to become counselors and in the past they had to then start at level one as a counselor if even if they were a level three teacher so that was and we want to retain people in the district and if people want to change in their job and that might bring him some long

[01:06:00]
Liberty and revive them we want to do that so this is going to allow those role groups to keep their salary as they move to the career pathway which was created when the PED started the three tier system it didn't apply to anybody outside of a teacher role group so we created career Pathway to give them away to advance as well that would be similar but we found that that is impeding the process of movement in the district and we're losing people some people are leaving because they can go be a counselor in another District at 40 in where they would have to start at level one at 34,000 so this allows them to move within groups and retain that same salary and it's really at no cost to the district because we'd be paying them either way so this was productive language okay and I just think as long as that was a good thing I have all of them

[01:07:00]
at any moment but she's coming from Santa Fe she's coming from court so last considerably longer than she didn't anticipate so I do apologize but but yeah all right and then the Ellen wanted me to convey is that as part of the negotiating team we felt very strongly that there was a great spirit of collaboration we got ahead of the game and we were able to come up with salaries that was very helpful for employees Tammy Coleman and her team Teresa Scott were instrumental in that and just in general the district was a great in collaborating and coming up with solutions to a lot of the problems that we're talking about today

[01:08:00]
everyone is just when there's a reduction in force that you bring back the not necessarily the best person but you bring back whoever was out last and so I just personally have have trouble with that one and then the other one just for elementary teachers who I think are the most awesome we have to as elementary teachers have to teach like every subject I mean we have to teach everything we had to do that and I know here it's a secondary teachers can't be required to teach more than in three different subject areas but I just want to point out that elementary teachers are you know we do it it's it's it's it's a hard job to be able to be good at teaching everything

[01:09:00]
across the country is when you have leave to take care of a sick relative and that mostly teachers will get to basically take care of I'm just wondering how that would how that would work like having their days off to be able to take care of someone when there's that many people on the list we have to follow FMLA guidelines step one so that's 12 weeks and if you have enough sick time accrued you should be able to be able to use that time up for a loved one so that's what every employee in the district can do and coverage is an issue but I mean I'm just worried about I mean I just know when I have had a rough year where there's been many illnesses

[01:10:00]
listen to death in a family where it's a whole bunch of people how that in turn would affect a classroom full of children so if you have a mom who's sick and you stay home and then your dad passes away and then your uncle's sick and you can take care of him the impact that that would have on a classroom is my concern so I know that doesn't happen all the time but I can think of in my situation where it's been a whole lot of people when it's like one thing after another after another and my concern is just what's happening to the kids yes we have to take everything into consideration but we can't violate FMLA this is the bottom line I know that the states working on a Paid Family Leave Act and that there's a task force in place and perhaps that would help address

[01:11:00]
teacher in the classroom every day so that's that's what I'm concerned about and then of course the other one that is disturbing to me is just I think we're the only government entity right now in New Mexico as far as I know and I could be wrong but that still pays people that are holding political office so I mean that's at a cost to taxpayers where they're getting paid their salary and then they leave the classroom and then there are we have a substitute in there and then they're getting their per diem and so I just think that is not something that that we should do and I know that like the state and the city doesn't do that and I think that we should take the lead there also when it comes to that so that is my opinion as well

[01:12:00]
and this is just from talking to a lot of people in and around my district I am a big I think teachers do an amazing most of them not all of them do an amazing job and the great teachers should get paid a whole lot more than the mediocre teachers and then the poor teachers and we still haven't figured out exactly how how to do that and to say we're all great is untrue because they're not all great doctors are all great lawyers and we look for a great doctor and we look for a great lawyer and our kids are the most important people in the world so we should be making sure that all of our children are being taught by the very very best and that we are moving out those who are not the very best I also don't believe when we're looking at the Janice decision and what's going to happen there is teachers are professionals

[01:13:00]
I always thought of myself as a professional and we should have a professional organization and not not a union we should be like the American Medical Association the bar association that's what I think and that's what how I look at teachers I think that that's what we are and that us having a union that Bargains for us is not where I think it should be and not were a lot of people out there think it should be so that's it thank you so much and there is absolutely no system that I've ever seen and that research seem

[01:14:00]
beer out that somehow arbitrarily rewarding one person over another is not what makes for the strongest teaching Force but that what's in place in this contract really focuses on how do you give professional support because not every child is going to be in the best teachers classroom the goal is really to guarantee that every single teacher in a building is a good teacher and has the support that they need and it seems like this contract really takes not just the economic part of what it is to be an APS employee but really looks at the professional side as well between the part the mentorship the differentials even because those go to people who are fulfilling leadership positions and their elected by the people who know who they are and they know that they're the real leaders instructional leaders and

[01:15:00]
building and step up and do the extra work and so I really want to thank thank the team not just for this contract but I think all of the contracts for guaranteeing that there's Equity across bargaining units and it was no small task I know because I've seen the budget along with everyone else that it was not an easy job I do have I do have a separate question we are not seeing the easiest contract what's the status of the EA's contract we had a lot of difficulty scheduling negotiations this year and we wanted to with the new bus driver Union being created we wanted to focus on that first because it's the same president Kathy Chavis is the president of both the E and the bus driver union now so we are working with them and then we're going to do the EA contract which will be rather quick so those are the next ones that are coming to the board in the next month or two in terms of the compensation

[01:16:00]
kitchen and the salary increases will they go into effect immediately yes we already agreed to that so that we could roll them over at the beginning of the contract here and so we'll see sometime in the coming weeks that contract I know one of the things that really is a huge step forward is being allowing people to move laterally from one position to another because you will never convince me that a teacher of 20 years isn't going to be more effective counselor if they if they make that move they don't forget what they know about kids and schools when they do those kinds of lateral moves and so I think it's I think it's huge and much needed to maintain people now we just need the state to recognize it for people who move into the ranks of administration because the effort by the state is there

[01:17:00]
and anyone who's been in building knows that those are not going to be the strongest administrators and that somehow we've got to make it if we want real instructional leaders and in administrative positions people need to be able to take that lateral move but that's outside the realm of this contract that's a legislative issue and so thank you for the workmen appreciate the collaborative effort because I think this could have done so at any particular turn and I think because of your integrity and determination to keep us moving forward I have a question so it's a general question more information so if you have someone who is not a member of your bargaining unit but has an issue a grievance do you represent

[01:18:00]
individual yeah we are required to represent them individually if the individual you know we cannot discriminate based on membership status ok

[01:19:00]
if you're able to comment on this is how we doing in terms of livable wages in terms of this contract not good to be honest we recently went to Houston to job fair and we tried to recruit stuff in particular and they were all making 58,000 as a new hire and they were going to have to move over here and make you know 20,000 less so we are still not competitive nationally the 34 the 366000 as a start rate is just awfully low it's hard to recruit people as a new hire here we can get them if they're going to come in as a level two or a level three but as a new hire it's it's just too low how about in

[01:20:00]
search for EA's I know we're not talking about is the EA's are more competitive Statewide with the EA salaries and they also have a career ladder so they are able to move forward in that respect and a lot of them take advantage of it but I think the biggest thing with the EA's is the differential that they received if they're filling in for teachers out or you know doing other stuff to get the differential that gives them a big boost so they're doing better off thank you very much thank you I just have a couple of things couple of typos and thank you very much

[01:21:00]
that's not what it actually goes in the contract but I do have a couple things on on page 5 of your summary and of course this is in the contract as well at the top of the page on item two you indicate APS employees will be limited to One calendar Years starting August 6th should be a year period and then in a couple of places you always you repeat that saying outside of the school work here like in one and three you repeat that but in two you don't I would suggest you take it out of one and three because you've already that's under the paragraph which says evaluations

[01:22:00]
also on I had a question on the article 6 the table you had here I know you broke out the marching band from what was there probably before and it was the band director you probably had the marching band built in there right you said that you just broken it out but then you have things like band assistant director and then you say the Asterix says it's not District find a position what does that mean exactly the district doesn't fund the allocation for the school the school has to find out of their school budget so if I had if I had a band director and then I had somebody who did marching band who wasn't me why is it I didn't seem quite right I mean

[01:23:00]
so we decided to fix this one first and then go through and analyze everything and well of course drug court system

[01:24:00]
that was kind of an interesting question if I had because I have known situations where the band director is not the person who does the marching band somebody else does that and so the band director will be making less than the system band director which is not not what you want to have right I think the idea was that it would be commensurate with the activities that were that fell outside of their regular Duty day so if they were indeed you know both marching band and band director then of course they would be able to receive the same or they be able to combine the two differentials situations like that so I'm just saying on the I did have one more serious question that's on page 13 when you're talking about your examples of the raises that are going to

[01:25:00]
occur and you you give up a table that was on 2017-18 and you give a number for that and then you say it doesn't really matter which one of these you do then you say for the next year which is the 2018-19 you've got the new table and you indicate like a person would go up a step and then you look at that step increase and you say this is the amount of Rage that you get what I would like to know is if I had the table for 2017-18 it also has a differential or an increase in the step so by definition if I still had the 2017-18 table I would get an increase by being there another year right that's automatic I don't consider to be the same as a raise in the sense of above what we would

[01:26:00]
so what I would like to know is if I had 2017-18 just take the first level one example make 34,002 so what would they make in 201718 for the for the next year and then take that difference between that and what's in 2018-19 and that tells me what kind of raise they would get and I think that's a little different number than the ones that we see here just to be transparent I mean I realize that it is going to be a 5.8% increase over the last year but they would have gotten some of that automatically from the previous table they had so a lot of the step increases were only a dollar difference for their years experience years longevity or years of experience

[01:27:00]
there's only a dollar difference in a lot of steps and that's what we were trying to correct by the new salary schedule so the question is is in all these 2017-18 I mean if the step is not any different going from one year to the next that doesn't make any sense to me because the tables in 2018-19 definitely have a difference in the step years right why wouldn't 2017 18 have the difference in the steps not just a dollar I'm talking about a normal normal increases right so is that because in 2017 18 we were going by some kind of a general idea of what races would be in the future or what no I don't understand how that works I apologize are basically a snapshot in time not supposed to be predictive of anything of what folks can expect to get because we're dependent on the legislature making allegations every single year so it should only

[01:28:00]
will you be looked at as this is what you are getting currently or to this year right so in since we were able to finish early and negotiations thankfully people were able to see the salary Matrix that they would be seeing for the following school year of course but often times it's only been for that specific contract year so did you know that isn't going to be the case you know that when I'm looking at this and saying oh next year I should be able to get this in other words even though you say that the point being is you've got to have some kind of a reasonable expectation when you're doing work and saying am I getting something more next year and you realize well that may not be true but you still kind of look at that and say well yeah maybe I'm going to get that you know so it is a little bit of a difference it's not black and white to say well we've got all these these races that's what you got this year and now you're going to get this much next year so that is

[01:29:00]
and I and I appreciate that but I'm just saying if you're looking at these kind of tables and it's the same way I would do it for example if I'm going down a recruiting in Houston right and I'm saying how many years experience you got I'm going to look at that table and that table is going to tell me that right for this year how many how many years I got experience and say well but I could if I could get another couple of years experience I'd be over here right right isn't that where I'd be and maybe and because we're allowing private experience maybe they didn't understand that you can do that so I'm going to be up here right you know so you're using those steps to mean something not just future stuff but you're using them to try to place where you are so they do have a meaning those steps have a meeting there in the past 20 years ago it was left up to the union and its entirety without

[01:30:00]
District input on where to place that money on their salary schedule so that's why the discrepancies are in certain areas if you the old salary schedule step 25 to 30 to around that were huge increases because they wanted people to be able to retire with a higher 5 and yet then at the beginning a couple years there was no increase so we're trying to fix that slowly in the future and it ended up staying like that for a long time ago okay yeah well that's that's pretty good one other one of the question here on page 15 I know you've got some interesting point point decimal students I just wasn't sure exactly what that meant we're looking at like

[01:31:00]
for example if I got several English classes 78 and I've got total number of students than the average of the number of students in the classes would be such and such and I can come up with the decimal point there but I either have one or I don't have one you know usually although some of them may think they're only three quarters their but so is that what they're doing is averaging here you know correct and if that is the average 142 English 7/8 in one class and I had a 100 and 140 in another one that would still be within the average of 141.75 and then I did have the question about the high school seniors I think we're trying to say anything about what the seniors can or cannot do

[01:32:00]
I think again some of them may well be taking college classes some of them may well be doing all kinds of things but not being on campus I mean good in their education maybe they're taking CNN maybe they're going to CNN you know so I think that would be very difficult to to try to require any any particular thing relative to their senior so and are court appearance I don't want you to feel like you have to say a lot here because again I know you're tired and you probably been through more than you really wanted to be today but you're welcome period

[01:33:00]
and whether or not insisting that sorry I was rushing insisting that the teachers at the schools had evaluation designations based on vanity I want to make sure we're staying on topic of agenda so sorry and I would love to hear that story I really would but I was thinking more about the contract itself and what we're talking about so I didn't want to I don't want to violate the rules here that we want to be careful what we're talking about I would love to talk about the country OK Google

[01:34:00]
thank you very much Simon for coming because I was trying to get back from Santa Fe I just want to say we had really productive contract negotiations this year we were able because of our collaborative relationship together as teams we were able to settle salary negotiations before the end of May have you already said all this and I just want to thank Tammy very much for all her hard work and Theresa also and then I think we did great problem-solving during the summer months and we're able to dress specific issues for specific constituents and I'm very optimistic that in the next few years we're going to be able to do a lot more for our employees and make this the place that they want to work and they want to stay Thank you very much

[01:35:00]
like how many voted for it against that kind of things I always when I had somebody vote against it and they weren't very many you got 29 I think in the teachers union but one of the questions I I always ask myself and I said what exactly were the main concern of of those that didn't vote no no what would they you know what is it exactly that you would say might be a concern that they had with voting no doctor Percy members of the board on our electronic vote system we have a comment section is there anything else you want to let the board know but because I was out of town and I wasn't able to compile it for you I will email it to you have an interesting perspective that I hadn't thought about before

[01:36:00]
one thing that I might consider is there's an issue I hadn't really thought about and so that's kind of more the idea and I've done this in my professional work a lot in terms of those kind of ideas what now there's a lot of times the statistics you throw the outliers out and I'm and typically what I do is I want to know why somebody is an outlier cuz you may well have found something I never even thought about not that it's going to be changed the overall picture but just from that point so yeah if you got a chance to you know to have some comments be interesting to if there's if there's a general idea of a few that kind of had similar thing or if there's something that you think is probably really maybe important to follow up on you know that kind of thing so I will I will tell you that what I have found no it's because it wasn't everything that they thought it could be

[01:37:00]
and I know that people feel that way right now about salaries sometimes even though they understand the context of State funding and that we surpassed what the legislature allocated they may be unhappy about how it impacted them personally sometimes it's a specific person where contract language like last year we were able to do something for the therapist that we didn't do for the social workers and some social workers were up so it's usually very personal and specific to the individual yeah I understand that I understand that and that's kind of not what I mean by that but you know what I mean yeah in fact we could probably isn't enough so okay that's we know that okay oh I entertain a motion

[01:38:00]
you know being from the west side and looking at growth on the west side we have large schools right large classrooms and I'm concerned with the fact that we have waivers to increase classroom size and I know this is something we're going to have to address with the lawsuit and I'm really concerned I just wanted to make a comment with regard to that this really concerns me our kids cannot learning classrooms board member Paterson we agree and we were able to go from 7% waiver to a 5% waiver when we were able to secure the funding just to refresh everyone's memory in 2008 and 09 during the recession they balance the state budget by allowing waivers in class size

[01:39:00]
is and so until we restore our funding at the state level to pre-recession levels we are not going to be able to restore our class sizes and so it's going to take another effort to bump it like from 7 to 5:00 and now from 5:00 back to where the state statute says it should be okay thank you very much appreciate it thank you on the National Association of Latino elected officials educational leadership and public policy Academy

[01:40:00]
in the first annual National Education leadership and public policy Academy hosted by the National Association of Latino elected and appointed officials and the Latino policy and politics initiative at the UCLA you'll see some of the photos up here I don't think I'm in any of them but I swear to God I was there but it was a three-day intensive convening that brought together about 60 different Latino state legislators County Municipal officials higher education trustees and school board members to learn about effective public policies that support Latino families and communities the curriculum was designed to strengthen our governance capacity and critical areas such as education Economic Development criminal justice and immigration and improving opportunities for latinos with special attention to intersections across gender and age so that we are better equipped to contribute

[01:41:00]
mute to the economic success of the country some of the topics that were addressed during The Institute included challenges and opportunities for Latinos in the 21st century academic attainment trends for Latino students dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline increasing College access and opportunities for Latino meals we did a study of a Fruitvale Oakland which was a case study on Transportation in community Economic Development improving public trust and communities while addressing Public Safety collateral consequences the Blurred Lines between immigration and criminal law and restoring hope through reintegration so some of those highlights in reference to like academic attainment trends for Latino students were that Latino students are the second largest student population in the K through 12 Public School System insurance

[01:42:00]
set student populations excel in the entertainment of a high school degree and is prepared to be Career College ready is a key economic priority for the country and the gauge how well students are prepared post high school policy makers must understand how to navigate the various data sources available to them so one of the things that I brought along is what we learned at the kids first Workshop in all of the different data sources that we use to make decisions the Fruitvale Oakland case study on transportation and economic development was where policy makers have the opportunity to better understand the effect of environmental stress on the lives of families in young children and identify strategies to support well-being and what that included was a it was like a very similar to what we have downtown so they build it around a Transportation Center so they build Charter Schools Community Center

[01:43:00]
where is access to healthcare so they did a case study you know 10 years later how they're doing and so it was really interesting and again I brought everything on a on a drive for you guys to take a look at cuz it was it was incredibly overwhelming these three days the one of the other highlights was improving public trust and communities while addressing Public Safety and so at the national level Criminal Justice Reform has paid increasing attention to the role of law enforcement and improving Public Safety through community policing procedural Justice eliminating poverty penalties associated with court fees restorative justice and police accountability and I and I included some more highlights but I just I really wanted to say that at the end of those three days what felt really good once again and we learned this every time we go to national conferences is how well positioned Albuquerque Public Schools is and how

[01:44:00]
spell we are addressing a lot of the things that we discussed at this conference and how we do have the restorative justice program in place we do address equity and engagement we do work with Community Schools and we do have an immigrant and Refugee Department in contact so a lot of the things that we had discussion around those three days thank God I had examples to talk about because we again I just felt so good after those three days that we are you know that you know not to say that we are ahead of the game but we are definitely in the game and we are addressing these issues and and we take what we do incredibly serious and and I love the fact that they pointed out such an emphasis on data analysis I knew that would be right up Dr Bowman's alley but it was incredibly interesting and again I could give you highlight on every Workshop but incredibly interesting and I did bring

[01:45:00]
check all the PowerPoint presentations in the handouts for you guys cuz it's a lot of information to take in and I would highly recommend you spend the time doing it when when you have availability so I could do without LA traffic though I like to rent a car because I like to be in control and I'll never do that again in LA but what you did tell me what an incredible opportunity again to be in the room with those 60 different elected officials from from everywhere from Florida to New York to New Jersey Michigan I mean it was incredible and I thought really proud of Albuquerque Public Schools and what we have to offer our community so thank you very good thank you this great report any questions from the board any thoughts

[01:46:00]
well I had a lot of aha moments and a lot of them had to do with Statistics especially in reference to youth incarceration I mean so that was disappointing but it wasn't necessarily an aha moment but I walked away thinking most recently how a board member Peggy talked about going to the graduation of our kids who are incarcerated do we have dual credit opportunities for those kids we do okay that so it wasn't an alcoholic moment but it was definitely a question that I walked away with thinking are we offering our students that are incarcerated an opportunity to also earn their college degree while while being there but I am I think carceration and you know young men of color in the high rates so and the other all home and it was again what we already have in place and what we're doing with such a positive thing thank you very much any other comments

[01:47:00]
thank you Liz appreciate that greatly no problem we're going to the approval of the consent calendar items I have a motion have a second second second thank you I'm going to board member comments I just want to ensure that Mrs Taylor and her husband were addressed this evening before who was here at the last meeting as well so I know that she had a similar concerned only was I wanted to point out the difference between the Albuquerque Journal editorial board and their beat reporters and I wanted to point out there is a big difference between the editorial board and the beaters and then I honestly think that our beat reporters and writers are trying to do a fair you know they're doing their best to be fair and

[01:48:00]
make it in the reporting so that was really the only comment that I had this evening that I wanted to point out thank you board member Patterson thank you and thank you and I hope we can take care of the Taylor Swift the frosty conditions here no longer exists is because of Mr Shay he was able to check the room and so we can now be comfortable in here and thanks to him you know from Eminem this room is now very comfortable and I really appreciate that

[01:49:00]
I want to say thank you to all the individuals that are associated with the negotiations work that went on with all the union all the union work I think it's a it represents what we mean by local control and that whole thing of like a community-based approach to how we address how we're going to work as a community I belong to a professional association the National Association of Social Workers and yet that Association would never bargain on my behalf with the school district and so it would require me to be part of that school district to talk about what my interests are and what I would need is a professional so I think what I like about the unions is that

[01:50:00]
it takes into account the individuals that are going to work for our community and it demonstrates the the willingness and the partnership between Administration and those that are going to be on the front line right and that's what it's all about I know with my job that I've had I've had the opportunity to be employed at the state level and I've been a union member when I was there and I totally appreciate the bargaining unit because oftentimes even as a social worker at the state level didn't feel like my interests would be met just with my Association so I know it's hard work and I know it takes a lot of commitment but I think it's the partnership that makes it work because if there's a willingness to sit at the table together and to talk about what's going to make it work and how can we support this is going to make us a much stronger community and a much stronger workplace for everyone so thank you for representing

[01:51:00]
the fox say are represented in that process I really appreciate that it's extended Beyond teachers when I was with APS it was just teachers and so I appreciate that it's gone for the than that my mother was a long time educational assistance she retired from APS as an educational assistant and she would have greatly appreciated having had an opportunity to have somebody bargain on her behalf so so thank you I think that was tremendous and in terms of just thinking about the differences in leaves and the importance of the Family Medical Leave Act I understand that as well too having been an individual who had to benefit who benefited from that because when my husband was I was on FMLA and now as a person who's taking care of my mother I really appreciate having FM

[01:52:00]
play to support me as I'm going through my work as well so it's very complicated and it's very difficult but I totally appreciate the reason why it needs to happen and so again thank you so much for your work thank you thank you first I thought I wasn't going to say anything but I do have to acknowledge a couple of things first of all I had the pleasure of attending the economic Forum this past week and was able to listen to the superintendent's professional presentation it was very interesting I noted this one I was there that you couldn't get people to come inside the room to get the session started at the beginning and then at the end because of the presentation and it was profound you couldn't get people to leave it was a lot of discussion

[01:53:00]
look like people were on point and it had to do very much with the I think the leveraging that you did in the words that you chose you're always Way Beyond being diplomatic you have you basically are a Class Act is the only way I know how to say thank you and I want to acknowledge also the associate superintendents for your hard work in the last period of time I thought a lot about it and it strikes me that I don't I don't know how hard are working group I'm sure there are lots of people who work very hard but I just want to say that any time I call one of the Associates in a matter of hours or minutes and are very professional and listen to my concerns and get back to me about the issues or concerns that I have and we come to an understanding

[01:54:00]
Cordova for what you said about the collaboration on behalf of the district that's been able to be achieved at this at this District you know it's it's quite remarkable actually and I think we all know that part of the reason that we've had so many challenges it's just because we've been underfunded for so many years my hope is that we can actually move forward in the next period of time but I don't think it's going to happen unless people get together and register to vote and vote we really need to make sure that we sent a clear message that people are behind our public education system and while I very much appreciate Elizabeth's comments about making a distinction between the staff at the

[01:55:00]
Journal who do the reporting on the editorial board it's hard to not be somewhat tainted I think in part I feel like a lot of what gets put together is a message that essentially what looks to me like makes the journal very much a spokesperson for ped and I don't think those policies are such that they've been useful to us whether it's the greatness of schools or the evaluations of teachers and the land of APs as an institution I think I take big issues with that and we have to stand up for what's right because our democracy is at stake and there's a lot to be said I'd call for a dialogue and have never ever received any kind of invitation to sit down and talk

[01:56:00]
I don't need to be lectured to but I do want us to be able to come to terms and perhaps maybe at the end of this Administration we could actually move forward in a way that we have it thus far I have taken great offense by a number of things that have been put out there in the name of the media and the offense I take mostly is that we're attacking our own Community without really talking about what really is going on so thank you thank you Google pay attention to it

[01:57:00]
and this is only because I have this conversation with constituents people don't get that it's more than just that category of direct instruction that's direct support for students and so every time we say 67 percent is direct instruction and that's teacher and DJs in classrooms just saying that one more sentence and then that other 20% are people who are working directly with students just not in the classroom anyway it was it was not only

[01:58:00]
one of the things that I know just from the years that I was teaching this goes to the salary schedule and I don't know what the solution is because every time there's just a chunk of money trying to figure out where it needs to go and how to divide it up and some years it's been people at the top who have gotten who have gotten more sometimes it's been people entry level people that have gotten more but I know that over the years my when I think about the years that I was teaching over 35 years I ended up retiring at 35 without the same standard of living based on my salary

[01:59:00]
is people who would come before me 30 years that when you look at what teacher salaries used to be teacher salaries used to support families and that never and and I know that there's a whole history to why the salary schedule is designed the way it is and some of it I really understand and some of it I think we could go back in time and read it it might be good but it was never a guarantee it was never if I was on step 19 it was never a guarantee that what was on the schedule for step 20 would be my income when I hit 20 years and very rarely over over the years so each generation of incoming teachers sort of loses

[02:00:00]
is a little bit in terms of the standard of living so and I think the tier system the licensure system was an attempt to to address that to say let's move everyone up let's say and automatically supporting what I know Senator Stewart represent or introduced last session in terms of saying let's just move those bass tears for everyone let's put his 50 now they should just start at 6:50

[02:01:00]
who sings that just really echoing I don't know why I'm so echoey we're leaving I think last year when we had that massive or whatever year it was when we had the massive cut there was incredible intention to keep it away from the classroom and and administrative level folks took a huge cut as we have more money coming into the district I think we need to be equally careful about thinking about what do we need to reinstate because we're going to burn people out in the administration and people can't keep going and what can we still

[02:02:00]
do to make sure we keep focusing on class size and on the building level instruction and it's it's going to be a push-pull because I know people are hurting it within the administration and at the same time the class size we've got to look at that so all of those things that goes back to partly what we're lobbying for what we can be really explicit about in terms of saying this is the need I mean I think I've always been a puzzlement we have to recognize that the teachers are human beings and they have sick kids they have six parents they have they get cancer people have to be able to take care of themselves and their families so how do we solve that we saw that by having sufficient Staffing in building period

[02:03:00]
and so how do we let people be human and take care of their families and still take care of the classroom we do that by making sure we have sufficient Staffing within schools so that we minimize what the effects are if we have permanent Subs in the building who know kids who know instructions you know who are part of the staff then all of a sudden we can minimize what the impact on children in the classroom are still respect the needs of human beings that work in the district so hopefully sufficient funding is on the way and we can start looking at some of the reality but always keep an eye on making it possible for people to work long term for this district and feel like it's something they want

[02:04:00]
still keep always directing as much resources to the buildings as we can and hopefully we'll have sufficient funding Someday I'm waiting for the day trying to think if there's anything else off to start this year thank you for the associate superintendent to or out there all the time trying to help and support so thank you for that first thing that I just want to put out there is at our last meeting when we had a lot of people talking about the newcomer program

[02:05:00]
we are behind that and supporting that but there is a great need for those a newcomer program that is going to help those high school students so we don't have too much time with them in our school so we want to make sure that we do the best we can so hopefully we're looking at that kind of program to hopefully start by hopefully next school year and as far as as unions everybody knows what I think you have a right to to join them but according to the Bureau of Labor there are 790,000 workers in New Mexico 63000 of those have a union negotiate for them 522,000 our members of a union Which is less than 7% bargaining with somebody else's money with the Public's money is not something that even if

[02:06:00]
I know when you're out there in the private sector your boss decides by looking at your work who is going to get paid more that's what we do with our business and that's what most businesses do there are the exceptional workers who deserve that exceptional pay as far as bargaining I want to bargain I would always want to bargain for myself and not leave that to someone who doesn't know anything anything about me I know unions speak as if they're speaking for the majority when they're really speaking for the minority as we looked at many of these numbers when you have 489 people that they're negotiating for and there's only $120 that are so that's something hopefully with the Janice decision bargaining will finally return

[02:07:00]
into the individual worker where it's it belongs people know themselves better and everyone who is a worker out there knows what their knows what they're worth everybody is not worth the same they are not worth the same amount and we all know this and we like to get paid for what we do and it's stifles when they're not able to be the very best and get paid for being the very best thank you thank you for 1500

[02:08:00]
for our uniforms for little Mesa Elementary School and actually had another $500 which probably came because people contributed to that after we were there we had course the superintendent was there we had Gabriel Gabriella Becky our associate superintendent for was there and our principal are Cabela who is the principal at La Mesa Elementary School and myself and I think they're very appreciative of the fact that APS took a little bit of time to send some of the some of their administrative folks there to actually welcome them and to thank them for their Outreach in Mission I'm a big believer in an organization's helping out with our schools and that's one organization that clearly they've been there for a while so I greatly appreciate that also ran into Nancy who was a professor

[02:09:00]
and she gave me several interesting research articles on why art is so important to our students I love it just let you know that I'm going to I'm going to put that out send it to you guys again I know a lot of the research but again it's always nice to have somebody else and she kind of cornered me a little bit and says I know you're kind of you know an Arts guy and I just thought I had to tell you about that a lot of what we we need to do in terms of putting out what we're doing in a matter of fact and I'm polite

[02:10:00]
what are Staffing or unions and what they're doing for their for their for our people for our employees I'm glad that we could have some races I don't think they're enough and to kind of follow up on the on the funding ruling that are judge made in the office we have a framework now at MRI schools and I'm hopeful that that framework is is on the basis of the fact that we know time on task is what they do is a lot of hours to the day we have added particular kind of programs like a genius hour which is experiential learning Concepts and we've spent somewhere between 1:22 to do that so if the legislature wants to know

[02:11:00]
what's a possible solution for some of these funding things for under to served under served kids in schools that have a large percentage of our Industries kids there's a model that you might want to think about and so that gives you kind of a baseline others when people say well how much funding you're really talking about I think we ought to have kind of a little bit of a baseline for what would that really mean particularly for Albuquerque and I don't know how many of our schools could probably benefit probably all of our schools to benefit from a longer day and a longer and more days but if I said well maybe 50 million dollars for 50 scores 100 million dollars we have 25% of the students in the state so that's 400 million dollars there's a baseline something to kind of

[02:12:00]
it's a little more than that but it's a little less than that so let's start thinking about that rather than having planning meetings and committee meetings and more meetings and more talk and let's do you know that's what we end up doing with this so the question is is maybe we got to be a little more proactive about that kind of an idea not that everybody wants to do what we're doing but the concept of adding days adding hours is is it's called learning in the community schools concerts so we get the community building in the community with our businesses and so forth see those are all the kinds of ideas that we know work we know that works so I'm interested to see how that works with schools but that doesn't mean you got to show me you know 45% increase

[02:13:00]
thank you very much appreciate everybody here and thank you appreciate it I'm not sure you needed to do that but I appreciate you doing that and with that I'll go on tonight

[02:14:00]
raining will be Monday September 24th 7:30 a.m. in the Delia Martin community room and we have a consideration for approval to convenient executive session pursuant to the open meetings act MSA 1978 10/15 a 87 for the purpose of discussing matters pertaining pending litigation and attorney client privilege related to Catherine Goldberg played versus John Cena and the Albuquerque Public Schools defendants 180422339 and we'll take a roll call yes yes thank you
