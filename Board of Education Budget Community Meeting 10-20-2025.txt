==================================================

[00:00:00] I shared we shared and we didn't have enough time to share to my left butt and it's such an individual thing so I'm not going to represent everybody really so it's very individual it came out for us my thought was took me to when I was in third grade and that was in Mountain Home Idaho but it doesn't matter where we are it's what the teacher did and she gave it to me to make a decision so it was my decision and at the time it was it was a recess time and I wanted to either play with the boys or play with the girls and I had played with the girls but I found it and I saw the guys like running around and having a really good time so she had me decided they played very rough so just that you know that if you make that I broke my wrist ship my two front teeth so that was
[00:01:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:02:00] give me the only thing that changes that I would have had a Navajo learning program on my kids are at La Mesa and to me that made a big difference it changes the way they think and the way they talk and let's try lingual so to me without the school district and people that do parents are assigned to teachers that go to the schools I know there's not enough money now to do it but back then it meant a lot to me and my kids are my daughters make a difference
[00:03:00] and now we are going to shift
[00:04:00] have those same kind of special experiences and it's not up on the side yet and what I have on my script is welcome question mark for those memorable School experiences while working within limited resources to understand how
[00:05:00] has rules for some only think about it like your own household budget you might have one account for housing another for grocery and another one for
[00:06:00] and you can't always move money from one to another the finance team must follow strict laws and regulations for every dollar spent most importantly every part of our budget supports are for APS goals and aligns with our strategic plan for student outcomes 8:00 p.m. is funded by enrollment how many of you know that it's funded by over the past 10 years are district like many Urban school districts Nationwide have seen a steady decline in student enrollment this de
[00:07:00] play in enrollment directly affects our funding which is largely based on student headcount fewer students means fewer dollars even as the cost of maintaining buildings transportation and Staffing may increase well the numbers are concerning our goal is not only to manage enrollment declined responsibly but to build a stronger more responsive school system for the students we serve today and in the future the aps budget this current slide this current Table is our current budget and it's 2.
[00:08:00] 2 billion with operational funds representing 48.5% that's the area of blue and capital funds 29.3 which is that area shaded in brown funding sources operational Capital funds grants Food Service Transportation instructional materials let's take a quick look at the different types of funds that make up the aps budget we often get questions about where does the money come from house it spent what can and can't be used for so here's a quick breakdown operational funds are what we use
[00:09:00] day-to-day needs like paying for staff keeping the lights on buying supplies almost all of this money 97 of it comes from the state capital funds these come from voter-approved taxes and are strictly for things like building repairs new schools technology upgrades by law they can't be used for teachers yourself from the state federal government and private groups these are usually for specific program and they do have expiration dates with them other dedicated funds cover things like School meals funded by federal and state programs
[00:10:00] student transportation that that is paid by the state classroom materials like textbooks that is also funded by the state operational funds this is the 48% of the aps budget and about 2/3 of these funds go directly to schools they mostly pay for teachers education assistance School level support and the rest of it does support Central Services to make sure things run smoothly won't be talking about this tonight Capital funds Capital funds are voter-approved taxes that are crucial for maintaining and improving schools up here you'll see
[00:11:00] play we have information on HB 33 which we could use for new construction additions major repairs also we talked about sb9 which can be used for maintenance technology equipment and then General obligation bonds or Geo bonds which are used for big projects like new classroom blocks or HVAC Replacements these phones keep our building safe and functional and they can't be used for salaries or classroom programs this is another one of the funds will talk to you about tonight in fact voters are going to the polls as we speak to vote on Giovanni's
[00:12:00] to help find bigger items like safety HVAC and buildings now I would like to turn the presentation back over to board member Benavides stop talking for College and Career every student
[00:13:00] developing the skills habits and mindsets for Life success return these answers into four goals that shape the work of our district every day budget priorities and talk about what you think APS should focus on there is no right or wrong answer just Talk Amongst yourselves and decide what you think is most important will take about five minutes for this discussion

[00:18:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:19:00] okay sounds like there was some good discussions happening out there would anyone like to share a priority or two from their table thank you after school activities
[00:20:00] we have an idea of Watchdog group I don't know if anyone has heard of that or knows what it is you want to speak a little bit on that it's when a group of parents actually Patrol the perimeters of the schools things like that to make sure that there are no imminent threats they walk around they watch all of the different areas that are accessible I was thinking that at some point there could be a use of the volunteer military police officers anyone that has training that could volunteer their time that would be willing to volunteer their time that way that money could be allocated access for the kids that need special services my children
[00:21:00] I've been trying to find proper services for them for years and we need money because the children that are autistic and especially the nonverbals or the violent children they're not getting the services that they need the teachers are not being trained properly which is putting them in danger which will in turn cost additional money if something were to happen if someone were injured on the job it's all about training I mean the training that should be an automatic reason for there to be more money there should be more access for what's really needed and it's just can't see it where the 50th and the state and my kids in the third grade I've been trying to find outlets and counseling for them through the school and through the state for the last 4 years I finally had a little bit of a break through the other day but come to find out that the people that are specialized and needed in these training areas are not available or they have to be outsourced for by the school out of their grant money in
[00:22:00] number to be brought in and used on Anita bases and there's just not enough of them and kids are suffering teachers are suffering instructors are suffering and safeties one thing but I mean we need safety and we need training and understanding for what's going on for kids that have special needs thank you for sharing what's your name my name is another thing we talked about kids are suffering we're not looking at the school environment that it was 102345
[00:23:00] where can we tighten up the budget I'm not going to ask for more money know but I want to know that the money that we have is well budgeted that's all so more and the services for teachers and students and that's that's what was talked about so thank you thank you for sharing anybody else want to share their priorities
[00:24:00] what a lot of the students in APS are using good students and all I want to do is learn and there's teachers out there that I do care about these kids they will learn but a lot of the programs are being cut because of lack of money like they were saying and if they would find a way even to budget out like one teacher for the special programs per week and he said the outside contractors
[00:25:00] do you know who I was and then who are you I said Mamacita's are doing and they go do the job and they go to the school and they take a month to do a job that the guy in a week that don't make no sense that's like throwing away money I thought I'd let you know cuz I could cut down cuz you got to watch him again so that kind of thing will happen anybody else this is your chance
[00:26:00] my table I brought up the idea of student engagement and when we talked about student engagement the kids think that school is boring the parents think that it's the teachers fault they teachers think that it's the parents fault for failing to and call Kate you know a proper culture of Education within the kids and I don't think it's really important to distinguish who's right but we do need to work on this so for example last year we you know following up on the state Bill HB 171 we try to find ways for to get the kids to you know take more ownership of their education I know that there are conversations Gabriella about the academy and whether or not the academy music all of these things are designed to increase student engagement are they working I'm not sure but that is everything that we need to do is find ways to get kids re-engaged after having some disengagement I think during the
[00:27:00] facilities to change this
[00:28:00] the most expand our communities capacity for aquatic education swimming is unique among Sports it's not merely recreational or competitive it's a life-saving skill yet the Northeast Heights is Gone without a public Aquatic Facility for over 20 years the north Domingo Baca Aquatic Center represents a long overdue step toward addressing this need Albuquerque Public Schools has already demonstrated leadership by contributing 2 million dollars to helped launch the project project project a contribution that definitely deserves recognition and gratitude however aps's funding currently represents represents only about 4% of the total cost of the facility despite the fact that the district will be one of the primary beneficiaries of the facility to consider an additional investment to help bring this project to completion together we can make New Mexico
[00:29:00] is both in and out of the classroom thank you thank you so early
[00:30:00] connection grade level Focus budget rankings and open-ended feedback will you received a more than 5,300 responses of which 47% were parents or Guardians 41% were APS employees and 9% represented both there was a limited participation from students and also the broader Community we have six different categories you can see the categories there on the left hand side Safety and Security curriculum and instruction student support facilities and infrastructure
[00:31:00] professional development and staff support technology and Innovation and then we had like an overall General budget priority within Safety and Security school safety for staff was very important 41.2 percent in curriculum and instruction engaging and relevant curriculum and instructional materials was the top priority in student support counseling mental health supports for students in facilities and infrastructure Heating and Cooling so are professional development classroom management in technology STEM related technology and then overall
[00:32:00] Safety and Security is most important now I'd like to turn it back to board member to share a budget activity OK Google and allows us to observe the way the community prioritizes the use of this will help us understand the importance of each priority and we will be able to use this information but they will give you a sense of the trade-offs and decision-making
[00:33:00] $40 is already allocated to staff salaries 10 is allocated to utilities the remainder is for the priorities identified in the community survey or any of the priorities you identified at your table and go ahead and start the activity now OK Google shared with you
[00:34:00] how much they may cost and we'll take about 10 minutes
[00:35:00] certainly can we go to the previous slide please we've had a request from the audience thank you and we've had a request to switch to the next slide that shows the top 10 priorities and the
[00:36:00] where is budgeted for each thank you Google
[00:37:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:38:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:39:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:40:00] OK Google
[00:41:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:42:00] okay we're going to start to share after we discuss the table discussion questions which on the next slide there we go so now that you have
[00:43:00] we'd like you to discuss some of these questions prioritization and trade-offs which priorities did your team choose to fund first and why what did you have to leave out or fun less and how did you decide where to allocate the limited resources equity and impact how did your team consider the needs of different students or schools when making allocations did you try to balance resources across programs or focus on a few areas with the biggest impact finally reflection and realism looking at your allocation what surprised you about the process did you did your priorities align with what you expected or did the exercise change your thinking about the district budgets we will ask one person from each table to share your team's reflections with the larger group and if there are any students in the room we'd like to hear from you first
[00:44:00] [Could not understand audio]
[00:45:00] I split it across two years I put $5 towards Building Maintenance because our intercom wasn't working so we had an announcement on our like Promethean boards because she's vegetarian and they have vegetarian options but she doesn't enjoy the lunches and they always have sweaty pizza and everybody's excited for that she put $10 to college career and I don't know why $10 for students coming out of college for the next step in
[00:46:00] what is your name and what grade are you in I'm Emma katish thank you Mama that was fantastic it's very important my name is Crystal already allocated for other things which made it a little bit harder to put the moneys I understand now why
[00:47:00] and there's not a lot you can do with the other things so it opened my eyes as far as budget in that sense but we did split $5 to counseling and mental health for the kiddos we feel like that's important and then some of the categories you guys had up there I think we're kind of redundant like some kind of fell under security and maintenance and so I feel like some of those could have been tied together so we did the best we could with what we have left over so we did 15 dollars for heating and cooling instead of 40 and we did $20 towards professional development for teachers which I feel is important if the teachers are paid well and their motivated to come to work then our kiddos will get better education training I volunteered in the class and I see that everything is fast-paced the kid out in the class well guess what their whole days now throwing off and they're missing assignments because the teacher has to stop and get
[00:48:00] counseling and mental health too so we did the best we could with what we got left over so thank you for that thank you good listener hi my name is Miriam not necessarily in the order of importance but just the way I wrote them down first we have Heating and Cooling we allocated $28 but that's kind of Up For Debate necessity for teachers and students alike he can't work in an environment where you're uncomfortable and
[00:49:00] then $6 for postsecondary education and preparation $6 for mental health services and counseling $6 well this is kind of the same as what you had said that we kind of combined the school security and campus security in the fences and stuff like that so $6 for school security $4 for campus security and infrastructure and I believe that that is it thanks thank you
