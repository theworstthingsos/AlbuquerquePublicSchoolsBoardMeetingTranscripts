[00:03:00]
did Albuquerque and the county of Bernalillo is all voting members are presenters for this evening are board members Courtney Jackson and Heather Benavides who represent APS on this commission so thank you president Gonzalez since 2019 when this was first formed APS has only had an advisory role and has not actually had voting privileges and we have worked this year to be able to move into a position where we have voting privileges on this joint commission and you will see that there is a board resolution which is what we will be approving tonight there's also the attached agreement which is the intergovernmental intergovernmental agreement for the local government Commission

[00:04:00]
this has been reviewed by our legal team and some of the attributes within this document that would pertain specifically to us have also been vetted through like the superintendent and stuff like that specifically you know the superintendent will have to attend meetings once a month with those intergovernmental groups as well as whenever the board members move into the the principal position we will have to provide staff support and all of that has been approved through through APS and through our supporting systems the one thing that was added that is very important is in number six with operating procedures they added a procedural voting for him shall be defined as a quorum of the body previously it was a quorum of each of the cohorts which is why this document was not able to be approved

[00:05:00]
April was because the County Commission cohort didn't have a quorum so they added this Edition so that if the entire body is there and has a core and then we can can move forward with business so remember Benavides am I missing anything no but if if I might just chimed in and say that I think that this is a wonderful opportunity and I'm really excited to be a part of it but I think that we just need to remain mindful of the resources in APS and make sure that we are not overloading our superintendent and obligation in this so thank you very much and Jackson and so with that and given that we had the opportunity to review the resolution I would like to ask for a motion to approve it I moved to approve the resolution approving an intergovernmental agreement between the Albuquerque Public School District Board of Education

[00:06:00]
City of Albuquerque and the county of Bernalillo to reform the Albuquerque Bernalillo County government commission as the local government coordinating commission to include Albuquerque Public Schools the City of Albuquerque and the county of Bernalillo as voting members second this is Jennifer thank you we have a motion from Member Jackson and the second from member astorga is there any additional discussion or questions I think just seconding what remember Benavides said and being mindful of all sorts of our time use when it comes to staff time because that's something that we have to make sure that we're calculating know and there's a lot of head nodding to that so we will be mindful of that and make adjustments as we go so with that Miss King can we have a roll call vote please Janelle story

[00:07:00]
yes our next item is to consider approval of amendment to the 2024 2025 instructional calendar we do have Dr Shanelle Segura chief of schools and Patricia Salas director of the school schedule design and system support available for questions however I just wanted to turn to Dr Blakey just to give a brief overview of why the calendar is in front of us again given that we've proved it all ready and then if there's any questions we can get into that but if not we can just go straight to a boat thank you board member of the board what we have is an amendment to the calendar so this year we've had a lot of feedback about the last day of school being that the last week of school it's a topic and currently because of the K-12 plus funding the last day of school is a full day so we're looking at adjusting our calendar for the next school year to swap January 7th

[00:08:00]
is a professional development day with May 30th to give teachers a full day of end-of-year items in lieu of January 7th which will be an instructional day for students and that is the only difference to this calendar thank you and is there a motion to approve the new calendar I moved to approve the amendment to the 2024 2025 instructional calendar this is supposed is there any additional questions or discussion it makes a lot of sense makes a lot of sense to switch that out so thank you for being responsive to the community yes thank you for that

[00:09:00]
Janelle Stroger Ronaldo tell Morita yes Heather Benavides Crystal Tapia Romero Dominguez Courtney Jackson yes Danielle Gonzales yes our next item is to consider approval of the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 2025 including Charter School including Charter School budgets are presenter tonight is Rosalinda Montoya executive director of budget and strategic planning and we also have a Chief Financial Officer available as well before we get I wanted to start by just reviewing and restating part of the guidance on effective budget alignment and acknowledge also that we are in the midst of multiple transitions so transitioning into sfg transitioning which is student outcomes focused governance transitioning into the

[00:10:00]
cast of aligning everything that we do in the district to student outcomes focused governance so aligning our superintendent hiring process are superintendent evaluation and then the cascading of rolls down from that but also aligning our budget to student outcomes Focus governments and it's a work in progress and it takes time and we're also in the midst of the transition with our new superintendent with Scott Helder who will Who is continuing the role through the end of June and we have Dr Blakey as the Acting Superintendent until July 1st and so there is a lot of transition there we also just updated our not just but recently updated the budget policy to get clearer about the expectations of the board and the community when it comes to the budget development and budget approval process and what types of information we need to be able to know that we're proving at a strategic level to start with some of that overall framing

[00:11:00]
and also just being mindful of the guidance that we've got that communities have created school districts for one reason and one reason only and that's to improve student outcomes and that needs to be the priority focus of everything that we do the priority of the budget and that it's our function to represent the vision and the values of the community and it is the function of the superintendent implement the vision and the values of the community as described to them by the school board and so we designate to the superintendent delegate to the superintendent the responsibility for managing the day-to-day Affairs and so with that in mind it is not our job to develop the budget it is merely our job to make sure that it meets the vision and values of our community and so again the guidance that we have received is that the school board should review the initial proposed budget from the superintendent with the initial assumption can't talk tonight initial assumption that it does not accomplish the community's

[00:12:00]
will honoring the communities values the school board should not simply extend the benefit of the doubt the superintendent must convince the school board that this is the case only upon being convinced should the school board then vote to adopt the annual budget so with that in mind that's why we've had the monthly presentation so that we can get all of the information that we need to know to feel assured that the district is moving forward with the budget that's aligned to those goals and guardrails so the last thing I'll say before I turn it over a similarly from our guidance nowhere in this process should the board be considering whether or not they like the budget nowhere in the process should the board be considering if the right people get jobs or if the right vendors get contracts that's not our job nowhere in the process should the board be considering if they agree with the strategies proposed by the superintendents if the board has done its job of listening for the vision in the values of community and identifying them as schools and guardrails for the administ

[00:13:00]
then those Visions goals and values guardrails should be the only tool the board uses to evaluate whether or not to approve the budget so tonight when we turn to questions we will have questions around that and that only so the extent to which the budget represents the vision and values and then we'll move to adoption and so with that I'll turn it over to our presenters superintendent we discussed and seek approval for the aps annual budget for fiscal year 2025 the output and ultimately the outcomes that is important to all of

[00:14:00]
the fiscal year 2025 budget adoption process began 4 months ago by presenting to the board different budgets such as food and nutrition Capital funds title funds Title 1 funds and operational funds we we provided the projected revenues and expenditures in each area information was included on how the proposed budget was aligned to 8 p.m. and how the guard rails were on Earth additionally bored presentations included percentage of change of funding from previous years information on strategies that were added continued and specific expenditures were identified and how the expenditures

[00:15:00]
align to the goals and guard rails for example on goals 1 which is early literacy we talked about the teachers that we are funding the educational assistance reading interventionist instructional materials and programs like reading in the park for go to for math intervention also we talked about the math interventionist the teachers the EA the instructional materials and programs like the online tutoring which is part of the approval process in the meeting today for go three for post ready secondary ready Nest we gave information on the Apes Network

[00:16:00]
the CTE programs and dual credit courses and then for Gulf War we today also in this meeting we talked about panorama the software that we use for Gulfport and additionally we showed that we were honoring the guard rails by providing wraparound services such as counseling Transportation nurses ancillary Services interventionist Community coaches and then also Equitable allocation we talk to you about how we all want and some of the other titles also special education how they found IEPs to make sure that the student gets the the proper programming in needs also translators family engagement

[00:17:00]
did surveys and I'll talk about in a minute but we had our budget community meeting and then support services for staff our instructional councils are very important to the school budgets board members the budget office and I hosted Community meetings to discuss the fiscal year 2500 as part of those meetings we engage community members in a budget role playing exercise to illustrate the gives and takes we deal with as we create this APS budget we also invited the community to tell us what we should be parked prioritizing in the budget through a survey in January 2024 during budget call schools were provided training and templates to build their school

[00:18:00]
that included the requirement to align their expenditures to board goals and honor guard rails the May 1st board presentation went over the operational budget distribution and the budget by Kohls and guardrails are fiscal year 2025 budget prioritizes the board goals while honoring the guard rails and this time I turn it over to miss Rosalinda Montoya for the rest of the presentation including charter schools for fiscal year 2025 for your approval as shown in the 2024 to 2025 budget resolution

[00:19:00]
the budget is for all funds in the amount of 2 billion 150 million 510,312 of which the operational fund including the reserve is 1.03 billion dollars with that I respectfully request your approval thank you is there anything you want to talk or president and members of the board I think that this budget that has been created as Miss Montoya or as a dog was saying has throughout the past few months gone through how it is connected to the goals and guardrails I anticipate as I started superintendent in July that will see how they expenditures are connected to the goals and guardrails so throughout next year you'll see how the money is being spent once

[00:20:00]
allocated and I expect that that will be really clear in the expenditures that you see the money start to be allocated to goals and guardrails and that next year we start the budget process just a little bit sooner to really get schools connected to how their budgets are connected to the golden rules as well so as you said it's kind of a cascading effect and so the more we're able to continue showing that this is real and this is how we're allocating our resources and prioritizing I think through the course of next year you'll see the allocation of how the money is spent connected to the goals and guardrails thank you for that so I will go ahead and open up the floor to questions from the board and we'll just go one by one so I'll start from the right with member Jackson thank you so I think I have three possibly four questions if that's okay

[00:21:00]
let me just start by saying that I really appreciate what you just said Dr Blakey about the fact that expenditures moving forward will be better I will have a better understanding because as I looked through this budget I see a lot of the revenue but I don't see a lot of the the coordination between the revenue and the expenditures and I think what I'm looking for is the expenditures right I'm looking for how is this money being used and how is it being used efficiently and effectively so I also want to respond to what board president Gonzalez said is that I hope you guys understand that our responsibilities to be skeptical of this budget and that that that's our job and

[00:22:00]
so my hardest question leading up to that then is one of the questions that was was sent in and it was mine it was in regards to where has there been a tightening of the belt and I appreciate the honesty in the response that it said there was no tightening of the belt but when we look at our requirements as we're reviewing the budget we are supposed to look at which strategies are being abandoned right what is the Strategic abandonment because again we need to be efficient so I guess my first question is how are you going to address strategic abandonment moving forward based on the fact that nothing has changed so far board member Jackson I can answer that question

[00:23:00]
so one of the things that I think is important in looking how we start strategic abandonment is looking at the first things in rather than the last things in so in a traditional budget when You Face budget cuts the first reaction is whatever was the last thing we were funding will cut that but strategically we actually need to look at what have we been funding for a long time that we're not getting a return on investment for so one example two examples could be the expansion of the top model and the Fine Arts expansion so those are newer items that we see that are connected to student outcomes that would be things we would keep in place and then we would strategize what are things that we do not need to be doing any more based on the new things we're doing that are connected to the goals so it's really looking at kind of the last thing in is the

[00:24:00]
first to keep and that's a little bit different of a strategy that has been used in the past the other thing we're doing is in the reorganization there has been a downsize of the organization but particularly we've also created a position for federal and state programs and that position is a new position that is critical in looking at strategy and how are we using federal and state funds to help with leverage the work in the classrooms and guardrails rather than like maybe pet projects that are in places that are siloed so bringing that work of federal and state programs connected to the academic office directly will help align the programs and also begin looking at return on investment on programs that we have been using coupled with that I have asked the finance department to

[00:25:00]
reduce a list of expenditures of over $100,000 of on the academic side and we can start looking at do we have duplication of effort and what are the return on investment on programs that we have that are on the expenditure of that amount of money so those are just some ways that we're going to start looking strategically how we can downsize and make sure that we're aligning the expenditures again to The Golden Girls thank you thank you remember story of my questions about Transportation so with this budget resolution that I'm looking at it does saying about 28 million dollars including the Enterprise on Transportation my question is would it be a good idea to allow charter schools to find their own transportation or are we already doing that stuff that we can offset some of that money to

[00:26:00]
be able to provide our more traditional schools with more buses or a better schedule since that was part of the discussion that we've been having thank you board member Astoria some of Transportation so if they're a district charter school I believe that we have to provide the transportation they don't get they can't use the transportation funds to contract out Services if it's a state Charter they can so all of our district Charters the funding is a little bit different as far as us providing Transportation all of our transportation money also is from the state as state reimbursement and we don't provide any operational funds for transportation at this time and that includes the Enterprise fund as well would that be something that we can look at when we're talking about District charter schools for them to find funny for their own transportation it would I believe and I don't think this is on but if you

[00:27:00]
you see him randomly let me know but I believe that it would have to be changed through law thank you great thank you remember Dominguez my question has to do with the approach apart from creating a new department that will deal with federal and state grants understanding that that's in place can you speak a little bit more about how we will be able to reduce the 69% that number that we returned or unused unspent Federal money and that was reported

[00:28:00]
previous song I don't know maybe that's off it had gone up from 607 66269 understanding that you have to work with ped as well yeah I'm wondering if you were regarding the title 1 funds cuz they are able to carry over 15% which is allowable and

[00:29:00]
but I don't recall that exact amount but remember this is important members superintendent Blakey I believe you are speaking to the internet guard rails and one thing that we are implementing that could go to this new position is monitoring the spending and putting specific goals through the year so that way we can minimize the unspent tomorrow

[00:30:00]
thank you so I think that this is already been answered and so I just want to ask it anyway and see if you guys have any answer so does the strategy that can quickly be summarized exist to ensure sustainability of programs that have demonstrated positive impacts on student outcomes and are there contingency plans for maintaining critical student support services and Times of budget cuts and so when you mentioned or answered board member Jackson's strategic abandonment question and said last in first to keep I think that that probably is the answer but is there anything else you might want to elaborate on and if not then I can go on to another question I would say that that is the strategy to answer that question so this question is in response to the question or the answers you provided us and so it's regarding the federal Indian educ

[00:31:00]
and the question was how much money was spent for The Last 5 Years and for FY 20 it was about $226,421 326,000 FY 22 296 000 FY 23 Windcrest is 304,000 in FY 24 570 thousand and so the question is is there a plan in place to reduce those unspent funds in the future and if so can you summarize it a board member benavidez I would say that it's similar to what is saying is that we need to have a better handle on monitoring it throughout the year so I think that combining it all in this federal and state programs that person then will have a responsibility to make sure that the spend town is happening throughout the year and that there's a plan in place at the beginning of the year so my expectation is that at the beginning of the year

[00:32:00]
everybody would have a plan on how they're going to budget within that budget that they have for their departments and I don't think that we've had a real tightening of that approach as far as the beginning of the year making a budget for the whole year knowing that things might change along the way but what are the department directors vision for expending that money throughout the year so that when they turn it in for at the beginning of the year it will say at the end of the year I expect you know 15% carry over because this is what I'm spending along the way and I think we need to do a better job and monitoring that and having a lot of foresight with her Department directors at the beginning for how they're budgeting that budget thank you great thank you remember thank you so my question is related more to communication I'm curious

[00:33:00]
in regards to last year I know we had some disconnects regarding how we were explaining to principals in schools the new process for developing our budget based on the goals and Cardinals can you explain what we're doing different for this year too and cuz for us it's second nature we've talked about this forever but everyone else is in privy to the same conversation every week that we are so what are we doing differently to ensure that all the principles in particular department heads are on Pace to make sure that they're aligned with their budgets according to the Golden Girls so the budget office and along with the Grant Management office we are continually in communication with the principals throughout the year and that is part of what the budget analyst do is they kind of like see how the spending is going and upfront they see how they can

[00:34:00]
what's the best help them to meet their their goals that they want for their specific school and throughout the year we are giving them guidance and as much as we can you know up front the instructional council's the associate superintendents and the principals are the ones that kind of decide how to how to use their at risk funds mainly to be to have fulfill the programs that they want to continue with cuz they know what the priority is for their particular school and so we just that's the start of it and it happens you know in February is when we have the we sent out the budget call templates and February 15th I believe and then we did the budget workshops with the you know we have some for the new principals we have different workshops and and office hours

[00:35:00]
can we have them February 20th through the 23rd I believe and so that's like where we do the initial start and then we just work through with them throughout the years and I mean throughout the year they're in constant contact with them and if one thing one big thing that happens is a lot of times they want to hire somebody and there's a vacancy that they can't feel so at a certain point you know that we start telling more do you think you're going to fill it do you want to use the funds in a different way and so we start that process is ongoing throughout the year I hope that answered your question someone I guess it's more related just to ensure that we're using new strategies and techniques to ensure proper communication that we're not repeating the same behavior because we've had this system in place years past and we saw that there was a disconnect there with the information being received just ensuring that

[00:36:00]
we are evolving and we're trying new techniques and communicating in multiple different ways to make sure we don't have disconnects from what we discussed here in the boardroom to the schools one big thing that we did do that we implemented or were going to implement I should say in the future is when we were working with the IRS they helped us to put a booklet together of all the funding you know how it's funded so there's no surprises as like to you know if you're enrollment is going down in this area this if this is enrollment based in the formula that you know that you're probably going to have some decreases in there and it's kind of like a one book that has all the different types of fundings and how they're they should be allocated out and I think that's one new thing that is happening that you are is really helped us with thank you remember for next year I like to see as I begin my tenure is

[00:37:00]
having the schools all have a budget defense with the assistant superintendent and the chief of schools where they and their instructional Council chair what present the budget at that time almost like what we're doing a bit how their school budget was prepared to match the goals of the school and so I'd really like to implement that next year and so it can Cascade kind of from the work we're doing to build the budget as a whole to how the school is building their individual budgets aligned to the goals and guardrails for their school Bingo thank you thank you so I had a question around quality of instructions so essentially strategic Priority One and Two and the question is where and how does the budget prioritize improving the quality of instruction in the areas of our goals

[00:38:00]
so sorry we were talking on this site board president one of the areas that we are really trying to align is in looking at of course the instructional materials that you've seen come through the budget and aligning all of the professional development to that work as well so a lot of the focus on making sure that instruction is being implemented is based also in the 92% of the operational budget that some people so if we don't have people delivering the instructions and we won't get very far and so how were able to really strategize around the professional development that's embedded for teachers as well as making sure that we were lucky enough to catch up on a lot of instructional materials that have been neglected for a long time and that's a huge step and something that we're not used to being

[00:39:00]
able to actually be caught up on instructional materials being used in the classrooms thank you for that member Jackson thank you my question falls in the line of the federal grants state and local grants I know that many departments have issue with getting payouts done immediately can you at least explain to me what some of those obstacles could be and can we improve that for some of our department

[00:40:00]
related for a department applies for those grants and for example Indian education they apply for that and and then the money is then one they initiated through their application and then one is it determined by the state and how long do they wait for their payout from that particular Grant from when they start the school year and the timeline access Grand budget is at this point in time after drinking around 45 to 60 days depending on the time we received notification of the grand award this is due to the fact of the mandatory timeline and requirement that both

[00:41:00]
is obtained prior to any fund being allowed to be encumbered or spent we have a strategy in mind to address it and shorten the timeline into the next fiscal year I have successfully opened the discussion with our Board office and we will We would like to consider bringing budget adjustments so the Action Memo that leads to access to budget Authority in front of you on Facebook speeding the average the average time of accessing that budget thank you thank you for the reminder

[00:42:00]
okay so thank you my next question kind of Builds on the question from president Gonzalez she asked about the quality of instruction and I'm going to ask about the quantity of the quality instruction excuse me in the February 2020 for presentation that we gave to the community the pie chart of operational said that 66 percent of our budget goes to direct instruction and so to me direct instruction is goal one goal to like that's where the heart and the meat of what we're trying to accomplish really meet the rubber meets the road so I guess my very direct question is if 66 percent of last year's budget went to direct instruction did we increase that was there a strategy to increase direct direct instruction did we go up at

[00:43:00]
board member Jackson the amount of direct instruction is usually any school-based staff so it's a mixed question because that question is harder than your first question because if we go down and enrollment then we need less staff so if it's even at the same or below the 66% it's based on the number of students that we have in the upcoming school year than it is based on the percents of like a budget allocation to that particular area cuz it's all in personnel which is all in direct instruction but the if we have a loss of students then we need less personal in that area where is the department we the Departments and all the other

[00:44:00]
have remained the same the first place that is hit by loss of enrollment is in that percent of direct instruction I know I have a follow-up but let me formulate it okay membership Justice and I was wondering if you can point me in the direction of where restorative justice is in the budget how much is allocated and what that strategy is to implement it within schools and I know we had mentioned that were hiring or a sort of Justice coordinator so kind of just all of that you can give me some more information on what that looks like most of the money allocated for rest of practices is in the federal dollars for student support service departments as well as operational dollars in the police department

[00:45:00]
have we looked to hire a coordinator yet we are actually taking a more what's the word I'm looking for comprehensive approach to our restorative practices work and embedding it through multiple departments in the school climate team so as far as it will fill that position I think that's something we want to determine as we look at how we make that actually more foundational through the funding that's allocated to it and just to go off of that what the funny that's allocated to sort of justice is that going towards the Departments or two individual schools to continue that work

[00:46:00]
turn my perspective I think it's going primarily to the Departments to support the work in the schools but that is part of the more comprehensive approach and the how we interweave it into the work that directly impacts the classroom thank you thank you remember Domingos and board president's office instructions plan to address the professional development aspect of quality instruction

[00:47:00]
don't know in the budget particularly if there's money allocated towards professional development as a large comprehensive amount a lot of the professional development money goes into the school budget where they set aside money for professional development and that would be the expenditure again aligned to the holes and guardrails so as they look to expand professional development funds within their budget the expectation is aligning the expenditure to the goals and guardrails that then would be monitored as far as if we are seeing an increase in student outcomes those would be monitored as part of our progress monitoring there's several factors of course that will see as we progress in raising student achievement but we would make assumptions that the

[00:48:00]
budget is connected to seeing the increase in student outcomes okay so just to clarify then so just forgive me if I use a different vocabulary but is it sounds more like a site based budgeting process them regarding professional development most most professional development is professional development as a whole is in various areas of the department so it's a line item in a multitude of budgets where they have money set aside for professional development connected to the budget so each department budget could have professional development money attached to it as does each school has professional development money that they put into that account as a line item in their over

[00:49:00]
call Budget and I get so I guess I'm trying to get it an image of how all that gets aligned so that were we all have the same framework I guess so I think that I'm looking at looking at next year it goes back to kind of what Romero was asking about the school's developing their budget so ideally the school as a their budget and they set aside money in professional development as they defend their budget and create it within their instructional Council they would have a plan as to why they put money in professional development and I would say just in my experience previously and working in the schools most of them it was something specific so when you like secretary Historia was asking about restorative practices there could be schools and I know there are schools that put aside money in professional

[00:50:00]
apartment for restorative practices that are aligned to the larger scale of the goals in guardrails so as they prepare their budgets they're putting money the schools are putting money in professional development for something in their mind that their instructional council is using to meet the goals and guard girls that makes sense of my conversations with community members parents constituents it always comes up it's always a topic of how concerned the community is with the mental health of our youth you know this is nothing new and so my question is pertinent and so how are counseling Mental Health Services another student Support Services in the budget and are there Provisions for increasing access to these services to improve the overall student well-being and performance

[00:51:00]
hey we are looking for Annette thank you for that question and as far as putting money for counseling and those type of services those do fall under the students supports department and they do have some counselors that have been funded and also they use Contract Services we do contract with many outside counselors that do come into the schools to provide services and then are able to work with the families so that might be a question I'm not sure if it's there or

[00:52:00]
perhaps Vicky Pryce I'm here thank you madam president members of the board besides our counselors that we do fun in schools and we do have counselors and all of our schools we do have Community Mental Health Providers and those we have multiple agencies that we utilize in our schools they're referred through the health and wellness teams students are referred to our community mental health providers through the health and wellness teams we also have school base health centers on several of our campuses that can provide both physical and mental and Behavioral Health Services to students on those campuses and we do them to have extended hours when needed to serve

[00:53:00]
school students from other schools in the so if it's like an elementary it would be a school-based health center that serves Elementary so we do have multiple we're in the same boat though just so you know that everyone else is there aren't still the number of providers out there that are needed so one of the good things is that Vicky price is a senior director of counseling is now teaching some classes at the University and recruiting counselors for APS and we have we're working on multiple agreements to try to get more internships in the school system so that the people that are going into those fields can't see what it's like to actually work in a school system so every opportunity we have to increase the number of mental health and behavioral health support for students we are doing that at this point in time

[00:54:00]
remember benavidez I was just add to Dr Muir's comments that we also look at an Acuity model for how we place our counselors as well as our nurses in our school and so that does take into account some of the mental health needs that we're seeing come from the community in the school and so that helps us to determine especially when we have limited resources where to put those resources thank you thank you thank you thank you so it's a piggyback to my first question so last year I remember when you all when each school had to display their budget we had a significant increase on the pie chart for other that didn't necessarily aligned to the goals because a lot of the principals didn't know where to put it do we anticipate that other amount decreasing significantly significantly or is that still going to be a concerned that it's not going to be plugged into one of the goals

[00:55:00]
board member Tapia Romero I would say that it will decrease as the schools are now becoming much more familiar with the goals so it decreases based on their familiarity and also with the school teams working with the principals on how they're meeting the goals I think they start to be a little bit more strategic about it rather than the approach I think the first year is more of you build it or they build it as they usually do and then they try to fill in where the goals match and now the especially after this year in when we get data back we can start to really see where it is it that they have to leverage their work and then they can start adjusting budget so I would suspect you would start seeing less other as they start to realize the connection to the goals and more importantly they see what they need to drive in their school to leverage that as well right and I I

[00:56:00]
because I just want to ensure that upper level that it's it's not like we're being told what what we're asking in terms of the goals and guardrails but seeing what the reality May tend to be in the schools could be different so I just want to ensure that everything is aligned properly and that we don't have any further breakdowns of communication or different interpretations of what the message should be I would say moving forward into next year that will be much tighter as we work with the principals on developing their the budget that they have how they create it for the year so working with schools at the beginning of the year just like I said with departments how do you intend to use all of this money and how would you adapt it as you start looking at your data as well and starting to think of other more as the enabling conditions we talked about in our strategic plan so other I think when they're just like oh it's other it's other it's actually like the enabling

[00:57:00]
in that maybe helps into driving the goal rather than trying to figure out like let's just put 10% of the one that that's a first grade teacher but how they actually start to use it to change the way that they're allocating their resources thank you board member Romero Madam president board members superintendent Blakey I just wanted to add that we are looking into the possibility of our existing Financial system to see when a school or Department puts in their reposition for a purchase and they're being built where they can identify which goal or guard rail it is supporting and is it goes through the workflow and the approvers then the approvers can also see that and if they don't see alignment they can go back and ask them about it so we've been working with our current Prov

[00:58:00]
to see if we can add that to our existing system and then hopefully to our new system also that's great thank you thank you remember don't worry too yes my questions can you tell me based on federal if a child has a disability and Native child or any child with a disability that a portion of that money is returned to that child with the disabilities could you give me that percentage or portion of that amount by any chance

[00:59:00]
that's fine I'm just throwing that I can ask that in a general question then to the staff so will if you could just email the question will make sure that it gets here did you have another question that you wanted to go ahead and go I'm okay ready to call she's ready to call so do you have a question about professional development days and it's just a refresher if you could just remind me like how get in our collective bargaining contract how many days of PD does the district determine or control versus what's determined or controlled at the school site levels like a baseball game over here

[01:00:00]
6 days right now thank you for your time that is a technical question we can certainly provide the PD memo that breaks that out for you in detail but certainly there's six days now and it's six out of how many total well there's six total days to 6:30 but we need to check the specifics on how many days are for site-based versus that's great and then my question just sort of in response Dr Blakey to your comments around expenditures I'm curious about like what Roi measures might you use

[01:01:00]
Play Future to do that so how will you know like are you going to be looking at cost per student or like what are my measures will you use to ensure that the budget demonstrates Effectiveness when it comes to student outcomes so one of the alignment measures is making sure that it's aligned to the work of curriculum and instruction so the academic team particularly that's part of the work of the federal and state programs that were not just picking something that somebody spending money cuz they have to buy something quickly but they can go through the academic office to make sure that it's aligned to the goals and the guard rails whether that be something specific as making sure that it's high quality instructional materials or making sure that it's not you know something that they just need to spend money and we realize we already have that or we have used it and it doesn't have a good return on investment or we can give

[01:02:00]
Sam ideas of items that do have good return on investment if they if they look at their 90-day plan for example and see what it is that they're trying to leverage and aligning that work in the department particularly in the academic side is going to be really helpful and making sure that schools also feel supported that they're getting guidance around what the expenditures are for as well so it's just kind of like a vetting process to make sure we're supporting the schools as well to see if they're you know purchasing something that we already have or that we used to have and there's a reason we don't have it anymore and so we just need to keep a little bit better I on it thank you so we have gone down the line a couple of times now so just wanted to open it up broadly to see if anyone else has any additional questions just I wanted to clarify vacation in your answer

[01:03:00]
two for president Gonzalez several minutes ago you made the comment that we are caught up with instructional materials what does that mean board member Dominguez so as we have instructional materials were on a cycle and we were not funded like a lot of times the state would put it on hold for a year or we would have to put it on hold for you because of budget we didn't have enough money to fully fund adoption of the materials so because of a lot of the Esser dollars we were able to catch up on that cycle so there's always been the cycle of instructional materials but it's never been fully funded whether it's internally we didn't have money to keep it going or the state put it on hold this is really helped us and I have to you know

[01:04:00]
spell commands the work of the district with using Esser funds in this way to catch up because you'll see districts across the country having these huge deficits because they put so much money into people and we knew ahead of time like we need to do it all on what is it that we can use money for that will not be recurring funds and because of that we're in a very different position than a lot of our colleagues across the country because we were able to catch up on things like instructional materials or Heating and Cooling and all these one-time costs that we were able to catch up on that didn't impact a cut that a lot of districts have had to do so that begs the question then ask her gone we can go back to I mean we have a system that

[01:05:00]
wasn't fully fund instructional materials or the cycle is that correct so we're caught up for now but yes anticipation would be that we could possibly get into a cycle of not being able to fund it in the next 4 to 6 years and that's a problem at the state the state releasing money is that correct or allocating are there other questions I had one just quick follow up first thank you for the work that you did with the questions I submitted beforehand and this goes with the family index question that I had before and just wondering if it would be effective or if you recommend schools looking for outside grants to fulfill some of that money that they might lose within the next school years

[01:06:00]
phone number astorga that is a very good question we are the grand allocation seems to be fluctuating quite a lot from year to year and the formulas are not necessarily consistent so they tend to tweak is therefore schools fall off the allocation grid from year to year and we are exploring different approaches I believe one of the approaches that were considering is having the schools have almost like an ongoing wish list because we have grants that sometimes come very late in the fiscal year so if there is a plan or a consideration of how would we spend if we would have the funding at that point in time we can better

[01:07:00]
boarding schools to spend their their late allocations timely and an address also the the grand deficiencies because grants are called soft money for a reason for that is their capacity for your office to hold money that but that's a principal might find somewhere else to local Grant's that are not like government or PD grants but like organizational yes we have the capacity of being the financial agent for most of funding weather through the Grand office or activities office or the budget slash accounting office and if if none of those meet the needs of the district we pull in the Albuquerque Public Schools

[01:08:00]
Haitian and they can step in for pretty much everything we cannot cover thank you so much are there any other questions I I might be the lone wolf on this but I get really uncomfortable with discussions of saying what we just need to find more funding especially when we have a document in front of us that demonstrates the amounts of funds that have gone and so I think my question is is in regards to their being evidence that the guardrails are being on Earth because I do not feel as though too is being honored right now especially with the amount of unspent funds and I don't believe another strategy that was

[01:09:00]
displayed in here was well we'll just look for increase public school funding as a strategy to to address the budget and but we have enrollment down our budget didn't change and we have funds so how can you assure me that the guardrails are being honored when we haven't honored the budget that we have officially board member Courtney that is a great question I think some of the issues that we have seen in the last few years for unspent funds like in the title one and any other Grant funds was kind of increased by the funding that we received from Esser because that gave a huge infusion

[01:10:00]
is sr3 on its own is 242 million and so like everyone put their focus on spending those Esser funds down when we have sr12 and 3 and so I think it kind of skewed why we have so many unspent funds and other grant funding I think that you're going to see a shift in that starting next year you're going to see that the spending of all grant funding is fully spent or close to being spent because you know when you just start giving so many so much funds in a certain time and you have only certain you know each Federal they have specific things that they can spend it on so that also Narrows your spending right and if there's multiple Grant funds that are all asking you to spend on the same particular things

[01:11:00]
you're going to have some unspent fun so I think you're going to really see a shift in that I appreciate you saying that but my question isn't just about grants I mean the the fiscal year 21st school budget was $675 million the fiscal year school budget for 25 with $676 so it didn't it essentially remained flat and it said the only difference is because there were salary increases but we have enrollment going down so in one in one sense you're staying will we just need more money from the legislature but I mean we're diverging right we're diverging and it seems like all we're doing is playing this shell game where we're just moving funds around so that we attain a balanced budget and I guess I'm I I'm looking for more assurances besides just grant funding I mean I appreciate you saying that but we have

[01:12:00]
5 guardrails are they are they being honored in this budget of board member Jackson I think that the indication of Sr was a bit of a constraint the the state funding what happens a lot with unspent funds is because of the string so to say that are attached to use of funds so in the state budget the more we can get of unrestricted funds that would be above the line would help him being able to spend money more efficiently so overall like looking at the operational budget that the grants I think are very impacted by Sr because we were so worried about leaving money on the table for Esser or carry over we could do up to 15% but the operational dollars the more that we're able to get money that's unrestricted above the line

[01:13:00]
the more it's you'll see it being spent then the restrictions of money that come in below the line and if I may say we do a very good job of spending the unrestricted funds there's never been an issue with spending those funds everybody you know there is no strings attached so those are very easy to go to and we actually have to remind people of their grant funding because they it's the easy route to just spend the unrestricted so we have a billion dollar budget of unrestricted and I will tell you that we will probably spend all of that okay we actually have for example we received in The Breakfast Club year Sr funding specifically for

[01:14:00]
special education and we brought it to your attention for approval that funding we were communicated that it expires 9:30 2024 at that point in time we looked into the idea B funding which was perfectly aligned with that passive special educational education and we consulted with our partners at PD and we asked if we leave a lot of special education funding on the table at that particular time in order to ensure that we spend down answered us that we will so at that end of the year we spend as much as we could we contracted as much as we could to meet the needs of the students you do know that providers for such type of services are limited but we've spent that as a special education down to the set

[01:15:00]
if you look into a different brand it is what it is you were mentioning in today's questions the Indian education funding it's good for the program to do its best to maximize the efficiency of the funding but there might be schools that don't have that type of students at that point in time they cannot access that money even if they want to so looking at from a I'm not going to say it's more like from an efficiency perspective which he mentioned that we're going to I think that is the right direction to go looking at what does the school need what are those students in those schools and looking for all the funding maybe we want to push

[01:16:00]
finding more to a certain school and because they might not have access to XYZ type of funding due to the type of students and when I say type I say overall type of students that they have that generates that their funding formulas thank you all right are there any other questions from board members that we have is that we will know that it's time to pursue adoption of the budget when the majority of board members voice in the negative on the following questions and so I'm just going to sort of I don't know how you voice in the negative but are there any board members who have evidence that the budget does not address accomplishment of gold one two three or four

[01:17:00]
are there any board members who have evidence that the budget violates guardrail 1:23 or 4 I know we have concerns we have concerns and I will say that I share those concerns I think it is difficult to with the information that we have now and knowing where we're headed and being in this transition point it's difficult to say and to provide evidence that there is violation of the goals or guardrails I think we're hearing a lot of the right answers but they're still questions and concerns so I think from my perspective that perspective that's addressed by the assurances that you'll be tracking expenditures that you'll be looking at Roi measures that you'll be looking at the spend down of funds and so I think two as we think about the rewriting of guardrail 2.3 which is the one around and spent funds that were just mindful of these

[01:18:00]
so is there anyone with evidence that the budget does not address the goals of the budget does not address the guardrails or sorry violates the guardrails so concerns but no evidence so the board can proceed with budget adoption and just to reiterate the budget adoption oh my goodness my computer literally just signed out hold on I have another document open the word not on whether board members like the budget agree with the budget or have items in the budget that they want and also budget adoption should be all or nothing board members should not try to line item veto the budget so with that in mind is there a motion to approve the budget include the

[01:19:00]
Charter Schools as well yes emotion for approval of the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 25 including Charter Schools I will move I will move for approval of the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 2025 including the charter schools budget and a second this is Heather thank you so we have a motion for member top your Romero and a second from Member Benavides this King can we have a roll call the police so the motion carries with that we are at the end of our meeting and the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday June 5th 2024 at 5:00 p.m. here at the

[01:20:00]
tell us some Bruce King educational complex and our special Board of Education meeting the next will be Wednesday June 26th at 8:05 a.m. or immediately following the finance committee virtually so with that this meeting is adjourned
