Lorenzo Garcia Yolanda Montoya Cordova Peterson Candelaria Patterson I'd like to emotion to adopt a September 19th 2018 Board of Education meeting agenda and approval of September 5th for Education meeting minutes and also we have had a request to move items 766 off the kitchen

[00:10:00]
scholarship award recipient and spent 5 months in New Zealand examining the integration of indigenous pedagogy and curriculum and diverse classrooms for underserved student populations she's going to share a brief presentation about her experiences with us so miss short would you please come to the podium imagine yourself Rings is seen as an asset and not a hurdle this is what I was imagining as I said out on a 5 months about New Zealand as a Fulbright teacher with a focus on creating culturally responsive pedagogy and curriculum New Zealand maybe halfway around the globe but there are many similarities between New Zealand and New Mexico

[00:11:00]
both have deep-rooted cultures the story of colonization and both are multilingual so I went to New Zealand to try to answer these two questions what does a culturally rich and responsive indigenous education and pedagogy look like and how do non-indigenous teachers best serve indigenous students so I would like to tell just a few stories from my travels that I believe will explain how I found a few answers to these questions first Community was important in New Zealand schools often schools have a variety of community members working with them it was common to see a mom with her baby or toddler at the school helping out in the picture at the top you can see a grandma is helping a kid roll across the playground in a plastic barrel I also had the opportunity to attend an event called tough guys and gals

[00:12:00]
to set the stage this was a cold fall day I was wearing hat gloves and winter coat and the school event had students of all ages running through the mud under brush tires climbing over walls through barbed wire what was so impressive is that students worked as a team this wasn't about winning but it was about helping your schoolmates finish the race in one picture you'll notice the girl is turned looking back she's checking on her classmates to see if they're okay in another picture you'll see a girl on the bank she's too scared to cross so one of her schoolmates goes back and helps her across the cold water filled with eels the strong sense of community in New Zealand's culturally responsibility of the school was the Hub of the community and everyone was responsible for

[00:13:00]
everyone else additionally it was just so refreshing to see kids being kids which brings me to my next theme risk-taking students were encouraged to take risks they were allowed to fail they were allowed to take ownership in their learning pictured here you see a learning through Play Station for kindergarteners this was complete with a real pliers and screwdriver the teachers were unafraid of injury they wanted their kids to explore and develop in the next picture students are experimenting with a paper propeller for Science and they're standing on their desks to do so pictured below that our students at recess enjoying climbing in an old tree and lastly this discussion topics from elementary parent teacher student conferences that focused on student learning and taking ownership I wonder how have we gotten so far

[00:14:00]
play from this in New Mexico education what can we do to move our education system back to embracing risk-taking and learning through failure instead of deficit model thinking lastly these pictures are from a rural School visit the students at the school total 25 the teachers were hard-working and knowledgeable and they came from their community and worked with their Community when Outsiders from the Ministry of Education came to offer help the teachers would tell them that they didn't need any help everything was fine even though this was one of the highest poverty schools that I visited the teacher's knew that the ministry had his own idea of what help look like they knew that the ministry didn't see how rich the people of this community were the people didn't have big paychecks but they worked off the land and own their own homes and they would come to the school to

[00:15:00]
how about we needed when I was there uncles and dads were helping students perform a hungry which is a traditional meal of vegetables and meat roasted in the ground culturally responsive education comes from the community and it seized the community as a rich asset it doesn't measure the deficits of children and their families so I asked you again to think about the fourth grade you what kind of education would you like to have one more deficits are exploited or one more diversity is an asset are you willing to help work for change and I have a little time if there are any questions thank you

our final recognition will be introduced by the executive director of the student parent and employee service center Shelly green thank you secretary Montoya Cordova members of the board superintendent reading tonight we have the honor of recognizing an exemplary Department the student parent and employee service center addresses questions concerns and complaints from students parents families employees and community members some of our topics include General District information parking lots conferences HVAC transfers grades boundaries custody issues GED homeschooling schedule changes student discipline or not student discipline policies procedural directives CYFD information and volunteers to name a few sometimes we also receive some very interesting calls

[00:34:00]
when we had snow predicted but there was no no snow on the ground there was no snow falling we had one of our high schools whose students decided maybe if they started calling the district during their lunch hour we might cancel school so that day we got about 25 calls from various students all from the same High School occasionally we receive calls for the Atlanta Public Schools Alamogordo Public Schools Arizona Public Service about 4,700 students have been placed in their school of choice so that takes up quite a bit of time the service center also oversees

[00:35:00]
strict discipline hearings and those are run about $450 per year and in the midst of all this hard work and our service focused conversations we also have some very memorable calls that are very touching we have one call that will always stand out to me a third grader third grader called us on his own because he was concerned that the lunch detention he had been assigned at school was going to affect his opportunity to go to college

[00:36:00]
Marcella Jones administrator drill knew he was one of our administrators also could not be here this evening many of you I think no doctor knew she's been serving the district for I think close to 50 years Paul pickerel specialist Tina Richardson are you hearing officer and John Rodriguez our student transfer secretary with the family and friends of these exemplary

[00:37:00]
group of people that are as dedicated as these folks are let's show our appreciation for this group

[00:38:00]
what's the weather of Education or just see how the Board of Education operates we want you to know that you are welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the

[00:39:00]
King and public forum upon signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting there are I forgot to look at that there are eight speakers therefore to accommodate the greatest number speakers each speaker has two minutes for comments within the 30-minute public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you're always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with in the 30-minute public forum the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to the board members comments before we adjourn and only at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so the first

[00:40:00]
I'm going to call up the first three speakers you guys just line up here at the podium Franklin Ghana Strada Patel and Janet Sayers Elementary School I've been there since 2010 I want to know why enrollment is dropping and then picking up and then dropping again there's a there's a lot of reasons for this at the lowest point Montezuma I think had like 140 in enrollment of students this was in I think

[00:41:00]
18 2016 at the end of 2016 we lost about 22 teachers and then it Rose back up again and now we're in 2018 and the enrollment is 400 we've gone through 7 Administration from my time when I got there in 2010 to current I think it's because of the way that teachers are evaluated through the state of New Mexico and we're losing nationally board certified teachers by the droves not not specifically in that location but that location is hit it hard it's because your disconnect to the building's both board members and superintendents and the trainings that you put

[00:42:00]
your principles through I think I saw my principal today for maybe 5 minutes before he had to go off in the afternoon for training they're not there to to to to to to to to to to support a building they're constantly at trainings so you're losing experienced administrators to not administrative work you have to figure this out and quickly you're losing your your teachers to other states to create its own stand

[00:43:00]
phone Police Department school security is an important issue all across the country and especially including Albuquerque Public Schools but this is not the solution the creation the creation of a stand-alone Police Department would make schools safer for students of color or for any student for that matter the aps had released data a few years ago around the on different districts on the number of suspension expulsions and referrals for police which showed that Native Americans students African-American students and Latino students were just just proportionately impacted and referred for rest in schools in this district and these are my friends these are people that are like my brothers and my sisters these are people that I know right they would just I grew up with people with students disappearing right and I wouldn't see them for a few years right they pop back up and they would tell me horror stories they would tell me that they're they're pushed into the margins this Police Department is not

[00:44:00]
listen to help keep students in school to help students have support in school right creating this will further marginalize students who are already targeted as this report showed they are further targeted and it will push them specially students of color into the school to prison pipeline when their students are safest when they're in a supportive environment there are many other options for you guys to look into to create that environment this includes having professionals who know how to intervene student crisis who are trained and restorative justice practices right APS schools work to align and train their current school police into these practices and focus on advocating for resources for more social workers for more counselors for change mental health workers instead of more police right are schools need support and they need people to feel safe these two institutions don't have a need to be under the same head right we have a need for more students

[00:45:00]
and I really encourage you guys to vote no on this resolution thank you same staff of APs yes I'm bringing another report about Del Norte High School and Hudson Elementary to 45 minutes because I know there are times when there are many many because I was not aware there was a new principal at Cleveland and I was able to make a quick connection with them outside so that was good I wanted to report that on Friday night September the 7th we have a fundraiser

[00:46:00]
call Del Norte scholarships it was the Ballet Folklorico which were students who had been at Del Norte in the 80s 90s and 2000s and we were able to raise well they were the dancers and they were able to raise a 2,600 so we're well on our way to our scholarship goals lastly Hodgen yes we'll celebrate 60 years on Saturday and I believe board member Garcia is able to come and board member Mueller airgun possibly and everyone is very much invited we're looking forward to hearing from Rose Dixon who was a long time in principal she's going to be one of our speakers Ron Angel whose mother was very first principal in a Barrack school on the grounds of Bel-Air from 19

[00:47:00]
56 on and then hodgin opened in 1958 where we also have some new partners with the Evangel Church they're helping us with refreshments and the Hodges neighborhood association is doing some things and very quickly this is my report card from Bel Air that my teacher signed in 1958 that sent me on to hodgin as a fifth grader and I will share some Choice comments that she made about my study habits at a later time thank you the next three speakers Zachary Ford Emma Jones and Jeremy

[00:48:00]
Madam Secretary president Percy members of the board my name is Zack force on the president of the Mexico Shooting Sports Association we are the state affiliate of the NRA for New Mexico but I'm here today to speak about the school safety resolution and I want to begin by saying you know I support most of the items in this resolution school safety is a very pressing issue right now in fact just today in Albuquerque there was a bomb threat made a CNM Montoya campus so I wonder I want to thank you for addressing the issue with this resolution for school safety but there is some specific language in the resolution I want to bring to your attention that I do not believe would be an effective measure to make her school safer that language specifically is related to what is known as universal background checks on this exact law that this school safety resolution supports was introduced in the Mexico legislature in 2017 however the Mexico Sheriff's Association in 2017 signed a letter which had this to say about that law this proposed gun control law would not stop

[00:49:00]
will not stop criminals from getting their guns from other criminal Associates as they already do these bills are literally unenforceable by law enforcement now this law that that the school safety resolution supports Universal background checks was implemented in the state of Colorado in 2013 a recent study done by John Hopkins University Center for Public Health about the Colorado's implementation of law found that there was no there's no impact on crime or even the number of background checks performed as a result of this law passing the attributed that result to non-compliance with the law which is exactly what our Sheriff's predicted so I'd encourage you to pass this resolution but striking the language supporting Universal background checks thank you for your time for president Piercy members of the board thank you for having me today my name is Emma Jones of New Mexico I'm a long time member of the family

[00:50:00]
time for Education we helped write the family engagement policy which board member Peterson was also a part of helping to write I'm here today in opposition of the proposed Standalone Police Department resolution that is on specifically because as a member of families in education and who's been actively involved in helping to write that that language I do not believe that the four elements of the family engagement policy will be pulled it if we will try to create a synonym for Police Department specifically the first one is fostering safe environments I do not believe in my heart of hearts that all students feel safe with more police officers on school campuses particularly young people of color inside of our community and particularly families who are undocumented and mixed status they would feel a lot more comfortable coming on school campus and engaging in any kind of familiar way both of the student and as a parent if they're not sure if they're going to be arrested or targeted by police while they're on campus

[00:51:00]
Reginald Chavez Elementary School this year I had a problem he has a disability he has irritable bowel syndrome and the police had to forcefully remove him from restroom for taking too long as a parent it was not only a nightmare for me it was a nightmare for my child and I know for a fact that it makes a very hostile working environment for him as a young person and makes me feel really uncomfortable wanted to come come to the school when I know that our schools are over police pushing the students into the school to prison Pipeline and not creating safe and spaces for our family and for our community to engage in so I please urge you to really think about this and think about what are the impacts on our families and really if you would like to consider allowing for Republic on the process I know there has they was talks about having a forum on school safety and I don't believe that that's happening yet so before voting on this I would respectfully ask that you look into having dialogue more with the community about what other Alternatives and solutions to school safety

[00:52:00]
is it supposed to creating a standalone Police Department thank you very much Jeremy Gillette of the school safety resolution like I support the majority of that school safety resolution but I would ask that you should strike the verbiage for Universal background checks from that and if we're looking at a school safety standpoint the universal background checks will create a polarizing political debate that I don't feel is in the best interest of our students or the members of the board I think they're resolutions their things that we can look to other states Ohio and Colorado things that they have in place to increase the level of Safety and Security that those school children have that we can look at possibly adopting within the current construction of the laws that we already have in place

[00:53:00]
and I know New Mexico Shooting Sports Association as well as myself and other other you know personal safety instructors or Firearms instructors would love to have a conversation with the school board on what we can do to to actually save lives when we're looking at school safety resolution the universal background checks I'm inclined to believe that that verbiage is in there for the unlikely tragic event of an active shooter at one of our schools right or school age children can't pass background checks as it is so we're looking at an adult actor so some things that we could put in place with the laws that are currently on the books it would not inflate the budget or the financial requirements of Albuquerque Public Schools that we have seen be successful in Colorado for example in Ohio for example some states that have some great training requirements and programs in place to make our grocery list

[00:54:00]
Isaiah Moya and Isabella Baker my name is the leadership coordinator for together for brothers Brothers

[00:55:00]
young men of color are disproportionately negatively impacted by disciplined by discipline policies and law enforcement in and out of schools young men of color are criminalized by truancy and classroom Behavior policies especially zero-tolerance policies undocumented immigrant Refugee families and other families of color especially Native Americans are also intimidated by law enforcement in school and the community possibly even including their participation together for brothers stands with our Community Partners against the resolution or request that request to have APS develop their own official police force we are GPS to reconsider a police force and instead invest in restorative justice policies and practices and other preventative strategies that value students and their families as part of the solution and partners in making

[00:56:00]
in making all of our schools safe spaces young men of color are can and should be leaders at all levels of the in their communities and the official APS police force doesn't help us to achieve our goals of healthy and successful lives for young men of color and their families so yeah we strongly asked you guys to reconsider and look into other ways to help students instead of look for alternative to a police force thank you my name is Isabella Baker which I'm sure most of you know and I'm here today to ask you to vote no to the resolution supporting the creation of a standalone Police Department give him a recent lawsuit against the state of New Mexico

[00:57:00]
Play Ozzy and Martinez family it was proven and the Court ruled that New Mexico schools are struggling to provide a quality education for all students and schools are greatly under resourced and underfunded at this time APS is the largest school district in the state and should not prioritize resources including funding time and energy to creating its own police department but instead should be focusing on working to close the achievement Gap and providing quality education that our students are being deprived of but greatly deserve the district is so underfunded that schools like basic basic needs such as counselors social workers small class sizes drinkable water and other basic services that are students have voice to us and have been proven to and those services are proven to improve Student Success the district should focus on having resources necessary to educate our children and not creating a police department students that I work with

[00:58:00]
can you name to many other options for school safety that don't criminalize them and better positively affect them and their education such as more school counselors social workers were sort of Justice practices and self-care slash mental health rooms APS is in the business of educating students and use not running a police department thank you thank you thank you for your input that concludes the public forum thank you we're going to superintendent reading thank you president piercey board members community members and staff the students at Hawthorne Elementary School are doing something different with their announcements each day and I'm going to join them next week because it looks like so much fun they're creating video announcements as a newscast called Dragon news so let's check out a recent Dragon news

[01:12:00]
what is the motion in all second term motion OK Google

[01:13:00]
we have several resolutions and what I want to do is I want to go through each one separately will vote on each one separately even though it doesn't say we're going to do that separately and so I think we all have let me go in the order they were in our packet see if I can get to that order here and I do hope that everybody who spoke here will be able to stay around and listen I think you may hear a little bit more about what some of these resolutions mean and hopefully they they made clarify some issues that you have brought up cuz I think sometimes we don't understand all of the things that we're trying to do here

[01:14:00]
so the first one here is is the resolution for funding on a instructional materials that's what we have in our bank first is that everybody got that are there any comments on this particular resolution any possible changes any thoughts on it on the 123455 textbooks

[01:15:00]
I think we're missing and is right after or and or is no longer able to purchase the proof textbooks right and then take out the b does that sound yes okay and then on the next on the next wear as where it says it demand for instructional materials does not decline now nor the cost of the materials decreased that cost keep going up but the demand for instructional materials when did declining based on enrollment though just a question and then when you're talking about on the first now there for

[01:16:00]
repeat result when you're talking about the New Mexico that sufficiency levels needed to equitably fund instructional materials as per New Mexico law so what what are you referring to there the New Mexico instructional materials law okay and then I'm just like equitably fund I just don't know if that's like part of the lawsuit that's already been like already been settled are you talking about something separate from Equitable funding so I think it's a reference to sufficiency in terms of instructional materials but more because the instructional materials said in an allocation for students and if the state distribution is underfunded then the result is an equitable because schools use or not use their

[01:17:00]
inspirational or supplemental funding to cover it then so it kind of results in inequitable situation then what I would just do though Heather is on the New Mexico law I would just add in the New Mexico instructional materials law just in there then that way we know that that's what we're talking about and we're not thank you and so the recognition is the instructional materials are separate from operational

[01:18:00]
the point of reference is actually the State Constitution which calls for sufficient adequate funding and I think that's what we're trying to acknowledge whether or not the state has decided to not do that is their decision unfortunately we have to deal with what we have or receive and so I believe that you know we have to ask for sufficient funding for instructional materials do we have a motion to approve this resolution and again Heather feel

[01:19:00]
Community Schools I would like to make one comment and that is that and I think some others have made this too is that Senator Bill Tallman when I talked to him just briefly he said I would love to sponsor this is a bill in the legislature so we may be able to work with him and maybe another person on the other side of the of the of the Republican and get a bipartisan and that would help I think a lot of other districts as well the other districts that are working on Community Schools as well so just a little background resolution in the legislature or some other people that would support us in this I think it's important because otherwise it doesn't go anywhere you know we don't get any funding just because we have a resolution so just a little back

[01:20:00]
so anybody have any comments on this and I do have one comment but go ahead yes and it's not it's a comment and related to your your point about legislation around Community Schools I believe there was something that was passed around Community Schools that just basically stated that and I can't remember the year because it occurred while I was at the Department of Health but there was some legislation that put into place or describe what a community school was and talked about the elements of the components of a community school so I'm wondering if it needs to be you know it just needs to be related to that particular okay but I'm but should it be part of the resolution of the

[01:21:00]
therefore be it resolves should be to cite and then we can go back and find the bill I meant statute now that it was but it doesn't include funding and so one of the line items or one of the results should be to provide funding through that legislation to to school districts and that's that's what I think the bill would already have encouragement

[01:22:00]
we want to have sufficient fighting and it might be that that the that would go you know in the be it further resolved before the end the one before the end which is a little bit redundant with the one before that actually because the one before that just says yeah we need to have a sufficient so maybe from that point of view add that into that for the results and again we got to be careful because we don't know exactly what that language is I'm a little hesitant but if everybody can agree that we know that that exists at the legislative

[01:23:00]
what about community school policy that we have with the Albuquerque Berlin County we've used that so it must be in there too and Dr Pierce I know when we were Barbara and I were at the retreat with ABC Community Schools last week they were talking about some schools that call themselves Community Schools but really aren't and so that's also a sticking point that we need to have every community school is going to look different based on their neighborhood and their needs but there has you can't just call yourself a community school so it's kind of I think we're talking about trying to figure out how you really Define a community school so when you're talking about like funding how will and maybe Heather would know how would they fund that based on who's definition of a community school but I believe that the

[01:24:00]
ABC actually helped support that legislation and write that legislation and it was put in there because it defined the components of a community school specifically set to Define it it's just the schools that are calling themselves Community Schools not based on part of the bill in terms of the funding clarify exactly that information but the question of whether you can actually get funding for that means you have to satisfy the definition of what you mean by a community school and so

[01:25:00]
I think it's a great point but that's probably something we can put and and pursue with regard to the the bill itself what do you think I think there's a bit of a line that we have to walk on this because last year this the resolution for Community Schools was voted down by the School Board Association and the reason was that the many of the smaller District side is something that was just an urban issue that they didn't want to structure imposed on them that that works for us but it doesn't work for them I think this year there's there's been done in Las Cruces and Santa Fe both have active Community Schools are working with ABC to follow that framework but I think in terms of getting the support from the School Board Association

[01:26:00]
set line of saying yeah this is a structure that works we have a structure through ABC partnership that may be different from if you're employed that's its implementation its implementation but in terms of getting the support of nmsba I think leaving this open and not too specific is is important for the language of the resolution of the implementation

[01:27:00]
establish something which helps you get the community involved helps you fund for example it might be a coordinator that maybe that's kind of our mechanism but the point being then is that if you follow the definition that's in the that's in the statute then in fact you can get funding to help you with this so the point is you can do that with your world District or who you are and I think they thought that this was just strictly well that's just for you guys cuz we don't really need that or whatever well if you don't need it that's fine I guess but in reality and so I think that's our 899

[01:28:00]
so I think we have to be ready to support what we want to say but you're right I think Barbara you know if we make it too specific like Community coordinator and all this stuff well that's our implementation of it and that may not be exactly what they have to do but I think in fact it does then in here it does say including a position so we are imposing that on some of the smaller rural districts

[01:29:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:30:00]
any other comments from the board members so so basically we're looking at a change that would add in the second for the results from the end that would add a reference to the existing list so with that Edition Community Schools include extended time for learning that in a great Community Partnerships through designs like genius hour and really what we have done is extended the days of the school year but that may be a little too much you know what I mean I don't know

[01:31:00]
but again that's not necessarily a community school issue you know what I mean they may not do a genius and Community School they may not do extended days in the year Community School itself is is a specific kind of a thing so they just said Partnerships so that's the idea is you want partnership and the idea of this is genius hour is good because what you're doing is having a partnership with businesses and other people coming in so that's probably a better reference so I'm going to erase my thought because I taught myself out of it because I do want to be related to the partnership I did because I think the genius hours probably

[01:32:00]
up above but I think that's that's the point what they do with it is based on the needs of the particular school so you would say include time for learning that integrate Community Partnerships and then just take through designs like out of there I think the major characteristics of a community school is that extended time because it is it is a characteristic of a community school I think I think the extended time is okay you might want to take the through designs like the genius sound a little bit too much so you say Community Schools include extended time for learning that integrate Community Partnerships and that is part of it you know because when we have internships those kind of things that was already

[01:33:00]
Community School okay so so the the other change will be there for that one to say where is Community Schools include extended time for learning that integrate Community Partnerships and then period leave out the designer even though I love that and I think that was a great thing but if we wanted to explain it to somebody is to hear so that one plus the other one on the other side with the reference that you make it okay any other comments OK Google for superintendent positions and I have talked with a person named a local lawyer who actually has

[01:34:00]
broader Bill about all public organizations in terms of the ability to say that only for finalists would you actually do that because people generally speaking have a you know they may be very well happy where they are but they're looking to maybe you know get advancement or whatever and they may not be a finalist you know but they want to find out about it in fact sometimes it's a matter of a learning process you know in other words let me send my resume out and then if I'm not selected tell me exactly what I need to do to do better here right and they don't want that to be necessarily a public home where they are so the idea on this is only for superintendents for us another words the idea of being as we have a search for superintendents we get 40 people who put in applications

[01:35:00]
would be public knowledge and we would probably have just like we have open forums and everything else everybody would know everything about those people but until they're finalists the question was is that really right for people who who you know might actually have repercussions from even making me an application so that's kind of the idea here where did the where did they come up with the five well that's yeah and I asked I asked that down there and and actually I don't know where we came up with five because the one that Nick had said at least three finalists that was the language that he had in his and that came from states that already have 35 States who already have this in their language and the language is typically the final three three three finalists in other words but usually it's

[01:36:00]
at least three finalists that means if you have at least three candidates you need to call them finalists if you have based on the size of a district like I'm thinking what is it at UNM some of the colleges what how many well New Mexico doesn't have anything right now in New Mexico is one of those states that you have to disclose everybody we're going to seven states that has that okay there are 35 states that have only the requirement that you have at least three finalists and they're actually 15 of those days I think that have no requirement for any finalists in other words only the person you have so what we're trying to do is to kind of get in line with a 3540

[01:37:00]
play do that for the finalists and then there's the free finalists that's that's the idea and so what they're trying to do is to look at this from the broader perspective than just superintendents but any top executive of public organizations would serve in the same kind of the same kind of an idea so that's kind of a little background that I know and I was surprised to know the 35 States already have on the books laws on terms of IP address that you can't get their request for anybody but at least three finalists of a surprise to see that there were that many so it's not like we're setting the standard here at all we're just kind of going along with 35 states that already have set that standard so whether we want to do that or not that's up to the board you know I personally thought it was a good idea just from the point of view that you know people who want to apply and understand how the application process goes they may not think that they're good enough to do it maybe they think they are you know but we want to have a

[01:38:00]
the pool of the candidates that we really do believe would would enable us to have the best candidate and if people are afraid to do that and you only get people who are just not or just willing to go ahead and apply no matter what and then we may not get the best candidates so you know that kind of a thing so that's kind of the idea here you know so I did have the one change one is list five candidates and I said at least three finalists canals you know I didn't like the five cuz that didn't go along with what I understood what is told me about the other 3532

[01:39:00]
they may have done it but I don't think that's in state law do you think 5 is a safer number than just three is pretty typical with the other states in school districts that have this kind of with the 35 states in the very next beat for the result of says the most qualified candidates that says among superintendents it doesn't have to be sitting superintendents I would take that out period so those are my two thoughts on this one but you know any other thoughts from others but I would like to be able to say well we got 35 States out there and this is what they do you know

[01:40:00]
I think that will have to work

[01:41:00]
my car just like we always do when the time comes which I hope is no time soon but when we when that does come up to just guarantee that there's openness and equity and and access to to candidates once we get to that point I think I think again the transparency is important that is very important however it is our responsibility to our superintendent it is not necessarily everybody else's responsibility that is our responsibility independent of all that other stuff that is our responsibility so if we don't do a good job they put us out or they do whatever they want to but you know that's kind of you know it's kind of responsibility so anyway so those are some things you tell me what it is that you were striking or read it to me so that I there's no there's no difference there that's not different there it's the 5th

[01:42:00]
is the fifth the one downstairs now therefore be resolved that the next one where I change the list to at least three finalists you were talking about the next one down it's the next one down the very second to last line where it says most qualified candidates among sitting superintendents stripes

[01:43:00]
yeah I would take sitting I would say just discourages some qualified candidates out of there instead of saying sitting I mean that's clearly one of the categories that we would definitely think is discouraged but it may discourage others to you know okay right now oh wait a minute that's exactly what I meant to do you know so yeah okay so

[01:44:00]
at least three candidates in the next be there for it resolved take the among sitting superintendents out other comments Cage movie thank you the next one is is the one on on school police department has nothing to do with adding officers working on our schools and those will be the same people the same people that are in our schools the second part of it is is that right now we do not have control of our campuses something

[01:45:00]
what happens on campus that we have to call the police recall the APD we call the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office they take control of our campus what we want to have are the police department is us having control of our campus that is the idea in other words are sros are trained for how to handle students and you can see I know you got examples where they didn't work well but they are trained basically handle students the APD Burnet County Sheriff's Office have different modes different operational modes and I don't disagree with their modes at all but if they come on to our campus they use their modes I want to let you know that okay so we're not what we're trying to say is with the police department we can then have control of our own campuses in other words if anything happens on our own campus we can control it we can do the discipline or whatever we need to do we don't have to call APD or the Burlington County Sheriff's Office the third thing is funding if we have our own Police Department

[01:46:00]
we can get federal funds for our police in other words are sros those people that reduces our operation of budget that we have to spend on those people okay so instead of saying it's going to cost us money is going to actually save his money because we can actually fund those people through federal funds okay so it is not costing us more money it is in fact reducing the operational budget so those are three things that I think are important for people to understand that I don't believe they understand they believe that if you form a police department that's going to be something worthy of police we do a bunch of stuff right now our sros are already armed on our campus are not armed on our campus they are the same people we would have if we had a police department our chief would be the same person we have if we have a police department they are not added people necessarily okay if we have a shooting on a campus right now we have to give that over to

[01:47:00]
PPD or a Burnley County Sheriff's Office our security people are doing some very great things right now that I can't necessarily tell you about totally but so that it's easier to transition that but if our own sros are there they know the campuses they know the buildings they know the students so they can take control of any kind of a situation like that if we have to turn it over to anybody else and not be the lead on that the point on that that's a problem for our campuses right now UNM does have their own Police Department okay so this is not about getting more police control or rough in our students up or any of that kind of stuff that is not it in fact what is doing and reality is reducing that possibility it's reducing that possibility okay she's the one who started the restored

[01:48:00]
play Justice he is an SRO for our schools so the restorative justice in fact process and and emphasis it was actually started by our sros and the people that we have working in it and that's a very big thing that I think is important to understand that we want all of our people who are doing this to understand about restorative justice understand about the disciplines understand about our kids and our SOS do so it's a different thing I think than what I'm hearing from some of the people that have spoke and I want to make sure that's clear to you all okay I just I'm just giving you I'm giving you information okay and so I just want to make sure you understand that so that you understand that we're not against what you're saying at all when in fact think we're helping you or helping you do that we're helping with the restorative justice we're helping with the fact that ours do know what they're doing in our schools and yes there are still incidents we understand that but we do not want to turn over our schools to the cookie Police Department

[01:49:00]
play the Bernardino County Sheriff's Office if we don't have to and we want to collaborate with those people absolutely and others if something comes off campus on campus we have to collaborate with them that's absolutely true but if somebody comes on our campus it's our campus if we had a police department and it's not right now I want to let you know that it's not right now okay so that's the background and so whether we do this another thing is that one of our Hall of Fame who is with APS for a long time is one of our Hall of Fame was very much in support of this says yes he says when we've got control of our own schools when we got to make the decisions at our school site with our kids it's much easier for us to deal with that it's very difficult when we have to bring other people into the picture let me do that and he said he would be more than happy to help support us in that if they happen to be

[01:50:00]
see anything in the legislation would have to be legislated obviously to do that he said he'd be more than happy to help us with that so that's a little background and just for my own changes here just to do that again the very top when you say on Police Department would be of sros and down here every time you say police officers it would say sros because that's who that's what we talked about it there's a security there's a school resource officers the fact that they're police officers I mean that they are that's who they are but sros are the people we deal with and those are the people we trained and I want to make a distinction between APD police officers and ourselves and the Second World War I was in fourth wear as and there's an end missing after the last Warehouse

[01:51:00]
changes with my explanation and I apologize for dominating this but I had to get the background and the and the contacts for this cuz I've heard this many many many many many many times and people don't get the full contact or what it is we're trying to do we are trying to affect help this you're trying to make it better not make it worse and whether people believe that or not that's that's that's that's what it is I don't know I can only tell you what what we're trying to do but I can tell you what it is right now and what it is right now is that we don't have control of our campus so if you don't like APD being on our campus and taking control well then we have to do something different OK Google

[01:52:00]
play some certainly seen and experienced some of the things that you talked about but I think there is a real qualitative difference in terms of what we've got now with Chief Gallegos has done we've made progress over the years since I started a number of years ago to be able to create an opportunity for understanding but also an opportunity to help push the agenda of restorative justice we're certainly not where we want to be but I think we're moving closer it's very difficult in the sense that the so much of the world outside of APs is held around a different you know their values are different the framework is different it doesn't help when you have a newspaper that puts young people on the front page on a regular basis or cease people is criminals and

[01:53:00]
certain neighborhoods as criminal that's not helpful the point I'm trying to make is that I think there is a qualitative difference and I support what Dr Percy has said that doesn't mean that we don't have room for improvement it doesn't mean that there won't be mistakes from time to time but I think we are consistent in what we hold out as a board in terms of our expectations and I think that the administration Chief Gallegos is someone who you would be able to approach you know the big challenge for us is to look at data a lot of young people who get caught up in the school to prison pipeline in my experience do it once they've left APS that's not to say that we have challenges but if you go down and visit the school at the Juvenile Detention Center I think you'd be amazed to see what's happening

[01:54:00]
so I think and some some of the alternative schools school on Wheels in particular you know Freedom High School they've been able to help young people who are trying to sort out what it means to grow up and deal with life issues crises in their lives including discrimination you know I just think this is qualitatively different and it will give us a chance to move forward so that's why I suppose there's our schools but I do believe that 8 p.m. board of education in the superintendent having oversight of these specialized training in mediations and interventions would increase the safety of our schools and I have a solid belief in Chief Gallegos in his concern for

[01:55:00]
I have the same concerns that many of you shared tonight but I do have a belief that us having oversight along with the superintendent of this I would feel like our campuses would be safer thank you Mary Patterson and my concern is that there's been no dialogue with the community and I really truly believe that before we embark on this and before we take any action that we have this dialogue with our community that we listen to the community I think some of the some of the information

[01:56:00]
are chief Gallegos is is outstanding individual I've seen him at work and but we won't always have a cheap Gallegos on staff we won't always say we have to remember that but I truly believe that we need to give the community an opportunity to dialogue about this because this is really a shift from what we currently have I'm not real clear as to all of the things that we are asking for here when you mean support I mean are these individuals getting training from the Law Enforcement Academy

[01:57:00]
just not know that obviously there would be forms that would be public input that would be that kind of thing before any kind of a bill got through know this is just a resolution to say this is kind of our thoughts about what we think we ought to go to think it's interesting to me is that is that we think somehow this is going to establish something that's a lot different than what we have and in reality is already trained so I was in fact they are in fact one of the top group of talking about just normal police so it's not going to change that but I do believe it is a different perspective there's no doubt about that another is the perspective is what I think we're hearing from the community what's the perspective of what a police department means and I think that is the kind of thing that needs to be discussed

[01:58:00]
she needs to be needs to be really communicated well as to what that means just what I said tonight now if you believe what I said tonight that's the kind of communication you want to have if you don't believe what I said tonight we need to somehow let people know that's what it is and if it's if it's something different than that then we need to make sure that that's not the case in other words you know as we do the discussions of the community we need to be able to explain that we need to explain what happens in the school when we have to give that over to APD and I don't want to that's not a bad thing I want to make sure that's clear to everybody they have a certain mode of operation that they work on her so does Burlington County Sheriff's Office and they want to work under their mode of operation that's how they work they do not want to work Under Armour of operation in general and so we need to make sure there's a difference in there and we understand what that is and that our training and everything else is appropriate for that and just a matter whether cheap gases here matters

[01:59:00]
I think most of us up here absolutely agree with the concerns of that have been brought to us around this I mean the fact is that nationality police forces are becoming more and more militarized that any kind of push to break the

[02:00:00]
the prison the school to prison pipeline is not being followed through on by this justice department in particular and local communities so I think the question is what do we need to do proactively to protect our students and is taking over the police force away of actually drawing a boundary and setting what is it that we need for our young people what is it that we need for students in school to alter what that National push is so I mean to me this resolution is it's permissive it's not it's permissive language it's not prescriptive language and it definitely doesn't answer how old is things would happen I think there are some other districts in the country that are models of what it can look like

[02:01:00]
hopefully it does open up access to funding that we don't have access to now so when we Implement restorative justice when we try to have more counselors It's coming out of operational funds that maybe would be freed up I mean I think that this just is one big question mark and that it's really with the community that we can answer the question marks whether we start trying to pull that together before the resolution goes through or after to meet this is just a vehicle to open up the discussion cuz I think we're in agreement about what's wrong and so that's that's kind of I feel like I can vote for it because it's putting it out on the table and we've got to have that conversation

[02:02:00]
whether it's better to vote it down on that basis is my only question but I can support it but it's not it's not a done deal we've got to have that conversation so I mean I would just ask Heather what what kind of cost would I mean we said if we get federal funds that's going to save us money so what kind of cost would be associated with having our own independent police force at this point for a resolution of General observation about where we are in the agenda all the items you're looking at are resolutions that you're approving to bring to the New Mexico School Board Association have a conversation about issues that school boards in the state are also talking about to open up a conversation

[02:03:00]
in order for these things to move on to legislation would be a lot of work out of that conversation and to form a bill and pass legislation would require looking at costs as far as my understanding of the process of transitioning to an APS police force the cost is not going to increase or decrease it's just the availability of funds would be a cost savings because we could apply for grants that we can't now because we're not so I mean they're really that's I mean that's what I just assumed that there wasn't really going to be a cost since we are already you know we already have the Personnel we already have vehicles we already have that would be my understanding but remember this point it's a resolution so that you can open up a conversation and if the conversation among like-minded school boards in the state of this is something that should move forward to frame a bill would require that kind of analytic work

[02:04:00]
what are the two when we had this before because we've had this before the legislation before there was considerable disagreement among the smaller districts because they felt like well this is just for you large districts and what I would like to point out actually is that this is a very very good thing for a small history if I got a small District up here in the Laguna place or whatever and it takes 30 minutes to 40 minutes for anybody in law enforcement to get to their place then that's too late that's too late but if they could actually employ somebody call it their Police Department get funding for that police department so to speak they could have somebody on site service them right there and they could actually do that right on site so in reality I think even for small districts that there's a big benefit to being being being able to do that right now they can't afford to do that they can't have somebody on site they have to call somebody and if anything

[02:05:00]
should be able to say I don't have to wait for an hour for somebody to come here and then and then have him be somebody from a police department that I don't have any control over at all but I could actually have somebody you know my location that's something that needs to talk to them we can't you know right talk with him but you know again some of them don't agree because some of them think that that's you know that's not something for them and so that's okay you know there's no we're not saying you have to this is not saying you have to formally

[02:06:00]
we're going to listen to you afterwards I think we need to not be that bored I think we need to say you are community and kids are important

[02:07:00]
that has been going on so I apologize for not being totally you know I tried to do some research on where I could head on this I think for me and I agree that there's a lot of work that needs to be done to be able to consider this because the part that just scares me and maybe it's because I'm the new kid on the Block but the whole part that would be controlled by the Board of Education and overseeing by the local superintendent because I think of that's not the business we're in so I I kind of think of you know when when we were doing school base health centers for example there was a big push with schools that wanted to control their own School Bass house

[02:08:00]
is there a run their own school-based health center and we had to remind school districts but you're not in the business of healthcare because it's very different there's there are some things that go on there and while we're really lucky to have Chief Gallegos I also am grateful that there still is a connection because my my thought is as I listened to our first Speaker this morning I mean this afternoon in public forum where she was talking about Community you know the importance of the school is the Hub of the community so I also don't want to lose sight of the fact that we are part of a community and that Community is also our local police departments and if the goal is to get back to community policing and that piece what's our role in functioning that and making sure that we're growing that and that we're supporting it so that's that's just where I'm coming from because I am new to the

[02:09:00]
to the conversation but I will tell you that that whole notion of the Board of Education taking on that that responsibility to me just seems really quite daunting and scary but I'm still new and I understand that it has a long ways to go and this is a conversation for a lot of other school districts because it's not you know I understand that part but I would stand with board member Patterson I don't think I'm ready to vote on this OK Google so we have to have collaboration we have to have agreements with

[02:10:00]
just make sure you understand you know why do we have and what is different what is not different so again you know if we don't pass this then we don't open this discussion so I'm just telling you it won't go anywhere else so it will not in fact enhance the opportunity for us to actually bring this to a larger Group which in fact

[02:11:00]
it has been discussed by other districts by the way too and maybe set a set a stage for saying how do we do this do we do this how do we make these relationships how do we build these collaborations and how do we do it so that we can actually address these issues we were talking about in terms of the of the kids being put in bad situations and you know when talking to unless you're down I just you know he's started Justice he was there that did that you know that's important for us you know it's important to understand he's coming from us so let's discuss that a little bit let's talk about what that means but if we don't do that then we're going to see this again so that's the problem we have is that you know we have to decide how are we going to actually make sure that we establish a capability for us

[02:12:00]
maybe we should have had this discussion and I think we just it's the reverse I think we should have had this discussion this dialogue open this up to the community early on I think we should have done that I really think that was that was that was key and I just really believe the community should have we should have had input from the community before we started going down this path with resolution here period

[02:13:00]
who's law enforcement efforts it should be maybe it should be changed the shell oh I think the intent is certainly there we hope that it's Shelley the legal ramifications of having our own department or

[02:14:00]
negative consequences the other can be there can be some both you know because if we have the legal right to actually decide what we do with our students then we also become part of the legal system in other words right now what we do if it has to become part of the legal system and not ours and and they go to jail and if we want to make decisions that say you know I mean I think there's some things that are very strict in other words if you bring a weapon on campus but I'm talking about the different things that we seem to get into hassles about all the time you know things that come into more of the bullying the kids or or the police officers are not doing right in terms of the kind of things that they're doing I think we can have our own decision about what we do with the students and we can get it and say well this looks like this is a felony

[02:15:00]
criminal system and and if we can keep them out of that I think that's a good thing you know what I mean I think that's a positive thing but it does put us in a legal position you know in terms of what we do and I can't speak for the legal Community cuz I'm not I'm just giving perspectives here about things that would be like you said that could be a positive they could also be a negative in the sense that we have some responsibility here to actually make those decisions rather than just give them to somebody else now if our students you know the people who talk to us would rather have us make that decision is not depends on how well we do our jobs and so I think they're still is collaboration in other words we collaborate with the legal Community all the time we collaborate with the attorneys

[02:16:00]

[02:17:00]
for several years now that knife is the length of that blade is below 3 inches or less and no one was threatened with that knife we've made an agreement with the DA's office those cases wouldn't be prosecuted however the other agency wanted to book him because of possession of the knife that's a small example of the lot of things that we've done to avoid sending these kids are students to jail it just doesn't work that way so yes there are a lot of concerns are arrests last year alone were less than five students and that includes kids who have broken and to our schools and have been court ordered for arrest a judge has signed in a restaurant has to go to jail or department does not want to do that and exactly what she is saying and in my heart I know it's the right thing to do I know it is and you're right it was mentioned that I'm not going to be here forever I'm old and I'll be the first

[02:18:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:19:00]
all I can say is we're operating as a police department right now under the authority of the Bernalillo County Sheriff's office so it's not like we're going to do anything different if we get our own police department and we don't have to stand under them we get access to Horry to ncic that's a huge huge game and I'm so so sincere about this that that's a big deal because all the property take it from APS right now if a school gets broken into and they still 20 computers like the other day when we had our meeting our committee meeting and they were 20 computers missing from a school there is no way to track that property there's no way to put the serial numbers in that that information into ncic for other agencies

[02:20:00]
when they could recover that or if they recover that where it belongs because we don't have an Ori number that's just one of the things if we have a law student we can't put that student into ncic so that other agencies can look out for that child because we don't have an Ori number these are just small amounts of things that were not able to do but right now we're acting as a law enforcement agency right now with the budget we're giving right now if I could just help out a little bit so I want to point out that some of the cost you are bringing up we all ready encouragement because we maintain a police force we buy our own cars we do our own training and actually this year we were a bill by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department for liability insurance for officers because they're operating under their commission so we

[02:21:00]
we actually pay expenses so there will be as far as costs we can do more detailed data analysis but I need to understand that a lot of the major costs costs are born by the district already and the concept for chief Gallegos and for the district is that we have a force that one we've embedded in the schools which is very very different from a city or a County police force who actually don't have the Manpower in bed they wanted to embed but they're pulled out pretty much so we rely on almost solely on our police force to deal with any incident on our campus they will not come if unless it is extremely serious situation we're dealing now with the lack of Transport for students who are having mental issues on campus afd and APD will no longer transport those students even if they are considered a threat to themselves or other

[02:22:00]
Chicago has to pick that up so we are actually picking up more costs just naturally so my sense is that there will be a few more costs that we have an anticipated but there will be some things that free us up in ways that we we have not been freed up for because we have been blocked by Sheriff's and with well meaning not not being nasty but we have become problematic sometimes it is nice when we can say this is our agreement and we do this are people on campus who know these kids dealing with these kids make the decision that you might want to stay around I just want to sort of things that Chief guide

[02:23:00]
rules we have a situation where we have officers from other departments and there is a marked difference in attitude and a marked difference in practice in terms of what's happened I've experienced this in my own family and I didn't like what I heard part of our challenge I think is is the function of police departments generally has gotten more and more aggressive around the country and if you're a young person of the global majority or a young person of color you definitely have to make sure that you've had that talk and that you talked yourself into trying to figure out how you going to relate to folks you know it's no accident there have been many many situations here in this town within the community where it's these young people that get targeted

[02:24:00]
I almost think that if we intend to establish the department of restorative justice or law enforcement and not respect that communicates something completely different these are young people who are growing up and we've had some situations that have been mishandled this is all part of a huge learning not official learning in terms of what gets taught in the classroom should be but what gets taught in terms of organizational culture and our organizational culture has to continue to shift and not everybody agrees and you know it and I Know It that there are people who would do things the exact opposite of you who are good people but they just happened to see the world differently and the challenge is how do we begin to work towards finding common ground and then begin to leverage that Common Ground into something different and I think that's what has happened with his predecessors worked in that direction as well they understood that it was

[02:25:00]
different what they were doing I think we're going to move forward but we want to I agree with you candy I think we do have to have this dialogue it's unfortunate the way these things come up you know there aren't always time always the time that we would like to have the dialogue and to organize it that's a whole other big thing but perhaps there's a way that we could begin to partner there have been a number of initiatives to try to get student input and hear from students what it's like unfortunately it always boils down to having input from the kids who aren't having problems or challenges and we have to figure out how to incorporate those voices of those who are having challenges I think we have a fine staff I think that they're still always room for improvement just depends on the situation but anyway that's my two more sets I did have

[02:26:00]
based on remember you know that the original statement that says controlled by the Board of Education overseen by the local Supreme Court I would like to take the control by Board of Education out of there because in reality we do not have that that so I don't think that we have a direct address so whatever we vote on I would suggest taking that out of there and then the other things were replacing police officers with sros taking the wheel down here in the west to say shell and

[02:27:00]
third Juarez school police May focus on mediation and interventions absolutely absolutely I like that a lot so that's it that's why I was wondering about the other one I didn't know how the will in the shower so even if you vote against that's fine no problem in the other states that do have their own police departments how are their police departments controlled who controls them are they controlled by the board

[02:28:00]
get bored or whatever or are they controlled by the superintendent I think that's important to know what the other 35 states do board member of what I do not know I do not know who actually controls the department I know they have a chief and the chief runs the department of course the chief has to have a boss and I don't know who that would be the next step that would be do you know how it works at the University of New Mexico who controls their Police Department is at the Board of Regents or is it the president our community hasn't had the opportunity to listen to some of the some of the work that you do I think that's important I think that dialogue needs to go out to the community here we are before

[02:29:00]
I'm bored with this information that's it's great information but our community doesn't know that and I agree but I think the the people or the part of the community that has the biggest concern besides of course the young people who spoke earlier and I totally understand what the young people said earlier and I would love to sit down and listen to those issues because it's only going to make us stronger but the bigger part of the community that I feel has the biggest concern or the parents of our students they're the ones who were concerned about their safety when they walk out the door until they get home and that's been expressed to me by many many

[02:30:00]
add large fitted fitted exists and if we don't figure out how to address that and and make sure that that's not that control is not the focus of what happens when kids walk in the door that it really is education that's the focus and so I mean I think the one reason and I'm and I'm waffling because there's compelling reason to not support the resolution but I also think that regardless of this resolution the conversation in the next step is exactly the same this doesn't mean that any action is taken it means that there may be compelling reasons to move forward or there may be compelling reasons to not move forward without without without the statutory permission then regardless of what we decide if the community

[02:31:00]
I can't take action on you know depending on what direction is so I don't think it changes what what we have to do regardless of how of how we vote on this resolution yeah I think so and and actually there's a really bigger picture here and then I don't know their students are young people probably both a lot of other security concerns other things that are being done or things that can be done and I think that's part of the discussion as well what are we doing and so I think there's a lot of other things that the community really needs to have input on and information about right now cuz I don't think they understand about what a lot of things were doing and so I think that's a broader discussion as well in other words how do we really hope that we can do some of the things that that I know that that that that are working on right now to make this facilitating in terms of a lot of

[02:32:00]
not just this kind of thing but how did the how did the SOS work into this how do they how do they part of this whole idea and and so that whole big discussion needs to happen as well as part of this say so I think again I'm big about having that discussion because the people need to understand and particular our parents need to understand you know what are you doing for our students you know what what exactly are you doing it and by the way I like to know how are those are supposed to work the other words tell me what kind of training these guys are getting tell me exactly how we're supposed for example our SOS work and yes they are working with counselors they're working with all the people that just like the people in school to try to understand what our kids are doing their what are the problems what are the issues they should be a resource for our students not not just a guy with a gun hope you don't trust me that's not the point that's not what we want to have in our schools and so we need to be able to explain that we need to be able to have that be one of the messages

[02:33:00]
I hope I don't run into that guy with a gun you know or something you're right in other words you ought to be welcome welcome

[02:34:00]
Board of Education and on the front big big capital letters and replaces police officers with sros and the third Warehouse down below says sros shall focus on mediation and that and there's an end missing after the last whereas I think and just let me clarify results that would be what that would be overseeing take control by the Board of Education out of there and so it would be would be over by the local

[02:35:00]
what we had to say so thank you very much appreciate that and I guarantee you if you want to talk to the chief goes about this he's more than willing to talk to you he is very accommodating and he is not judgemental he's more than willing to talk to you about the issues and what the things are and they'll bring that to us too okay so thank you very much okay

[02:36:00]
do you want to you want to take a roll call on this let's take a roll call vote on this that way it makes it really clear what we're doing this again

[02:37:00]
and I think there are things that have come up that that we have been unable to even consider because we're prohibited from doing this but I also as I sit here and if it passes I will happily present it since I'm on the nmsba board I will with with you know I will represent the board happily because I think they're compelling reasons I think there's a level of distressed in the community and and so I think there's groundwork I think there's ground work that needs to be done before I go

[02:38:00]
even though I think ultimately it's the right thing to do I think that we can take control I'm worried about what some other districts and other parts of the state would see it as an opening to if they haven't done some groundwork on restorative justice so I'm I'm all for pursuing it but I'm going to vote no for this resolution but I think we need to to not drop it make sure it comes up and Community settings on Pandora

[02:39:00]
opening up public dialogue around this and having more Community conversations like we discussed many months ago when we talked about an earlier resolution so yes and so with that it's a 3/4 vote it's no so they will not go on we're going to go on to the resolution for school safety I mean the only thing I have excelled was the one about Universal background checks and if we don't want to strike that I would

[02:40:00]
I would add to it if if you all don't want to strike that I would add after Universal background checks on the second page the first be it for the result in the second page after local governments to acquire and strength and Universal background checks I would add on the sales of firearms for a fee or other consideration but not the temporary transfer or loan of firearms between two individuals I had the same change it's just that for someone that has to get permission to borrow a firearm if they're you know going to use it to concealed carrying it they have to get permission from the government all the time to be able to do that and I think that language change kind of tracks with what a lot of the gun control groups already publicly rolled out last in August so

[02:41:00]
and it hasn't it hasn't passed this way in any legislature without you know with that verbiage and I and I had that too related to I said this is related to the purchase of firearms but I don't know is that the language I just had it on the sales of firearms for a fee because you want to make sure for your other consideration because it could be like an exchange but not the temporary so that's not like me lonely my guns on the

[02:42:00]
where is a temporary loan or a temporary transfer to someone like I say here like I did for my daughter here so I would say to strengthen Universal background checks on the purchase of firearms or the temporary transfer or loan a Firearms you know cuz it's like I've known someone before I think that we have to the temperature outside temperature

[02:43:00]
I don't know Heather you have to see if both of them should be in there I don't know transfer loan are two different I think they're two different meanings right can you loan I don't I don't know so anyway the language would be related to the purchase or the transfer of firearms I just say transferred federal state and local government Universal background checks related to the purchase or transfer a Firearms transfer of

[02:44:00]
somebody who may be taking a concealed carry or they don't know if they want to have a gun but they're taking a concealed carry then you can loan somebody your firearm yeah you can it's not against the law you can loan them to see if they and then they decide later or sometimes in certain shows like cowboy shows that they have events they do the same thing where they're just sharing their their their weapons I mean it's just things that happen out there and you know anything about okay so it would be like this on the purchase purchase comma transfer comma

[02:45:00]
okay is the have you got that right Heather again the Edition checks related to the purchase comma transfer comma and or loan of firearms and again you know we're not going to do a lot better than words and we had some students coming from

[02:46:00]
and and we haven't heard back from them and so I'm not sure if it Alters in any way what we want to do with this resolution going to the nmsba but I'm I'm wondering what has happened to what we tabled what we put to the side earlier this year I think it's on us to have that Community dialogue like we discussed when we first talked about the resolution that we have a larger Community College

[02:47:00]
SBA for passage but I guess I bring it up just to say I would support something stronger but if we feel like this is the best we can do at this point in time I'll support it oh they may make changes at nmsba who knows chances are any other thoughts entertainment and basically this really

[02:48:00]
deals with primarily are tax levy election the ability for us to get this changed and loss of the just a little background and I've talked again with some of our folks about this this is not just this year's problem this is a Year's problem after every year for us or every 6 years or whatever it is we have elections because the fact is that if we don't have the elections so we have to have a special election in February in order to do that if we don't have one this February we lose 30 million dollars okay if we have it in November we can't get it on the this year and therefore we lose at least 30 million dollars maybe 30 plus million dollars so the point of this is to say please legislature would you solve the problem in the legislation so that we can actually

[02:49:00]
have have support from monetary support supposed to leave our election as we don't want to be paying both of these for all of our Board elections and other elections in in in in November as well as is our special way so just just general are there any are there any specific things I have a couple but let me let me just indicate in the one now therefore the first specific to reimbursement to Albuquerque Public Schools I would say any other school districts cover the cost of a special election now there's any school district that has to have a special election

[02:50:00]
is there and you got to have a taxes been made if you don't do it in February it won't get on the tax rolls this year it'll be the next year if that's what you want to do okay you can do that but if you can do that the trouble we have is we have it in a regular regular pattern so it's a little more difficult for us so that was the only other thing to try to and in fact maybe just say reimbursement to public schools to cover the cost of a special election you know period any public schools or something you know Public Schools or any school districts any New Mexico School District I don't know

[02:51:00]
reimbursement to school districts I think that's better than to cover yeah so that one would read Heather that the New Mexico Ledger provide reimbursement to school districts to cover the cost of a special election any other thoughts on this one I know and I've been trying to find out and then I talked to senator for a long time today so to try to go over this and get some answers and he is again as I've said more than willing to come and work with APS do a works I mean just kind of he wants to do that but we've tried to figure out when the tax property is applied

[02:52:00]
an effective and nobody can nobody can give you that answer nobody's going to give you that answer they haven't given it to him to other lawyers couldn't find that the other thing that I talked to a city counselor today also and they are going to be one suggestion to to save you know to save some money but we're investing a million dollars to get a whole bunch of money so it's not a bad investment it's a good investment you know it is because we're getting I mean tens of millions of dollars I mean the last Bond I think it was 570 something or whatever so investing a million dollars to even get that it's worth it it's just worth it so some things are worth the investment but they the city from what I understand is there going to be they're going to have a city election

[02:53:00]
in the spring so I said well why can't we just do it together and Grant that we are have a bigger budget that we may not be able to do it 50/50 but we could split that split that cost so the city councilor was going to talk to talk to the mayor and see if that's something that we might want to look at cuz we could save I mean even if we had to put in 40% you know 60% and they put in 40% that one cost us a million dollars so I just said that's something to put out there I don't know you know what will come of that but then the other thing that is important is that you know several years from now 6 years from now this going to happen again so how are we planning to make sure that it doesn't I mean how are we working with this

[02:54:00]
with this with House Bill 98 how are we working to make sure that we take care of this for the future because that is the same thing the cities and you know other municipalities in school districts are going to have that same problem the first thing is is that how we arrange our February when we can work a city that's great I think that's outside of this resolution not saying we have the total solution but but there are some things that have to be fixed and so I think that's those are the things that are talking about but certainly we got to work with I said we got to work for the legislators and we got to figure out what kind of Bill would result from this so that we can actually make sure that happens this is just getting it started this is just saying guys we need some help here in making sure that this happens now whether they'll reimburse us or not

[02:55:00]
that's up to us to work out and maybe that'll work and maybe the reimbursement would be less or or maybe not I don't know but but this resolution is primarily focused on what we're going to try to have to do in the future so we don't have this problem we've got the problem right now they will not be able to pass this before we have to actually do something probably unless we find some way to wiggle in there but it's going to be a you know I don't know how that's going to work so do you have some things to say Scott briefly I'd like to move you all on but one is we would not be able to run a joint election with the city under the current the only not for school districts so we wouldn't be able to do that we have to do our special election in the only way we're allowed to the special election

[02:56:00]
I think we're happy to to run whenever we just need it done at a time so that it's a line to the tax code remember that the issue is not so much we have no opposition to having the election when the election is the issue is that for the mill Levy it doesn't work in the line with tax code so either they correct the tax code or they correct win the election is help it's it's very simple we met with the LFC and we gave them quite a bit of testimony and more than happy to work with and he's been very good about reaching out to us and and and and and taking ideas that's not been a problem the other thing I would say is you're absolutely correct and we're going 30 million dollars in capital funds this morning's editorial really did Focus solely on the school board and neglected the concept of The Middle

[02:57:00]
election component so it really dropped the 30 million that we would lose we also were talking to the Business Leaders this morning at the superintendent's committee and she noted that the loss they noted that the loss of 30 million dollars of Revenue and with the way price increases are going up we may actually come back in a year having lost that revenue and if we get it this year we saved the million dollars over what we would have to spend a year out so I mean it's not only an investment for the 30th by doing it so and it keeps us from having to change our Capital master plan and everything else so does he feel like this covers with the LFC does this recipe

[02:58:00]
changes to the one now therefore do we have any other comments hey Google how many hours

[02:59:00]
provided by the vendors versus the Orioles probably okay we'll go to entertainment

[03:00:00]
I am I am really honestly I'm talked out the only thing I'd say is about the dragon news it's like when you look at those kids that takes your breath away I mean there tomorrow and they're the ones with the ideas and and and and and the hope and so that that was the highlight of of the night it will be great fun to have the lesc at Hawthorne next week I am looking forward to it just one quick thing and and this is coming conversation lately talking about what a wonderful thing it would be if our teachers got to have sabbaticals that and I think that Amanda's presentation tonight of just you know we we underestimate what intellectual activity teaching is and the just the

[03:01:00]
total commitment and just totals and I mean this in a good way soul-sucking thing teaching is and teachers need a chance to step back and think and breathe and right now lots of times we don't even come up with the money for teachers to be able to have a 7 in their classroom so they can go visit appear a fellow teacher even in the same school even in the same grade level sometimes and you know we just know that the teachers get better when they can collaborate and talk and somehow and this is a long ways of I think every teacher gets better every year but sometimes they need to catch their breath step back get some perspective

[03:02:00]
and there's a reason why universities make it possible for professors to have sabbaticals and and so long term as we think about what what are staff needs it would sure be a wonderful thing thank you I just want to appreciate the board for the discussion on resolution with regards to establishing Police Department I think it was a difficult discussion I think it was important and I think it's a good example of democracy at work I appreciated the community's comments the courage and I think that comments by Chief Google

[03:03:00]
the district is working together and the board is working together we may agree to disagree and we move forward that's a huge huge difference and significant so well done everyone thank you but remember I really enjoyed the presentation from Amanda short because it was it really just started with me with everything that's important about a school where she met she mentioned you know Community is part of the importance of a school but school is the Hub of the community and I think in our presentations tonight you know with our community focus on Community Schools the handle with

[03:04:00]
pair of Peace Billy demonstrates that you know APS functions well because we have Partnerships because we are part of the community and our schools are part of that Community as well and Hawthorne I've always said this I mean a Hawthorne sort of embodies that that we Embrace that school because it was so important to that community so I just I just really like that in a shout out to the National Merit scholar that's always that's always important thank you thank you so much that I wanted to share is in a 1018
