[00:02:00]
I will move for approval of adoption of the January 24th audit committee meeting agenda and approval of the July 26th 2022 August 24th 2022 and November 28th November 8th 2022 audit committee meeting minutes I'll second to Yolanda wonderful thank you both and if I could have a real call Sarah Sarah I believe she's having trouble logging on Scott Elder yes Danielle Gonzales yes Courtney Jackson yes Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes Barbara Peterson Crystal tapioca Romero

[00:03:00]
yes and Peggy Mona Aragon yes thank you and our next item up for discussion is presentation of the fiscal year 2022 audited financial statement and this is just a discussion item so I believe Mr Turnbull you will have the floor and then Miss Sarah or both of you together go ahead and share members of the boards is a presentation of the fiscal year 2022 financial statements by has been released by the office of the state taxes on their website at s a o n m dot report was submitted on time for the state auditor rules

[00:04:00]
has also been submitted for financials for two Awards one to the association of school business officials international certificate of excellence in financial reporting we've received that this award for the past several years and we planned to receive another one we've also submitted our work to the government Finance Officers Association this is the certificate of achievement for excellence and financial reporting have received out and no small part to My dedication and hard work so with that I would like to turn her over to Sheila Herrera Adams

[00:05:00]
thank you and good morning Madam chair members of the committee and superintendent Elder as Mark mentioned we did the financial statements have been issued they were released by the state auditor's office on December 27th and we're made public and so the financial statements are five volumes long if you open the financial statements the most important to the district are volumes one two and five volume three and four are all specific to Charter Schools the other volumes volume one has the main independent Auditors report which we discussed during the exit conference the opinion is an unmodified opinion which is the cleanest opinion that the district can receive you will also see additional paragraphs in that opinion specifically on page

[00:06:00]
B dot I dash 1 so if you look at volume one that's where the report of the independent Auditors is and there are different additional paragraph specifically related to the emphasis of matter for the implementation of Gatsby 87 which was the new Leaf standard that was implemented in the current year there's also paragraphs related to the charter schools that have Charter renewals that were going to end June 30th 2023 and had not been renewed at the time that we issue the financial statements and so those paragraphs are included in the financial statements volume Five specifically has all of the finding details so while we did provide the number of findings for both the district and the chartres the actual written findings for everything is in volume Five along with

[00:07:00]
both see what we call the yellow book reports and the compliance reports those began on pages 4/28 of volume Five and did want to just point those out as those are often you know what we discussed during the exit conference any questions does anybody have any questions of Mr Turnbull if not thank you all I think you all did a great job and as well as 8 p.m. so thank you miss it on thank you Mr Turnbull and all of APs who worked really hard on this and it looks like we did a really good job so all those awards are wonderful so thank you okay our next item for consideration

[00:08:00]
is acceptance of the ethical Advocate statistics for the period July 1st 2022 through December 31st 2022 and this is a discussion action item so I don't know if Dr Segundo and Mrs Riser will be presenting but you have the floor good morning Madam chair members of the committee and superintendent Elders executive director of the student parent and employee services for July to December of 2022 which starts on page 12 of your electronic documents as you can see we have received 4 6 6

[00:09:00]
okay does anybody have any questions if you do just go for it I guess typical for the time of year except that our numbers have jumped up in person or because we just didn't see as many during the last couple of years I was just curious about that I would say that we had a decrease in 2021 due to covid I do believe we've had an increase coming out of covid we often know that people file complaints when they're uncomfortable or when there's changes and I think that's what we've seen coming out of covid is

[00:10:00]
we've advertised with a blower a little bit better and added an email to our list so there's I think there's several factors that have increased the numbers Through The Years thank you okay does anybody else have any questions this is Barbara and this is really sort of this is definitely a qualitative not a quantitative question but lots of times when they're complaints even when they're not confirmed and I think it's important that standard for confirming the complaint period it's an indication that there's some kind of Discord that something isn't working for someone and I'm just wondering if you can give a little just information about how you deal with these situation

[00:11:00]
so that people feel like they've been heard and leave with with a better feeling than they came with after they've made the complaint and just remember Peterson to I don't remember if you were the one that had asked the last time at one of the meetings I think it was in July if they had implemented a satisfaction survey I think you had suggested that if I remember correctly and I think that would speak to maybe what you're kind of talking about so if TCU can kind of answer you know member Peterson's along with if you have implemented a satisfaction survey remember member Peterson we have begun adding a second level to all of the complaints so when a complaint is made say against I'll just use an example say against a principal I ensure that the associate superintendent and the superintendent are copied on that to give those levels of

[00:12:00]
feedback and that way the associate superintendents who supervised can go in and kind of look at what's going on we've talked about the satisfaction survey before and that's very difficult because when an individual uses at the call Advocate even when I asked additional questions we very rarely get feedback I rarely get an answer back from them because it is an anonymous way to provide information and using a satisfaction survey when it is a complaint if they don't get the response that they want you know very few people are probably Saturday but I don't get any feedback period which is where probably about 90% of these are from so and and I get Anonymous complaints as well through email so

[00:13:00]
isn't a way to contact the majority of the individuals that file complaints I definitely understand that it seems like it sort of goes together with some of our other not issues but just as we work towards more welcoming environments and creating things like Community Schools where people feel like in person they have more access to working through issues and problems I think it's I think the solution is beyond simply with your office and I know you can't you can't respond to someone even if they identify themselves if there are issues that need to be confidential thank you for the report

[00:14:00]
the detail that something we had asked for for a long time and I really appreciate that it really helps get a better view of What kinds of complaints are coming in and how they're addressed so thank you thank you any other questions I have a question I guess consider this is very helpful I do agree the information to level of detail and the response considering that we as the board have one employee I'm just curious how we know if there's ever a whistle of complaint against our employee does that come up in some other way remember Gonzalez when you're talking about one employer you talking about and if if a complaint is filed against superintendent Elder the procedural directive says very clearly that I do reach out to the board president and the board president does manage that complaint or work with me

[00:15:00]
do you make sure that we do know about it I haven't because the General Lee the ones that are coming up there I've worked with HR or I've worked with legal and there's like no it's not confirmed I mean like it doesn't turn into anything so so and I will just say that in my my year last year 1280

[00:16:00]
don't get confirmed so I follow through with the process in terms of who I need to speak to at the district to help confirm or to to work on that particular complaint and then it just doesn't go anywhere okay thank you thank you for that information does anybody else have a question I do remember to go ahead so could you review for me what what constitutes confirmed because it seems like such a black and white system that you know we miss we miss details that maybe to our detriment I would say that okay so I'm not going to speak

[00:17:00]
Anonymous you can't really follow up yeah so I mean and TCU might want to speak about that but generally on these particular complaints there are Anonymous and so it's very it's kind of very Broad and you're just sort of dealing with hearsay kind of thing and so you go through and you you try to work through those pieces and I think there's other avenues for individuals to complain that is not Anonymous and that you know that takes a different a different route so and that's I think what's happening with TC on these as well correct you see they come in anonymously so you try to do some like root cause analysis you sort of looking to see you know where there's some incidences but when you don't know who the individual is it's hard to

[00:18:00]
it's hard to like to follow up yes remember Dominguez member quarterback the every every every the majority of the plants that I get are Anonymous I do always follow up if there's additional questions or providing feedback the individual that filed the complaint even if the response is through ethical Advocate if it were a confirmed complaint I do let them know that the situation is being managed that you know so I give them the feedback if it is a personal issue I can't share personal information but I let them know that it is a personal issue that has been managed so everyone gets feedback period for example and that's a cool Advocate is

[00:19:00]
Anonymous so everybody gets feedback you asked about how do I tell if it's confirmed basically the the supervisor looks into the situation and determines whether yes there's you know it is or is not happening but then they still can follow up with with their employee on how to better manage that situation the other thing I think is important to add board members is that sometimes these investigations to support the investigation so where is it may be anonymous as long as report a specific whether its Financial whether it's a management issue personal issue point is someone goes and investigates whether that's directly asking the person back to give me the side of the story of this sometimes they go in and interview people inside the department so there is an investigation and that's where you get to

[00:20:00]
confirmed or not confirmed simply put sometimes people see something in the interpret what they're seeing and they say this must be because of and sometimes there is an actual story behind that now that may be a Personnel matter someone may have received discipline and they didn't see it so they assume nothing happened and they'll make a complaint that's where sometimes it gets a little tricky with the anonymous part of it and the ability to share all the Personnel details with with the anonymous complaint but they all get investigated by someone either from the district or something we use for Eos Brad's thank you I think back to Peterson's point it's hard to know what all these not confirmed numbers

[00:21:00]
but there is I know bad behavior has been on the rise after the pandemic and I don't know how that would fit into this but it just seems I don't know I don't know that this helps us if you just look at it but I don't know that that's a fair representation either given the anonymity of the system and I do wish we could get a feel for staff feedback just does you know that's that's all I

[00:22:00]
I was going to say that I think a lot of the and it's like not that I've seen any of these but just my experience is that even with parents that I've spoken to that choose to use this route to go through an anonymous route is they don't really want to be called out because they fear that they might have it retaliation but sometimes too it's their concerns about something it's just like superintendent Elders said where they don't feel that the school is being fair for example or they don't like the hiring of someone a decision that was made and in retribution on that or they'll say a name like the individual that they hired is not qualified for this and I'm really concerned about you know the decisions that were being made and that's a kind of like type of complaint that would

[00:23:00]
and then you know they have to they still have to respond so obviously there is some Discord there's some distrust and usually sometimes it happens a lot after like the hiring of a principal because the community was not happy with the decision that was made because maybe there's a division in one side wanted this and one side wanted that and they'll make a claim that it was you know it was an inside job or something like you know something to that effect but generally I think most parents or most people are willing to come forward with without being anonymous and then it goes a different route it doesn't come through this one thank you these are only the folks that don't wish to be that don't wish to be known okay thank you remember Jackson so

[00:24:00]
I kind of wanted to go back to the procedural directive that Miss Riser and board member Cordova brought up because I'm sorry to say I have not read that procedural directive so this is kind of new to me in regards to our our one employee and so my question is regarding that procedural directive and how how is it then brought to the board if there are trends that start to develop and how if it's the the president that kind of is the first point of contact how is it then brought to the board if there are concerns that become a trend and I'm not sure who can answer that I would say that I mean I guess I would say if there was a trend I would definitely bring

[00:25:00]
I think we could go back and revisit that procedural direct if you'd like I mean I will just just for like to Tamper it down there isn't a trend so first of all I think that's the first thing but I would president I would definitely be bringing it to the executive committee first and we'd have a conversation okay and then the executive committee would kind of decide well I think we would have to work together yeah absolutely okay okay yeah so I mean that was new to me to hear that there's a procedural directive regarding that so and so I don't know Miss Riser would it be possible could you just forward that or the link or something I like to take a look at that

[00:26:00]
I made it right now so for what it's worth it does say the executive director of student parent Employee Service Center shall track the number of and other appropriate information regarding whistleblower campaigns regarding the superintendent for reporting to the board of education so it does seem to minimum there should be some way to have the number and other appropriate information together to be sent out to thank you and so I mean I know it does say that you know to the board of education but that does go to the president and if that's something that we want to go further to

[00:27:00]
all of the Board of Education that could be something that we might want to talk about and that might be a procedural directive that the board may want to look at so if that's something that you think we should look at then if you would make sure and let president Montoya quarter but no can I ask a clarifying question because I think it's just a whole bunch of other questions as we're in this topic now because the way we're in the way I just understood what a board member Gonzalez just read the proceeded procedural directive is that it should go to the entire board not specifically just the president and I think just to make us aware of what has happened even if it's not like we're not involved in the final decision making but just the same way we got a report here for everybody else and to Keep Us Alive with what the procedural directive States so I think it will be important to at least get you know last year's data

[00:28:00]
we're going forward with the evaluation remember Tapia Romero the the procedural directive specifically says if the nature of the Whistleblower complaint is about the superintendent of Albuquerque Public Schools the president of the Board of Education shell designate an appropriate department or individual of his or her choice to complete an inquiry or concern the president of the Board of Education designation forward the information resolution in any necessary recommendations from the inquiry to the executive director of the student parent Employee Service Center for appropriate follow up so that's what we have done I can gather that information to go out to the board which is the last paragraph and I recommend that we actually look at that in conjunction with the evaluation on so that we look at it and we pull it all together so that there's a context for that around the evaluation you know in that's coming up in February so we can take a look at all of that

[00:29:00]
great thank you okay any other questions and this is Barbara I I agree that I think it should be maybe in during the evaluation and it should be where we have the opportunity to have some discussion about context because I think contacts is really important with especially when especially when they're unconfirmed I mean an example of an unconfirmed kind of complaint is teacher friend of mine had a whistleblower drinking on the job and being accused of being under the influence and the reality was she was having chemotherapy and taking it and it made her unstable

[00:30:00]
made her balance unstable there is no grounds for the complaint and so it gets dropped and I think lots of times it's those kinds of complaints but I think it's why it's so important that we have the details so if it really does reflect something that has more to do with climate and within a school or a real trend of complaints about one specific either program person I think all of these issues do you need to be handled in a very respectful way because there are things that need to be addressed that are valid and we really have a responsibility

[00:31:00]
there are other things that are more nebulous but we still need to look at and then there are things that are really and truly unfounded and have been made for whatever reason thank you anything anything else did I hear somebody know okay I mean and this is just something that has just kind of always concerned concerned me is that it goes to I think is doing an absolutely fabulous job but when it comes to I mean she is just you know I'm just very happy with everything that she's done so I just want you to know that TC but when it comes to the superintendent and things go to her and then they go to the president TC is and her supervisor and her boss is Mr Elder and so why

[00:32:00]
I've always been for having Like An Inspector General that sits outside of you know APS just because of that relationship and so I think that's something that you know has just always since I first got on the board has just always been concerning to me no matter who the superintendent was so I think that's something that we need to also think about and so then the question if no one else has anything the only question that I have is Riser is when I'm looking at the complaints and we're looking at the you know by by location and we're looking at elementary middle high and then we're looking at district and so there's you know 24 compliant at the district level so I just kind of if you kind of look at any Trends there when it comes to at the district level do you see anything that might be going on because when you're looking at

[00:33:00]
you know 24 and when you think about how many employees and you know kids and parents are at a high school I'm just wondering if you see something there Amber Mueller Aragon what I will say is where I have seen any kind of Trends reporting we have utilized our outside investigators so that it is an impartial individual doing that investigation so you'll see that there's quite a few listed with an outside investigator which I'm looking for that the external and the type of investigation external was and internal was 30 is that what you're talking about so where I do see a trend we have

[00:34:00]
investigator and so for example in previous reports I've talked about repeat reporting so maybe two or three people reported the same incidents that increase the numbers so even though there's eight outside investigators that those investigators might be looking into multiple reports so and that way it is very unbiased and those interviews are done by somebody outside of Albuquerque Public Schools okay thank you if there isn't anything else I need emotion and a second so I will move to accept the ethical Advocate statistics for the period of July 1st 2022 through December 31st 2022 thank you this is Barbara I'll second okay wonderful Doctor Albright if I could have a roll call vote please

[00:35:00]

[00:36:00]
