[00:01:00]
make sure if there's any additional items that need to be removed remove them now otherwise no further discussion will be needed for the additional items are there any other items we need to remove besides for a 4D and 4 pm if I can or if I can ask get adoption of the January 25th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda with the removal of 4844 as well as approval of the June 22nd 2022 July 27th 2022 finance committee meeting minutes so our next item for consideration and action will be

[00:02:00]
item 4A which is consideration for approval of office of innovation and school choice request for Arps or funds to support unfinished and accelerated learning this is a discussion action item Mr Mark Garcia will be speaking on this but I'm going to open it up to the board for questions and I will actually turn it over there we are to board member Mirada go in for your questions thank you all for coming what I thought it was just really important for the office of innovation to really talk about this money that you're asking for but also to tell all the successes that you have seen when we're spending you know a million dollars we want to make sure that you know the public does you know know what we're using it for and it's to improve student outcomes because that is

[00:03:00]
you know that is our goal and so I know there were you know I wasn't the only one that had some questions but if you all could just kind of go over it and not everything that you gave us but I think some of the things that we wanted to to focus to focus on I would really appreciate that thank you madam chair members of the board we appreciate this opportunity to talk more about our request as we all know the pandemic had a disproportionately greater impact on many students many students for various reasons and the one big bucket from Esser is unfinished learning and when we really have the opportunity to look at this funding and what our team could do in the circle of influence that we have with the schools that we work with we truly believe that with our experience with Magnet School in construction that we really could have a profound

[00:04:00]
impact on helping students that were disproportionately affected by the pandemic of really for learning loss and students that have seen greater gaps in their outcomes so we really want to take the experience that we have from our msap magnet schools that work with Garfield Mission and Valley high school for the last five years the team really has worked with those schools on theme based instructions to stem education and we have seen improve graduation rates and academic performance we have also seen academic performance higher than the district when you look at the last name for example the district is a whole the average was 35.4 per cent and when you look at magnet schools for ELA

[00:05:00]
we're at 40.5% and when you look at math the district as a whole was 25.5 % and when you look at magnet schools as a whole we were at 28.5% so our proposal really is to allow all of our 21 magnet schools the opportunity to have Focus professional development in regards to unfinished learning and accelerated learning and right now the MSA magnet schools of America they have PDS professional development aligned to unfinished learning and accelerated learning so we would like to organize and work with schools specifically for that but in addition to that we would like the opportunity to send teachers and principals to national conferences magnet schools of America National Conference and what this gives us the opportunity

[00:06:00]
to do is to see what's happening nationally at the national stage what is the most Innovative teaching and learning practices happening in our country and we've had the opportunity to the msap grant to send groups of of teachers and principals specifically from the engineer in the future schools and sprinkling of other schools but this opportunity to this funding imagine all 21 School having this opportunity and it just really excites me about what we can bring back in the district and being a magnet school there's a responsibility and that responsibility is to be a model school for all schools in this District we want to have the opportunity to improve our practice but then also be demonstration schools for others in the district so that we're sharing what we learned we want to move forward as a whole and

[00:07:00]
we really want to build a culture that every school is each Families First Choice in this District we want to build an ecosystem for families and children of support and belonging in their schools great thank you have some questions associated with that so I just if you could tell us what I have your your goals when it comes to improving math and literacy proficiency and I think they are great goals to have so I don't know if everybody else has this or not but their goals are to go from 40.5 in the spring 2022 to 50% in Spring 2024 for ELA k through eight and to go from 28.5 percent in math in Springfield and so those are

[00:08:00]
Eagles but I'm sure that the schools will reach them and the other thing that I wanted to if you could if you could tell me I know the graduation rates at Valley went up I think like 13 points do you know was that the highest of all of all of the other schools between 2018 and 2021 I think it was one of the highest increases but also Academy High School saw around at 16% increase as well but yes so it just tells you what this kind of you know educating our kids does I mean it's just it's such a phenomenal program I think the concerned the only concern I have is when we have grants they end so we know we had the engineering the future for five years so that's going to go away and then now we're hoping we're going to have cultivating the future which will will help with this as well but

[00:09:00]
I know just getting the money and you all are doing all kind of finding all kinds of ways to get the money but beyond the grants and everything else you want to do I know you're just it's it's easy to sell this I know it's easy to sell it but do you have a real sustainability plan beyond what you have listed because I think that's important and I feel it should just come from you know the state and it should just be in there but do you have a plan Madam chair members of the board so looking at poster funding the office of innovation will work on sustaining funding through Congressional Omnibus funds which we have just currently received for Rio Grande High School in Mountain View and with that relationship with a congressman Google home we'd like to show growth and like to show how well we're using that money and expand

[00:10:00]
Omnibus funds for the district this is the first time Albuquerque Public Schools has ever received ominous funds so that will really hopeful about that we're also looking at legislative grants we're going to also again apply for the msap grant for our cultivating the future and by environmental stem pathway looking at State Appropriations Federal discretionary grants also you know really looking at flexible and Innovative budget spending shared and or stipend basement line positions and then also in this year's House Bill 2 we believe that there's 12 million dollars for the PD to create Innovative Zone grants and if that is in that bill that's something that we are going to proceed Madam chair and members of the board to I think it's it's important to realize too we've done an amazing job of building

[00:11:00]
City with our trainers in the district and that's important because we have District trainers and National Trainers for instance for project lead the way we have five trainers that are we can use and utilize for the district for sustainability purposes you want to have as many trainers and build that sustainability with capacity of professional development so we have those trainers in the district so that all teachers and all schools can utilize them so that's one big goal that we have done is for the sustainability plan is having several people trained in different capacities so the district can you utilize them that's great thank you thank you I'll turn it over to you for questions one specific question about the allocation of t e for the Cindy High Court

[00:12:00]
is it really and truly well when that high Madam chair members of the board when you looked at the numbers that we put I believe it was $188 is that correct or Sandia what was the number of students and it was $124 to $188 students so Madam chair members of the board so for the 1888 students we accounted for the students who are in the Junior and senior IB diploma program and for the 1224 staff are intention is to provide this opportunity not just for the teachers but for every teacher at San Diego High School okay that makes sense and I'm happy to hear that will any of this funding expand beyond the magnet schools I mean one of my concerns with magnets especially when they don't

[00:13:00]
honor the boundaries that for the location where they're sighted is that it really means that only students that can provide transportation really have access to it so it automatically creates a different Community School Community then neighborhood schools do but I think I mean I think they do some really important work in Innovation but I know their teachers and every single school that really are working on innovative ways of of teaching and so what in the magnet program expands beyond the walls of the specific schools of the board just in regards to your first thought in regards to access to magnets

[00:14:00]
did I really want to work on for our team to deliver on this next year during the magnet schools of choice week magnet Choice week which was this last week I would like to develop Parent Academy that way we can work with families on how to navigate the choice process and how to navigate the system itself that's one goal I have just in regards to equity and access but in regards to schools being able to benefit from this professional development when I think back to the covid-19 pandemic and how much are virtual schools really helped the entire District you know flip the switch of face to face instruction to online instruction if we hadn't had those Innovative models in our district to provide that we would have been you know really on the on the back seat so we're always thinking how can we incubate replicate

[00:15:00]
you know what we're doing and really how do we invite schools to be part of this so I think if you know if we are approved this opportunity I think we would like to to brainstorm about how to involve you know teachers from across the district but also at a minimum all of our magnet schools have the responsibility to be demonstration schools so we would open our doors for interested in teachers to be part of that I appreciate that I am also concerned I don't have to leave their home school to find Innovation and I think it's really important to figure out when when we have best practices or when teachers at traditional schools have program and approaches teaching strategies and

[00:16:00]
how do we get them support to so I think that's something that's a district that we always need to keep in mind and Madam chair members of the board for an example of what we've done to have that scale go out to all schools we've had several teachers from the magnet world go to SD which is a national Innovative conference for technology and our coaches have created a file that we've shared with all four zones that have Innovative practices that can go out to all teachers so that's just an example of giving a taste to all schools of bring professional trainers coming back to the district and being able to extend that to other schools as well cuz I think that's very important some schools don't have the money to do national conferences but it's very important to share these practices because these are all our students in APS thank you thank you do we have any further questions or discussions on the side item okay without that

[00:17:00]
find me I move for approval of the office of innovation and school choice request for AARP extra funds to support unfinished and accelerated learning all second this is Danielle thank you Miss King if I have a roll call please Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes I gave me a letter yes yes Barbara Peterson yes Courtney's yes so our next item for consideration is item D which is consideration for approval of function transfers for Grant budget for the month of December 2022 this is a discussion action item we have missed Michaela in here yes and I will open it up to you for discussion cuz I know we had some questions on this particular item thank you so much Madam chair members of the board for presenting for your consideration

[00:18:00]
Google the grand management across interface and transfers for the month of December 2022 with a slight change we would like to request to request your approval with the exception of the item referencing with the exception of the item referencing the budget transfer 4K and W which requires a longer notification of public for the corporation of public broadcasting if you have any questions on this we also have a dentist thank you I will open it up to the board for any discussion or questions on this particular item

[00:19:00]
so they just needed more time because the corporation of public broadcasting request that amount of time is that it's my understanding that it is part of the guidelines for this notification to be put to the public for a certain amount of time and this was not sufficient to allow for that we will be bringing this item back to your consideration in our next Finance meeting okay so we will not be taking any action on this particular item tonight so I'm asking for an amended motion I move to approve the intersection transfers for Grant budget for the month of December 22nd with the removal of the k a n w

[00:20:00]
yes so our next item for consideration is item P which is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equal or exceeds 250,000 dollars this is for covid-19 Rapid test antigen at home test kits I can't wait to have to say this word anymore and it's a discussion action item we have missed Charlotte did I say that correctly she will be speaking on this particular matter and I will actually open it up to the board for any additional questions or discussion on this item is for the boards pleasure I think we all have Cheryl Brubaker from nursing services in Julie

[00:21:00]
all of that so this year so I saw this was just a little bit alarming to me that there are insurances that I guess APS offers that don't allow for coverage of some of these tests and so that is obviously concerning to concerning to me because I understand that most insurance is cover up to eight months so I'm just wondering why would we have I mean this is important for people that need to have a test and don't have the ability to buy them so I don't understand why we would have insurance that won't allow for coverage of the eight cast

[00:22:00]
Madam chairman and members of the board and superintendent we are considering testing for students and not just stack correct and there are students who have no health insurance correct we we certainly do have a few staff members who may choose not to have health insurance but we do have a requirement by the public education department to provide a type of testing program and we thought that the over the counter at home test was the least expensive and gave the most choice to families and staff and students and staff test negative for covid and they feel up to it they're able to return to the school environment more quickly

[00:23:00]
and I I do I understand that it's alarming to me still that there are students who don't have insurance or you know if they're on Medicaid or whatever and that we're not willing to provide those for free to them anyhow so that's just still alarming to me I'm sure it is to you as well you know what I mean we can't say anything else that it should just be provided the the other question that I have I know that you had said that during the fall I'm reading from one of the questions I guess you during the fall of 2023 which we haven't got to so I'm just assuming that was just a typo and it was the fall of 2022 that there was an opportunity to request no cost test kids that were made available through the CDC reopening of schools program and that you did take advantage of that opportunity

[00:24:00]
so is that opportunity still available or it was just for I mean cuz I know that's when I ordered a whole bunch of tests when they were like oh you can get these two Madam chair member of the board members of the board superintendent Elder the Department of Health we have been able to this point to obtain just over $165,000 test kits through the deal Department of Health over the summer time they didn't notify schools and districts that they would no longer have funding available for the purchasing of test kits and at schools and districts that were wishing to provide testing services and employees would have to be prepared to purchase them in August of 2022 an announcement was made through the public education department the CDC has

[00:25:00]
Graham and they were able to provide additional tests at no cost to school districts the distribution of these tests to schools and school districts was through the Department of Health those orders were taken in the fall of 2022 APS to take advantage of those orders at this time there hasn't been any further notification of other opportunities to order test at no cost through the Department of Health I do assure you that if that announcement is made APS will be quick to respond and order again versus purchasing test kits if given the opportunity to do so so up to this point we have been able to obtain over $165,000 test kits we have distributed approximately 150,000 to schools in departments to hand out to students and staff as needed over the course of the past 10 months period that have been distributed how many

[00:26:00]
I have those all been used in or just distributed many have been used we've had several departments in schools respond since those distributions requesting more to replenish their inventory so it's something that is ongoing and his schools and departments start to run low on their inventory we ask that they notify the district so we can replenish their inventory okay and is there a way because I don't know sometimes this is missing is a way for a school that maybe hasn't used very many right I know there are schools that they haven't used a lot of them and then there are schools that have used all of their supply a way to get those you know before we start purchasing anything that we get those that haven't been used to those schools that really need them is that being done yes we have metal chair members of boards super we have a network of nurses who keep their ears to the ground and they say hey I have

[00:27:00]
this many items can we trade you know whether it's Band-Aids whether it's covid testing kits whatever it is we figure out a way to make sure we can get what we need okay that's that's very important because often that's that's lacking so I'm glad that it isn't in this case so we're just going to as I understand we're just going to buy them as we need them so when we run out of the ones that we got at no cost then we'll start purchasing we'll start purchasing them there then correct correct we wanted to have the opportunity to respond to the disease environment in real time it's hard to predict and as you know we've had our USB influenza covid all hitting at the same time and everybody needing to test whether they had already

[00:28:00]
or covid they didn't know which one it was all they could come up with is okay well it's not covid we don't have testing for influenza we don't have testing for our recipe we don't have testing for the common cold and I'm not trying to say that we want to be able to do those but while we still have a requirement from the Department of Health and ped to provide some kind of a testing program for covid we have tried to do it in a way that is judicious and careful with our dollars right I just remember at the beginning of covid that we ordered like tons like I don't know how many masks they were just filled up everywhere so I think this is making sure that we don't we don't do that again also because the tests do expire so we want to order them on as needed basis so that they just

[00:29:00]
those are my questions thank you thank you and I have a question on this as well the funding that we're using for this is this Esser okay that was it and you answered my order and used questioned already so I just have a quick comment I just want to State first is just just to commend Dr Bruce Baker and the school health Team I know that APS does an amazing job with nurses in terms of How It's organized and the operational side of that just having been connected with school health in the past APS has a really incredible School nursing team so I know that there's there's a lot that goes on there now just wanted to remind school board members that another important announcement has come out nationally that we have to pay attention to and that's the number of folks are going to be losing health insurance I believe as

[00:30:00]
March is what I understand so individuals who were eligible for Medicaid are going to be dropped off those rules so there's going to be a big Cliff effect and I know that the that there's really a lot of push going on to at least keep our children covered but we have a lot of adults and a lot of families who you know it's unfortunate that health insurance sometimes is tied to employment and not all employers offer it so we're going to see a huge Cliff effect I think with some of our family members that are going to be without health insurance as of March thank you madam chairman and members of the board if I could add one thing even if someone has insurance they don't always have access to be able to get the test ordered and insurance is going to require a provider order that the test be done or that it be done in an office and

[00:31:00]
getting that access is oftentimes limited and getting the care where the families are especially in the schools is a really appropriate way to make sure that we are preserving the health and well-being of our entire Community I agree thank you do we have any additional questions we have not taken a stand as a board but as individuals we can all be talking to her legislators about ways to expand health coverage for students look at our goals and if we don't have healthy kids that I don't care what our goals are we're not going to be able to make them and so as individuals we can definitely be talking and and just the work that the nurses have done over the last three years has been incredible teaming up with

[00:32:00]
Doh folks that have been out there reaching out to families making sure that kids are brought in and there's a connection that's maintained so just thank you to you and your whole department thank you good night and so the comments prompted a question for me this idea of access reminded me that I was so impressed at Highland High School when they had this community effort to bring in families and children for for shots of hugs and every District

[00:33:00]
get like school districts we have a great effort among the nurses to make sure that there is Outreach to the community the situation at Highland High School was very headed by Lily and Palmer she is the one nurse in the district been around longer than me and and she says she will never retire she wants to be at the schools and wants to be providing services for these kids and the nurses that we have on board have in general the same attitude and I've managed to get a few of the ones that didn't have the appropriate attitude to update the results

[00:34:00]
thank you I'll have to follow up with you about getting that information out to the various districts thank you thank you I'd like to make a motion to approve the district purchase of expenditure or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for covid-19 Rapid antigen test test test kits that was terrible I said that awful but I think you all know what I want I'll second item thank you missing if I will call Police Academy of Romero yes thank you ladies thank you so our next item for discussion is item a which is an update on the fiscal year

[00:35:00]
2023 budget and pre-planning for fiscal year I think we have to do that the rest of the consent agenda or we need to go so we just we need a motion picture yes yes yes yes yes yes yes now our next item for discussion is item a update for the fiscal year 2023 budget and pre-planning for fiscal year 2024 this is a discussion only item and I will turn it over to miss Montoya you have the floor

[00:36:00]
Madam chair members of the board in superintendent Elder I am here to present an update to our budget planning process you should have a copy of the annual budget calendar the calendar you have is a high is just at a high level but I want to also give you some dates of importance we are preparing our school budget call templates which will be sending out on February 24th and those will be due back to us on March 20th this gives the principles time to review and make adjustments to their budgets before sending them to the associate superintendents who then return them to us with their approval by March 20th the March 20th deadline so shortly after sending out those templates we have a workshop for the principals giving them guidance on how to finalize their budget this is actually helpful for new principals

[00:37:00]
and myself and the team are available to them through office hours throughout the entire process and during this time the budget analyst work directly with them to get through any issues they may run into then on the week of March 13th we will send out the budget call templates to each of the Departments who will also have two weeks to review before returning them to us and that's kind of like internally what we're doing but also along with that I did want to mention that we are also I wanted to give you an update on what we're doing to prepare ourselves for the transition to student base budgeting so we have reached out to ERS which stands for Education resource strategies for Guidance with this process they have assisted many school districts to achieve this transition and how they

[00:38:00]
can they begin analyzing our resources to see how they can align with the district's goals as well as best practice and so they provide planning and analytic support to districts and help implement the student-based budgeting systems and Equity metrics reports they have worked with other districts far size such as the other APS Atlanta Public Schools who successfully rolled out a student bass funding system they also helps Santa Fe Public Schools when they did their transition and when we met with them they were able to give us a high level timeline indicating that this process usually will take about three years so year one were in year one now and by 24 year so during this time we will provide them with details of our current

[00:39:00]
process and start and they will start going over steps with us as to how we can prepare to transition to student based budgeting so the following year fy22 we will begin with a few pilot schools who will be fully trained on this new process and we will learn from these pilot schools how to improve and refine the process and then in FY 2656 budget we will be fully transitioned into student base budgeting so it's a long process but we're excited that we have at least started to embark on this transition and with that we will stand for questions thank you that was really helpful I enjoyed that last breakdown 3 years old but I understand so but I'm actually going to open this up to the

[00:40:00]
item to see if you have any specific questions regarding the budget and I'll start with board member if I could wait okay so if you could just I'm a big fan of zero based budgeting so can you tell me I mean this sounds kind of like it because you're starting from you're starting all about the kids so it's like you're it's like kind of like starting from zero so can you tell me what the difference is between 0 base budgeting and between student based budgeting what will you know what will the public be able to see that looks really different similar so you we will start each year kind of at a 0%

[00:41:00]
but what is different is that each time that they put in the you know if we send out the templates and of just saying you know I'm going to use these teachers you know 20 years 20 education assistance whatever each one will be associated with one of the goals one of the Strategic plan it will directly point to that area and so hopefully what you will be able to see right now you just see dollar amounts as a whole lump sum and what you'll be able to see in the future in students budgeting is you'll be able to see how much of each of those buckets are going directly to one of the goals or strategic pillars of the boardroom it goes back to the students needs instead of enrollment of course enrollment is important

[00:42:00]
but it also take in the other considerations of the funding that is needed for the students to be successful but you're looking at student outcomes and I know that's your focus so it's it's looking at more to make them Successful by having the funds allocated so we'll still get funded by the state by enrollment but then when it gets to us and we have that bucket of money then we're going to focus on each of those goals and how and each school is going to have to do that so that sounds good to me oh it'll be exciting to see it when it's fully implemented so do you have any idea when you said you're going to begin with pilot schools are you going to start with like high schools you're going to start with elementary schools are you going to have a mix Madam chair members of the board we are hoping that we would have a mix a little

[00:43:00]
set of each you know like an elementary school or a couple of elementary schools couple of middle schools couple of high schools and I think in part of the process we're going to start with probably principles that already have kind of some Finance Savvy cuz it's going to be a big transition for them instead of us doing a lot of the work up front for them and then giving it to them it's going to be the opposite we're going to just give them a lump sum According to some formula or whatever we figure out and then and then they'll probably have to do the kind of budgeting and and designating it out now of course we're not going to leave them fully on their own the budget analyst will serve now more as you know an advisor to them and kind of guide them along the way so it's just going to be a transition and I think it's going to be exciting I have one thing I did want to mention is that along

[00:44:00]
this way in the process we've been doing a lot of research and we've come across some really cool software that can even show exactly these budgets and not be right now we build the budget book and it's just right at the time that we build it you just see it the data lots of data but what we're trying to possibly go towards we have to see if we have funding but for it is a more of like a dashboard looking type book so it would still be all the data from the budget book but you could look in there and drill down to it and just see you know to the transactional level or just look at a high level and it would be a living document that would update automatically as people are spending the funds that's our hope I am not going to promise that we actually get that part but that's we would desire to be able to to have some

[00:45:00]
so then in the diagnostic year then you're going to really be trying to help principals like know what they're doing is there going to be like real face-to-face kind of training of all of the principals Madam chair members of the board yes we believe we haven't fully gotten the whole scope of work from from the vendor but what they kind of seem to show is that they're they're going to train us all so on how to help them right and and then they're going to train them on the steps of that they would need to take so it will be a big training year the first probably I would say right now we're going to really just look at the scope what we want to have get let them know how we currently are doing our budgets and what we would like our end result

[00:46:00]
they have a lot of different examples of other schools that they've you know gone through this process with so we will pick and choose and they already have like templates of how how to do this process so I think it's going to be a pretty much a training year this year and then it'll continue next year but next the next year with those pilot areas they'll actually have hands on practice and it'll still be training as they go specially for the analysts to do some of the training with them and then for those pilot schools are you going to let it be like on a volunteer basis or you're going to pick up we have been quite decided that yet I'm sorry we haven't quite decided that yet but I I envisioned that we would pick people that are already kind of pretty Savvy with we already know which principles struggle a little more than

[00:47:00]
where is on which or which ones are are really good at looking at budgets and maybe from other experiences that they have they they know how to really build a budget I would I would hope that maybe we would pick those that are already pretty Savvy with budget preparation so that we don't get somebody that struggles and and makes it seem like it's very difficult and then we can learn from those that even if they're Savvy and what issues are still coming up and we can learn so that we can train better train the the whole group so that we don't have these issues and principles aren't scared of the process and of embracing it well I'm excited I'm excited that we're putting kids first in their needs first and that's what I always wanted and so I think that's a good thing and I'm just excited to see it good for you guys yay thank you

[00:48:00]
I love the idea of starting off with our strengths right so picking those individual schools that definitely show some strength so that we could build off of that so that's always that's always a great practice so thank you for doing that I really don't have any specific questions other than I'm really pleased to hear that you all have like a real like timeline in mind so as we're building the budget this year I I know superintendent you really have had some conversations with her principles already around the you know the expectations from the board in terms of like looking at what the goals are looking at so I think we're starting to set the conditions for success and starting to set the at least the framework of where we are so I'm wondering if with this year's budget templates and you know the instructions there to is that we're all so still starting from that conversation of like remember your goals remember the guardrails so as

[00:49:00]
so I don't want it to sound like this is just beginning this has been something that came on July and it was one of the first things we put in front of her Department have been engaged in a series of trainings they traveled to Cleveland they've been working with economics number of groups have been provided to us I think what's come clear is that we can do that at the school level but we also have to do with the district level and honestly my budget office to this new system we needed some more support and so we stepped up and sort of

[00:50:00]
yes you'll begin to see in this year's budget from my Department's from the schools we have to relate back to the goals you've now selected and we have to justify things but to realign the entire district is going to take some time 3 years is a little more than I had hoped but you've got to start somewhere and we will be getting I mean we're starting now so it's not completely from ground zero or we started in July was we're not complete and Ground Zero but we need some support and that's why you hear what they're presenting tonight thank you thank you period

[00:51:00]
search extant have to do with sustainability that when we have to budget because of by virtue of Grants and legislature when we have to end up budgeting year to year we can't really budget we we do what we can and so I think there are some structural issues that the best on the board can keep addressing with other elected officials and meanwhile you all are taking care of business internally and I really appreciate that thank you so much I'm super excited about that I do have two questions just related to the budget process overall so one is are we anticipating a budget that is a cut so we can talk further from we did last year and I know it's hard not knowing where the legislature is going to land but what are you anticipating right now

[00:52:00]
and then two I think as you know one of my biggest concerns with the last budget was just wanting Clarity around the impact for the students that the Yazzie Martinez settlement has declared that we need to be investing in so not cutting from them so when we see budget documents this go around will we be able to see the impact on the Aussie Aussie Martinez student groups two questions for their justifications we're going to have to ask more detail around those specific areas which we did not have last year so that will help us and I do think as far as reduction you're right we kind of have to guess we know that down again we're down for the first time or below so I think we're 699

[00:53:00]
we'll do the best we can to keep them as far from the schools as possible but like I said last year it just gets to a point where there's going to be some reductions but some of that will be applied simply in nutrition at the schools and in terms of Staffing so you may see some shifting again as far as that goes I think some of the decisions were proposing for the right sizing will help in many ways because we have some schools where students traditionally leave for at least a few years before they come back I'm thinking that we will retain some kids and that will help at least in specific areas and potentially with some programming but so we will try to have a better as you requested a better justification of of how that works sometimes from the budget office it's a little hard for them to actually make the connection between the student and the money and so we're going to have to really be thoughtful about that as we present to you next year it's hard what's your

[00:54:00]
not the system we've operated under so that's been the process that we're trying to adapt to this year and then I hope with these guys is help it'll get easier as we move forward yeah thank you for that and I guess the follow-up question as you also know I was pushing for guardrails in the context of the budget cuts last year so considering that there's potential reduction in the budget this year superintendent Elder what guidance Vision guardrails do you need to be able to help inform where those cuts go and sort of in the context of what will be talking about next we have some proposed guardrails in front of us we don't know yet how that conversation is going to go but is there a guardrail in particular that would help you make the tough decisions you're going to have to make as it relates to potential reductions yeah I'm sure there is I'm sure there is

[00:55:00]
I think I don't have the actual language for that that that that that perfect guardrail a couple of the ones I suggested last week or it should be whenever that was 2 weeks ago there was something about trying to make sure that we don't have a breach and safety policies and procedures you know we can't find things in a way that make things unsafe for kids and staff so that's something we're going to have to keep an eye on and I think we're going to have to be really clear with what the Baseline allocation is and what does it mean sufficient to run a school and I don't know how you write that guard rail board member I have spent a lot of time reading guardrails from across the country last month I haven't seen one specific to budget that I thought was the Panacea but I appreciate the concept and I think we can certainly discuss it tonight if I can throw out

[00:56:00]
so I have a feeling there was something behind the question but if there is I look forward to hearing it okay great thank you thank you board member Jackson So yeah so just just to kind of finish off board member Gonzalez's thought about when cuts are made and cuz I think last year we did ask questions about what the what the programs were how those were affected and it took a while for that answer to get to us if it ever really did so looking forward if there are programs that are going to need to be cut obviously we would want to know how that is going to how it will affect student outcomes and you know in the hierarchy of how we are moving forward now obviously anything that's going to affect student outcomes needs to be cut

[00:57:00]
so I guess I'm just pre pre pre prepping you or prepping you that if cuts are made and that they're done in that fashion and then the justification is brought forward early so that it would be nice if all that information was in front of us and didn't have to be gathered so that's the first thing and then kind of going back to the discussion about ERS I too am super excited and I loved hearing you say that it is going to be the budget will take into account the student needs and not the enrollment so that is wonderful to hear you did mention that Santa Fe Public Schools has already adopted this or are in the process of adopting this they are there are already doing this yes they are already doing it I believe I can't remember the exact year but they've already been doing it for a couple of years okay and so we kind of have like a

[00:58:00]
District that we can look to to see how it's working and and we can use some of their best practices as well I'm guessing yes and and Dr Bowman actually was a part in in that transition so I think it must have been already some time yet there and so he was one of the ones that suggested possibly going with the IRS and so when when we met with with them he was in the meeting okay so is there any way we can go a little faster I think I mean it's just a question they really emphasized on not pushing it because of the change management they said that

[00:59:00]
management with the principles and even with the community is going to take some time and we want to get it right you know we want to make sure and get it right so I think that's our goal okay yeah I like it yeah and exactly what you had said you know this consultant has great experience and you know they've helped other large districts so we're going to benefit from their best practices so we're not like a guinea pig you know they have done this and we are going to benefit because they see what what works and what might not work so I think we're in a very good spot because of that well I think we're also in a very good spot because one thing I did pick up from what superintendent Elder said it sounds like you guys took the initiative to go out and look for this and you heard what we said last year and so I just want

[01:00:00]
do you offer praise that you took the initiative to do that and so it's very appreciated I think everybody truly understands this move towards student outcomes and how it's affecting every department so thank you for for being willing to to take that risk and to take this on and I think just some of the other questions can be addressed later as we move through the process but thank you for kind of getting on board with reform and change and putting students first and just it's really appreciated thank you thank you and she kind of stole the words right out of my mouth because I wanted to say the same just commend you and your team is up a doctor from the moment you took this particular position you were eager and ready you know to start Leading The Way of the whole District was headed and I appreciate that you know and you could see it reflected in your entire team I don't know what happened to behind the scenes but what you tell us and

[01:01:00]
you know your willingness to adapt to change cuz I know it's hard it's appreciated so thank you and everything that you're doing and being able to answer our questions and support the district as a whole and you were probably one of the first people who started using the terminology of student outcomes and goals and guard rails and outputs and inputs before even many of us got used to the language so thank you for doing that and I'm excited like again this three year like again that just got my brain like wow but I understand why behind it and again like you said we want to get it right we want to make sure that we make an effective impact and the changes that are needed for our students so I'm excited as we begin you know all these different phases you know we're going to have all the questions surrounded around you know with it but I'm confident in your team and what you're doing and if it's an honor to share this this committee with you so thank you so I think we're good any other I'll go back to board member cuz I'm so sorry no worries

[01:02:00]
music to my ears is that you're going to be methodical and you're not going to rush we're just too big a district and we already have pushed and so far it's gone well but when it comes to money I think we have to be careful so I appreciate you know I appreciate everybody behind or above helping you the fact that you got together and are talking that's wonderful so we're headed in the right direction thank you thank you thank you ladies appreciate it so

[01:03:00]
so our next finance committee meeting will be held in February of 2023 we don't have that date just yet on their February no okay I'm just looking over but it will be in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown or virtually at www.aps.edu so with this meeting being add it will be followed by a special Board of Education meeting thank you so now we're moving right along on to our next meeting so welcome to the board of education's special board meeting and I would like to call the meeting to order and Miss King may have a roll call please please period

[01:04:00]
so community members May attend the aps Board of Education meeting in person at the Allison Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or by watching the live stream on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel so our first item for consideration and action is adoption of the January 25th 2023 special Board of Education meeting agenda so I think on this one I just need some clarification because the consent calendar we did go through and we approve those items so I believe that we can just call it as a consent item I don't think we have to pull them out so I may have a motion place so move I move that we accepted or actually just the adoption of the January 25th meeting a joke I have a real call police you needed a second

[01:05:00]
calendar items and this would be with the changes from the finance committee meeting I may have motion please I move to approve they can sense the consent item agenda with the Amendments as made whole second album yes okay so our next item for conversation is there a student outcomes Focus governance and we're going to have consideration for approval of golf focused on school climate and social

[01:06:00]
emotional learning and our guard rails anticipate we have lots of discussion on this one so we have superintendent Elder and Ashley pause with the Council of great City Schools to help lead us through this conversation so you all have the floor who wants to go first would start I'm ready I just wanted to give you an opportunity to say anything if you if you want to thank you for all for having me again tonight I'm excited to be here with you I want to highlight a couple of things before we move into today's conversation so first prior to today our time together has really been spent on how you as a board will honor your communities Vision so during last week's board meeting you took a huge step towards doing just that when you adopted

[01:07:00]
three student outcome goals now the board hasn't completely closed the book on that conversation as you still have one priority left to discuss so tonight will Begin by continuing that conversation but first I'd like to highlight what has already been decided so last week you adopted three student outcomes these goals honor the student outcomes that your community set as priorities and they focus on high need Student outcomes that have been revealed through your current student performance data your community said that students should have the technical knowledge and soft skills that will allow them to thrive after graduation so you adopted a goal around us the community said that students should be stronger readers writers and communicators so you would have to go to strengthen Proficiency in English language arts a specifically for the early early years your community

[01:08:00]
also said that they want students to be better problem solvers and critical thinkers with strong computation skills so you adopted a goal to build Proficiency in mathematics now you were very specific that you want to focus on the highest need Learners in your district with the understanding that that Rising tide will lifts all boats you are also clear that which measurements you will use for each of your student outcome goals and you said a minimum expectation for growth of 10% over 5 years while still leaving space for yourself to make sure that your goals are attainable while rigorous put more simply they're going to challenge adult behaviors to change you made it clear that you have a starting point and ending point a starting date in an ending date now this is a long way of saying that you have made your goals smart they honor your communities vision and their grounded in the current reality for students in

[01:09:00]
in doing this you have honored your word to your community now I can get really overwhelmed in this work when I start to think about all of the things that I still have to I still need to get done all of the things that haven't been done yet and so I lose sight of what has been accomplished that's why it was important for me tonight to just highlight how far you'll have already come in such a short amount of time so the remaining steps that in this first phase of students focused governance implementation are to deliberate social emotional learning tonight and I identify where this priority works best for your bored as a student outcome goal or as a guardrail then you're going to discuss an additional one to five priorities for how you will protect your communities values you'll do this by articulating guard rails

[01:10:00]
those are those guard rails have to be clear about what should not be done in pursuit of your student outcomes goals finally this phase will be complete when you understand how the superintendent interprets your work through the interim goals and interim guardrails which you will all monitor throughout the school year fiscal year your goal for the end of tonight's meeting is to walk away with a minimum of one guard rail or maximum of five and potentially one more goal so before we proceed what questions do you have for tonight's meeting there any questions on the board nope I mean well let me go with board member again thank you I have a question just about the timeline it is we're doing tonight relative to the February 1st

[01:11:00]
eating when we will be approving goals and guardrails so are we just drafting tonight and then when will we see the interim measures for both goals and guardrails so tonight you're just drafting your guard rails and the potentially one more goal I I will divert defer to superintendent Elder as a superintendent is who selects the interims but I will be clear that it is my coaching that the board so you've already adopted goals but it's actually important for guard rails that you should know how they're going to be interpreted before you adopt them because if you don't and there they end up not being aligned with the vision of your community or the values of your community then it could lead to a lot of heartbreak for you all and not just you on the diet but all of the members of the administration who have put in a lot of work

[01:12:00]
making these things happen so it'll be a lot of heartbreak for you all but it would also be really unfortunate for kids and so that's that's my coaching as with everything my coaching is my coaching and the decisions are yours to make as the board cuz y'all are the elected officials so board member Gonzalez I think what I anticipate is that will potentially establish forth golden Knight work on some cards in room work for this semester is specifically lined as strategic plan you guys have asked for by monthly updates on the Strategic plan what we're working on right now to establish priorities we're going to start moving into trying to figure out what the initiatives are so we can meet the goals so I'll be able to report back to you guys regularly on how the progress is being made to build the infrastructure that you're talking about then next year we can begin to look at the interim goals and start

[01:13:00]
data every time we come but we may be looking at zones and maybe looking at grade levels and maybe looking at subgroups of students on some of the interim assessment work that we've got so that's I'm going to have to continue to build that we're not quite there because we're still sort of looking at the guard rails and waiting for that but we've been working so immediately the work that's a strategic plan and getting everything in place I believe is our interim goals so that we can only I guess that makes sense so what I'm hearing from you and tell superintendent Elder makes sense but what I'm hearing from Miss pause is that we should not adopt our goals or guard rails which is scheduled for February 1st until we have seen and approve or whatever seen in discussed the interim goals and guardrails in a measures so how do those two things align well what I just

[01:14:00]
what we're going to have to do is really look at how we're trying to get our interim Assessments in line so I think I can give you a better idea as far as you know how we're going to do this once we I think as far as the academic goals those two measurements I think are pretty easy as far as the interim assessments the third goal we're going to have we haven't really banged out a lot of thoughts on those rooms yet to be honest and I don't know about so I'm going to be able to provide some I think a basic structure and how we see our innermost assessments aligning to the the large State assessment and that's where is done over the years and they've tried to find correlations between assessment so those will be some of the interim goals that will be

[01:15:00]
as we come up with that data to share with you and then talk about what sort of interventions were helping to the schools that demonstrated need for it that's about the best I can do right now I've received the same coaching I think you all have I'm working on those goals those interim goals when I'm really focused on right now is trying to get that strategic plan so that we can get the initiatives in place to start really getting the work done so in the context of the February 1st meeting for which will receive the materials potentially Friday will be will we receive anything with the February 1st materials related to potential interim goals or draft ideas or placeholders Friday well whenever we get the okay unlikely

[01:16:00]
Bible movies quickly as I can with the interim goals for the like I said for the two academic goals we think we can because we have to answer the resources of interim superintendent that on those goals so let's just pick the literacy one for example that an interim goal would be something that would potentially be related to like maybe first graders and sort of the internal work that they're doing there and you know how they might be progressing towards literacy

[01:17:00]
so you know some sort of looking at it in a progressive way so that we're looking at sort of marching up to the the literacy goal for that that we've set for for that for that grade and so I'd like to just take a pause here for a minute and ask our coach Ashley can you give us some guidance on this in terms of like a potentially about how we might be able to to get to this and what are February 1st meeting should really look like then if we're at it sounds like there's a struggle here there's a bit of you know still not a lot of clarity I think with the district side around how to set those intervals yeah and I'm also happy to visit more one-on-one with older and whoever on the team we need to schedule that with to help so the thing as I'm listening to this

[01:18:00]
station one of the things that I am hearing is that there is So the plan is to adopt the the goal or the guardrail and then develop the strategy so taking you all back to everyone who attended back to your 2-day workshop together so we talked about inputs outputs and outcomes so inputs are going to be your strategies those are strategies resources that are dedicated to achieving your goals to a cheap to implementing your educational program so those those are inputs very clearly are those are the decision those decisions are made by the superintendent they should only be made by the superintendent because the superintendent is the person who has to be accountable for

[01:19:00]
what does implants so if the board picks the inputs then it's really really difficult if not impossible to hold the superintendent for a cat for accountable for them so the next thing is the outputs so the outputs are the direct result of the inputs so if you if one of the inputs is restorative practices then your output is going to be how many students are are given or given those opportunities for restorative circles throughout the a quarter or the year or however often you decide or the superintendent decides that he would like to report those to you so that was that would be an input that's output the outcome is at the end of the year or at the end of the cycle what is impact for the entire program so we in sosg we are very clear

[01:20:00]
about your goals needing to be focused on student outcomes so you have student outcomes that are very specifically what students know and or are able to do and so that is a student outcome anything that is not a student outcome is an adult outcome so student.com goals are the first so the board has to pick the student outcome goals that's what you did for the most part so you adopted three students at your last meeting tonight you're going to have dialogue about SEL and whether or not that would be a goal or a guardrail and it's and it really is what the what the board decides so you you you you you you have by the end of this meeting ideally you will have adopted or you will have identified four

[01:21:00]
outcomes that are going to be your priorities for how resources are allocated throughout the district so the that is the first thing that has to happen is the board has to articulate your student not come goals Additionally you articulate guardrails these are specific limitations on the superintendent's Authority that protect your values they guard we talked about guard rails like on the highway guardrails protect you from gearing into ongoing traffic or ongoing traffic from coming into you this is protecting the values of your community in pursuit of those goals so those are your outcomes that you that you as a board are creating priorities for the next step is not to identify the inputs the next step is to identify the outputs these are we call these interim goals and interim guard rails these are the measures that you'll look at throughout the year goals you'll look at interim goals you'll look at at least

[01:22:00]
once per quarter and your interim guardrails you'll look at at least once per year so I may I cuz I think we understand that part yeah we're stuck is getting from the goal to making sure that we have interims because it seems like there's there's a bit of a there's that's where we're stuck I think we understand the concept of where you're leading yeah so I just want to say this first before you go on is that it's clear to the board in terms of the distinction between goals and guardrails I think we're real clear about our distinction two in terms of the role we have in setting that and I think we've agreed to that part okay where I think we're we're struggling is is that we know what we have to do tonight too is potentially either have another goal or and plus we're going to have a set of

[01:23:00]
what else do we need to accomplish tonight so that when we're meeting next week on the 1st to be able to adopt this because it sounds like we can't move forward if we don't know the interims and so it's that's the disconnect is how to get from here point a on the golden guard rail to interims and that's that seems to be the struggle a little bit Yeah so the reason I made the clarification of inputs outputs and outcomes and student outcomes is because the order that they are selected is first support your outcomes then the superintendent identifies the outputs those are your goals and your girls once those interims are selected then you start building the strategy

[01:24:00]
now it's in strategic planning which all belongs to the superintendent and that's the work that he's doing with the tuned that you have additional they have goals and they have progressed measures kpis whatever terminology they use that the superintendent should be looking at throughout the throughout the term to understand he needs to understand what the that progress is so that he can report to the board on the progress that you're going to be measuring through your interims you're the board should not be measuring anything beyond what is your goals your guard rails and your insurance Madam president I just did it all meet with Miss pause before Friday I think I understand kind of what we're doing and I feel pretty good about that academic goals if we absolutely have to have

[01:25:00]
minimum goals before next Wednesday I don't think I'm going to be able to meet that but if you I will do my best to provide you with exactly what you was required I think you will have your goals I think you'll have your guard rails and an idea of how we plan to measure those on the interim basis so I will meet with her and work on exactly what it is we need to provide for you okay I do I do have a recommendation as well go ahead so the work that you're doing tonight and the work that is in preparation for your meeting on the 1st one one thing that you can do is you can adopt your guard rails as and your potential other goal you can adopt them as like a first reading of your of your goals your guardrails or

[01:26:00]
this is what we are adopting pending our you know review of the of the draft guard rails and to provide clarification the board doesn't adopt them but the but you do need to understand that because that's how you know that what you have adopted is clear and and is reflective of what the communities vision and values are so the reason it's an important distinction is if you were to adopt guard rails next week and they were not interpreted the way that you intend by the superintendent then he could come at the in April May whenever they have the Strategic plan written and they could not be aligned and so what happens is not that well one it's not in alignment so the board then has the option to go back and rewrite them so

[01:27:00]
you are an alignment that would be really unfortunate to go through all of that strategic planning work to put all of that effort into it and not know that there that a misalignment exists this is more of a communication issue than than a technical issue so you could you could you could adopt kind of a first reading so to speak of your goals and your guard rails and then have the final once you have the official or you also don't have to you know you're just you just need to understand what his interpretation is and so it doesn't have to be fully realized language but understanding what the what the interpretation is for how he what the things are that he will do and recommend to bring back to the board for

[01:28:00]
monitor throughout the course of your 5-year-olds and I guess for us the difficulty is that the first is the week away and so you know is that have we set a realistic timeline for ourselves you know given this piece so perhaps what we need to do is just go through the exercise tonight figure out we're going to have another goal and figure out some guard rails and then I think by the end of the night we might know how realistic it is for what we're going to do on the first although we've already kind of like our approving gender you know we will have student outcomes Focus governance as a topical piece that we could do and there's still work that we could do on the first but I just don't know what that means yet and that's where we're stuck so it's there's just there's a little bit of a disconnect and I agree with superintendent Elder the two of you can get together you know quickly and somehow is just sort of give some

[01:29:00]
guidance on sort of this on this piece so that we can make sure that when we come on the 1st that we have something to actually look at discuss or what's the piece so I would recommend that we just go ahead and push forward with let's talk about whether we're going to have a fourth goal or we're going to go straight to guardrails so if we could just step into that conversation I think we'll just do that and then we'll we'll let this part rest for a minute is there any other discussion on this before we move forward board member Gonzalez do you have anything else to add know but I think board member Miller auto going to have a question and I had before mine so a question just of the process is because we approve the agenda then would we have to table approving the goal in the garden rails I think we'll be able to answer that question later this evening after we've said potentially

[01:30:00]
and the other guardrails to see how it's being interpreted by the superman okay and then I mean I'm just going to because I was just confused about this whole process and what the timeline was going to be and so I and the reason is because I went back and I read you know everything you would give us and I it says that we have that you were reiterating the importance of the interim goals and interim guard rails to be presented to the board before they are adopted and then what what could happen according to what you wrote To Us is that this could like put push back the time frame if things are like you said are misaligned and so of course that's a concern but I'd rather do it right and push it you know if that it has to get pushed I wanted to do it the right way and I don't want to waste you know

[01:31:00]
waste our time if we are supposed to really know what those interim goals and interim guardrails are before we spend our time and then we may have to you know redo the language so that's a concern to me times important to everybody so I don't I mean I don't know if you can speak to that at all Ashley so yeah so when when I say when I talk about adopting if you were to adopt them which I want to be clear you absolutely can adopt them without seeing the interims that's a judgment call that you all have to make its again you're the board you're the elected officials this is your process I'm just here to help guide you along the way this is it if you were to choose to do that and if there is misalignment then you you could come back and change your language to make it more specific so that alignment exists when I talk about it

[01:32:00]
they're potentially being unfortunate consequences what you just spoke to is exactly what I'm what I'm referring to and unfortunate consequences and so you're absolutely right this is this is 100% a process that requires deliberate speed and so you know and the coaching is not new and I've been saying this for a while but it's also I've been you know there's y'all have done a lot of very short amount of time so it's all so understandable that this might be that it could have gotten missed or whatever but the important thing is is that you all feel comfortable moving forward and really one of the things that like again you don't have to have fully realized and from goals but at the very least if

[01:33:00]
if you could have like the general areas and and I'm again I'm happy to work with superintendent Elder between now and Wednesday to try to pull that together or 10 for when you can expect that and so I just want to also be clear to that and I just want to be really careful cuz I don't I don't have the exact language in front of me but I believe we adopted three goals so we've already adopted three goals without knowing the interim so so we're already you know out of the Chute on those and making sure that we have those we can speak to the interim so that so so I think that said everybody wants to do this the right way I'm not overly concerned about I mean I'm not overly concerned that we're going to just really mess this up I mean I think that we're we're boarding

[01:34:00]
meaning just like probably some other boards I've been paying attention to also all the videos and such that you sent me and so I mean the struggle that we're having Is Not Unusual so so that I want to also put there but I think let's just go ahead and move forward then with the discussion first of this approach on this potential fourth goal and I think we'll start there on the conversation are we going to have a fourth goal around social emotional learning and climate and I guess we can start our discussion there about what's proposed because there was everyone received a document that had some proposed language around this fourth goal and I think that's where we need to start in terms of like what's proposed and you know what kind of questions we have our thoughts are on that so how would you recommend that we started this conversation

[01:35:00]
if you if I'm and I'm not 100% sure about what information you have in front of you does everyone have access to that language is proposed okay and does everyone have access to the questions that I sent over I know I sent them over really late which is my I take full responsibility for that so the questions around at the very top of that page questions to ask when evaluating goals the easiest ways probably is just to look at those questions and reconcile them with the proposed language so I know that the Administration has a goal that they'd like to propose the why don't we start with that first thank you madam president report so you have in front of you proposed language says proposed fourth goal for get that one little bit over

[01:36:00]
we have been doing a lot of work on this and we have been doing work around castle and one of the reasons we're not going with the proposed goal that you saw at the front of the page is the castle Rubik really doesn't do what we think you're trying to do is and it's not made to measure sort of the things you're looking to measure it's helpful it's good but even Castle says they don't think it's a line quite with what you're asking us to do so we're comfortable suggesting something else so under other suggestions you see the first suggestion there we'd like to suggest a modification to that but increase the percent of students who feel safe engaged and connected from September 2023 to why in March of 2029 as measured by an evidence-based and a line tool period

[01:37:00]
what has happened with SEL is something of a cottage industry has erupted and there's a lot of tools and there's a lot of people throwing a lot of items at us we've been looking at a couple including Panorama and we would like and there's been a lot of work so I brought with me today is Dr Bernice Gutierrez and Allison pocha who's here to answer technical questions and they're part of the SEL team and there's been a lot of work done to start sending out resources and supports to the schools but we begin to realize to measure what you want some similar to the talk about the budget we've got to build an infrastructure to make sure that the teachers have the resources and that they can measure it some of the issues with some of the goals that were suggested and what we've discovered from some of these tools is that they can be used in a lot of different ways and a lot of different times so one of the questions we're going to have for you tonight is which grades are you specifically thinking of

[01:38:00]
we're proposing probably third grade up because we were concerned with some of the younger kids when you asked them some of the questions about say feeling connected or valued they're going to take exactly how they feel in the moment right there's also some concern and that's fine I mean maybe that's what you're trying to measure I'm not sure but also Dr Gutierrez has done this work in Salt Lake City she was mentioning to me that some of the issues especially the younger ones is you can't use the language you can't use the words it has to be emojis it has to be and so there's a level of difficulty and some of that translation work that can be done probably in an individual level but it gets harder as you start spreading it out across the district the other thing where were discovered is that some of these tools can be used different times we're proposing twice years that we measure them at one point in a year and a second Point that's why I was a little hesitant to say exactly September March

[01:39:00]
whenever we're going to try to propose that when the because we have to figure out who owns this as well one of the logistical issues is me who will give this survey will it be something that comes out from the district will be something to be done in the classroom is this one more thing we're asking teachers to do so that's what we need some feedback from you and kind of how you see wanting to do this work so the we're very comfortable with the language as far as students who feel safe engaged valued and connected help us with the dates and will continue to do the work on the on the tool if you have any questions about the work that's ongoing or why they're asking for a little bit more time to work on the tool that's why I have Dr Gutierrez and Allison here as well period so do we have any questions I'd like to hear from doctor with us in terms of some of the worker what you saw in Salt Lake City and how this you know how this could

[01:40:00]
yeah because I think it's going to be important for you as the leader of this is it doable is it you know what are we asking too much but how can we get this done and it would be would be logical so that's what I'm curious about Absolutely I'll give you sorry madam members of the board and superintendent Elder I'll give you a really brief summary of the work that was rolled out in Salt Lake City and it was definitely a five-year process with very intentional and strategic components that were rolled out so that we could build upon them the tools are the people that really are going to have to decide when to how often so that we can measure them in Salt Lake we did do K12 with Emojis but there was a discussion about how valid is the data for

[01:41:00]
we could modify the language but some of the language of the surveys you need to make sure that it's being comprehended by the students and that's why we went with safe engaged valued and connected rather than the next one because it's really hard to codify and measure love right that's that's really hard but we have things in place already that we can align and utilize to measure safety engagement whether or not students feel connected and whether or not they feel valued like I said it got rolled out K12 we did a sign it to counselors it was given in October and April reason being that wants to do the October 1:00

[01:42:00]
you pretty much stabilized and you know that those those are the kids that are going to be in the school before that you know you have some movement and then April so that we could do it prior to sort of that pre-summer fever and get a real read for where the students were there's a lot of work that has already been done here in APS that is very exciting there's a strong Foundation like in Salt Lake Castle is one of the one of the works that helps to inform the work but it's not the soul inform informing the word Castle is great but there are other items as well there's already standards that have been worked on I can statements foundational professional development so we're not starting from zero which is very good

[01:43:00]
we just need to figure out how are we going to measure this how often are we going to measure it who's going to own it and what is going to be the roll out how are we really going to roll this out over the next five years so that by the time we get to 2029 we have strong data to show that we've made games in these areas I know I have I have a lot of questions but I'm going to defer so well let me go to board member Gonzalez thank you I have many but I will start with the contention that loved can't be measured which is not accurate and so in the challenge and prepared index was actually created by DCPS with a tuned when they put together their strategic plan 10 years ago so loved is essentially the

[01:44:00]
placeholder word for sense of belonging which is measured on the Panorama survey and other surveys so they chose the word loved because sense of belonging is more confusing to the community so loved is measured by sense of belonging in the specific questions which are aligned in the Panorama survey so that's just one point the other is just in terms of the age appropriate in a developmental appropriate list of the various surveys and I agree that castle is not validated for these purposes but certainly five is Panorama conditions for learning are and our validated for the age groups that they're used with so there's no additional modification that we as a district would need to do for the younger grades because they're written for them because they're validated for them and Panorama is validated for grades three through 12 the 5 years is validated for grades

[01:45:00]
play K through 12 and conditions for learning is validated for 2 to 12 so to answer your question superintendent order from my perspective I think it would make sense to do it for what is validated with the survey so I would so for example if we pick Panorama we would not want to do it for grades K-12 so I wanted to turn to the part below the other suggestions where it says research where it says that there's seven skills skills mindset habits that are most aligned to students success so this is sort of based on the 3M what do we know from social emotional learning about what matters is measurable and is malleable so these seven things pass through that 3M filter so I won't read them but as I looked at the list that you read out and connected I don't see those show up in terms of the list of validated skills so perhaps engaged is

[01:46:00]
Marshall curiosity and perhaps connected is social awareness but what I'm most interested in is if we know that seven particular skills of mindsets are most aligned to Student Success why don't we prioritize those ones and in the context of the loved challenged and prepared index what that is measuring is perseverance self-management which is the same as self-regulation and self-efficacy which is the same as social is no self-awareness self-awareness so if I could see that's on their self efficacy and so I guess as I consider amongst the other suggestions I would be inclined to push for the second one increase the percentage of students who feel loved Challenge and prepared because the indicators are more aligned to the research because it's already been validated because it's already been used by other districts for years

[01:47:00]
and because we know which indicators across the Panorama survey are measured there so that's more of a response than a question but I'm just curious what was it about safe engaged valued and connected that led you to choose those to be measured so just based on my experience in Salt Lake and the roll out that we had their these are the four that are more in my mind at least in my experience we can connect them more to the castle the five in the castle wheel and we could connect them to the seven skills and mindset that you're talking about so even self-regulation to me that connects to safety I would have to give you a better answer to do a correlation rather than just doing it on the spot but those four just based on my experience in Salt Lake and this is not

[01:48:00]
but having gone through one of these rollouts before those are the ones that in my experience we will be better able to codify and to track and have data for any other questions when I look at the the statements that came back in the feedback summary for what was important to adult entire reason that we're even looking at a fourth goal is soft skills that the term soft skills is what was overwhelming throughout the district and the feedback and when I look at what soft skills is referring to and the terminology that I heard over and over throughout the district it was

[01:49:00]
confidence self-management empathy time management grit self-regulation efficacy stuff like that so I I I I I I I I think I would prefer that we set a goal that directly addresses what our community is asking us to provide and all do respect what I did not hear was engaged value connected I heard very specific terminology regarding soft skills and so thankfully I have a board member that I can ask these questions of and I was able to look at DCPS and how they are rolling out a soft skill goal because I will admit I too was thinking how how do you what does loved

[01:50:00]
but to see that it means it's a sense of belonging I think that is very much what was correlated what was the feedback from the community is that they want they want our kids to have a sense of belonging so kind of going to the conversation that you had about how this is going to be put together I would say that it's already been put together that we can look at and DCPS and see how they put this index together how it was measured you know that you you mean they have the play The Playbook they have how they created the culture of the lcps index and so I think that's a long way of me saying that I too would prefer to see the second one where we address loved Challenge and prep

[01:51:00]
because those have a more direct correlation to what our community is requesting of us I want to remind people that United voices for newcomers came and presented and asked us to they wanted more time and I'm not asking that you know that we delay but I what I am asking is for us to consider what you heard that evening and I think I feel a burden or not a burden but

[01:52:00]
I feel compelled to wait what they said that evening when you don't know how to get to the bathroom because you don't know the words I'd say you're not very connected you're not safe I'm just trying to and and actually had that experience working with refugees in Salt Lake City so how how did both those experiences

[01:53:00]
bringing the belonging piece to this we did discuss belonging in Salt Lake tonight I really apologize I feel like I'm saying that way too much we did consider belonging and we did and actually a book study of a book called belonging to a culture of dignity that really talks about how Equity has been very poorly implemented in districts across the country and how we could do better but they Define so the authors Define belonging as having four components which is treated fairly feeling valued being validated and feeling affirmed so whether it's loved or belonging I agree with you board member Jackson in my mind or synonymous and for our newcomers and refugees that component of access and

[01:54:00]
there's a piece of assimilation of learning how School works in the United States like you said why do I have to raise my hand to go to the bathroom and maybe this is my first time with indoor plumbing or one of the things just a really funny anecdote we had too many refugees with lunch balances because they thought they could go through the lunch line as many times as they wanted to get food because we had not taken the time to teach them you get one free lunch you can't have three we'd love for you to have as many as you like but we just can't do that so that's the piece that could be under prepared it could also be under connected whichever one of the two that you think best would fit I would just like to request that we end at and a line tool

[01:55:00]
period I'm just concerned about listing any program any one tool because of what the superintendent said in his introduction this is an evolving field there's a lot out there and we want to ensure that we make you know the best selections for students in APS so okay that we recently had to face but it's been an underlying it's been a current and so do we have to stick to only safe engaged valued and connected or can we bring up

[01:56:00]
challenged which I think was also a concern or is that more academic you know did we capture that and I mean I have a thought on that because I was thinking is like is it really increase the you know the percent of students who can demonstrate or who have the skills the mindset and the habits that are most aligned to Student Success so that we don't really know so that we're just aligning it to the things that we want them to be able to know and do which is to have skills mindsets and habits keep going back to the goal conversation it's about what students know and are able to do and so as I'm reading this

[01:57:00]
I'm struggling a little bit because it sounds like a guardrail because it's you know it's about what what we we want them you know we're not we're going to create this or we're not going to I can't even talk in that negative piece the way that it does it but if we're going to turn it into a goal to me it seems like we should increase the percent of students that have the skills the mindsets in the habits that are most aligned to Student Success and you know we reference these kinds of things I it seems like you're going to be able to to measure like a growth mindset or intellectual curiosity those things would come out through other ways as well so I'm just I'm thinking out loud because this is where we are and board member of a lot of turn to you here and I would say would you just said because that's just what I was feeling and I just wanted to say is who is who is making the child feel

[01:58:00]
safe what is an adult doing to make the child safe the child is not in my opinion this is just my opinion is not doing anything it's up to the adults to make sure the kids are safe it's up to the adults to make that child feel that they're important in their valued that they're welcome that they belong there it's what the adults are doing and you can correct me Ashley if I'm wrong but we're supposed to be focusing on what the child can do not know what the adults do to make them feel that way am I wrong I mean cuz then I'm also thinking about you know using loved just being a mom and every mom has probably heard this your kids get mad at you when they're you know 10 and they tell you you don't love me well if that's the day that they have to say that they feel loved while they're not going to feel loved that day because they're mad

[01:59:00]
if I didn't let him go somewhere or something so that doesn't mean that they're not but on that day they could have said that but I just think when I'm listening to all of this this is all you know the feeling safe engaged value connected safe is all things that adults will do to make sure that the child feels that damn phone it shows that I'm unmuted can you hear me now so board member Eragon you are correct and I want to be clear that this is what I'm when I say that this is everything that has been mentioned is not a student that doesn't mean that it's not important and that it shouldn't be a priority of the board but it's it's just it's

[02:00:00]
literally not everything that has been discussed with the exception of when a board member Jackson talked about the community survey and she mentioned some of the very specific things that were on the community survey that came back as what students are able to do those those are the only things that have been mentioned so far that had that are actually a measure and they're not even a measure they're just things that students have control over and but it's really really everything that you all have identified as priorities and that I'm hearing that you that you want to measure our adult outcomes it is what adults are doing for students is the climate that adults are creating for students it's the conditions that adults are creating for students it's very different than you know students being able to read

[02:01:00]
that is that is an actual skill that a student can demonstrate you can argue that feeling loved feeling belonging are are things that a student can demonstrate but they are in all of the measures around that are those specific skills are measures about what adults are doing for students and so as I'm listening to this I'm as you all are talking and I've heard it sounds like your staff has done a tremendous job and trying to pull together some work that honors the priorities that you will have set and from what I what I'm hearing is you have a really good guard rail around adult creating conditions for adults not creating conditions where students don't feel loved belonging and challenged and it sounds like they also may have met have some identified things that could be potentials

[02:02:00]
but you know that that's my coaching you know it's again you you all are the board you're the elected officials you'll have to make the decisions but so far everything has really been focused on student or adults and monitoring adults and what they are doing for kids so then I mean I just thought it would be a good guard rail because any adult Any teacher wants their children to feel all of these things but I was thinking that should be a guard rail and what I had written as a guard rail was the superintendent she'll not neglect the social emotional well-being of all students and will provide the necessary resources and support systems to maintain and improve their well-being I mean that's just where I thought it should that's just where I thought

[02:03:00]
Google so that's my two cents and if I can provide just a little bit of feedback on that so that is excellent language my my only coaching is that I would stop right before you say and because up until that point you're saying this is what the superintendent shall not do once you get to and you start saying what he should do and that's and you can't do that I wish we could still be on my school board if we could really want it I know I know I want but I just wanted to lift up a suggested in a potential goal language which is the percent of students who demonstrates the skills might demonstrate the skills to life success perseverance and perseverance

[02:04:00]
so that would be both student outcomes that we heard from our community that tremendously matter those are also measurable we know in the in the Panorama survey so I think and you know we can certainly do the from X to Y over time thing so I think that may be a way to get us what we need for what it's worth the love Challenge and prepared index does measure those it is validated it is in use by other districts and it would get us more so I like the love Challenge and prepared index however if we want to take out the loved and challenged the prepared literally is perseverance self-regulation and self-efficacy increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills mindsets and habits

[02:05:00]
list the lines to life success colon perseverance self-regulation and self-efficacy which in the LCP index are the SEL topics directly related to prepared but I don't I don't feel comfortable with us directing the the type of tool because I think that's an input that the district would get to determine no I'm not I was just so okay okay so and by the way you guys all in your email now should have what that LCP index is so that we're all looking at the same thing but I wasn't I wasn't trying to direct which okay survey used I was just it was helpful to me to understand how

[02:06:00]
terminology could then be related to what our community is telling us and they're telling us that soft skills are soft skills is on every single line here except for two our community wants us to address this if our community wants us to address this I think it needs to be addressed in a goal because we are supposed to represent the vision of our community we need to be responsive to that and I am I am in favor of making this a fourth goal sorry this is how well our students

[02:07:00]
how are students are able to achieve high expectations how are students are able to persevere through setbacks this is how our I think I and I and I put visions of my children in my head is I want them to learn how if they come up against an obstacle how they can overcome that and I and I yes the learning in school just like they're going to learn the quadratic equation those are both outcomes and so I think I I would disagree respectfully that these are not students that these are not I don't think that I just want to I was just trying to think of the distinction between a goal and a guardrail and so as stated in terms of how a board member console is his lifted it up and stated it

[02:08:00]
[Speech recognition failed]

[02:09:00]
so I'm looking at the research 7 skills and mindsets I think it is important to add social awareness to the other ones that were stated and I think when we talked about what the communities asking for one of the things that came up over and over again was empathy and giving back to the community and so I think if in adopting the school I think it's important to add social awareness I understand the argument for keeping it as a guard rail but my feeling is that unless we have social emotional will being as a goal is going to get sidetracked

[02:10:00]
it's not going to be implemented with the same seriousness and and finally I think it's already been stated but just say again the tool I think has to be in the hands of the administration I mean first off we're not in a position to decide to purchase something I think there's a legal process that goes along with that and I think it's got to be in the hands of the administration can I can I just add some most success and perhaps it should be most aligned to life success such as and we can say perseverance self-efficacy social awareness you know maybe outlining some of the seven habits or do we just even State the seven habits after that I mean I'm just how is self-efficacy different than

[02:11:00]
perseverance or I was going to align it with something else but actually I didn't self-regulation and self-awareness was pretty much I think they are aligned I think we can combine that South Africa to see would be aligned with confidence belief that they could complete something or do something I think that's what I heard I say we use words with the community and I'm not I'm not subject to whatever conditions are imposed on me I've got

[02:12:00]
level of Engagement that comes with empowerment so I do think that because we're picking specific research validated indicators we should be clear on that for the purpose of our goal for the purpose of Public Communication like yeah totally let's say and put the instead of social awareness like that totally fine with that but I think in terms of being really clear about what we're directing the district to prioritize I think we should stick to what's been validated to respond to your question around like such as versus Colin I guess I worry that such as just leaves it a little too broad for them to pick anything and so I did have a conversation with AJ crabel about this and I was like hey let's put all seven because this is what matters and his response was the more narrow and specific and focus

[02:13:00]
we are the better we enable the district to also be narrow and specific and focused so I think what we have now is increase the percentage of potentially increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills mind Simpson habits most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness from X in year to why and year as measured by an evidence-based and aligned tools no you're fine thank you know I don't want to repeat what's already been said but I do feel like it's important that we do recognize that goal of what's been spoken with in all of our community outreach meetings that we had and personally I when I was reading the two different suggestions you know between safe engage valued and then the

[02:14:00]
once I read into it and saw how it was validated and explained you know at in DC now it makes sense but without knowing it it's hard to make that Coalition of what is going to work and how we can apply it to our district but I like the new the new verbiage that you came up because I was to saying okay now that's a guardrail and we're making it about what the adults need to be producing versus making it you know how it applies directly to our students so with the new verbiage I'm I don't need to continue to repeat what you all said but I agree with that done before because I know you were on the fence how are you feeling about this I mean I still I still think it's a guard rail and I get the whole soft skills cuz that was just so important that was so important for our community and I think it every

[02:15:00]
on every listening session I went to they were talking about that my concern I guess is that I'm thinking of it is we're putting this enormous responsibility that we already put on teachers to begin with that they have to do all this academic stuff which is important and why we're here and I understand you learn better if you're socially emotionally well I get that but to put more on them that I just don't know how much control they they really have over that and then I'm concerned about how it will how it will look that are we then becoming liable for their social emotional health and if we are

[02:16:00]
and I don't know that we are with you know the change in verbiage but if we are then what else are we going to be responsible for if we're taking that that on on top of the academics so that just that concerns me and I would really like an attorney to be able to go know you're not going to be liable so if we pick one of these you know whatever it was it we're going to be measuring and the children you know have an improved from X to this well then are we liable when that child commits or attempts to commit suicide or does commit suicide or does bring a gun to school so that's where my mind goes I think we just asked so much of our teachers are Educators to begin with and then just to put this on them because then

[02:17:00]
School District become liable for that as well I don't know where you going to say something superintendent I think it was certainly we could run that by someone and get response but there's always potential liability when we remove some of the liability anyways I don't I I mean the reality is liable I can't give you a perfect answer so we wouldn't be if somebody did that whether we had this goal or not we're still potentially liable I mean I just seen and I'm sure you have also is where

[02:18:00]
current sues the school or sues the district because they should have known by looking at whatever measure that that child was in need of more help and so we've seen that like not just a few times it's like we've seen it several times and I know people can sue for for anything but I just go how much liability are we going to take on and not that I don't believe that children should feel all this thing all these things and I believe that the majority of our teachers make sure that the kids are safe and feel loved and feel cared for and feel valued and you know that's just my concern because that's where I always go just that's having husband and lots of friends as lawyers so what can I say period

[02:19:00]
you know what I will say is that we are in experiencing I think in our state the result of a lawsuit because some of these things were missed and so I think it takes a lot of Courage you know for us to also sort of call it out and and and and and really you know we are Community really pull this into an area that was really important to them around you know things that we want our students to have because you know we heard a lot about a lot about reading I think that definitely came up but number two was all around soft skills and it was really all around these things that as board member Consolidated things that would lead to life success because you know perseverance and confidence and you know

[02:20:00]
the social awareness those are all the pieces that we need but I think we also can see in the Ozzie Martinez lawsuit that it is calling us out I think also on not just the missed academic learning but also the social emotional pieces that were that were definitely done if we really truly can measure this and we really truly can demonstrate that students you know are really learning and that you know there's a way for them to know these things and be able to do these things it will be interesting I think for us as a district to sort of look where the gaps are too because I'm really I'm concerned about you know are those gaps based on you know the demographics is it based on a social economics you know but those kinds of pieces I think it could help us a lot also to direct what

[02:21:00]
find the resources we may need in a school to really help develop further habits in these ways that could help our students be really successful as adults so I do like I do like the way that it's it's worded this way because I think it does measure exactly things that students should know and be able to do as long as the district feels that they can actually measure it so that they could you know they could ask board member said you know X from this year to text to something else so even with that being said like and I agree with what you said president that just because like it's hard does it mean we go away from it because ultimately we have been held liable for not meeting the needs of our of our students in the goals and we need to ensure that we we do what we're supposed to do the right thing

[02:22:00]
you know and people like you said people will sue no matter what and I think ultimately we have to be able to put this in as a goal and reflect the needs of our community so and I know I know Ashley wants to say something but I'm going to actually just throw it out there and I'm going to make a motion to put out oh gosh I have to say it exactly what we said goal number four go ahead go ahead and make your you make the motion I'm ready to do a motion actually is bigger shaking her head she could shake her head but can we put emotion wait she wants to hear from you so I don't think that you are I don't think you have voting on the agenda for these tonight and so if that's if that's not the case you can't make it you can't make a motion I just want to if you can then that's that's fine but I want to keep you all legal we are on discussion

[02:23:00]
well I don't know it says here no no no no no no it's a discussion action so it's consideration for approval of a goal focused on school climate as social emotional learning and guardrails it is a discussion action so we can make a motion I would like to make a motion that we approve a fourth goal related to sel which reads increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills mindsets and habits most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness from X in 2 0 2 3

[02:24:00]
so we can make sure we have it exactly you think you might have had it but we want to verify it yeah so if you could do that that would be great all right so we have a motion and we have a second is there any other discussion no all right so I'll call for roll call please and give me a little Eragon no Danielle Gonzales yes yes yes yes yes okay so we have four goals now we have to go on to guardrails but here's what I want to do I just a little process check we need a little time out because we've been here we need to take a we need to take a little break and just to announce we do have some sandwiches back there if you want to grab something to eat really quickly so we're going to take

[02:39:00]
so let's see who are we waiting on are we waiting on anyone I think we're all here right you have some cabinet members coming down okay so we'll get them hopefully Ashley was able to grab some coffee it's already 9:00 I took a nap earlier so I think we're just waiting on a few more folks to come and join us in the boardroom

[02:40:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:41:00]
you know I don't want you all to wait I don't want to be here till midnight either okay all right so I guess we could just go ahead and get started then we don't need to be counted in or anything I think we're on we're live we're ready to go again we've got the cabinet they're all here so the next conversation that we're going to focus in on and it's really to set our guard rails and on this one I believe we have an option to go to like from one to five we don't have to have like all five and we don't have to have more than one so that's the cool part so and this conversation this is my coaching for my wonderful coach Miss pause saying that

[02:42:00]
this is actually where we kind of have to leave this conversation in terms of what we heard from the community are the most important guard rails for things that you know they they really valued for us to to protect and so I know that there's some proposed guardrails that were sent over to all of us and I think all of us have a list of them the I mean the guard rails came in from suggestions from the district all the way to each of you so Ashley I'm going to turn it over to you as a coach for us and just you know you've seen all of the guard rails we have can you help me just hone in like how would be the way for us to like home in this conversation and lead us to to getting to a product yeah so I'm not going to make it that easy

[02:43:00]
yeah but I am going to give you a good place to start so as you know your guard rails are how the board protects the communities values so the best place to start is by identifying what the highest priority values were that came back from your community during your entire Community listening process so the survey and through all of the engagement sessions and Outreach sessions you had so the first the highest priority that came back from your community was around Equitable access to resources and extra equitable distribution of resources which are basically the same thing it's how how they're being just how resources are being distributed and how students have access to them so a lot of the so this I want to be clear that this is this should not be completed with racial equity

[02:44:00]
which is that isn't it is inclusive of it but that is not the total of it this is also includes equity for students who receive accommodations and special education services equity for students with language differences you know their economic inequities so it's really just giving giving the students regardless of their place in life access to the resources that they need to be successful and so it's really you know if the board so that that was the highest the highest frequency that came back from your community so you know if you were to only adopt one guard rail then that should definitely be or at least it's my recommendation that that be what it is on because that's what your community said

[02:45:00]
that's what they said that they valued so patio feel about starting their let's do it all right so who who would like to go first start throwing it out there this is so Equitable access I have a suggestion for a guard rail it is in the proposed guard rails document it was added a little bit later but I so I'm just going to I'll put it forward the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having effective school and Community Based wrap around and support systems as well as necessary and sufficient resources to ensure proficiency for any student group is at a minimum

[02:46:00]
sustained the reason that I like that so no sorry it didn't make it to the auction so it's in the online kind of like now online now it's now online sorry it didn't get sent in until sorry so in the proposed the Google form it's probably the very last one and I edited it slightly so you want me to read it again the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having effective school and community-based wrap around and support systems as well as necessary and sufficient resources to ensure proficiency for any student group is at a minimum sustained so part of the reason that I like

[02:47:00]
this one is again to the equitable distribution of resources this goes back to a little bit to what I said last week there there is a concern that I have that with a targeted focus on the achievement Gap as it should be focused I understand that there is a concern that I have that that that that that might shift Focus off of groups that are maybe already at proficiency so by having a guardrail that says that necessary and sufficient resources and effective in school Community Based support systems will remain at least sustained I think it's a guard around those schools that are already meeting proficiency to not be forgotten any thoughts on that

[02:48:00]
I like it I have concerns about I mean I mostly like it but how can when you talk about all students having effective school and community-based wrap around and support systems that's an ABC Community School model that is not fully funded for all schools and I just set up for that but I mean how do we address that Lobby super

[02:49:00]
can you tell us where it is I'm sorry you have access to the Google sheet oh he's got it now okay so I was just going to go back I mean cuz the questions are one of the things on the questions is will the guard rail provide flexibility for the superintendent to achieve the boards student outcome goals I mean so I mean if it's all this is assuming that all students will have this effective school and Community Based drop around and support systems I think it's it's a great I love it

[02:50:00]
but like board member Dominguez I'm worried about the ability to actually because I worry about like so for example a school in District 1 that doesn't have necessary and sufficient resources to even ensure proficiency for any student group and how how does the money how do we get the money to really support all that I just worry about it pragmatically in terms of is there going to be what happens when there's not enough resource because I think we're all so up against that in terms of just not enough research and I think we just need to talk through those guard rails like that to that point because I really want to make sure that it's not like a promise on you know kind of thing that we that we can't get there so that's just my first that board member Gonzalez

[02:51:00]
I was going to say the ABC model is one interpretation of what this is I think there's others and so I was going to offer all students having effective school and or community-based wrap around and support systems because there's lots of different services that are school-based or community-based support systems I think the key point is that all kids have what they need and there's going to be different needs based on different schools communities and students so we're saying all students should have support systems sometimes their school base sometimes they're community based in the context of Community Schools obviously there's those Partnerships I'm so I think that's that's my point here is

[02:52:00]
you're asking that how do we put in resources to make sure that at least groups don't fall back because a lot of the language here that makes me nervous is just I don't think you're going to go out right now today or go out 10 years ago or go out 10 years in the future and everybody's going to say we have sufficient resources and I don't know who gets to Define that so I I I I I like the intent of what you're closing here I'm pretty comfortable that I'm just not sure some of the language if it's if it's going to put us in a bind on Earth because I think you hear it from all parts of town we'd like more safety so I guess the my my reply to that would be and I mean I I I'm I do feel like we are sufficiently funded I think

[02:53:00]
you got a God awful amount of money and I don't know that it actually is being diverted the way it needs to be and my hope is based on the budget discussion that we had early earlier with the shift to student need budgeting I think that there is a way that the schools can have sufficient resources because it's going to shift to following the student needs and not necessarily the enrollment and so I I guess I would push back I think we I think we are funded we just are not directing those funds in the way that benefits student outcomes first so remove the budget conversation for just a moment and just dealing with the hiring process and the hiring realities that we deal with

[02:54:00]
play don't have csa's we don't have counselors we're doing pretty good on teachers they're pretty good there other than Special Ed I don't know again how that would play into to some of the services that people would be requiring an article by without to address the needs of children in poverty in public schools currently at 2 to 3% so

[02:55:00]
there's no word woefully underfunded for 70% of the kids 54000 kids that need 40% more so yeah I want to give I want to give Ashley an opportunity to what she she's like to give us some coaching around the school I mean this guardrail thank you know this is so anytime there we have a guard rail that has multiple ends in it I always like to take the board through the process of of examining how what follows each of those and so you know and going through the

[02:56:00]
questions that I provided with you to evaluate the quality of your guard rails so the first yes is clearly states using the shall not or do not language this is clearly protecting one of the communities top values the next question does the guardrail focus on an operational action or a logical logically connected class of actions so when we talk about an a single operational action or class of actions that means is one one person in your Administration or is it going to fall maybe not under one specific person you're going to have multiple people who need to honor the guardrail but is it like it can't be budget and HR and transportation so when I talk about operational actions or class of actions that's that's what it's specifically referring to so when I

[02:57:00]
read this guard rail you talk about wraparound Services Support Services those are clearly connected then it gets into resources which kind of so it's your then going into budgeting and allocation so you kind of have to separate you kind of have two separate operational classes within this Cardwell so it's not bad I'm not saying that but what I am saying is if you want it to focus it needs to either focus on wrap around services and support systems or resource ensure or sufficient resources to ensure proficiency for any student group as a

[02:58:00]
at a minimum is sustained so my coaching is really that at the point so after support systems the comma could turn into a period and everything else should be implied because all of those things are they are inherent in what what is expected in this guard rail and in guard rails period you don't you don't have to explicitly say resources unless the guardrail is specific to like the superintendent shall not allow an equitable allocation of resources but everything is going anything you adopt as a guard rail or is a goal is going to be the priority for how resources are allocated throughout the throughout the budgeting process so it's not like they get to make it have an option those are what the board says is is it gets you know carved in stone as they say

[02:59:00]
so I love that you all are having that conversation it's a smart conversation to have it's also important to to understand that your goals and your guard rails are supposed to challenge adult behaviors to change and that means that if something hasn't currently been a priority for the district or has it been it hasn't been the source of funding and the past that whatever your new goals and your new guard girls are are going to now become priorities so those resources get shifted and I guess that's what that's kind of where I'm going with the coaching of when you have so one you shouldn't have multiple classes of operational actions and and

[03:00:00]
I'm not saying that it does I'm saying that you all have to you all have to decipher and and create Clarity because when you stop writing the superintendent starts interpreting so okay so I'm going to so what I'm hearing you say is that even just with the first part the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having effective let's just say school and Community wrap around and support systems period if that was stated that way then the adult behaviors that have to change on that is a school would have to think about how great or how good or how effective they've been at sort of dealing with those support systems and creating those support system because I mean typically they are doing that anyway I mean to some degree I hope I don't know board member Peterson had something to say right I was going to propose just putting a period after

[03:01:00]
well it's true that the ABC Community School partnership model is not the only way and in fact their schools that don't need it and probably don't want it and have other ways of Meeting those students needs and at the same time for those schools that do have Community Schools when it's absolutely essential that they have the resources that they need so to be effective so I am totally comfortable with the first part of that with the period after systems I have a couple of other proposals that I will wait until we finish it added without all students having affected school and or

[03:02:00]
community-based wraparound does that complicate anything seems to give a little more flexibility it doesn't complicate it for me I mean does it complicated for the other board members if it was stated that way and and I want to go back to board member Jackson because this was her proposal for that first part of it how would you how do you feel about that first well period cuz what I was trying to do was take a couple of the ones that I saw in the the guardrail and align them together that we

[03:03:00]
we need to to operate with effective systems while at the same time making sure that the schools that will not be directly targeted are still funded I mean are still able or I mean that they're not forgotten and I think that goes to the Equitable access and distribution of resources that the first part is the distribution I kind of read the first part of the distribution of resources right that we're having effective support systems that those are that's the distribution part and that the Equitable part is that the resources are necessary and sufficient across the district so I guess my thought was that it it actually addressed the very first

[03:04:00]
which one with the Equitable access and the distribution so I mean is I guess if the first one that's just if it had that pin in it I guess for me is the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having these pieces and support systems is that it speaks to that equity in resource distribution to me I mean I guess because it's saying I mean I saw another guard rail and you know I'm going to say way into there was another guard rail where the superintendent will not allow a school to something something around the fact that they won't allow them to like also underperform you know like it's like sort of like maintaining that performance across our schools if a school is doing well we're not going to let them just suddenly not perform well I don't know I'm not saying it well but

[03:05:00]
the way that I read it the super as if it stopped at that to me it speaks to Equitable resources but I I may be reading too much into it does any how about you I'm going to pick on you for a minute I know you're sitting here studying really hard but I am I'm going through the verbiage because I see what you tried to do board member Jackson with tying together the other ones into the into one is the same sorry my brain is trying to make sense of anyone else go ahead I think what strikes me about the second portion of that is Insurance proficiency for all student groups or any student group

[03:06:00]
and then sustained so you're trying to get the idea of sustained sustained proficiency ensure sustained proficiency for any student group at a minimum but I still think that this needs to be a separate guardrail so I wonder if it would help to maybe hear some of the other ideas for Equitable access and see if kind of instead of just focusing again to try to be efficient if there are other ideas for well let me go back we're working on Equitable access right so I wonder if it would be helpful right now like we can pin this one the way it's written see if there are others that we can mow over and decide of the

[03:07:00]
is that we have which which one really addresses the needs that all of us are trying to meet I mean I was trying to rewrite the one that you and and this is just what I did it doesn't sound exactly like yours did but it's maybe a little bit shorter and so what what I just wrote is the superintendent shall not allow the diversion or removal whichever word of necessary resources needed to ensure proficiency rates of all student subgroups are at a minimum maintained with that in your one of the no I just did it right now with is the two concepts one about equitable distribution of resources and specifically calling out school-based and Community wrap around Support Services the other concept is not about not letting proficiency drive-up

[03:08:00]
and so in the Google Doc the one that is January 17th under other guardrail suggestions number two the superintendent will not allow the district operate without students having effective school and that's one and then the second concept is added on January 17th the first one the superintendent will not allow the performance from any student group to decrease while focusing on closing achievement Gap and we'll maintain the necessary resources there's still two separate Concepts and so I think what board member Jackson was proposing if we stick just focused on the Equitable Thank you period or is there another proposal for how we would reach and I'll just say since I have the mic I'm good with that

[03:09:00]
document the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without students having effective school and or community-based wraparound and support systems to meet all student needs which is number they're not numbered but it's the second one under other guard rail system and then it's like the second guardrail would say something about the loss of maybe but you know maybe because it's so the second one potentially would be the superintendent will not allow I don't like the performance part I don't like that but will not allow or will not decrease necessary resources that we could words with the second one after we agree it seems like we don't want any group to go backwards but I think he but the superintendent doesn't directly

[03:10:00]
he's not in their teaching saying you're not going to go backwards its he will not allow practices I think it needs to say instead of the performance it needs to say will not allow practices that would undermine our result in harm to any any group let's go back I agree with the first one so the first let's just stick with one guard rail so the first guard rail that's being proposed a superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having effective school and community-based wrap around and support systems period Well it currently says sufficient to meet their needs

[03:11:00]
I feel like the one on page one the second seems to it's the same goal but I feel like it's just simplified around that one support systems period so the first page the second to the last paragraph I'll read it again it will not allow the district to operate without students having effective school and Community Based wrap around and support systems sufficient to me all students needs

[03:12:00]
then I would request that we keep the entire thing because I think that the sufficient to meet all students needs is addressing my concerned Ashley looks like you want to give us some coaching here yeah so I like the direction that you are going I just want to bring us back and ask ask the question what is the value that this is that this is protecting and is it are we still talking about distribution of resources yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah are we assess well okay so what do

[03:13:00]
school and Community Based wraparound Services provide do they address soft skills the address what could be all kinds of things well I mean but specifically anything that came up from parents and I'm just throwing that out there as my effort to that's right redirect redirect to what was what was said that all those nights so I suggest that this the guard road is one of the honours one of the values that came up from your community is very specifically focused on wraparound services like student Support Services you can

[03:14:00]
play that you can identify that or the kind of your litmus test is if the superintendent does what does not do what this guard rail is saying that he shall not do then will the Equitable will that value exist will that value be protected so if all students have access to wraparound services and student Support Services then does that ensure that there will be an equitable allocation of funds or can those things happen and you still have inequities in the way that your resources are distributed I mean I think I think part of that question goes to what is equity and and I think that's an ongoing conversation but the the point of equity

[03:15:00]
differentiate it instruction we we need to differentiate what what supports different students need and there may be different amounts of resources that are connected to that but it's absolutely essential I mean I'll just give one little example because I was talking to someone about cognitive load and how it impacts our ability to learn and students ability to learn and I would say that when students have to navigate around homelessness as they walk to school it gives a different cognitive load to them I mean we could call it aces or any number of other things but those students are in need of support services that other students in other schools may not

[03:16:00]
and so I think I think we need to be explicit and clear about that that and Equity came up over and over and over again in the in the meetings and I think it was with the intention of realizing that different groups of students need different amounts of resources to be successful yeah you're absolutely correct those everything you just said is true my question is specifically if so this this card will as proposed is focused on providing student Support Services in wraparound services so if you focus on just those two things can inequities still continue to exist in APS and so while that that is an important an important guard rail my question is

[03:17:00]
is that guard rail responsive to this to the value of the Equitable allocation of resources so my theory is that if we're not a bit specific about saying that student will being Beyond just academics is important if we don't have language in there it does not protect for instance the community school work it doesn't protect the allocation of health clinics it doesn't you know I think we need to have something that does specifically direct towards student will being in how resources are allocated and I hear what your question is Ashley is like although this particular Garden real estate it would help

[03:18:00]
student support and intervention services which is one of the the values that was was listed this alone is not going to address the issues related to Equitable access and distribution of resources so we may need another guardrail for that but I think this particular guard will definitely hits really well on number three and so I think we could let it can we let it rest there and say okay so now we've got to deal with some of like one and two which is the Equitable access to and distribution of resources and number two the differentiated instruction which is really different I mean because I am looking at these and for me I think we have to hit at least one two and three as the top you know values that were there so go ahead so I agree with that and before you said that I was going to offer the superintendent will not allow the district

[03:19:00]
two operate with I had it in my head inequitable distribution of school and community-based wrap around and support systems does that make sense to operate with inequitable distribution of school and community base wrap around and support systems I like that so again it's it's by continuing to but so by still specifying wraparound Services Support Services is that honoring really it's your it's your decision do you all feel that that honors Equitable allocation of resources which is very specific

[03:20:00]
and on that summary document that I shared it's been a couple of months ago or weeks ago but the that has all of the top top frequent or most frequent trends that came up it has definitions on there as well for what your highest ones are and the inequitable allocation of resources was about how how money is spent how students access programs how they access services so it does it is inclusive of that but it is not necessarily holy inclusive and so you all can absolutely choose to be like very focused on what specific programs and services you want to make sure you provide it's my what my coaching is just to make sure that in doing that you're honoring

[03:21:00]
what the value from the community is so like Courtney so we want to kind of just talk about resources is that what you're saying Ashley and not include even though those are resources when you lay them out community-based wrap around and support systems those are resources already so just not maybe named them out so if and this is like to Courtney if if you said the superintendent will not allow the district to operate without all students having effective necessary and sufficient resources so when you get more specific you're you're making it very clear that these are these are the specific resources that we want to make sure everyone has an equitable access to and so by being very specific about those

[03:22:00]
then you are you are also clarifying that that does not include everything else so you would either need to adopted another guard rail or I guess you could choose to adopt another guard rail that includes the other things that are priorities or you could broaden that guard rail but it's in or you could just leave it as it is again this is this is the board's decision and the guards I have a lot less direct coaching about the about what they Intel as long as they're with the value of but they also should be I want you to be really clear and understanding that what you say is your priority is it means that that is your priority and not everything else so I have

[03:23:00]
suggestion I mean I I like the way that the guardrail was stated as board member Gonzales stated with inequitable school and Community where you added that piece and then punto that's one guardrail let's Let It Go because I think that one covers number three on what the what the values were around student support and intervention services okay the other one that I would recommend I'm just going to throw this out there this is throwing out the first one is that the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated without transparently communicating how the allocations are sufficient to ensure Equitable access and and Equitable access or I don't know equitable distribution of resources my only concern with that is that it allows it to happen so long

[03:24:00]
I don't think it actually guards it I think it allows you to to still be in Equitable in your action so long as you tell everybody you're doing it so if it was just the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated I don't know I mean I can't figure out how to say this state since I have to think about that one sorry I thought it was on a roll there but it was that simple because if we somehow just move the transparently communicating or the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated without insurance Equitable access or equitable distribution of resources I don't know something like that

[03:25:00]
without insurance okay so resources be allocated without insurance equitable distribution of resources period are you looking at something else I am trying to like Wordsmith a one that's that's number four that I'm working off of the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated I think it's just inevitably completely acceptable to be allocated in equitably so this is great good job you've got I think maybe even have two guard rails we're still on number two I think we got number one

[03:26:00]
China hammered I think we're I think we had agreement with the first one around the support intervention services but this next one if it was just to say the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably without transparency and Equity know we don't put that just period because when we add the transparency what Courtney was saying is that it's still allows him to do it he just has to tell us why he's doing it right but if it's an and not a the way it reads right now is without transparent see he can do that but if you put without transparency and Equity then it has to include both so you lost me on that one because I really don't know it it's rather than saying

[03:27:00]
what Barbara is proposing the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated without transparency and Equity that's without either of those so it's it's adding the need for transparency which I agree with but I also like another one in here about transparency so okay the superintendent will not allow the district to conduct duties without including students families Educators community members blah blah communication to be unresponsive or lacking and inclusive transparency Community sensitivity or inconsistent with the express values of the district so that's long we can trim it but I just wanted to say

[03:28:00]
did I like the part of it around communication needs to be responsive transparent Community sensitive but how is that related to Equitable access not so I'm okay so what I'm saying is where Barbara was proposing we add transparency as a concept of number 7 we can do that or we can have another one around just communication everything is done with but we have to understand what value are we protecting yeah so if it just said the allocation of resources has to be done equitably putting it in the negative then that's okay then we have a third grade and that speaks to one of my biggest concerns about all of these is that the other one of the values that I think we heard over and over and over again with community and educator voice 2016

[03:29:00]
so did we solidify number two or have we moved on to number 3 cuz I just want to make sure we're talking about 134 I'm like holy moly okay so let's step back we have we have we have guardrail number one which protects the value if you guys go back and look at those values that we're trying to protect which were listed as the top seven okay so the first guard rail protects the third value of student support and intervention services done wait so which one is that just for clarity so that's the one reads that the superintendent will not allow the district to operate within Equitable school and community service Distribution Center School and Community Based wrap around a support systems sufficient and that's tied to number three and then the one you just

[03:30:00]
what is tied to number one correct president so it's the community listening session it was the the board of the drive it's all the data that came from the community sessions I think Johanna just shared it over this is the same document we used to settle the goals let me look at my location

[03:31:00]
it has like the big word art in the middle of the little blurb word cloud word cloud thank you I worked hard on that I like it so what email is that connected to one from Ashley on January 5th January so we're looking at several different documents January

[03:32:00]
577 there's the word doodle there that said that so just remind everyone that the values that came out as the top pieces to protect number one was Equitable access to and distribution of resources that okay okay sorry about that I actually wasn't lost on that one so so what we were saying is that the first particular guard rail that was presented around the superintendent will not allow the district to operate within equitable distribution of school and Community Based wrap around and support system sufficient to meet all students needs meets number 3 of the

[03:33:00]
is here around student support and intervention services that would be a guardrail for that a guardrail for the Equitable access to and distribution of resources is a superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably and I think we just stopped their correct and that would be a guardrail for number one so now we have to create the one for number two right I think it's important of what was mentioned throughout the community right that's what I think because I feel like we went over the place and I don't want to lose sight of number two because we had more responses to that around you know differentiated instruction responses related to the issues that impact the effectiveness of or access to individualized or differentiated instruction this includes multiple responses about not

[03:34:00]
increasing class sizes and one size fits all mindsets during and after a student's time with APS what would a guardrail look like for that one there was one oh well there's number 10 where it says the superintendent will not Implement a one-size-fits-all approach to expectations of students across the district there's also number three on the Google Docs the number three again has a lot but it includes differentiated differentiation and it also includes instructional quality which is number four instruction quality which is number four on the list of value priorities

[03:35:00]
culturally responsive or not differentiated

[03:36:00]
the academic needs of students I I am not happy with number three the way it's written because I think it could be interpreted in a way that says no you can't differentiate because that may not be aligned with whatever I think that goes It goes back to the conversations to have strict adherence to The District Library and I think that it needs to be

[03:37:00]
stated in the guard rails in a way that makes it clear that we need to meet the needs of the students in front of us and that is not separate from from a district curriculum but that the door really needs to be open for teachers making professional decisions about how they make the needs in a differentiate way to the students in front of them could we still I mean I see that that could potentially instruction but the other value that cuz that's valuable number in quality which is another one around 4 so how do we how do we create a guard rail that protects both different and instruction

[03:38:00]
well that's why I like three so maybe it does have too many things in it cuz but distracting I'm not distracted by it I think it's all possible I think our kids deserve all of it I am not at all concerned about the number of things in it so I like it but if others are I'm willing to negotiate around what it looks like so the superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not standards district and standards lined research-based challenging and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students what do you not like Barbara so again research base if I make a decision as a teacher that if I teach ceremony

[03:39:00]
is part of my literature program am I going to be challenged that it's not District aligned or research research base if I make a decision that my students would find deeper meaning from Reading rather than A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and or supplemental materials I mean cuz I think that I think that's what I'm hearing is that because I know there are teachers that will supplement a curriculum so

[03:40:00]
and to supplement the learning on that they might add something like that they do have to get approval for it though you know because that still does existence that needs to be I agree I actually will standards aligned is aligned with the district right so we can leave it just standards line yeah so when we're talking about District alignment we're over here working this out whatever you do tonight please don't vote in the tonight and give us a week to the really look at him and give yourself a week to look at him so we can come back next week and vote but when we're thinking about District alignment we're thinking about a scope and sequence or thinking about a course taking pattern

[03:41:00]
District alignment standards align means you're using materials that are aligned to the standards I think that is what everybody would agree with I don't think I think I'd get out of the just from my perspective I don't think I'd get into supplemental materials I just say look material that is standards aligned the distance alignment for us is you know if you want to cut language that's I don't know it's patterns that they have to follow right I think that's what we meant in this initial proposal and then you can figure I mean like you said there's someone literature that's really good literature and I don't know who proved the literature you know what I mean so I think the work that's engaging

[03:42:00]
so I just I worry about you know I went into classrooms today I was at stress volcanoes and they were doing some work and the kids were engaged but I just worry about some of that so but again I like that the standards aligned if you want it that's what we're talking about though I think the one you have trouble with is approved then right now because things happen in the classroom I mean moments change you know what you started talking about something that really interested I'm going to pull an article yeah you know I said I just think moments occur in the classroom it's living and I don't want to limit teachers but I like having you know some things that say we are going to be standards align we are going to

[03:43:00]
how do you spell on that Barbara sorry because some people use it in a very narrow way other people use it in a broader way like if I can show research says that when students of literature so from a professional point of view I can argue my point but

[03:44:00]
Play Can't point to this this item and say this is research-based what do you want more I mean I wouldn't have research-based so is that what you're saying Barbara I think or you would want to follow I wouldn't say okay and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students I can go with but we're getting rid of just District because we're all the reasons he just not that he said to keep District because that includes scope and sequence we just we just discussed policy that have that word that verbiage in there so we need to make sure that everything is

[03:45:00]
aligning with policy that we have one of the things that I started again that's why I'm asking for a little bit of time we need to debate this out a little bit but with the mlss model we want to make sure that there's no issues that we don't create a guardrail that impacts the teacher's ability to interventions to intervene and work with kids and so that's I think we're good with what you said is where I get nervous when doctors not here but I've got these guys in there pretty it takes to represent doctors are there any you know in you know some consequences of of this so are there anything that could potentially be harmful because we don't want to be harmful I mean I think the goal is and also super duper limiting right so that there's no flexibility at all I really want to make

[03:46:00]
can we add like student-centered and culturally responsive I was just going to say we need culturally responsive we are in this I think that is important but sorry I'm just when I'm reading all of these though that's not listed like I see that that might be hours but no I'm just the document which item are you referring to let me go back to let me go back to that dot I'll actually save you a little bit of time because cuz I'm the one that Cody so in the in the value around differentiated instruction a great number of those responses were about providing not not providing

[03:47:00]
directions to ignores the cultural needs of of students that treating students as one size fits all definitely we heard an overwhelming piece of feedback from the community that said that that includes you know the the different cultural and ethnic and bilingual and all of the different aspects of of who makes up the students of APs okay so I'd like to add culturally responsive so so what we do have though is in our what students should know and be able to do cultural competency came up as a big one I mean we don't have to have a goal around it but it could be stated as part of a guardrail to basically

[03:48:00]
text that that is the value I think but what I was hearing from Ashley was that the word differentiated includes the cultural and linguistic so it's really a question of do we need to add it to our list I think where is it clear enough for those specially for you know the the tribes brought it up and I mean and the refugee culturally responsive and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students but I hear differentiated that that helps me to sort of connect also with our students with disabilities what I went yeah that resonated with us as well yes so I see the head's not eating

[03:49:00]
the residents to add no no no don't add cultural Linguistics and immediately needs a special that needs students and we are back here and just had that comment that was exactly what we needed for our special needs population know it speaks to that value for that particular group because culturally responsive response I think it just evokes a different a different thought around our community in terms of that value we see those are separate both very much hey good I thought you were

[03:50:00]
all right so we have so that last that last one helps us with differentiated instruction as the value and I think instruction quality as well number four so it we've hit one two three and four with basically with three guard rails so may I please ask that you read it slowly so I can catch up this weekend the first the all three of them or just the last one so number one the superintendent will not allow the district to operate with inequitable distribution of school and or community based around and support systems period number two

[03:51:00]
superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably Period number three the superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not district and standards aligned challenging culturally responsive and differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students

[03:52:00]
District staff AC like haven't seen them like fall over yet I think they're going okay so Ashley can't see like what we're looking at so I'm looking at their faces we've got some head knots were probably going to have some questions around definitions OK Google okay so I think that's where we probably are is that so Ashley you want to do a good check with us before we move on to something else so this is this is a really great place to do a gut check and to make sure because I before we move on I want to I want to just make sure you feel really good with what you've already created so for each one of these I would like for you to so we've we've made it clear like they're all shopping with the values of the community has come up with I think

[03:53:00]
is there all very clearly either a single operational action or class of actions one of the things that I really appreciate is that superintendent Elder has been clear especially on the in the last discussion where where some things may prevent flexibility so that's because your guard rail should not prevent his ability to achieve your student not come goals so now it's time for the for the board to answer the question will these challenge adult Behavior changes and how many they be interpreted so remember when the school board stops riding the superintendent starts interpreting and and one of the things that you can do in this inside of this conversation is

[03:54:00]
how do you interpret this you know ideally we want we want you to look at what your interims would be but if that's going to be really difficult at a very minimum it's worth a conversation with superintendent Elder so I'm actually going to jump in there because I was actually really happy with the verbiage that just came out until now when you brought up with the guardrail Challenge and disrupt the organization and require adult Behavior change my easy answer is no because I feel like many of them are already doing these practices in a way and I know we're trying to formalize it and saying these are now are do not but what are we doing differently to challenge them with these guardrails and I Look to Danielle because I feel like she's like the all knowing that's a lot of pressure how does that do you feel like these are really challenging

[03:55:00]
what I would say is maybe in part because if we look at like the first two around how we're allocating resources that kind of gets to my question around when push comes to shove in the context of a budget decision this should push them to allocate the resources where they're needed like that's the inevitable distribution that's what the definition of equity is on the number three I don't think we're currently having curriculum and instruction that is challenging okay I would agree that every kid every day I consistent so what I see and I think this is what's going to come up in the interim goals and and in the Strategic plan is I mean

[03:56:00]
I just keep going back to I 50 years in education boots on the ground and I've never been through a year where there haven't been goals dated and where they haven't been aspirational thoughts the real question is how is it going to get implemented and what are we going to do that actually changes things and I don't think that's what we can encapsulate in you know four or five guard rails or four goals I think that's what's really going to be encapsulated in what are we doing that changes the reality in schools and I think that's what teachers are looking for and wanting I don't think somehow it always gets posted the teachers are the are the obstacle in this and I think teachers frustration is that goals get thrown out into nothing changes in the reality of what they're trying to

[03:57:00]
and what resources they have and what what they face and so I I mean I think that this is in a way that aspirational part and our job is going to be to support the superintendent and his crew and staff to make sure that something substantive in the reality changes so I'm completely comfortable with the way it stated but I but I think needs to be in this came up over and over again his voice and Community educator family student voice and they play well I was going to ask do we need to go around implementation and I'm just thinking out loud

[03:58:00]
responding to what you said because the problem has been an implementation so we've never had a I mean we've had plans that we had a true strategic plan I would probably argue you know and when we have we haven't stuck with it I would be concerned about a guardrail around implementation only because we're in the process of trying to come up with implementation I mean you can put one in but I don't I don't know how limiting I'm curious how limiting it would be as well yeah that's my only concern about that I kind of like that process play out and that's probably in the input or output to to the task at hand and I would ask the superintendent or even any of the associate superintendents that want to chime in

[03:59:00]
would you implement what interim guardrails pop to your mind about the second one the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably do you think that is sufficient to address the concerns that you heard from myself and everyone on the dice because we have different concerns I think that's probably the one that we have the question of definition of terms so when we talked about resources being distributed Walgreens that have certain programs for high achieving students

[04:00:00]
you know gifted students whatever a lot of you know AP classes whatever etcetera what those would be important to in many of my schools and so I would say that what would happen there when you have a big need for other school for other schools that need something completely different than what many of our schools may need and so that's I mean how do you really Define what because it could be I mean I could say well that's inequitable to you know Volcano Vista because they have this but then this school you know Sierra Vista really needs this and so how is that I mean I would see you would need some kind of a definition wouldn't that be tied to the goal like

[04:01:00]
establishing proficiency with this particular group because I feel like ultimately we're going to have to make some of those decisions between good versus good so then we kind of go back to what our goal stated and that's the tiebreaker does that make am I saying that yeah you're saying that those those those goals were talking about a certain group of students and I may go well I know that those kids need this help but then I also know that these kids are not part of any of those subgroups they still need things I'm going to suggest something and I'm an apron period

[04:02:00]
but within that I think you can still merge some of the innovations that are happening at the magnet schools or you know engineering the future that kind of program there's no reason to to not solidify or bring together we have to be creative I don't see us getting rid of but one of the goals was to try to increase question out of it and it just goes back

[04:03:00]
play who's available and who is working to school and sometimes it comes down to who's class you know class making enough students sign up for a particular subject matter to make so you do have school so you say well they have this will they have 356 so it's it's it's sometimes they're factors that are outside of certainly the district's control and even the schools control so that just keeping that in mind when we talked about this distribution of resources there's more than just money and we don't belong in there and then exactly because that we've seen that happen where you just don't I mean our students are also changing places

[04:04:00]
Define in my conversations tend to focus on the comprehensive high schools because that's where you get the most play at guess around like you know that the different kinds of instruction that you can have but it does get difficult when you've got maybe a very small student group at one particular place that's really interested in like an AP but couldn't make the class of the course in the school that they're at and it's like where is the Innovation and so that we don't lose those five students to be able to have access to it but I don't know how we make that happen I think it's easier said than done and that's not up to us you know I mean it's really not up to us and and that's the part that I you know I worry about because I know that the rigor is really important and we also know that rigor sometimes is missing and some of our schools simply because we all so can't make the course size

[04:05:00]
and that's totally unfair to some of our students who really you know want to be able to to partake in that but then also how do you increase the the performance overall at that school so that it starts to increase and you've got that and is that going to be part of our goals as we're doing that and as we're implementing them are we going to see that natural growth which is what I think we want so that those schools can start to grow to that kind of rigor at all levels and it's not just contained to a handful of schools and it starts in April I think setting the gold and the guard rails is is definitely it's difficult I think it's been hard but I think it's even harder on this side I think the doing of it is really

[04:06:00]
you know where I'm I'm humbled by it because I know it's not you know I'm not an educator I'm not an expert on that piece and so I really do you know I'm humbled by that perspective of you know that you all have it it's a task so can we get rid of resources and I went back to resources sorry because resources I'm responding to what I heard from our group or administrators and there's on the San Francisco website there is one guardrail called resource allocation but they use resources to the number one

[04:07:00]
sufficient to then leave him to work within it to create the equitable distribution that's needed and I think he said that was going to be a different I think that's what he said that was going to be a difficult one I mean I think so I mean I just kind of go to me when I taught at a school in the southwest part of town and I have children that I knew were gifted children and there was not a gifted program what is that Equitable even if I only had you know we only had a few but there wasn't enough of them and so I personally would say that was inequitable but I think they should have been provided the

[04:08:00]
this is because I know they were gifted children so that's I mean that's when all that come plays in and I know that member Peterson it says this sometimes also there may be courses whether it's ethnic studies or whether it's a language class and then there's not enough enough enough students in the class but those kids that would have been equitably if it was Equitable then they would have those courses because those kids need it or want it so I understand superintendent white that's a hard one I mean I think she supposed to point like it's our job to set that guard rail and it's their job to figure out how to meet it and there's a whole host of ways to be Innovative and to make sure kids get what they need and kids of color especially get what they need so I think if we just like stop there and let them have the week and come back to us that feels fine to me looking at some of the other

[04:09:00]
districts and their interim guardrails their interims are exactly what we're talking about like the interim Cardinal for Broward is percent of underrepresented groups in gifted right so like the interims can be all these hosts of ways that you measure Equity equity and academics equity and resources equity and whatever so I feel okay with where we are right now giving the district time to respond to us and let us know what are different ways that it might look to measure it and I also think it's you know what we're looking at to is going to be a developmental piece right I mean because I don't think this is going to be we've set some goals and we've set some guardrails but I'm hoping that what we see is that we're challenging ourselves one to to meet those goals and guard rails sort of looking at the growth but then also sort of being able to come back and

[04:10:00]
this really is a gap here because it's going to be much more transparent as we're looking and we're evaluating and it gives that feedback you know back to the district and back to us around where we do need to like either step up our game or you know think about it differently so I what I like about the conversation is that and and superintendent says you know we've had plans but then it's just a plan and it doesn't really get measured and nobody really comes back and sort of addresses where are we this is the next part for us is really the most important part and that's where we get into the monitoring discussion of like well where are we and not not being afraid to set I think some pretty challenging goals for ourselves and guard rails for ourselves but really being willing to come back to ourselves and one celebrate because we did make success but also being honest with ourselves if

[04:11:00]
I'm not making success and not beating ourselves up about it but really just taking a look at maybe the inputs weren't right you know what do we need to shift what do we need to change and having that honest conversation amongst ourselves one as board members but also with our community because the thing I like about this particular model and this approach is that it's a continuous quality improvement approach to it's about that continuous question that we have because we're going to go back out to the community we're going to listen again and we're going to continuously review where we are and I are we going to make mistakes absolutely I think we're not going to be perfect in this as we go about it but I think it takes a lot of Courage for us to just come out and say this is what we're going to give our best shot at and we're going to we're going to be as transparent as we can around the conversations that we're having and how we're looking at it and then be willing to course correct so

[04:12:00]
so I think the question for us really is right now we've got four goals and we've got three guardrails that we have pretty much identified drafted we're not they're not solid they're just been drafted I'm going to ask on the dice do we fill the need to have another guardrail or are we good with what we have thus far go ahead I actually I agree with what I do feel it's important to have a parent student guard rail Associated here and again I think it's still resonates with when we went to the West Mesa thing the other day and hearing the students speak about stuff that we probably weren't necessarily aligned with from administrative level and and I think we don't capture

[04:13:00]
voice enough so I think it's going to be extremely important to add a guardrail that ties us together so I just copied and pasted the San Francisco won the superintendent will not make major decisions without utilizing a process that includes meaningful consultation with the families students and staff who will be impacted by those decisions at the Inception adoption and review but like the Inception adoption a review of what is my question but anyway but I like I'm mostly like what's going on there it's in the San Francisco

[04:14:00]
add it to the Google Doc yeah I can oh no we can't she's on it so what about like the superintendent shall not discourage students or family input and engagement or if you want to put student and family and I know I think that came out as number four about parental input and engagement

[04:15:00]
5 and 6:30 family and student yeah so I think it's just leaving it kind of bra you know kind of broad so another option is a week to number 6 which I cut a few words but the superintendent will not allow the district to conduct its duties without including students families Educators and Community member and put an engagement and will not allow District communication to be unresponsive or lacking in transparency sensitivity oh it was a number six on hours right now and I have to say initially I was rooting for the San Francisco one because it was the first one that I had really seen the talked about decision-making

[04:16:00]
the one that's number 62 do you think we get the point across if we just stop adding engagement and not make it so right you know engagement I think is not sufficient I think it's it's got to be more active than just engagement I mean engagement is part of it but I think lots of times our community feels like they're being engaged but then it doesn't get implemented it doesn't happen so I think that this is a little bit farther the engagement I don't know I'm having I'm struggling with the and will not allow District because I see that as a different card rail it's like you know you can bring it will not allow District communication

[04:17:00]
the first one is really around the input and engagement with students and families and you know it's it's really around that the second part is just a guardrail around how communication is conducted so well and what's nice about the first part too it actually includes five six and seven into one sentence get my only concern is just the transparency engagement and inclusive if that if it's clear that we mean transparency I mean I think to Barbara's point from the second hole that we are real that transparency is crucial

[04:18:00]
and I think the reason we didn't put it there was because we thought it was coming later so I think somehow we need to work transparency into so after engagement can you just say or lacking an inclusive transparency period families Educators and Community member input and engagement or lacking but how do we get with inclusive transparency of contacts to the list so on the so for the the final

[04:19:00]
use that are listed I want to be clear that they're not listed in the order of of like most to last they're listed in alphabetical order so there's for the last four five six and seven they're all three out of the 11 for came they came up three out of the 11 Forum so parents Community engagement student voice and accountability teacher and staff support one of the things that all three of those categories had in common was about the relationship between the teacher the parent and the teacher the parent and the student and so special and a lot of these had the same they were categorized from responses related to parents being engaged students being accountable for their actions and even supporting teachers and

[04:20:00]
through relationships with parents and students and Community as well so I don't know if that adds a little bit of context to kind of what the community was saying around this one just looking at the three of those kind of combined in the the Synergy that exists between all three of them but if you were going to adopt one focusing on so it's more focused on building the relationship between those having having a Cadence of accountability with your parents teachers and students that are having agency for parents teachers and students and I think that kind of gets to some of what board member Peterson was speaking to earlier as well in supporting teachers and professional or supporting teachers period

[04:21:00]
I like to start over I know I'm like okay awesome so how do we so there's three we agreed on we're talking about a force which is related what we had been discussing was primarily related to engagement and input and we're kind of struggling whether we should include transparency there or not there's also the separate concept around teachers having the support and the resources that they need to do their job and indeed I'll explain teachers everyone within the district having what they need to do their job and there is another one in here related to that so that would put us at 5:45

[04:22:00]
adding restorative practices in like a program no no no no no I'm just saying that the concept of but I think you which so I found the one that I was thinking of which is I think 15 the superintendent will not Implement new programs or procedures in schools without supplying appropriate professional development and essential material and human resources that gets to the teacher and staff support if we added that we would have one two three four five acknowledging that we're still wordsmithing the transparency communication is is

[04:23:00]
is the fourth goal explicit enough if we're not going to address restorative practices in in light of and I'm referencing students supports and interventions because we've got a big problem that way right now but I think well even mentioning that because again if we just refer to our conversation at the school the other day the students were against that again restorative practice well okay but but we spoke to a limited group because Stevie my sister works with the the other kids who are getting themselves who are also fearful she was advocating

[04:24:00]
well and and what I'm trying to get so you know have we come back to my question did we address student supports sufficiently enough and the fourth goal so I think we did I think we did too because I think there's a lot of there's a lot that could be strategies that an inputs that these fine people will come up and address there and the whole issue around like the contacts of restorative practices it just depends on how it's being delivered and all of those things because there's a whole wide range of how that's done and that's all right there's a lot that needs to happen there for sure I agree with that I know Ashley you want to weigh in here

[04:25:00]
but thank you for creating space for me to to provide coaching to everyone at the same time so I would like to post the question or or maybe even just suggest that if these last two guardrails are if y'all are having trouble committing to one or I didn't take them then perhaps it would be it would best serve the board to focus on the three that you have identified and then maintain that flexibility to add another guard rail or to down the line as you become more comfortable with the with the focus areas that you have created and so that's you don't have to do that but it's generally when we see that there is

[04:26:00]
that there's a little bit of just lag lag I guess and deliberation then that indicates that this the focus that you've established might be the best place to go how do you guys feel about Alexa I still have two more so I feel good and I think I have I have a suggested suggestion to the Community Based one but I will hold it until we go down the line I feel good I don't feel like I'm lagging I'd like us to try to get to guardrails that are responsive to what we heard from the Community Values Barbara I feel like addressing voice is really important that's actually pretty key to three of the seven points

[04:27:00]
so I feel it's important as long as we are being responsive to what stated here and it doesn't become our definition of what we think it needs to be I agree how about you petty ditto okay I've got one left in me and I and I would like to see it be the community voice at 9:35 and you I think you heard this group is still ready to rock and roll so that we can figure out what we're going to do in terms of what other you know what's what are we also shouldn't have more than five right so we were agreement in that we've got three so it's our last

[04:28:00]
do that I mean are we going to go to all the way to 5 okay I propose that we just fit wrap up the community voice okay well I think we before we do that that's warm me up tomorrow

[04:29:00]
what allow the district to conduct its duties without including students families Educators and Community member input and engagement through transparent communication what's transparent communication but everything everything this is a big deal we make a lot of decisions every day I appreciate that we want to include people and we have to make decisions we have to be free to make decisions I appreciate taking Community input is it at specified time

[04:30:00]
calendar so duties is a big term and then communication like we do it a couple years ago we did 1,000 surveys to the parents called us and said stop doing surveys you don't want to give you any more feedback just make a decision so it does just curious there I I like the idea are we going to try to include more student boy should I try to include my parents I get it I understand that I guess we Define it it's going to have to be how about let's see Ashley did you want to weigh in you sent me I can't hear you we lost your audio here how about now

[04:31:00]
okay there's there's something happening with my when I click when I hit mute it doesn't unmute so I was just going to say superintendent Elder just he basically just stole the show for me he gave you the exact the exact feedback that I was about to give you a coaching you don't want to limit the superintendent's ability to do his job to achieve your goals and so restricting all of his feedback is going to make it really really difficult to do that so you need to be able to maintain enough flexibility for him to be able to do what needs to be done so just as he said you know what which decisions which duties if you wanted to be more specific perhaps with substantial or on maybe focused on a specific type of type of actions or there's

[04:32:00]
what if there are a lot of ways that you can that you can approach it but that that specific that specificity is really important on this one so I think we've got go ahead and other edit okay how about this the superintendent will not make major decisions without including students families Educators and Community member input and engagement with transparency the major just right he's going to ask what a major decision is I get to Define it well you're going to ask you what he says I think I bring you guys major decisions pretty much every board meeting rooms are for I can't be just interim all the time I appreciate what you doing I want better voice too I just I I get it this is very

[04:33:00]
play difficult and I think you're right the big ones are the big ones I just asked who gets to Define it if it's my interpretation or interpretation and when the board stops riding the superintendent starts interpreting so where the board when when the guard rail is written it however the superintendent interprets that is his interpretation so if if his interpretation of a major decision is anything that he brings to the board then that's that's his interpretation if his interpretation is anything that impacts you know Community the Community Schools or the community at large Like You could argue that everything does so again it's just it's not really as important about what the interpretation is but just being comfortable with with you all being comfortable

[04:34:00]
sing his interpretation I will I will say I heard that language in the San Francisco guardrail and I know that guy I mean I'm happy to call him and ask him what what you need to get a sense of what other districts do but if that's my definition then we're going to have to I think we'll have to put something specific for you guys that you know what we're calling a major decision I mean do we I mean I think we're leaving a lot of those major decisions to the superintendent and to his cabinet like that's that's just what I think that we're letting the experts do what they need to do now do I want the parents to be you know not be encouraged to provide their input which I think they should be allowed to and I think that they are but I don't I mean I just don't know if I would want to go there I would

[04:35:00]
just wanted to be brought that you will just not discourage you know Community student and parent input and engagement and then you decide you know when you want to get that input and on what that's just what I would do I would leave it up to you while we got this we got to this point to this understanding at that 2-day Retreat if I remember correctly we came to an epiphany about that that first it was the onus was on us to be better leaders to do this process and then get to the direction that we were going to give through this conversation administrators are our administrator or superintendent to follow

[04:36:00]
so maybe we really do need more time I mean I keep thinking that on the one hand we are putting a huge task in your laps and to do this well I think it's got to be done with a spirit of trust and respect between all of us and I think that's really critical I mean you all are taking on you as Administration use the superintendent or taking on an incredibly difficult task and if we don't respect you for the work that you do and Trust our relationship in moving it Forward we're not going to get there and I think that's essential at the same time we

[04:37:00]
I know that one of our barriers for making the progress in this District that we need to make is that we don't have we don't have the working relationship with family and community that we need to have and sometimes we don't even have the working relationship with staff members that we need to have and if we don't address that and figure it out we're not going to be able to accomplish these tasks not for lack of Desire or hard work but because we're not addressing one of the fundamental issues that's in front of us so I feel like if we don't figure out a way of creating a guardrail that really does figure out for instance we have huge issues around I mean it's come up with the right size

[04:38:00]
conversation we have huge issues that are very real that we have to address and at the same time one of the things that I hear from Community from school Community says why weren't we asked we've got ideas about how to address this we know the community we know the environment we know the needs and we know the obstacles why aren't we being engaged to the deeper level to solve it and I think that comes up over and over and over again period

[04:39:00]
like if we have one that says the superintendent shall not allow families and students or so yeah I'm trying to think again that double negative to encourage to be partners in the in the school Community like because in the positive test it says you know every parent and guardian will be welcoming and encouraged to be partners in their child's School Community but we need to put it in the the shall not and I think if you read the values I get that we need to do better at the district explaining why we do things at the district but they were specifically talking about was how were they engaged just parents at the at the school level

[04:40:00]
what grades mean in middle school so one of the ones that's in there is number 17 is a superintendent shall not discourage parents we know we could say students families from being Partners in their child's education and will encourage them to provide input and engagement you still not enough but I think I mean I think it cuts off let me just go because one of the things that I you know Ashley is coaching me to as we're going through this and one of the issues that she's seeing is that we're really struggling coming up with the last one and what I've noticed about us as a board this is just I'll get to use my social worker we are also this

[04:41:00]
play The Script that's really driven like we're going to do it we're going to do it all right now and we don't give ourselves a little bit of a sort of disgrace and just permission because I think there's this feeling that we're just not going to come back to it but one of the things that I've seen with the sport is we always come back to it and so you know do we need that that permission to just say okay let's just take let's just take a breather here guys we've got three really good guardrails right now that have to have a whole bunch of interims that are going to be in there too so there's a whole bunch of work that's attached to that and just make that commitment that yes this one is really important so critically important that we all want to make sure that we get it really right and so maybe we just need a little bit more coaching on this one so that we can figure out how we could come up with something that's going to be solid enough for us that we're not just sort of dancing around it right now I mean we're going to treat it the way we did the goals we established three came back into the fourth

[04:42:00]
same thing here at the guardrails we have three and we'll come back and do the 4th when we have Clarity of mind and we're not stressing them out I think that I think superintendent Elder wanted something different I think that's fine I think what you're suggesting makes perfect sense what I was asking them was how would we write this and so we're going to work on that ourselves and and throw you a possibility as well but we don't have the answer right now one of us is falling asleep so I'm sending it home and I think that's it that's exactly what proposing is like let's just put a pin in it for a minute it's not gone but let's concentrate on what we've got before us right now because we still haven't even

[04:43:00]
we just got the discussion there's going to everybody we come back on Wednesday will look at those and depending on like how things happen between now and Wednesday since we're having a student outcomes Focus governance conversation we could have the conversation about this particular last particular guard rail is there something that has come up that has sparked some interest we could still have that conversation it doesn't mean that we can't bring it up that's why we're putting student outcomes Focus governance on the agenda at a regular board meeting so that there's always this room for this conversation so I'm just how how do you feel about that I'm going to go down the aisle yeah I'm fine to put a pin in that one

[04:44:00]
but I would like to address the final one that Danielle brought up a while ago okay but I'm also fine I'm putting a placeholder on the transparency communication engagement one the other one that I brought up was the teacher supports which is the we shouldn't do anything without giving teachers and staff the support they need I agree I think so those would be like two particular separate goals one around Union so good work Ashley do you want to say anything and closing I think we are going to pause

[04:45:00]
so let's just I think we're clear on the three that we have we will go over it again on Wednesday when we look at that because I believe on Wednesday we will vote on our fourth goal and we will potentially adopt our three guardrails that we have as long as we've got some interims that we can look against those so when are we discussing the fourth and fifth guardrail potentially also on Wednesday so action items leaving for potentially the superintendent will we have your your potential draft of the community engagement guard rail before next Wednesday yeah and I wouldn't look some of you guys are really good about me stuff and more happy to take it we take it we work with it I don't mind and I will yes before Wednesday sure

[04:46:00]
the interim comes from us I mean not the answer to the guardrail is come from us so I hear him you know wanting to be a partner with us and making sure that we have it Wordsmith appropriately so we can do that because what's the most important part of the actions tonight too is that superintendent's going to meet with Ashley so they can start talking about the interims for the goals and also for the guardrails that we do have identified and then for the 5th one that that we discuss that we're not going to discuss tonight will we put that in a separate document that can be molded I think yes we could continue to use this same proposed guard rails section that we have or this document add whatever you want in there is proposed language and then on Wednesday we'll just take a look at them and see if we can get to the the 4th and the 5th we will number 15 okay all right

[04:47:00]
all right so taking us home all right so the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday February 1st 2023 at 5 p.m. here in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex or virtually at www.aps.edu and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held in February we don't know yet and the John Milly room and with that we are adjourned so it's
