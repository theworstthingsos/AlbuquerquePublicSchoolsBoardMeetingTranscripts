[00:04:00]
necessary thank you so much thank you board member our first Speaker this evening is in the room and it is Janet Sayers and she will be followed by Janet harmonium so actually I was going to come in on something different tonight until I took a better look at the agenda and I thought maybe tonight would be an appropriate time to just say something about long range coordination between the city of Albuquerque's Library program and literacy since you'll be looking at the the progress

[00:05:00]
bring a ports for the early literacy I now have the opportunity to serve on the library Advisory board for the city and the county and that would be that represents 19 library branches spread across Bernalillo County and actually the summer reading program has this wonderful thing of Color My World and there are daily activities to make reading a fun and enjoyable there's a dancing there's music a lot of things and I looked at the local government Advisory Board of which in member Jackson just thinking that at some point we need to make sure that our public

[00:06:00]
library programs are complimenting things that are happening with some of our school programs in the summer reading program that New Mexico ped is putting on so I'm going to put on my thinking cap about that and try to well I want our library board to actually take this up as an agenda item later this summer and better coordination with how APS is following a lot of these topics so thank you very much and that will be followed by Beatrice Pacheco Janet Harmon is that you have two minutes I'm sorry hi I'm here to thank the board for not renewing the contract with the great City Schools

[00:07:00]
Christian the need for this model hiring out of state coaches is it mandated to have this sort of contract as we seen it takes an enormous amount of time vetting these outfits many of whom have questionable motives when it comes to True Equitable public education I encourage you to investigate funding sources for the cgcs likewise they will always any outside group will always need to be educated about New Mexico the Martinez and Yazzie decision is the most concrete example of New Mexico because you need situation we even immense amount of knowledge right here in our community each of you have been Educators parents or students in APS are steam superintendent who's not here is even the daughter of a well-respected passport president continuously we have heard from APS Community we have heard the aps Community voice concerns and offer Solutions at these board meeting you have an excellent family engagement policy drafted by family

[00:08:00]
you were advised to fully Implement restorative justice practices and the fortify the instructional councils let's do it I was a parent who served multiple years on I see at my son's school and I'm happy to share my experience and what the road blocks that are presented to families who want to be involved let's see board members should also be allowed to visit schools in their District at any time please lift the gate keeping around this I had to make this longer anyways the whole day long about coaching and godly good rubrics is just a distraction from the urgency of what needs to be done and does not certain

[00:09:00]
Cordelia and you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you I've also worked as a reading specialist and director of special education and large Urban school districts I would like to respond to superintendent blakey's interpretation of the iStation data and to speak to the effectiveness of Ice Station and i-Ready as reading interventions for low-performing readers as identified in the 2000 National reading panel report which was the last white scale National reading report conducted in the US superintendent Blakey indicated in her analysis of the data that the challenge for the next school year is to implement instructional practices in our first grade classrooms that enables this group of students to maintain and exceed the level of achievement that was demonstrated at the middle school of at the middle of the school year when 24.8% of first grade students in this group were proficient or above and overall reading ability

[00:10:00]
proficiency dipped at the end of the year to 23.2% it is also noted that the Yazi Martinez subgroup shows limited gains across the year with most students performing below proficiency benchmarks I would like for the board to see clarification on how iStation and i-Ready were chosen as appropriate tools for mitigating reading deficits for low-achieving readers if you review the US government what works Clearing House supported by the Institute of Education Sciences you will find only one one valid peer-reviewed quasi experimental study regarding iStation outcomes there was only a marginally significant difference found between the two groups and the effects of the program was determined to be point 0664 is the hinge point and that would equate a small effect size meaning that it would be what would be expected over the course of one school year a program with the point 066 size should a big question by the school board before tax dollars were spent to purchase the program it's important

[00:11:00]
use to note that overuse of technology in the classroom takes time away from traditional reading instruction which can produce medium to large effect sizes and finally I would suggest that the board asked to see the research behind the system is being made for curriculum changes particularly when they entail purchasing expensive programs which are technology-based thank you thank you our next speaker is joke OK Google and by chance to attend the last meeting and something that my board member said kind of caught my eye during the cgcs conversation she said that essentially she didn't feel that this group was acting like a team that there was a lack of teamwork and I'm actually an executive coach I work for a local nonprofit but I also do Executive coaching I do leadership training and Communications

[00:12:00]
training I don't work with school boards but certainly familiar with all the leadership challenges that come with large organizations and that really caught my eye so I went back and watched several of the recent school board meetings I also went back and looked at some documentation and tried to get a better understanding of the cgcs contract at what that relationship was like as best I could and I want to say something which is that in the corporate and sort of tech world where worked a lot of folks talk a lot about teamwork but there's there's a lot of issues that come up there which I'm not going to go into here in this forum one of the biggest pieces that happens is that folks don't work as a team they don't work together and there's often not a culturally responsive approach to leadership and as I go back and sort of look at some of those those meetings that have happened I think a lot of that's pretty evident here I think there's really a lack of leadership and I'm not making a comment on the intent of any of the board members or any of the leadership here I'm simply saying that the behaviors that I've served really fell short of what we would expect

[00:13:00]
School District that represents taxpayers that represents teachers Educators School staff and parents most of us I've been an educator in a very very far away former life most of us know that our kids they watch what we say but they really watch what we do and so I would encourage this board to really listen closely to what board member to make us and board member tell me where to have to say because I think they really offered a lot of insight about what we can do to be better and more responsive because our kids truly do watch what we do and thank you sir our next speaker is Megan long and Megan will be on Zoom making me have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you and I'm here today to voice my concern about the RFP process as it stands to replace the cgcs coaching I think it has been negligent and in a time when the budget is at the highest threshold we need to ask ourselves why

[00:14:00]
constituents are being left out of the conversation is it intentional and if so how can this be remedied we expect inclusion and transparency going forward and not for their division sewed by certain members on the board I didn't expect to have this much time so forgive me but I think what we're really looking for is some clear communication we'd like to move forward United with parents actually being involved and included that is I think our biggest concern at the moment given the current state of affairs we'd like to see people take responsibility for their part in this situation that we find ourselves in I it makes me think of something that I often say to my own children when we're playing with others aren't as shared space if you helped make the mess then I expect you to help clean it up so the job moving

[00:15:00]
can you forward here is to make things better by listening to the voices that are speaking listening to the people that want to be heard and reaching out even further into the community so that we make sure that we are actually coming at this from a well-rounded approach and not just listening to the pundits to people who have their very own private interests involved we want something that is going to be Equitable for our community and we strive to keep public education public thank you thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Mary Herrera you'll have two minutes when she begins speaking okay thank you look good evening Madam president school board members and I am here to speak on Children's Health and Wellness executive order 14168 signed by President Trump in January of

[00:19:00]
APS the county and New Mexico are very happy blessed June 10th and so thank you may God bless APS and New Mexico thank you for next speaker is in person Nina Simona will be followed by David Ames you have two minutes to acknowledge that the board as we thinking the process for hiring out of state contractors to coach the board the community urges the board to slow down this process and open it to public comment this will go a long way to make sure we aren't let down the road of quote leadership should know that the community is going tired of apses

[00:20:00]
play APS is on admission they messed up how the right sizing of Taft and voltage they misstepped notifying families of the sewage bill at Harrison Middle School so of course we are asking questions about the contract with the Council of great City schools because we were wondering if this will be the next misstep the last board meeting was telling but perhaps not in the way that was intended I want to remind those listening this contentious contract is dictates the board how the board governments and how the superintendent needs her goals and keeps her job so although it might not be a part of the budget it weighs heavily on how the entire District operates so how is it that the initial contract was overrated as an open-ended agreement and why did not go through a Professional Services agreement channels to begin with how was it that there were no contract passed approval without being presented to the board the board president tried to say the whole board approved the renewal then she said it happened in executive committee been in a meeting with the superintendent which is it and where is the proof

[00:21:00]
APS as a hole as a reminder to board leadership we need our school district to function in terms of equity especially for students identified in the yasi Martinez lawsuit equity and trust this is not corporate boardroom this is the people's boardroom and our children are who you serve thank you thank you next week is David and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking sir hi I'm here to offer my support for the student outcomes Focus governance model and for the use of an aligned coaching vendor such as the Council of great City schools on the agenda for tonight's meeting is an in-depth discussion of the progress monitoring results in early literacy for our District's most vulnerable populations are Yazzie Martinez groups are underserved group

[00:22:00]
people like myself when I was a kid nowadays you'd say as a kid I was economically disadvantaged however when I was a kid pears and adults just called me a poor kid but then we back then we didn't have school board specifically evaluating the progress of kids like me it honestly didn't feel like people cared but tonight we're going to see something pretty amazing we're going to see a school board discuss an evaluation of the progress for

[00:23:00]
and encourage you to block out the noise of those who are distract you from this important work stay the course with student outcomes Focus governance please your community requested this your community still supports this thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Tanya Hopkins and I believe she is on Zoom Tanya are you there I am thank you you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening music because student outcomes focused governance looks like in a variety of diverse schools and I urge the board to keep what works from sfg while expanding their oversight and influence to address the dynamic needs of their constituents we

[00:24:00]
longer contact our board members directly and I wonder if it makes a difference to share concerns with board members now that board work is so closely policed and limited to the confines of this Council of great City Schools framework I attended the community listening sessions when the goals and guardrails were being created and it was not made clear to the community that the priorities we shared would result in high stakes assessments become virtually the only work the board could address and be the sole criteria for evaluating our superintendent an example of a community concern that may not be receiving enough attention and board meetings is school safety this issue is not a part of our progress monitoring and I have observed schools putting more resources into compliance with the goal for survey then actually creating a climate of safety please include educator and parent voice in this important issue focus on measurable outcomes it's important but by eliminating board work to measuring static goals and

[00:25:00]
all of the implementation decisions to the district leadership are democratic voice is silence thanks to all of you for your hard work on behalf of all of our students thank you and board president Gonzales board members that completes public forum great thank you Mr Gonzalez and thank you to our public forum speakers we will move on to our next item which is to consider acceptance of progress monitoring a reports for interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 for early literacy are presenters our doctor Anthony Gonzalez Deputy superintendent for learning leadership and learning and Sherry jet are chief academic officer and our facilitator for this discussion is member Dominguez alternative thank you so tonight we are monitoring gold ones 1.1 and 1.2 measuring Proficiency in literacy in first and second

[00:26:00]
populations plus African-Americans for the Public's understanding the Martinez and Yazi groups include children with disabilities Native American students English language Learners and socially and economically disadvantaged children under the title One Federal program the most vulnerable in the title one program 10 to be children in foster care children and families who are and housed and lgbtq plus in many of the vulnerable categories the aps governance team added African-American students academic challenges before we hear or before we have our progress

[00:27:00]
questions and conversation we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete on Tuesday June 10th I met with Council of great City Schools coach sandal revelry to review the progress report at that point a draft I want to thank him for being a focused thought partner in preparation for my meeting with Dr Gonzalez and Chief of Staff Miss Johanna King later that day the administrative team and I reviewed the draft report and had a productive conversation my charge as facilitator is to evaluate the draft interim report for the following structural elements the data does the report include a clearly labeled line graph showing results from the three prior reporting periods

[00:28:00]
yes for the aggregate population and what I mean by that is the total of the groups that I just listed but not for the disaggregated populations listed previously is the graph easy to interpret and aligned with specific goal or informal language know with the without the disaggregated populations reality we cannot know where they stand in fact both interim goals show a decline in year over year performance and if the decline continues we will not meet the interim literacy goal of 1.1 the monitoring report cites a lack of support and resources for data driven small group instruction and the implementation of a new curriculum is causes for a year over year decline in early literacy

[00:29:00]
this with an anemic annual targets for interim guardrails 5.1 professional development and 5.2 adequate resources for educators to do their job that was a in on June 4th we had that progress monitoring session while the situation sets up teachers and by extension our students to fail I point this out because it is my duty as a facilitator who has had extensive conversations with Mr revelry about this to meet the standard we as a board agreed to I highlight these areas of concerns so that the board in its questioning and the district in its strategic planning can make adjustments now while there is time to write the ship

[00:30:00]
what's the purpose of the progress monitoring sessions are the target reporting periods and annual goal benchmarks clearly marked yes for the aggregate data interpretation of the data does the superintendent offer a clear interpretation of system Performance Based on the data no I do not have enough information to assure the board that we are on track for all the reasons stated above is the interpretation directly tied to the stated goal or interim goal know if we cite Martinez in Yazoo plus African-Americans we should grab their standing relative to the aggregate data under evidence and plan if progress is not on track has the administration

[00:31:00]
6 which I suggested was not targeted enough a clear plan to get back on track no Clarity is tied to rationale and I pointed out that the rationale was missing during the facilitator meeting with Dr Gonzalez and it is still missing because the report has not been revised a rational for why those actions are expected to be effective know there is no existing evidence in the report that bolsters the claims made in the plant actions that Inspire confidence that these plans will work if progress is on track and it's not I'm going to skip those because they don't apply again I requested in this meeting the disaggregated data for each of the student groups shared earlier I made the same request several months ago in October of 2024

[00:32:00]
facilitated the math report we have been missing graph data points for the populations referenced in our goals we need to see how the most vulnerable students would I refer to as a disaggregated populations listed earlier compared to the total vulnerable population would I refer to as the aggregate population data points that appear on today's graph I also want to clarify that the superintendent and this is important superintendent is evaluated on the Aggregate and not the disaggregated graphs to provide five different evaluations would be unwieldy nonetheless I believe the board collectively agreed to be responsible for holding the district to high standards and structural Integrity this requires seeing the

[00:33:00]
segregated information graphed against the aggregate it is important for transparency and for honest conversation that leads to the best possible student outcomes for those students who are not progressing it also promotes and guides successful root cause analysis and culturally and linguistically Rich Solutions the lack of rational and the lack of focused root cause analysis makes it difficult for the board to understand the reality of the very groups struggling to show growth students with disabilities Native American students English language Learners and African-Americans we want this to be an effective monitoring session I want that so we will proceed to try to make it

[00:34:00]
so in light of the missing rationales for so many root causes in future sessions the expectation is to have the disaggregated data graphed against the aggregated data which would provide board members an opportunity to ask more effective strategic questions which would lead to a more effective monitoring session are we in agreement that we can proceed to try to make this an effective session thank you you believe the required elements of the report are not present and so because of that I'd like to make a motion that we postpone the progress monitoring session to a later date

[00:35:00]
I understand I had an extensive conversation with sandal revelry about this particular point today and I am taking his suggestion that that we can try to make this an effective session but I certainly I raise the same questions that you are raising now so I hear you board members I appreciate president Gonzalez's suggestion because I think it gives the administration the time to to revise their reports and I am on board for that okay thank you

[00:36:00]
when you look at the dashboard and the effects chronic absenteeism not only in elementary middle school and high school but it's a repeated start I really want to know how we're going to take a look at that so I do agree that we should take another look at this at another time

[00:37:00]
so we do have a motion and a second to postpone the consideration of the progress monitoring report to a later date I want to capture the rationale for why we would do so what what is missing what would be needed to be included in the report so what I heard from you remember Dominguez is what's missing is the rationale for why the actions of the Administration has proposed are expected to address the root causes identified in the report correct there's also a lack of focus we have six root causes and again during having my partner and I discussed this some we found out and I mentioned this in the in the meeting if we could prioritize six is

[00:38:00]
I think it it it it it lends we need to focus 06 on the most relevant also okay so the six are the root causes so if they identify those as the root causes but we're asking for is rational for why the strategies are expected to address those root causes and you're suggesting that the strategies and plant action should be more focused insane that we can't do six root causes I mean or or you have to prioritize get we have to be more focused about your root causes I don't think we can tell the district that they can't focus is in order to proceed with the report it does need to include rational for why the actions are expected to address the root causes okay okay so with that we have a motion and a second to postpone the progress monitoring session is it looks like you want to get in with

[00:39:00]
and engagement assessment fatigue and engagement instructional suggestions like more strategic use of Technology an effort to humanize assessment practice and reference to Screen Time Guidelines those were the strings the gaps and concerns have to do with first no direct link to vulnerable the disaggregated vulnerable student population no clear plan for implementation or monitoring impact strategies are offered

[00:40:00]
so I'll give you the details in writing three minimal parent Community engagement for lack of data on actual screen time 5 no evidence of adjustments to strategy based on progress monitoring Thank you period we have emotion and a second to postpone the consideration of the progress monitoring report to a later meeting I believe the next possible later meeting would be August 6th I'm looking correctly till August 6th which will provide I hope ample time drunk for the administration to be able to respond to the request for rationale for by actions are expected to address the root causes along with more focus and prioritization and a clear

[00:41:00]
6.1 through 6.23 is there a motion and a second chance

[00:42:00]
Josefina Dominguez Ronaldo yes so the emotion to approve the consent agenda carries and we will move on to the next item on the agenda which is agenda item 6 which is the president's report so I'd like to begin by acknowledging that although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want you to know that you were heard and they were working with the administration on resolution some of the issues that we heard tonight were regarding progress monitoring and reading instruction board support Community engagement leadership RFP process in Children's Health and Wellness I also want to acknowledge that this has been a heavy week in our country and in our community and as we sit here trying to transform education for our community it's important to acknowledge this is a moment when people are being disappeared across the country disappeared from our streets and kids are afraid to go to school kids are afraid to attend

[00:43:00]
graduation ceremonies families in employees are afraid to go to work to go to stores and elected officials are not just being detained but murdered so I just want to acknowledge that as we sit here and how committed I know this board is collectively to working together to address the challenges in our education system to transform and improve education but also to address the challenges in our democracy for that I think it's important that we continue to acknowledge the students are focused and that we ensure we stick to that along with high quality coaching along with high quality support but an important acknowledgment of just where this world and this community is this week that's concludes the president's report our next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday July 16th 2025 at 5:00 p.m. here in the Allison Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard North

[00:44:00]
and live stream live streamed at aps.edu and with that the meeting is adjourned
