for the Middle School teachers and inspiring scientists national wide Nationwide Miss Hayes was selected from approximately 200 applicants to participate in this week of advanced science training and network a scientific requirement of this scholarship is the responsibility for sharing Lessons Learned with colleagues and Scholars and homeschools and throughout the district and the state by fulfilling this requirement the impact of scholarship is magnified over multiple classrooms as teachers learn new strategies in new ways to engage students in math and science would you please come to the podium we can clap for that

[00:37:00]
Kim Lopez and Maya Lopez so we'll go ahead and start with the first Speaker my name is Naomi Cisneros of SIA Family Focus Center I love Family Focus programs for their country diversity the love and dedication to the teachers and staff have for her children Family Focus is a selfie progress from Sports Arts Science music cooking to help any other things are interested students have as a parent Family Focus helps me to get involved with my children's education by volunteer I love Family Focus they treat me

[00:38:00]
family member my kids love to come to the programs every every week and I love to give back to the community is fun safe and it's a very good learning environment for our kids and I just want to say I love I love our program thank you Kim Lopez I'm a mother and a board member of the family Focus the same that she was speaking about Family Focus Center serves not just see Elementary but other schools in Bernalillo County my children transferred to another school and they remained at the Family Focus for their after school program where they received physical activity as well as enrichment programs in a variety of different fields including karate sports music dance gardening cooking and these classes

[00:39:00]
they were able to choose their own classes and it enabled us to help to understand what their interests might be rather than investing in a karate program or something if first we got to test out what they were interested in your family focus is not babysitting or entertaining the children but it's an enrichment program my kids are in elementary and middle school but as they enter adolescents in high school it's important for them to have activities extracurricular activities to maintain healthy minds and bodies and avoid risky behaviors you have Family Focus originally had funding of 30000 from Bernalillo County then it was reduced to 20,000 annually they were able to give more than 50 scholarships with this money but for five years they've had no funding now they're able to give less than 20 scholarships just based on they're just barely scraping

[00:40:00]
bye and it's a very important program it deserves to have funding it children don't have always art and music and dance and a different sports in elementary schools and this gives them an opportunity to have that and we have some things that are called lights on after school and has names of different students not from Family Focus from other programs and I think that after school programs like the Family Focus Center are really important because they're different activities because of one kid likes Sports and their Sports and if the

[00:41:00]
like likes art then there's art and so then that gives them a choice and and so they can both have fun and and learn stuff but also it helps them meet new people and have new friends and kind of like having a new family thank you our next three speakers are Katia Lopez Carmen Mayer and Julia

[00:42:00]
hello my name is Katya and reasons why I think that after school programs and Family Focus is important is because it's kind of like a second family and your your first family is very important of course but I can't forget about that but it also gives you a chance to learn how to be social it gives you have fun at the same time and you and you do what you like to do you have fun doing what you think you might have a passion for and and and and it doesn't have to just be one thing it can be a lot of things and then and I think that that's wonderful because you get

[00:43:00]
a lot of things in out of one thing you get you get a second family you get to do what you love you get you get friends you it's just really great thing to happen to do thank you I'm actively involved in the PTA passionate about public education and extremely concerned about the survival of public schools over the past six years I have watched him enrollment drop from 600 + 519 students of the students who left from last year to now 40% transferred to a charter school for promises that may or may not be kept

[00:44:00]
Charter Schools were originally designed to meet the needs of students who had very little hope of making it through the education system without those additional and specialized supports now charter schools are popping up left and right and are often masquerading as public schools but are really just private schools using public money they are not being held to the same standards regulations and requirements is traditional Public Schools also many charter schools have an expectation of monetary support from families that will ultimately weed out low income families for example one school has an expectation of a 5000 donation per family per year considering that roughly 60% of APs students receive free or reduced lunches their families would most likely not meet those types of financial expectations this doesn't really feel like a truly open and public educational if you feel like a discriminatory system to cherry-pick financial statements charter schools have become a gateway to privatization of our entire educational system

[00:45:00]
my request is the following that the following occur play some moratorium on opening any more Charter Schools do not renew the ones that are currently not performing and level the playing field and hold charter schools to the same level of scrutiny as traditional Public Schools without that our hands are tied and the ability to compete with Charter Schools to keep our enrollment full is completely undermined thank you very much for your time hi my name is Julia Fitzsimmons and I'm a parent of a 5th grade student at Bandelier elementary school and I like to start by saying that for all six years at my son has been at Bandelier we've had excellent excellent excellent teachers my concern is very similar to what Carmen says that are enrollment has fallen in this year to 50019 students and what does this mean for Bandelier it means that we have less money we went from having a full-time assistant principal to a part

[00:46:00]
what time is assistant principal we lost our teacher our full-time teacher level technology instructor and so now we have a part-time EA who doesn't actually teach classes we also lost our second grade teacher one second grade teacher this year after 40-day count which really put our second grade students families into a state of turmoil and now why is this so one reason is due to Charter Schools the number of schools in our district continues to increase while the number of students in our district decreases on my block we have four houses with students in a school-age students only two of us send our students to Neighborhood schools to our neighborhood school which is Bandelier another issue with Charter Schools is they pay teachers more my son's kindergarten teacher

[00:47:00]
left Bandelier to teach at a charter school because they pay more so I agree with Carmen we need to have a moratorium on charter schools and we should not renew the charter schools that are not performing thank you our last speaker tonight good evening period unfortunately I did not receive a response to the issues I brought up

[00:48:00]
last time and had to leave for a PTA meeting before comments were made so I will restate what I spoke about it the last public forum in hopes of receiving a response our neighborhood schools are in crisis our schools are experiencing a decline in enrollment lack of teachers increase class sizes and efficient Services Bandelier has now lost two teachers this year to enrollment numbers when parents face these types of problems that produces an overall negative perception of public education they lose faith in the system and play pulling their children in place in them and Charter Schools will solve their problem further aggravating the stresses on our neighborhood schools there are many misconceptions about what charter schools are in can offer ultimately the concept of charter schools destroys community cohesiveness and creates in my office view of Education that benefits the individual at the expense of the community this I have to do what is best for my child without regard to the impact it will have on all children

[00:49:00]
play more it stretches already heavily stretched dollars as we did get money tomorrow and more schools school choice is an illusion that fundamentally undermines our neighborhood schools in a roads the community a moratorium must be placed on new charter schools in the renewing of existing ones most charter schools are not necessary if our neighborhood schools are funded and supported appropriately to provide the services needed and desired by the community second there is a lack of parent voice in our district in schools which also contributes to this growing negative perception of our neighborhood schools the venues for discourse provided by APS are inadequate first board meeting at the very least provide substance to follow up with those who do speak Spanish that brings together community members District heads and School staff on equal footing to discuss make decisions and Implement policies procedures and programs relative relevant for the school Community APS is making educational policies and procedures without input from a very core in

[00:50:00]
busted group parents thank you thank you for your input that concludes the public forum thank you Google thank you I had a chance to visit classrooms for the average today at Truman Middle School it was a true celebration and very impressive Staffing students shared average strategies they're enthusiasm was contagious and wonderful things are happening at Truman Middle School very very proud of what the weather in speaking of contagious enthusiasm of visit with students at Academy Westside campus was also a delightful experience students were so full of Pride as they showed us around the facility it was obvious

[00:51:00]
say love their school and are working to make this school their own hands on projects Rule the Day at the Westside Academy they working on architectural projects and also focusing on landscaping and I asked them why they decided to do that and they said it's because this is our neighborhood and we want to make sure that they know that we are proud of our school and that we are good neighbors and it was just really made my morning several students from Valley High School Mission Avenue and Chaparral Elementary schools have been given the opportunity to speak directly to Dr Serena on Union Chancellor aboard the space station tomorrow morning the students will have about 10 minutes to ask questions prepared by the three participating schools before they lose the signal the event is being coordinated

[00:52:00]
by the Valley Air Force JROTC stem program sponsored by staff sergeant Chuck Newman and the K-12 stem initiative under the guidance of chaparral assistant principal Alma Ripley with assistance from the high desert amateur radio club of Albuquerque if you've never met with the radio club this is like going back decades it's fantastic Valley the lead school for this project was one of the nearly of nearly a thousand schools worldwide that applied for this opportunity and after an extension an extensive selection process only a dozen schools were selected to participate and we were one of the valley was elected because of its continuing support of many collaborative stem activities in the city and could it be that Dr Pierce

[00:53:00]
it might be a tad envious and that would be the second time tonight I don't know it's not a good night for you Dr Percy he is certainly as excited as the students because he mentioned that it would be interesting to get the astronauts perspective on the recent shuttle accident he'd like to ask that question himself but wouldn't mind if someone else picked it up for him and we'll have to see what the students decide to ask tomorrow a school training for engagement planning which is also called Step was an event that was held on Tuesday and we have an opportunity we had approximately 75 schools with Comprehensive plans for family engagement step is an all-day workshop for school based family engagement teams District 9 District staff members provide

[00:54:00]
is it raining on the foundations of family engagement and then guide school-based teams in creating a family engagement action plan and thank you for the board to the board members who were able to attend that training APS will host its annual School showcase formerly known as our school choice fair from 4:30 to 7:00 p.m. on Thursday October 25th at the Albuquerque Convention Center the Showcase will feature neighborhood magnet and charter schools that offer a wide variety of educational opportunities and settings information will be presented on the variety of courses electives activities and Athletics offered at comprehensive schools as well as information about the specialized schools in the district that offer a unique approach to learning it would be wonderful if you plan to attend the Showcase if you've been there before you realize that it's really a very high

[00:56:00]
there's only three of them and they have so many schools but they work miracles in the span of 6 months the web team migrated 143 school websites into school loop standard 2 as a part of this process they worked with the individual stakeholders to audit and reorganize content creating consistent navigation and information across the district as well as meeting accessibility standards during the same 6 months the web team updated the contact APS form and the internet help form in APS dot edu these forms will make it easier for students parents employees and community members to direct questions to the most relevant people in addition they created online resources for web content accessibility School Loop and phone the webpage content management

[00:57:00]
add software this is all Greek to me in Subway's the tutorials but I know it's it's great the tutorials include screenshots and step by step instructions on how to accomplish important tasks and will be continuously updated based on feedback and as new needs arise I'm very proud of the ongoing work of this tiny team and this kind of accessibility is essential to our work and so thank you thank you thank you web team that's three because there's three of you that include that concludes the superintendent's report thank you sir we'll go on to the special issues we have an update on the leadership academy

[00:58:00]
as a reminder we just want to give a little bit of the history of what brought us to this point with Laura Solana in December their contract their Charter was approved for 2 years with conditions that needed to be met prior to execution of a contract in April on a site visit our staff identified special education concerns and issued a notice of unsatisfactory performance from May to June the school developed a corrective action plan to address those issues in June their contact contract came to the board and was not approved subsequently the school asked the New Mexico Secretary of Education to finalize the contract and since then both the school and the district have filed briefs as we start every meeting in this discussion item we're not here to talk about that but just to contextualize it for you so what we are here to talk about is a monthly update as we have agreed upon

[00:59:00]
line with our monitoring of the special education corrective action plan the school does receive monthly site visits to monitor that plan we continue to bring you monthly updates and anticipate that by December we will have enough information and adequate monitoring time to bring you a recommendation regarding the school moving forward at this point the school continues to not make adequate progress and implementation of their corrective action plan I'll turn it over to Dr Escobedo for more details Mr President members of the board superintendent reading the briefing document that you have as you know the school does have a new director and Dr Pepper the school has had a significant number of new board members that are listed on page one of your briefing documents and so they are

[01:00:00]
in compliance there they are not in compliance with their audit committee so they are missing a finance person on their audit committee but I believe Mr Vallejo has a plan for that as of October 8th the school had 71 students enrolled as you can see from The Briefing document a large percentage of students with disabilities and English language Learners we have updated their enrollment by grade 4 you which you can see on page 3 shows you in analysis of their school enrollment and then on page six we've included some new information with really dug a little deeper into park performance levels of students with disabilities compared to students without disabilities in English language arts and in math and so we wanted to point that out to you

[01:01:00]
again we want to thank associate superintendent for special education Lucinda Sanchez for her partnership in this work of supporting students and ensuring compliance on September 26th Patricia Espinosa the aps special education liaison to Charter Schools performed her monthly site visit she didn't know that the school is making making progress in the areas of attendance at Student Assistance team training they have created to spreadsheet to track student IEPs they aren't sharing that students are receiving Direct Services and have begun reviewing files to identify discrepancies from previous however the school has not made progress Insurance out of compliance with their IEPs

[01:02:00]
that one IEP that was conducted had a compliance issues the school also continues to allow a non-certified staff member to review special education records we will be conducting another site visit at the end of this month and will bring you an update in November and we are here to answer questions and again Dr Via Jose Garcia well thank you for the update it's very helpful and hopefully we will be able to get back on track thank you Google

[01:03:00]
what's what the next steps are for us and for the school Mr President board member Peterson we have a commitment to you to bring you monthly updates and we will be bringing you a recommendation in December on the school going forward we do need to give the school some time to try to get their processes and systems in check however we are monitoring that monthly and we have we are committed to you to bring you a clear recommendation on December on the school going forward so if you could just please let us know what you're doing right now to try to meet some of these some of these meats absolutely

[01:04:00]
we actually have made quite a bit of progress you'll note the date on this is September 26th since then all of our overdue IEPs have been taken care of our calendar at this point is up-to-date and we are working on making sure that all subsequent IEPs are in place and being addressed as appropriate also in terms of some of our other processes were making sure that they're in place and being followed I was here for four weeks ago and had mentioned that yes there is quite a bit of work ahead of us we have made quite a bit of especially in terms of for example in our requirements regarding students who who need assistance that's in place in terms of of the one

[01:05:00]
the records she actually is a registrar and is receiving the material in fact when she gets it all she makes sure that it's all there and then hands it over to our our special education coordinator but making sure that that process is clear and followed is is where we're at at this point and at this at this juncture as of today we can probably say that yes yes she is getting the materials but she's handing it over for review to our coordinator so there is quite a few people over yes because she's the red star needs to make sure that she's receiving all the the academic and educational documentation regarding students says they come to us so yeah she does need to look at them

[01:06:00]
but in terms of reviewing for accuracy making sure that the IPS are appropriate do we need to do a read update on a piece Etc that actually is our special education coordinator who's doing that okay so she's doing her job so it's I just want to make sure that we're clear that she is doing the job she supposed to be doing and as well as my coordinator but again we make sure that those processes are clear not just in house but

[01:07:00]
but I would be disappointed but right now I'm I'm pretty confident that we're going to be vast majority Claire the reason why I say vast majority is because as you all know across the state they're still issues with hiring special education teachers and so that does put a burden on our existing staff members and teachers but we're working to remedy that as best we can as well okay thank you tell me about the budget in terms of the expenditures or the you know the movement to hire special ed has that has that been completed has that been determined actually I just spoke with my old the last week or so I have been in touch with our business management and at this point they just takes some time for that movie

[01:08:00]
but as of this morning the intent is to get those bars put in place and adjust it so that way that is not hanging out there for us to address especially since you know if we're going to be hiring folks that the money needs to be earmarked in the appropriate account until we are working on making sure that that money is being moved to that account it does obviously take some bored action as well to make sure that those bars are approved Etc and will be taking care of that at our next board meeting so in terms of like advertising for this position and trying to recruit is there active recruitment correct so at this point not only have we put in for the Coalition of charter schools

[01:09:00]
APS website as well in terms of the the job section we are also on Craigslist and I have personally emailed all of the universities and colleges that have special education teacher programs to let them know that we're looking for them so we're talking New Mexico Highlands UNM CNM Santa Fe Community College to let them know that we're looking who do you have it's coming up the park that we might be able to to work with that in the meantime we are actually working on getting a substitute and we are to fill that position in the meantime and actually that person does have a special education license so we are working to bring her on board as soon as we can to help make sure that our students are getting that those services

[01:10:00]
did to help reduce the amount of pressure on our coordinator / teacher just help me to understand so you've had been in session absolutely and we've been looking for place yet we have been looking for a long-term sub and it is only literally three days ago is when we finally got our first hit on someone who would be interested on that because of all the recruitment efforts that we've got and I immediately called call her and have been working with her and did the interview process so we're just waiting on backgrounds special education services actually our students with our between teacher we also have another special education teacher who has been working with our students

[01:11:00]
we also have EA special education is it's been quite the dance but we're getting through it making sure that students are getting the services that that they're due because the majority of your population is special 29 or 30 of our students are considered special education correct thank you Google I am very comfortable with that because my staff are there before school starts and are there

[01:12:00]
after working very hard doing due diligence and justice to all the different IEPs that we have in place are we at 100% of addressing the the know are we well on our way absolutely not to mention the fact that I have also have regular meetings with with our special education coordinator to make sure that we are making progress you know again to the point where at this point all of our students who have IEPs that have been in September and October since I've been there for the past four weeks we're caught up we are caught up matter of fact we even have enough time to make sure that a couple of students who are nearly identified as is being out of compliance because we didn't get it in time that we were able to go through look at their existing information from students from

[01:13:00]
different schools including APS middle schools to make sure that the dates were correct and if they were incorrect In the initial information that I got that we put in we corrected that information and corrected our calendars to help better meet the needs of our students so at this point everyone who has been doing IP has had an IEP and do their IEPs it was a combination of the two combination to because we had some students who who came to us

[01:14:00]
already out of compliance and so we had to make sure that we were addressing their needs as well so it was not just our existing students but also incoming students who who have IEPs and some of them were out of compliance but having to address all the different needs is what we've been charged with and that's what we have been doing matter of fact you know is is noted by by Patricia and Espinoza that we have caught up with those pieces finally and so we are moving forward with anyone else at this point who was doing IEP actually as of the 40th Day we have 74 students and there's a two of which one was a student so we sent out

[01:15:00]
Play Enter the school so we have the 30 days that we need to make sure that we do the read on that IEP to make sure everything is up-to-date and current and and that particular student actually is due I believe October 26th we also have another student who came to us October 9th who was out of compliance because their IP was actually due October 4th and it was in it so we're having to for both of those students are 30 days started when they started on the 8th and the 9th for free

[01:16:00]
thank you for the monthly update Google okay thank you just a question for our special education folks here maybe Lucinda I don't know that we have any of our special education people who are handled by registrars or secretaries or anybody I don't even know how in the world they would know whether they have the right records or not so I doubt that process very much and I appreciate the work being done I appreciate the effort to correct these these concerns I think it's going to be very difficult to satisfy the 40% so much

[01:17:00]
I'm also interested to know how because originally some of these issues were around budget too in terms of getting those things straight and board member Montoya Cordova mentioned and I think again the assurance that you really have budget to in fact actually bring on the kinds of people that you need to bring on I think is a concern so I look forward to hearing more in the near future and from our own staff is to what those kind of recommendations might be so keep working and we'll see how that works out okay thank you we're going to item number B which is our teachers Federation presentation about a systemic approach always listening to attract and retain high quality Educators in New Mexico Continuum of professional sport I believe doctor thank you thank you

[01:18:00]
Dr Piercy members of the board superintendent Reedy I am very honored to be here tonight I was at I think the last board meeting when the topic of the teacher shortages in fact all Educators and the shortages that we face in all categories was the topic of conversation I've been working on the concept of a Continuum of support since we got a grant back in I think it was 2001 or two and we formed a partnership between the Albuquerque Public Schools in Albuquerque teachers Federation and the College of Education and through that work and our collaborative efforts we read a piece of research that was called from preparation to practice designing a Continuum to strengthen and sustain teaching

[01:19:00]
what we did with that work at that time was we co-created are beginning teacher mentorship program something that has been around and evolved and really helped a lot of teachers through their first year and stay in teaching so the ideas that I'm working with today are not new they're not new to our district they're not new in research but it is a conversation whose Time Has Come is that correct grammar that the time has come for that conversation and the reason is because we do our best work in crisis things are changing in the state everybody in the state is having problems and everybody is looking at the change that's going to come with the upcoming election and so

[01:20:00]
with that the l e s c has been really studying a document created by ncsl the National Council of State legislatures called no time to lose and no time to lose has synthesized conversations that have been going on around the nation and around the world for a very long time about how to create the strongest public education systems and in that work they have synthesized a lot of the research that is Global Research and National research and it really has to do with creating a system that attracts and retains competent qualified and caring teachers for every student no time to lose and that work has been presented at the LSC and very prominent researchers will respected in the field like Linda darling Hammond

[01:21:00]
ingenious have come to present their parts to the l e s c countless others have been adding to the research on this and so what I wanted to do since last year when the legislature started is start to lay out and a vision for the future and the first thing I did was I put it in our teacher's voice which I send to all of you this idea of a Continuum of support then as I was listening to legislative education study committee I started thinking okay it's time to really push on this idea as something perhaps we can all jointly support because I think it is time and I think the state is ready to move in this direction and I think if all of us the teachers unions and the colleges of education and the boards of Education from all the districts around the state

[01:22:00]
start having similar conversations about what could happen at the state level two attract and retain the teachers that we need then it would benefit all of us so I was lucky enough to start these conversations with some of the staff of the l e s c and the LFC and then go and present to the LFC for that presentation I created this graphic which I know you have in your pockets if anybody here needs a hard copy of what I'm presenting to the board my staff right there will give you a hard copy so that you know what I'm talking about thank you this graphic that we created for this is really a graphic that looks like we're focusing only on a grow your own strategy it is partly a grow our own strategy one of the things that we haven't done is made teaching

[01:23:00]
option and an attractive option for the people who are going to school and I know for myself I chose to be a teacher in 4th grade When Miss duderstadt at Belhaven Elementary had career day that's when I decided because I had a role model my dad was a teacher because my teachers were Role Models because they were enthusiastic and positive about their profession and I knew that that's what I wanted to do what the study say now is more people say that they trust teachers as a profession than ever before and these are the same people who say to their children but don't go into teaching and we do that with our own children as teachers we say to our own offspring don't go into teaching and the reason is according to the research is because one it is

[01:24:00]
disrespected and two it's a lot of work for very little pay okay people go into careers when they first want to pick something where they think they're going to make a difference but also they're going to make a living so we want to start having our high schoolers think about teaching as a career and not just teaching counseling Social Work therapy everything that we have in public schools I'm going to focus just on teaching for this presentation so this graphic is a loop and it basically says we can start in high school and we can go and Revitalize all the way and then keep that Loop going because if we do then we're going to be able to have these role models for these kids of enthusiastic and engaged professionals and they're going to do what I did and that is saying oh that's what I want to

[01:25:00]
do when I grow up I want to be a teacher so I'm going to go through each of the ideas in the Continuum with you and I'm going to just briefly Summarize each page each I tried to create a one pager on each idea on the Continuum mostly I created two and three pagers because you could write a book and there are books there is so much research behind every single concept on this Continuum but I tried not to write a book I tried to just say this is the idea but I want you to know that I drew the Continuum down the side of the paper so every time you see a check mark you know that that's what I'm talking about and that's what the paper is in each single page I just summarized it I gave a few bullet points mostly from no time

[01:26:00]
to lose but also from Linda darling Hammond my own Union and other resources just to say there's a lot of research behind us and I ended with policy considerations and a takeaway so I'm hoping that we can have a joint conversation about starting in high school there's a lot of talk in no time to lose a lot of research about the importance of revitalizing Career and Technical education and this is going on in many countries what we've done in our country by saying the way to a future is to go to college and there's no other option other than College we have really just kind of destroyed and Technical education in our public schools and we've done it nationwide and what no time to lose says is it's time to focus again on Career ticket we need a skilled Workforce and college isn't the only option and sometimes through career and Tech they go to college after they have

[01:27:00]
set training one of the Career and Technical areas that is really important if we're going to revitalize our own students become teachers in New Mexico is called Educators Rising it too is a Career Technical program CTE program and it is available to for Perkins money and we have three programs in APS right now one at El Dorado one at Manzano and one at a Trustco Heritage I think every High School in the state of New Mexico should have Educators rising and it is an expense cuz you've got to have enough to hire the teachers and they have to be able to supervise the students but these I did a newsletter the teacher's voice on some of our educator Rising teachers and the students that have now been hired in APS and I interviewed the

[01:28:00]
and they are very enthusiastically teachers in APS so they can do that at 3 high schools I think we could do it at every High School in the state so the bottom line is Revitalize CTE and while you're doing it make sure that we focus on education the next part of the presentation is on pre-service education what we've done in our state and what many districts and states have done is during a shortage they lower expectations for the profession and we've done that often by having alternative licensure and there are many alternate ways to become licensed but they should not be substandard paths to licensure and so sometimes we as a state and other states put people who are unprepared in front of kids and then they too are not inspiring role models and they

[01:29:00]
struggle to be teachers and they don't stay long so what we want to do is Revitalize colleges of Education by increasing standards not lowering standards we also need to have a lot more clinical experience early on so one of the things we need to do of course is partner with our local colleges of Education to get candidates in our classrooms as soon as possible because you shouldn't wait till you graduate from college after you've done student teaching to figure out that you don't really like that work you need to figure out early you need to have a lot of clinical experience it needs to be connected to Theory and it needs to be ongoingly so one of my ideas the bottom line is raise the bar for Teacher candidates we need to have you know the best people going in and that's what countries that we hear about like Finland have done and that is they've said it is the most competitive rigorous thing to get

[01:30:00]
do a college event but the other thing some of the countries have done is they've made sure that once you're in there you have loan forgiveness if you work for the local school district or something like that and I think this is a state policy we could try to work on so that if we're lacking candidates to go into teaching in our colleges of education but they guarantee they'll work for us then we should guarantee that they're not going to be saddled with student loans for the first 10 and 20 years of their career the next thing I want to talk about is teacher residencies on the Continuum we have currently a grant in APS it's a partnership between APS the College of Education and the Albuquerque teachers Federation I work with every single week we go and work with the College of Education this is a post backpack program for people who already have a degree possibly for people who are looking at a

[01:31:00]
age of career second career people they come into a paid teacher residency and I put paid in air quotes because the pay is so small in some places like Singapore it's a living wage in ours it's like we'll get your tuition paid for but with that they're placed in a school setting all year long so that they're basically co-teaching and there's a gradual release of responsibility between the professional teacher and the resident teacher in the classroom they become a member of that school community and when they're finished they basically have one or two courses and they agreed to work in APS when they're done so we were able to recruit with very little effort 24 people 25 people to start in our schools

[01:32:00]
now this grants ending we have no more funding but we need to keep these residency programs going so what we need to do is Advocate because we're going to have money in the legislature this year there's no reason why we can't find the beginning of teacher residencies in every College of Education in every College around the state so the evidence is clear in the research on teacher residencies that they become well-prepared strong eager teachers so I think it should be a path a high-quality path to license and that we should provide it around the state the next thing I talked about is mentoring our state has one of one of the best laws I have ever seen our state crate is this beginning teacher mentoring law it's wonderful when I started in this work as the teacher Federation president it was one of my big goals to get it adequately

[01:33:00]
Statewide we had thousand dollars and we divvied up 900 + 900,000 among every beginning teacher in every of the 89 school districts so of course it was an adequate and we subsidized in APS with a lot of operational money then we Lobby in lobby and we got 1.5 million then I think we got it at one point up to 2 million and then it was 2008 and boom it was gone so we've been struggling to get funding back ever since there is funding in the state through the pad for a different kind of mentoring but it doesn't fund the law called beginning teacher mentoring program I have been able to research and experience in every District that I have ever seen we have a Premiere program one of the

[01:34:00]
best programs it is site-based every teacher knows who their Mentor is the mentor helps them through their first year not just to survive but to thrive so my goal is that we switch the way it's funded first of all we get funding we refund an existing law that is now an unfunded mandate that is very important then the second thing is we do it per new teacher because it makes little sense to me that you have a million dollars and so then you give what everybody 10 dollars to Mentor a teacher because there's so many new teachers hopefully there's so many new teachers we need at least 2000 dollars per beginning teacher and we need to figure out a way with the state to get that funded so that your operational dollars are not depleted for a state mandate you can use your seg money for other needs

[01:35:00]
induction that's the next one induction is a longer period of time to get support to become a teacher and most a lot of our teachers really feel that they need more support than they get in just one year of mentoring and I know reach a cone has worked in the Summers with teachers who have voluntary voluntarily come forward and said I really need a little extra help and I think it'd be great if we could do that Statewide so that teachers can voluntarily get more help in their second through 5 years before they transition to their level to teaching license and I think that's a specialty true and Special Ed I think if we truly want to attract and retain our special ed teachers giving them support for more than one year would really help

[01:36:00]
next thing on the Continuum professional development we all know that adult learning impact student learning more than almost anything else I don't think there is a silver bullet in terms of the way we can provide support for ongoing professional development I do know that the research says that if it's site-based job-specific and ongoing it has more impact what we don't have in this country especially in the state is any devoted time for professional development many states Across the Nation have two weeks of paid time for teachers to have professional development but in other countries their teachers spend a small amount of the day actually engaged with students and a large amount of their day engaged with other professionals and there are other structures of

[01:37:00]
to take care of the kids for for the hours we need to start investing in more professional development time it needs to be teacher driven not One-Shot deals from somebody lecturing and that's not necessarily connected to your job but I know we as a state need to start investing in the development of the teachers because the research is very clear the more the better you do at your job the longer you stay in your job and learning with others is very invigorating and engaging and helps you be a better teacher and I know that made a big difference in my career the next thing I talked about is resources we have to start taking the politics of funding our school and this is how it works and we all know it we need we need a stable adequate

[01:38:00]
Landing source so now we've got the lawsuit that says oh you have to find your school's adequately but if it's not stable then it's not adequate and so obviously we have to look for a lot of Revenue sources when I started teaching it was right after there was a big cut in taxes and there was a big drop in oil and gas and as a beginning teacher in 1982 making 11,800 I bought my own paper then after I kept teaching there was paper and then the oil and gas market went down and there was no paper so it's not just about whether I had paper to do my job that's important but it's about the fact that we think that one generation of children is worth a different amount than the next generation of children and that's just not true I want to school when we had great resources wonderful you didn't too bad

[01:39:00]
we can't do that in this state and I think everybody knows that and the lawsuit definitely has proven that so I think we need some collective political will around the idea that we are not going to allow things to continue the roller coaster but that we really want to have sustainable funding because that's how we do the rest of this with that sustainable funding I think we need competitive salaries and I've been pitching an idea for a couple years and so I want to talk about it here I think our three tier system is a great Statewide career letter I think we didn't do enough when we created it to create research papers that created Buzz around the fact that we have a Statewide career ladder that's based on competence and license

[01:40:00]
like the most famous educational researcher in the world literally wrote about our system in her teacher evaluation book and highlighted it as a wonderful competency-based system what we didn't do is finish flushing it out we didn't figure out a way to automatically increase the minimums at a regular base on a regular basis so they didn't get out of touch with reality and we didn't figure out what happened in the inside of a tear so right now we have this weird marriage between tears and steps in lanes and what happens is people that you know oh I got to level two oh I'm in my second year at level two and I'm making oh a dollar more it's just it doesn't make sense now the way we flow money in our Equalization formula from the state to the 89 school districts is by waiting a student and having the money follow

[01:41:00]
are you a student right and every attribute a student has carries more money so if you're a student and you have speech you have a multiplier because your attribute means that you need a little more money so we can hire the staff so you can have speech and that's how our student waited formula works well I would like our state to flow money to flush out our career ladder and I want to call it a teacher waited for me laugh so if I'm a basic teacher I carry away so you can pay my salary is a district if I'm a teacher with multiple credentials I should carry more weight and more money should flow from the state if I'm a teacher that carries responsibilities because we all know our schools run on teachers taking on more work than just teaching we run clubs We Run Sports we run all of the stuff that

[01:42:00]
play Schools running well if I take on responsibilities like mentoring I should have a factor a weighted Factor if I take on credentials work I can't think of the other ones but if you turn to page 15 I have a Graphic representation of three tears and I want you to know that if the state doesn't do this I think we should do this as a district if we have the funding I think our salary system is broken and I think if we can get the money through the scg to do this as a district we don't have to wait for the state but here's how I think in concept the numbers are not necessarily real I've never cussed it out I just want you to know that but I have the concept so level one level one is Bare Bones because I don't think anybody in level one should be assigned extra

[01:43:00]
please I think you should get mentored and learn how to teach and that's it too often we assign extra duties to level one teacher because nobody else will take them and it's not okay then in level two instead of these steps in Lanes which are archaic and broken we should have bands so when you get to level two you're in your first one through five years at level two not in teaching just at level two and if you take on more education you get a weight if you take on credentials you get away responsibilities if you have a good evaluation system and you can be accountable for your students learning or if you take on school leadership roles you should get away and in this way we have a career ladder where if I have a baby I can step away and do less work if I'm currently my kids are going to college and

[01:44:00]
I'm ready to step it up in my career I can take on more and do more work but I have the flexibility within my career to be the architect of what my pay looks like beyond my base pay so the take away is a teacher weighted formula would support a competitive Statewide career ladder compensation system and then finally teacher evaluation we know that our current teacher evaluation system has been a burden to principals and teachers it feels unfair I've talked to many teachers and I know other people have to who have left teaching because they're just you know I can retire it feels demoralizing and I'm just done well teacher evaluation systems cannot serve two masters we have to decide what is the goal of our teacher evaluation system

[01:45:00]
and that's what the research says so we can't have a deficit teacher evaluation model that's a gotcha kind of system that's why teachers leave we need to focus on feedback and growth because that's what they want and that's what they need so we can have a teacher evaluation for improvement purposes or we can have teacher evaluation for accountability purposes I think there's a lot of accountability in a lot of the structures of school and I think we need to do that through appropriate supervision teachers are accountable I want teachers to be accountable they want to be accountable but I don't think that's what this system should do I think it should be for improvement purposes and that means we need to have feedback really meaningful feedback one of the things that we did

[01:46:00]
when we had a bill that actually passed the legislature but was vetoed as we recommended that teachers have a cycle like we used to have of summative informative evaluation so when I'm past my probationary years I should have a summative evaluation every 3 years that way every principal at the school is giving formative feedback every year to every teacher and some of the feedback to a third of the teachers which cuts the workload of these yearly evaluations and I don't know how many principles are in the room but I think the yearly every single step of evaluation is killing principles and I don't speak for them but I think it should be doable and once you have passed probation you should rely on the form of feedback they're a lot of

[01:47:00]
what's your evaluation systems out there we're going to propose a new idea for this legislative session but I think we can have something that is doable and Rich and helps teachers with their teaching and gets away gets away from this gotcha system so that is a synopsis of the research and what I'm hoping we can continue to have a conversation about thank you thank you great information about what this is about so that we can actually make some reasonable progress through this okay cuz there's a lot of information here lots of questions lots of thoughts but I don't want to be here forever because I want to you know make sure that we're actually able to get clarification on

[01:48:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:49:00]
I started in 2000 2001 it was $900,000 and we worked with the LSC and we work to get the amount up and we got 1.5 million dollars at some point 2 million 08 it got wiped out they we had some allies who worked to put it back and got it at 1. 5 9 1

[01:50:00]
a mentoring program based on if you have high test scores you meant for someone with low test scores and I can't pursuing Excellence teachers pursuing Excellence I think is what it's called and that ended up getting funded at 1.5 million and the other 1.5 million is in theory in the seg but I think it's not offended mandate at least for many years if you looked at the state budget it was still alive but it was 0 but on that note if you don't mind what happens as they roll over the line items every year in the education committee says they're creating the education budget

[01:51:00]
end up falling off so there's no place saver line item for the Mandate anymore well I really appreciate the systemic approach and would like to continue to hear on how we can support you and thank you for the work that you put into this you and your staff thank you very much other questions that I think is really critical for us in Albuquerque about how do we make sure that we have a teacher teaching education and we know that one of the barriers to that is the cost of education and not just tuition but actually being able to live

[01:52:00]
survive and get through so so I guess I'd like to hear just a little bit more of expounding how how would this really serve to make sure that all of the potential teachers that we need in the classroom see that is see the path see their own pathway into that and I think part of it is on page 3 completely government this is a Long View there is no instant answer to our teacher shortage but you cannot entice people in any

[01:53:00]
ready to go into teaching if they don't see excited and engaged happy people in their own school and I and I don't mean to say we don't have that because I know every day and every school there are amazing people who are excited and engaged but I think the undertone the kind of the bad morale undertone comes through so I think it starts with Educators Rising I went to Future teachers of America that's what it used to be it starts with having that in the high schools because I can tell you the high school teachers I think you guys have met them that are educator Rising teachers are incredible role models who modeled that for the kids in their school but think about where the schools are right now Manzano

[01:54:00]
and El Dorado and Atrisco Heritage so think about engaging every student at every High School in every community in the possibility that teaching is for them you know just thinking about the thinking about how many and I fear that because of the kinds of fast tracking that we're doing that we can will end up with teachers in the classroom

[01:55:00]
one of the things that I would love to see is a public information campaign run by the state teach New Mexico only I think that phrase might not work but something you know teach true I don't know there's got to be a way to highlight the fact that it is amazing it is the most engaging exciting life-affirming occupation in my opinion that there is

[01:56:00]
what how do you envision building the support networks between all of us because this is going to be a massive lobbying campaign this is not going to be a one-off this is something that's going to take time it's going to take Building Bridges I mean everyone from the New Mexico Educational Alliance that was served in the Forefront of the lawsuit to the district to the unions and other employee groups what what do you foresee the first step in for moving forward an incredible amount of conversation among everybody that knows everybody I remember when Peter wintergrass

[01:57:00]
you're Peter Winograd did the research a long time ago on the fact that we were teaching in our colleges of Ed a ton of teachers who were then leaving to other states to make more money that's the research in the conversation that started creating the three tiered licensure as an actual law and his research really just just made everybody say I get it and then salaries went up for you know a year and we attracted to teachers for a little while so I think we need to do something similar this is all based on Research that everybody's using right now including the entire LSC I would like to start talking to the dean's of Education are we going to do that tomorrow we're going to talk to Dean's of in college is a vet Karen and I because we care about filling up their College's event again

[01:58:00]
because they're not and they're not Nationwide we have education partners that we've had for many years and it has been the unions both of them across the states across the state superintendents and principals Association the school boards and I'll be talking to Joe Gannon and maybe we can start talking together and then the ptas and I think if we just keep sharing these ideas and not worry about who owns them but jointly support them and talk in all of our different networks that we can get some Buzz going did you want to add to that thank you president Pearcy Dr piercing board member superintendent recall I just wanted to add that as part of this conversation in the Continuum that wouldn't be working on jointly with the union and the district we also are requesting some budgets for the

[01:59:00]
what's the upcoming year in order to sustain the Albuquerque teachers residency program and we work with UNM by Flores from UNM and in our last meeting last week we talked about how can we sustain this next year perhaps we split the cost UNM covers the cost of the faculty members because they want us to stay in that it does add to the numbers and their student prep program 25 more students and then we cover the cost of the stipends for the student residence in the Master Teachers so that's going to be in a budget proposal to the cabinet and Teresa Scott to wear that and then the other thing that is part of our budget request to an HR is to add an fttp it's not a full blown ft he because Educators rise in is just one course I think we can easily afford that for all high schools so that we can expand that program so we've been in a lot of these conversations and we're looking at trying to find a lot of these things and the Continuum has to start

[02:00:00]
because we have to start in high school we need to grow our own you know part of that is the easiest to which you did mention but that's another career pathway so it's but we all have to join forces on this thank you remember one of the things that I really appreciate about the approach to when you talked about that clinical experience and getting out immediately I mean cuz what it is is it's calling for a change also at the higher ed level right to really rethink the strategies that were using around how we're preparing and really doing that engaging teachers to be I was that person first time I did my student teaching I realized it didn't like it you know it wasn't for me because I also realized oh my God I spent all this time and Elementary Ed and I probably should have been in secondary

[02:01:00]
I really do love teaching I went and taught at a higher ed level and I loved it it was great I was able to to grow from that but I think that part I really like because in most jobs today that's how people prepare right you you get that opportunity to really sort of grow as you're going through through the through the process in terms of the CTE side absolutely love it but I think the other part of the layer of that conversation that also needs to be on top of that because it's not just about education but we're finding this at a government level right is also needing to make sure that we're Rising the awareness around young people about public service because it is about working in a public setting versus working in a corporate setting because there is a difference we're having that problem with young people that want

[02:02:00]
what to do it but are not thinking about it in a public setting because the the whole technology piece when you're working in a public setting also means a different kind of salary it means a different kind of piece but we're trying to piece it together with saying you're also serving your community it's it's it's about a public service that you're giving back and you're also helping to sustain communities and you're sustaining those pieces so I would want to see that part added and the reason I bring that up is because the students that were recognized today from Highland are part of that one organization that doesn't include Public Service into it and so it would be great if our schools had more of those associations too because we tend to have a lot of deca but we don't have a lot of the of the fccl organization and that's the organization that is about Community Partnership it's about public service and and working in that public sector even though I

[02:03:00]
I committed myself to still working in a public setting and working and focused on what could I do for my community and so I want to make that link also in the Career Technical Ed side about the distinctions between that because I think we tend to focus so much on corporate level types of employment and engagement and we we just sort of like push that one under the rock this is only one small part of a massive legislative agenda that we have as unions the other part of that of course is to make sure that we protect and preserve our pension systems because the public service deal that we've all made in public service is that we understand that it's not a corporate salary but that we in exchange for our Public Service have a pension

[02:04:00]
so part of our legislative agenda is to make sure that people want to go into public service because of those things and then the only other question I had was on the induction part because you talked about mentoring being unfunded but how would induction be funded because that still isn't just a carry over for more mentoring or is it how would that because you talked about 2000 for teacher for an incoming but what happens for induction yeah and I didn't flush that out and thank you for pointing that out my assumption is it would be similar only far fewer teachers I think our experience in the mentor program is if we're mentoring 600 new teachers a year there are 100 to 200 teachers who would probably voluntarily want more support and then I just want to point out that the health care shortage on the date of behind that

[02:05:00]
put Porsche legislation around loan forgiveness for the programs that were supporting nurses or medical professions that wanted to come here and work and stay in New Mexico so I think there's something to be learned from that piece of legislation to build on loan forgiveness for this as well I agree very nice thank you because you're systemic and you researched to make a good argument certainly have me so I'm curious though I can hear all this and be excited and forward-looking and then I read in the newspaper that John Arthur Smith says everybody wants a lot of money and part of what I'm trying

[02:06:00]
you don't understand is how do we get beyond the impasse of that kind of mentality because we have oh gosh a partisan driven set of assumptions and then we have people who maybe are in one party but act like they're in another and you know I I feel very very frustrated over the amount of angst the amount of just horrible horrible things that are passing for political dialogue these days I think what we need are from you what is what's the dollar amount needed for district to make this happen

[02:07:00]
I think we need to know what's the dollar amount needed for teachers in terms of stipends we have to be very practical I think there's an opportunity to braid systems here perhaps the Department of Labor could actually invest in teachers as opposed to doing what they usually do no offense Yolanda what seems like they do is they help start up businesses and others that have potential for technology that gets exploited elsewhere you know I'd like to know from you what are the three things we need to do next you know if you could just summarize that I know it's not fair to ask you like that but I don't feel like I want to walk away from here with you know feeling great but not really having a practical answer

[02:08:00]
board member Garcia I am so optimistic because I believe in less than 3 weeks this election is going to matter so much I invite you all we're having an early vote rally on Saturday our national president Randi Weingarten is flying into town we're going to park and ride over at the Mercado on Central and San Pedro we've hired some people some public school bus drivers to drive us in school buses down to Wilson Middle School we're all going to listen to a wonderful mariachi band from Atrisco Heritage we're going to enjoy and rally and then we're going to walk down we're going to block off San Pedro and walk down to the early vote Center at the Mercado in Castroville

[02:09:00]
I have five teachers running for office they have a very good chance of winning not I personally but you know there are five teachers running for office I think they have a very good chance of winning I think we're going to see more allies and the conversations that I have listened to it's like I believe this tiny little square face in the rest of the political atmosphere we're in is going to be a good place to be the square called New Mexico I really believe that and I think the first step of three steps is to vote the second step is to keep these conversations going about what it's going to take to revitalize our public education system that is currently demoralized

[02:10:00]
and when I tell teachers did you know that our teacher evaluation system never became law that it's only a rule and that in January the new governor will appoint a new secretary of education who can change that rule or we can get a new law passed they don't even believe me yeah you may never be evaluated according to test scores ever again oh really that's a reason to vote and a reason why teachers are becoming more hopeful so I believe that those things will turn people to the polls and then the system will get a little lightened up and a little money everybody knows that money is coming into education this year everybody says it I have never heard people make premature promises about money ever in my entire teaching career and I've heard people say it this year

[02:11:00]
we had a couple of folks parents who are suggesting that we have a moratorium on Charter Schools what's your opinion on that I see that some parents are here yes I think it's time to have a moratorium on charter schools for many of the reasons that were articulated by the parents tonight but also I think it's time to equalize the funding that charter schools get as I said this is part of a larger legislative agenda that we're going to have I think if charter schools are expected to function like public schools they should be funded like public schools and I don't actually want to take any money away from charter schools that exist right now but we definitely want to all get more money right but they shouldn't get more money I think I

[02:12:00]
understand that I'm going to have to think about that I don't know if I could say a different what's the third thing that you were going to say I think engagement and accountability that's all I know to say it's we as a culture don't engage in the kind of Civic dialogue that holds our elected officials accountable so once we've engaged in voting we can't stop that engagement there needs to be discourse and I think the discourse about what does it take to ensure that little kids like me and fourth grade want to become a teacher it's because they're having such a who was it said the other day that every

[02:13:00]
every kid comes home from school and play school until all of a sudden what do you want to be when you grow up and then it's not a teacher I mean there's got to be a way to continue that that enthusiasm and that's part of the dialogue that that we need to keep going and holding our public officials accountable for for supportive policy it's not just money its policy I don't know I made those up but I think voting is the first step thank you for the optimization and I realized

[02:14:00]
I could not make a living doing that and so I changed my profession one of the things I wanted to talk to you about is what would it take to expand that teaching program the teaching programs that you have at El Dorado and Manzano and Atrisco Heritage what would it take to to do that across the board and some of our schools I think that would be very helpful and superintendent reading we have talked a lot about this because those three programs have a lot of students in them and they're excited about it and it is like an internship or a program for teachers future teachers of America and it's just really a point to or maybe a 0.4 at each high school because then they can train people about the program and any teacher at the high school

[02:15:00]
can teach that class so there's not an endorsement issue it's just a matter of having a minimum we could get away with at each high school so using current staff perhaps if they can find an elective teacher to train yes I can do that right thank you thank you Google you just talked a little bit about having the state doing some messaging I think we need to do some messaging here and I think it's Billboards that show you want to be a teacher do you want to be starting at the elementary what are some of the things that

[02:16:00]
I see your teacher doing and what are the things that you can do as a teacher and I think it should start at the elementary school level and it's our messaging and how we talk to our community what we do out in our community and I think is board members I think superintendent really was talking about you know how do you get this message out I think if we had some talking points here that we could put out on some of our you know we do social media if we could do this I think it would be helpful Community I agree with you completely we have started as a teacher's Union putting it out there to our Union reps and our members that we will come and do Career Fairs one of the things that bothered me for many years is that you can go to school to Career Fairs and there's somebody representing engineering and somebody representing lawn somebody representing I don't know all kinds of things and there's nobody representing the profession of education and

[02:17:00]
so we've started doing that and we're going to be at two career fairs next week one at Mountain View Elementary and one at La Cueva High School I've actually got misky from El Dorado going to La Cueva cuz we're double booked but we have materials and so that's one thing we want to make it bright and attractive and we're trying to promote all careers in education not just teaching but counselors and nurses and everybody that it takes to be in public schools and I think Billboards around town you know I'm I think it'd be great and there are multi-generations of teachers that we can we can call out and I know kids I taught are now very experienced teachers scary thank you very much and I too I just stopped

[02:18:00]
is that we're going to be left with 1 1/2 to 2 billion in a surplus so very different than being in deficit that we were with the past administration so that is a good thing not only for education but for other people that will also take from that from that Surplus so thank goodness for this Administration and so I say yep we do need to go out and vote to continue on the same path one thing that I think I just having been an elementary teacher and I saw the kids that played teacher in my kindergarten class so I too would Envision having an after school teacher club for our elementary students it's just something to put out there I just remember them just loving playing teacher and all of them didn't all of them didn't play teacher it was so few kids that like to do that and there are those in in every

[02:19:00]
mushroom so I think that's just something to maybe you know like you were in future teachers of America well we can start that I think at an elementary level is at least an after-school kind of activity that they may be able to do it's just it's a thought and then also I had a question that the teacher the alternative licensure the teacher Residency program Dr Bernstein how long does that last how long does that take they take classes in the summer it's over so that they take card in the summer school year and then Karen they take classes the following summer and then they're done that's basically like almost a whole calendar and then I know that you had mentioned talking about making it more rigorous to get into the colleges of Education as we know that's a case in many other countries

[02:20:00]
so what do you envision that looking like at least here in New Mexico rigorous by what standards like what test scores what what standards I would have to research exactly what other countries do in terms of how they assess whether somebody is good enough to be in a college event but I think one of the things they go with is great point average I'm sure they have entrance exams that's not an area I have done a lot of research on but I know that there are requirements for getting into different colleges at a university and oftentimes College of Education have the Lesser requirements rather than the more rigorous requirements that's what I've seen so that would be interesting research if you have time you know I know you probably don't but I think it's important to kind of look at what other countries do because I think that's an important thing to to do in my opinion teaching is

[02:21:00]
the best profession ever so that's just what I think I mean you touch the the future every single solitary day so I think it's a great one the other thing I know that you had talked about the alternative licensures that they are like substandard why do you think that currently you can get an alternative license to be a teacher without any clinical experience in New Mexico so without any clinical experience and very little coursework I think the requirement is a couple of reading classes and so we basically the research is really clear on alternative licensure that is a shortcut rather than just a different way to get licensed and what happens is a lot of times we go after like retired mathematicians

[02:22:00]
in scientists at the labs to fill our Math and Science High School courses and what the people report in the research is that their image of what it would be like to be a teacher in the reality were so different and that knowing your content is not enough you have to also know the content of how to teach and they report often after they leave after a year or two that they feel bad they did a disservice to the kids that they taught because they really didn't understand what it took to teach and so what we want to do in America is say that it takes really smart people and what Linda darling Hammond says is you have to be smart and two ways content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge and that one without the other does not make a good teacher I mean so I just a little bit with you there but when we're looking

[02:23:00]
maybe high school children and then we're looking at college-level children and we see professors that are able to teach and they didn't go through student teaching they didn't go through any of that so I mean why do you think that they weren't able to do that I could see it a little bit more just having been an elementary teacher that that might be a little bit more difficult to do but for people who are teaching high school kids just a few months after high school they're in college and they're being taught by somebody who really never went through too much Aragon I actually have a strong belief that some of the worst teaching happens at the college level because it is so lecture-based I think there's enough research about how people learn and enough experience that universities

[02:24:00]
were created to sort people only the elite were supposed to finish in a university and only the people who were able to sit through like I failed my biology class my first year of college cuz it was in one of those lecture Halls you know where there are 300 people yeah exactly and the person was down there on a screen and I was so disengaged and I was an Engaged student and I wanted to go to college but I did not do well anyway I stopped going not a good idea don't nobody do that anyway I just really think that we have to reform our universities I think it's a discussion nobody's willing to have and that is if we think everybody should go to the university and it doesn't matter if you're from the owning class or the working class but that you're supposed to be successful then we

[02:25:00]
I need to look at it as a different than the the beginning people are in the largest classrooms and then you get to be engaged if you make it through your first two years and that the people that are actually teaching have some pedagogical knowledge so I would like to say that they could use some strategy also that's that's for sure exactly and I know this whole teacher Residency program and I mean some of the other things that you're you're talking about is like a really it's an expensive proposition so we know that the chances of us being able to do all of this or I don't know maybe slim to be able to do it all if you have to choose prioritize maybe the top three things that you think that we would be able to get the money to do what would you prioritize

[02:26:00]
that's a great question when I wrote the union newsletter last year I talked about planting seeds so I hope that we can plant a lot of seeds and if I had to only kind of like my graphic planting seeds letting them grow if I had to only plant a few seeds that would make the most immediate difference for us I would focus on CTE in high school I would focus on refunding mentoring and competitive salary expensive just right now because the default on loan's college loans as I think close to trillion dollars right now so that's just an expensive that's an expensive

[02:27:00]
but I was wondering if you had I was looking I had spoken to somebody when I was at the cube conference that was from Baltimore City and I was wondering if you had looked at their they replaced their pay scale with a career ladder and it looked really amazing because those they have like four different four different levels I think it was called a standard a professional model and a lead and so that when you get to the lead you can make up to like 100,000 when you get there and they do it all by something called a used which could be professional development it could be on their evaluations there was like several different ways that they can earn those so I was wondering if you had looked at had looked at that because I think I know that would probably be really expensive as well but it looked fascinating I have looked at a variety of career ladders

[02:28:00]
one of my colleagues actually tried to create what he called a career lattice so you could weave together that it wasn't like you climbed up or down but that you had different Pathways anyway I haven't looked at that model but there we have actually co-created in our collaborative work through the decades the union and the district different models of career ladders that build on the idea of taking on leadership positions in credentials and all of those things being a lead teacher so I've seen many we've created some I haven't seen that one it was it was just fascinating to talk to one of the board members from Baltimore City and some of the things that they were doing but I thought it was just wonderful that they could just go and all of them have these different professional responsibilities depending on the level that you're at and so they just went away with the pay scale and just gone to this so it might be something

[02:29:00]
when you have a free moment to just look up thank you thank you thank you very much I'm going to take the rest of the 3 hours here I really do have a lot of questions but not questions and just comments first of all I love the systemic approach I think the idea of the CTE is what I've been trying to say in terms of an overall CTE framework that we need to have and we need to promote that you got a little bit of news for having some vocational know I want us to be out front I want a framework to become to us and it includes something like the Educators we need to get it out there guys and we need to make it make it work and this is part of it this is part of it so I think that's I think that's absolutely great the alternative

[02:30:00]
I made some comments about you know we had at the region for a meeting there was somebody who mentioned the fact that we're trying to get teachers and so why don't we just do alternative licenses and get people who were smart people and come in and teach and I made a big speech about what you said basically you know I said well you know I don't have the pedagogue necessary even though I've taught in college I've taught in high school actually but I didn't and I thought that was really important you know well then I woke up the other night and I said I probably should have said yes but there is some really positive things that about that and they're positive in the sense of what you said in other words the idea being yes let's recruit some people from whatever but let's give them some mentoring let's give them some background in terms of what teaching is about right so that we can actually not necessarily

[02:31:00]
a total education program but very specifically to their topic and how you handle classrooms and so forth a pedagogue and we can have recruiting that way so I wish I could go back and say that to my raging for people because I kind of made it a negative when in reality I probably should have said no let me tell you why this is a good idea right and that's and it is a good idea to do that but under circumstances not just bringing somebody because you've got a PhD in mathematics and so therefore you're going to be really good that's not necessarily true and I've had a lot of college professors and I can probably count them on two or three of my fingers don't like to be really really good teachers didn't mean I didn't learn a lot that's a different situation because you know your challenge to learn when you're there but you know I could have had a little you know from a teaching point of view you know it's not exactly good

[02:32:00]
I think this this this this this this this framework is very interesting because you know when we were down there at the region for me and we talked about funding and priorities right and how do we build priorities in our funding now the question is when you start having all these ad hoc bills sitting out there right the question is how do you know where they go and how they fit into let's say the education so if you look at your side of things here you know teach your residencies educated all those things right the question is does that bill fit in any of those things and is it supporting what we're trying to do in the education that you can say oh okay your targeting stuff and by the way Educators write would be a part of that so let's make sure that we get that put into the legislative agenda right

[02:33:00]
and so I think we have a way to look at the the the the whole system from a from a framework kind of point of view I like that I think again I don't so to some extent I mean you talked about a teacher model I thought that was very interesting that was very interesting but I will question your evaluation the reason I say you mentioned evaluation having like every three years of Summer and and all this well that kind of suppose is the fact that I've got common principal common teachers are the same school kind of because I get a kind of a common and I get a continuous kind of a thing and I don't get that I really don't have that a teacher's move around principles move around and so it's just like students that's why that's why they growth

[02:34:00]
stuff and everything else and I'm trying to measure student proficiencies and growth and school grades is a problem right because they move around and and it's a problem with individual schools right so it's the same kind of a problem with evaluation so somehow we have to figure out something that might work a little differently maybe but a very much like the Danielson model I like it as it is not as it's modified right that's why we have people doing research you know because we have a model that actually works has research so go use it right but how we add another things I don't know you know I think there's some more but so I'm not sure about that evaluation I'd be careful about that even though I don't necessarily disagree with having a summation every three years somebody you know whatever I think the formative evaluation with the Danielson observation

[02:35:00]
they get it from their Master teachers from the administration you know that's that's the right thing so I I I I I like this a lot and I appreciate greatly you bringing it to us I think this is very timely before the legislative session I do agree that step one is to vote but I think again we need to be very proactive I know that we mention the fact that we need to be on Governors teams about education we need to volunteer we need to say you're going to have a team on on looking at the education process I would like to be part of that you know if you going to have something on the evaluation or whatever or selecting the next public education

[02:36:00]
Mission department secretary hey we'd like to be able to provide some input on that or maybe be on your team to do that so it's a follow-up for that too because we need to get our voice out there in terms of these kind of things that you put forth and so I think we have a little bit more of a systemic approach to how we might want to talk about that cuz I hate all these little pieces that I can't kind of get them together you know so I appreciate it greatly what you did how we do that you know I I very very much like the idea of the clinical experience might actually get out without having any clinical experience at all she says that was just unacceptable so I think that's true for all of our

[02:37:00]
and The Residency program in terms of not just the getting people into it you know like like mathematicians and so forth but but from the teacher preparation program that we've got with you and him you know that says hey I'm going to bring you in as Juniors let's say and have a mentored with a master teacher so they get some experience and like you'll understand maybe they don't like it you know maybe they don't waste all their time in college and get out with a degree in the city I don't like this you know so they get a little bit I think it's going to be important for us to figure out if we do Educators Rising how to have some structure at local universities so that they can continue the interest in their first second and then into their clinical experience years because we don't want to lose that interesting enthuse

[02:38:00]
it doesn't because everybody has to take English 101 you know they have to be there's got to be a way to help them through that time and stay connected yeah I agree and I think again that other piece of it is not just here working here with with you know Educators rising and then we got our own know we've got to work with the universities it's got to be both of these collaboration so that we have this this this this system that's working for us right now go to university and there's an organization and they don't you know that does not going to work now our students go other places you know what I mean it's not just you know Mexico State University how do we do that how do we get other universities out there understand what we're trying to do here you know what I mean well that's a big problem

[02:39:00]
good stuff I think it's one of the better things that we we have heard from a nice discussion from a board point of view probably ought to do more more of these kind of things this is the right kind of stuff to have and and I hope the people out here who have stayed around get a little bit of that field too from what we have so thank you I am very I'm very grateful that we have this opportunity to have this conversation and you've been very kind to give me this time thank you very much okay we'll go on to the next item number which is the consideration for approval of our evaluation tool for the 2018 and just to give you a little background we did get some input we got some input I know from several board

[02:40:00]
so he tried to look at the existing evaluation tool we have and tried to integrate some of those comments into the evaluation tool itself so that we get a better feel for the superintendent as to what's expectations here and and then we also I suggested that we change the statements from a question mark to a more of a statement you know I like evaluation where they have a statement so that ideas that you you look at the statement and you say if you're doing just fine you you got it in the middle of you a little bit better you go over here more if you give something that says the Superman you're already in trouble because you know if you don't really think so you trying to kind of you know make those statements be a little bit different it's still pretty much

[02:41:00]
so those are some of the things that were done in terms of what we have here so I'm going to let Brenda kind of explain some of that and you should have had a copy of this just to kind of briefly look at it but we've seen this except well if you've gone through one of the evaluations yet I came on as you guys were just doing it it was kind of a brand new yet so it's not real real real real estate so we have seen it so it's not like we have so many more

[02:42:00]
on the superintendent evaluation survey tool but I'd like to kind of put that in context for you and review the timeline of how all this will work to help you with your decision tonight so after approval tonight the staff will convert the word document that you have in your package digital document and then on November 2nd they're about so you will receive the Survey Monkey evaluation form in your email for individual completion and then you and the superintendent will have the week of November 5th to the 9th to complete the evaluation form the following week of November 12th through the 16th the individual evaluations on November 16th

[02:43:00]
you'll receive the board summary with all of the responses your individual evaluation and the superintendent self-evaluation form for your individual review and and consideration to think about before the first meeting when you meet together then the next two dates you should have on your calendar cuz they've been on your calendar since March so please make sure that they are on your calendar without conflict so Tuesday November 20th that's a special board meeting that you need to ensure again on your calendar the board convenience to review and discuss the survey summary and superintendent evaluation and together as a board you'll discuss your individual evaluations and you'll determine a consensus ranking to provide one evaluation to the superintendent you'll decide on the format of how you want the evaluation to be to be set up with the superintendent and the next really important date is Monday

[02:44:00]
play November 26th November 26th the board at that date and at that meeting will meet with the superintendent to discuss evaluation and provide written results from the evaluation form to her then your regular meeting on December 5th is when you'll review the superintendent's contract so that brings us back to tonight to the evaluation survey you did see this last year's document actually this past April May and several of you asked to provide additional items or changes that you want you want to considered for inclusion so without doubling the length of the document that you're voting on tonight we did include many of those additions and changes in some sort of format so with that

[02:45:00]
I asked for your conversation and your approval of the superintendent evaluation survey tool tonight thank you I didn't know that I think you said December 20th November 20th yes November 20th November 20th November 26th November 20th November 26th OK Google is specific to engaging APS families we have sections in here that talk about engaging the Albuquerque community and energizing the aps Community do you feel like as a board that that is that specific

[02:46:00]
quickly engaging APS families is covered in nothing and the evaluation without it doesn't actually come out and say that you know but it's the community but I think again one of the things that the superintendent may want to consider is are the comments that have been heard from here like for example do we need to form a parent advisory committee or not you know I mean those are things that I think the superintendent may come back to us if that's appropriate now we can ask for that of course but I think it's important to know everything that's already in place around engaging APS family so we don't always you know what we learned last week was really important about that group but the aps family is connected so I mean I think it would be there are a lot of things that are being done right so the question is how do we you know sometimes I think again

[02:47:00]
play we have some community members and the question is do they understand what we're doing either you know I mean sometimes I think that's that's not understood well so yeah that's a question if you don't want to change this and call it out specifically as long as superintendent reading it and reports out on it then perhaps it can be covered under engaging the Albuquerque Community or it can be covered under energizing the aps Community if we don't want to make changes tonight but I want to really hear about how are we engaging our APS families and normally that does come out of that hilarious because we're talking about Community meetings and all those kind of things that we have quite

[02:48:00]
and I think again when we when we talk about this in our discussions we can always ask that question you know what I mean that there's there's nothing there the question is do we want to micro those things because now maybe we should ask something about well how about the business community and how about that you know so we could start in the many different multiple questions underneath that which is part of it no I want to know how we're engaging with the business Community you know because how do I Community Schools work Community Schools are supposed to work in terms of working with the families and so forth right isn't that one of the mechanisms we have for doing that right so all those things are part of that same question right so I think that it's okay I'll go again you know if everybody here says I want to know

[02:49:00]
if we're going to have a parent advisory committee I guess we could ask that question but we're always welcome to ask that question anyway you know there are a lot of questions here you know what I mean ton of questions you know where is we might want to just say how are we doing you know you're kind of talking about and what a lot of schools do and they have a lot of districts have a ton of questions they have like 60 70s or that would be meet expectations doesn't mean expectations there's only one Community Forum or whatever so that's what they do to address what you're talking about so it's as many questions it just has a rubric for each question that would talk to what you're talking about

[02:50:00]
and it seems like it's in the conversation I mean the most meaningful part I believe if any evaluation is in the conversation that goes on and so it's it's not that that's not absolutely critical important question that I think it comes up adequately in the conversation that we carry on me I recall going to a number of Title One events where what passes for family engagement is kind of a call out for parents to come and be in a meeting where they get sort of information bombarded on them and I don't see

[02:51:00]
let us family engagement I think we have to have a definition for what successful family engagement is what it could be and how do we know that there are opportunities for families to be engaged and perhaps it's not appropriate to add that into this discussion but I think I have to think the parents that have come forward and said look this hasn't worked for us how do we help people you know one get back to them show them where they're maybe those opportunities but I I like the idea of at the level at least of the Zone superintendents an opportunity for people to listen to what parents have to say and get information that they might not ordinarily get I just think it's critical and it has to be a two-way process

[02:52:00]
we are I mean I'm a grandparent of students in APS I think I have some information limited as it may be but I do try to share a perspective that's at least from there you know I mean we've talked about art music and school every year that's important you know I think what's what's frustrating for parents often as they don't necessarily know where to go or if they're hurt when they speak out and I think we have to figure out a way to set it up so that there are opportunities to follow up and say did your concerns get addressed how did we do you know and wow that's a we missed it on this one we never thought about that I mean I think the website has made an incredible amount of progress over the years so that parents have an opportunity what you reported this evening is incredible

[02:53:00]
I would have never thought it was possible a few years back it seemed like we got a lot of blank stares initially when we would bring up the idea of we need to improve our our web page so I think we need to flush it out more I don't necessarily know that we need to add it this time but I do want to say to the parents or at least the people in this room I think those those concerns are being heard and sometimes it takes one or two presentations to get us to hear what you're saying let me let me follow up with this little bit and that's because I just went to the step training thing and the step training is exactly that at the school level just trying to say how do we schools get here and do this two-way communication with the community with his family with the parents and so forth and so I know that that is one piece of what they're trying to do now this is not necessarily at the

[02:54:00]
turn to level or even at the superintendent level that may be a different kind of a level of of discussion but this is intended to be for the parents the families that are there in the community and working with their schools and so how you do that through this training process is what they talked about all day basically and they had teams from the different schools that came and said okay how are we going to work this what's our action plan what are we going to do to actually implement this and I thought it was a very very good systemic kind of approach with every school now being able to do their own tailoring of that so to speak okay so that's a school level aspect okay now that has a little different perspective I think from having a larger perspective let's say the district and so forth and that's another level of potential okay so I don't know that it's a disagreement that we might not have both of those kind of things

[02:55:00]
but I do believe at the school level is where you're going to have the most direct impact and and coordination with the parents and with the families and with the community that's in that school that's going to be where you're going to find the most used because they're there at the school right that's and they want to know what should I do and how do I connect and who do I talk to and all that and that's what they're going to get that information is from this school but a lot of times you know now they have to work their way back down to the school and where are you and what exactly is the concern and you know so it kind of gets it gets and that's why I think we have this delay all the time because they're trying to get back down to where are you at the school so if we can get that at the school from most of the time I think that's going to be a better approach but that's something that we can hear about you know I mean I was I was I almost didn't go you know how it is you know I got it on my calendar

[02:56:00]
if you can do that across the schools and they've got I don't know 77 schools that they're 75 775 schools that they're working on this so there are things that are going on is what I'm saying and sometimes we don't even know all about dinosaurs have been there besides just me and so I think those are some interesting people

[02:57:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:58:00]
I mean the only way to really fix it is to listen to the feedback that we get but I do think that it's really important to have I mean we have the super sack we need we need access we need families to have access to the superintendent I mean I I think we have an amazing superintendent who knows how to listen to people who knows how to connect with people and we have no structure set up for that engagement to go on and the zones I think from Minnesota

[02:59:00]
Arabic administrative stuff it's it hasn't been a pathway for the community to have that kind of input and I and I just think there's no reason why why we can't have the superintendent accessible to the community for conversation because it's something that I think the superintendent does really well and I think that we would learn from just simply having that advisory committee but not have it be restricted just open it up have that kind of I think it would serve the district superintendent I don't think it would be that much of a burden and I think it would give the community an opportunity to have the kind of input their feeling like they're not happening right now I think that's something that we can take care of I don't think that specific

[03:00:00]
quickly need to be in the evaluation I think that just becomes part of the conversation that we have in the evaluation process but I don't know I don't see any reason why there's a barrier to doing that ok Google

[03:01:00]
so I just think that if we had and I know it's a lot of work but if we had some kind of rubric that said a one means you know doesn't encourage high standards like maybe the five stars was does everything and renews and remodel you know models high expectations like if we had a rubric then I would know because I definitely know that I don't think three what you think is the three and I think is the three are definitely not going to be the same thing so I think would just be would be very helpful well I think it'd be difficult to have a rubric for everyone in these questions and they had a rubric for it they did have a rubric for everything well that's just that was just be very

[03:02:00]
is rather than create a rubric for every single one what you create is what's called a likert scale and the likert scale says if you're if you agree with this with a statement that's there basically you sit in the middle if you think they're doing better than that you go to the right if you think you're doing less than that you go to the left and that's how you do that so every one of these is now it's very difficult don't get me wrong it's difficult to write a question that is neutral in the middle is difficult that's why I tried to do with Brenda little bit to take the words that are adjectives words out of there and adverbs for example the first one that place is Student Success is the top priority for communication a communication systems so if she's doing that basically as stated she's just

[03:03:00]
what are the priorities in than normal maybe maybe go up one if you think it's less than that you go down one so that's where you start in these and that's kind of the way I think it's easier to do this process and trying to create this rubric for everything which is also questionable because what you're doing is you're signing what a one means and you may say well I don't agree with that that's not what I mean so you know we use those words like one means didn't do anything to means did little three means a pretty good well that's all you're doing is identifying and so generally speaking I don't even like a 5-point scale I like a 4-point scale which says you can't be in the middle I don't allow you to be in the middle you either say they're doing well or they're not doing so well so you have to go on either side statisticians don't like that

[03:04:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:05:00]
at this point in time anyway and look at a rubric for every one of these but there may be some way to think about a more General rubrics how do we how do we just like I just explained here maybe that's a way to explain how do we actually look at what a one means or two means or three means or something like that and see if we can get a better common understanding maybe that's something to think about here maybe like for number one about improving academic outcomes we can come up with something for that one and for the second one we could come up here and maybe at the top level I like that much better than anybody else for example what is it really think that we're doing so that's maybe

[03:06:00]
play something that we could even think about and maybe the superintendent has some ideas about that you know cuz I think again that's the general thing what what questions are is is trying to explain to you what you think you mean by academic outcomes that's all questions all right and if we haven't included all the right questions and then what we have is a top-level topic that we have some questions that reflect some aspect of it but maybe not all the aspect of it and so sometimes even easier to talk alone and if you want to correlation kinds of things which you do is you say Let me let me just answer the question that the top from one to five right and then let me look at all the individual ones and let me see if the scatter plot if I if I don't agree that all the questions and all the scatter plot of all the answers I give you down here in the lower level

[03:07:00]
don't agree with what I said at the top level now if I look at the top level and says what is the superintendent due to Improvement academic calculus let me just think about that in general when I give her a 4 or 3 or 2 or 5 or what would I give her and I give her a number and then I go and I do all the questions and I look at a scatter plot of that and I see where it looks at a scatter plot I mean I'm not averaging I say this again and again these are just numbers that represent a a range they are not real numbers I could use anything from low medium high I can use things that are not numbers represent what I mean by the top one

[03:08:00]
and that's kind of how that works in terms of a measurement kind of concept in terms of evaluation and and that may be something that we can think about too in other words what I say what I think should be the top level number and then let me do all the questions and then mostly these six topics are what they use across the across the country and some of them just use those six people and in reality when we do this we look at the summary and we do have notes or something you know how many how many people we

[03:09:00]
what kind of a rating on that which is a lot like this is exactly what you said so I think what we're doing with the questions is trying to just say there are some things that we kind of would like to hear details about you know and you have a lot of details that you you indicated and we tried to get some of those in the performance framework cuz I agree I think having real goals having real projections of what we think we want to have is a good thing for the superintendent to have and so some of that will come out of that I think from our discussions in other words we're going to have to see what the superintendent really the general number cuz I I agree with a lot of things that I heard from people

[03:10:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:11:00]
put the workshops was about parent engagement and what that look like what that looks like in the schools and it was really when you first hit that front door it's even talking to the custodian your contact information you know contacting those who are at the front and those relationships that you build as you go along as you come into the school it's talking to a one-on-one relationship with parents and then having that ongoing conversation with families and it's it's a constant it's it's it's it's building relationships with her family and our students and I think that's really important yeah I do too and in fact I didn't find it and stuff they do Define exactly what you're saying they do

[03:12:00]
attract indicator 101 indicate the relationships and indicated definition so they do have that now whether we like it or don't like it that's another question but they do have a definition of that so that maybe can be brought to us in terms of that you know just as a board in general know whether you like it or don't I mean I think what I saw was very much exactly what you said Patty candy everything you said was in that definition in terms of building the relationships having a conversation absolutely every single one of those things where is there a button it from our family engagement from that so that is what that is about is trying to implement it at school level okay that's okay

[03:13:00]
it's still something that's maybe in addition to that but I very much like the idea that the schools themselves are working on how do we do that because they're the ones that are on the ground floor you know they're the ones Candy that are working with individual parents and everything and and if they do it right we're going to have most of the issues probably covered there be my guest but that doesn't mean we wouldn't like to have the opportunity to have them you know because superintendent really does have a good way to communicate she has a good way to do this and collaborate and so to have our people see this and to talk with her on this I think would be very useful in other words it's another way to promote our schools it's another way to promote what we're doing in APS and to be available in terms of the top level you know so people don't say what you're up to anybody else when that's not true

[03:14:00]
true but if if an individual doesn't have a chance to actually participate they feel that way so the perception is there so just a message I think that's that's a thought okay and we've heard that we've heard that you know from from our parents tonight we've heard that from parents before so there's a thought ya remember so I would like to make the suggestion that in section 4 that we add a one item in that section the somehow says his developed Pathways for Community for listening to the community for for allowing for having Community input some I'm not sure exactly how

[03:15:00]
in that section for that specifically addresses the the communication into the district not just the communication out from the district and then with that that I moved to accept this as it stands because I think the I mean I think it's an interesting idea I can't see us being able to create that between now and what the time frame is but maybe maybe for next year early on in the process just look at some of the models that are out there for others I think it's too much of a task to think we could do it for this for this if you want a question the deals with how do you

[03:16:00]
how would you change that to make it what you want it to be so maybe it's communication externally the superintendent develops develops structures or Pathways for Community right because you have a level of Engagement with the school and I think we've done a really good job with the step and working and solving their issues at that

[03:17:00]
level right but what happens when you have to have a level of Engagement that is either at the Zone level or then it rises up to the district level how does that work and how do we engage parents when you know because there are and what I've seen is that there are a number of issues that could come up that are specific to his own for example and they're unique to his own and it's not just at a school level but it really is something that needs to happen at that level and what I heard from the parents clearly is like when and how do we engage with them at that point when we're needing to problem solve because the problem is even bigger than us we can't solve it by ourselves and we really need that Community input to help us solve that so I don't have any like solutions to the Google explain what I'm saying is that what

[03:18:00]
what I wanted to say was that I see this simply as our tool to start that conversation and that evaluation because I think that that part would come out so if I was doing this evaluation and I'm looking at that external piece then my comments would be back to what just what I just said yes we have parents engagement we have a step program and we're good at the school level but what is our level of Engagement and maybe that's where the Improvement needs to be how about the word engaged with the idea that engages means what the definition is down here in this step thing which is a two-way kind of communications engages means how do we engage with him thank you

[03:19:00]
I did 30 minutes ago it just says the superintendent engages with external School District constituents and members of the public engages and how about and develop structures and Pathways for questions is bad because and says but I don't have any Pathways so now how do I do this superintendent OK Google

[03:20:00]
Pathways for family engagement is that okay I mean I don't care about businesses care about Publix

[03:21:00]
not saying anything about the rest of the questions I want to make sure we understand don't care about anything in that question here and engagement engagement externally engagement period

[03:22:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:23:00]
Farmers framework you mean I just see it here I just I just thought I'd call the opportunity Gap instead I think it should be the achievement Gap it aligns with the lawsuit the language that's being used in the lawsuit that was used in the lawsuit you know we don't have to do it but it's okay if the board members think that that's what we should do I mean I've gone back and forth with this term back and forth I think a lot of times we use the word opportunity get we use that as a positive note is we think it's an we have opportunities here now there's a diverse group those are opportunities and we think there's a gap in the opportunities that we have as opposed to achievement a lot of opportunities here that we have not just by the way we were talking about

[03:24:00]
what's the treatment when you start looking at grades graduation rates and all that it's really an achievement but we already have efficiency rates and things like that so I did my suggestion is that we change it to achievement Gap or reducing the achievement Gap but it's a school district how do we actually address it what tangibly do we do to address it and so the tangible implementation of of closing the achievement Gap is to look at what opportunities are we providing so it becomes to me then it becomes a resource thing it becomes it be

[03:25:00]
how do we actually implement it in a way that students feel and we do that by saying what is it that one one group of students have access to that another group of students where it becomes Our obligation in our responsibility to provide it so I think that's the way that's the reason that it got shifted temperature to actually do something about it but you're comfortable using the opportunity Gap I just think it should be there I know that's your level of comfortable because the

[03:26:00]
play thing talks a lot about Equity tell me a lot of big cocks a lot about opportunity talks a lot about the fact that the problem is is that a lot of our students don't have the opportunities that they should have so I have a mixed feeling about in terms of just a Yazzie lawsuit because I think in fact it does talk about opportunities and so I think the idea of saying reducing opportunity just about graduation

[03:27:00]
do all the things that we talked about it every meeting right guys is in fact what we're actually reducing so you know that's my thought about what that means so because we have all the other things already and just asked what we think about changing it from opportunity what do you think what do you think Barbara I think I think the place to put the achievement Gap is in the this is my personal phone as the heading

[03:28:00]
then if we're talking about academic outcomes there to to put it in that over overall if we're talking about equity and in all of these things it's a thoughts of things are really looking at what are our goals what are our Majors what do we want to have for graduation

[03:29:00]
had a question about changing opportunity I want to know from a board member point of view do we like achievement better or do we rather have opportunities to suggestions

[03:30:00]
and the reason I say that is achievement is one aspect of opportunity but it doesn't Encompass all the aspects of opportunity that I think we're trying to address Peterson Florida

[03:31:00]
but you never had it you got to give it back to Peterson here or remember Patterson's about

[03:32:00]
what students have access to the student achievement in the part of I think I'm still thinking I'm still thinking because I think the point is that we need to know if we're serving students will and how do we need to look at to know if for serving students and I think that's what if we if we leave it to only test scores

[03:33:00]
helpful for what action we actually carry through with and that's why that's why I keep going back to the opportunity Gap do they have access to AP classes do they have access or providing what students need to be successful are we providing the CTE things how are we going to Define achievement and I think in the lawsuit it's a breath are they scoring the same on test scores radio

[03:34:00]
and so I

[03:35:00]
can give us some of that information or maybe say those are really good ideas and we're working on that maybe the sapper stuff that we're doing right now with Richard you know he's starting that process they giving us over time and what our goals are going to be and what we're going to try to do next year in the year after that so there may be an implementation so I think the idea was and and a lot of this is from what Peggy gave us was let's get some detail

[03:36:00]
so it's not saying that we might not have other words here or other things they're probably lots of other things that we have included like I don't think I've seen C in here you know well you know I want you to eat too and you know that's that's part of an academic message too I think I think you have a concern that I guess

[03:37:00]
and I think I think there is an underlying concern that you have if we don't have that language and it's probably a concern that we need to listen to so I just want to hear what is it if we don't use the terminology because I'm kind of holding on to opportunity to get but I think there's a concern that you have that if we don't use that the terminology of achievement Gap we're going to neglect something that we need to not neglect and I don't I don't believe that it's nothing like necessarily I just think that when you look at the Disco don't we all don't we always do that don't we look that what are the outcomes

[03:38:00]
English language

[03:39:00]
we actually delineated a lot of those elements that are part of achievement that that was what was done here and so that's why I'm having trouble with why it isn't doesn't include that okay because those are the things that in fact define I think if we revisit this at another time maybe we could take a look at a little closer I'm okay with leaving at the way it is at this point I just think we probably should have had a work session before we brought this to the

[03:40:00]
as a board or even a retreat looking at this information quite frankly because we spent over an hour and a half an hour and 45 minutes on this and so at this point in time I just think leave it as outcome the what is it the opportunity so do we have an agreement on change change

[03:41:00]
we actually did have a presentation on APS families connected and had an opportunity to

[03:42:00]
hear about programs and services that they provide to our schools and because of your comments are major questions to them were well how do our families know about it how are you communicating these kind of programs and services to our to our community so we did learn a lot about the aps families connected and in reference to family engagement so we hope that our associate superintendents can meet with the Bandelier parents and discuss opportunities around family engagement and also concerns around school culture as well one last thing there is a draft calendar that is out for the school year of 2019 and 2020 you can find it on the aps website we can also email it to you if you want if there's anyone left in the room we can share that with you and we would love your input on that calendar and that's it thank you thank you

[03:43:00]
are there other comments from anybody yes remember Garcia I want to just go back to the public forum presenters regarding the ZF Family Focus Center we need to figure out a way to at least talk with these folks have a conversation and see how we engage them and perhaps some opportunities it sounds like the they have something they like it's helpful to hear from the young people and my hope is that whoever you decide superintendent radio program I also wanted to just say something about the the issue of charter schools in Marshalls and that kind of thing it's been very

[03:44:00]
number of years because we've had Charter Schools approved all over the place without consulting us and the assumptions that are often made about Charter Schools versus Public Schools is entrenched in a lot of harshness we know we have schools that are struggling and we're doing our best to get them on track but I also think that it's been an unfair portrayal of APS in terms of how we're doing and come to find out that Charter Schools don't do much difference and it's frustrating and how do we have a dialogue you know we got a very helpful presentation from Dr Bernstein

[03:45:00]
how do we begin to have a dialogue because there are a lot of people that are convinced otherwise that what we need to do is improve education for everyone and I think that's part of that presentation in our state be there at Charter Schools and or certainly our Public Schools we have to move this forward from this intransigence that's kind of gotten stuck on us so those are my comments thank you thank you very much I wanted to just speak out about the the charter school moratorium and stuff because part of what I've expressed some concerns as we're moving along to is just the amount of resource that it takes for us as a school district to also support the charter schools and we need to pay attention to that because I think we we need to

[03:46:00]
or that it is an administrative lift for us to do it too and we need to be able to to say that and be real with that I mean as we were listening about the one school that is still on a corrective action plan and I kept thinking about the amount of resources and time and energy that our staff is paying to just have to get that followed through makes me worried as we're adding more and more charter schools because it does take away resource and time and energy may not be like real hard dollars but it's it's resource and its energy from the district so I so I am also concerned about that and then I just want to apply the the partners that were here tonight because it does put the public back in public schools when you have Partners like Comcast like Delta Dental where you know the message really needs to be that Albuquerque Public Schools

[03:47:00]
belong to this public and it's not just about us internally or the staff here internally that runs the school it's the parents also it's Delta Dental it's Comcast it's the businesses it's the agencies that need to be our partner so if they want our schools to be better they also need to be part of the process to help us make them better instead of sitting on the sidelines about complaining about them they need to be our partners so that we can make them better and just kudos to the fact that we have a young student who is going to be what an astrophysicist or whatever something to because Albuquerque yes something with black holes but and all those young students at Highland that you know received recognition for the complexity and the level of work that they were doing Albuquerque Public Schools are Great Schools

[03:48:00]
turning out great students and they're having a wonderful experience and also with our public education our teacher who also received that award I mean that's the part that we need to continue to talk about it's a great district and we shouldn't feel like we're not we're giving everybody a quality education that's all I had to say thank you very much I want to thank the parents who are here from Family Focus I'd like to know a little bit more about what that is about advocating for their school I think we need to take a look really at the neighborhood I think the family is there need to take a look at the at the at the school in figure out why the you know I have some of the students left the area or is it

[03:49:00]
the community has become gentrified has something changed in the community and not necessarily with the charter schools but I agree with much of what you have said and the moratorium is an interesting conversation that we probably need to have the other thing I want to thank you superintendent reading for your report is a vibrant report and I'm sorry I missed some of the activities on the west side but thank you for being there as always for all of us in our community thank you so very much and thank you dot thank you I always appreciate people coming for public

[03:50:00]
Seattle public service because it's something that's on my mind a lot and when we talk about what our communities need and why public schools are so critical it's really you know inspiring kids to support our community that's what it's about it's not being a good employee for someone is being how do we grow members of our community and seeing that investment in the community is something of value and it's something that we have lost and gotten away from and I don't think that we can talk about it too much to say what is it that we're building it's not I mean sure being a good employee or having the skills or whatever maybe a part of that but that's not what drives us

[03:51:00]
is human beings it's it's what's the value in the relationships that we have with our community and somehow we've gotten away from talking about public services something that's to be cherished and proud of rather than something that's just taking advantage of someone and it's gotten Twisted that way but when you look at all of the people who make the state run in the city run and our schools run we can be really proud of that so thank you for that little

[03:52:00]
I said was that at this point in the state there are the same about the same number of students in charter schools as there are in the Las Vegas Public School Las Cruces Public Schools however it costs 25% more for those students and the outcomes are absolutely no better or worse but what they have done is segregate our community even more so the schools and we saw this with a couple of the schools that we have updates on you know the schools the the charter schools that are going and wonderful you look at their demographics and they do not look at all like the demographics City and the question I asked the question with the

[03:53:00]
Charter that's at Mesa Del Sol and the response was yes some of the students come from that Community a lot of them come from the South Valley and those are students that would be in South Valley schools that would make South Valley schools look like the community and they they listen less look like the community and more segregated in the tool and this is something that I think is going to be coming up again in the legislature what's been what's been the story for how to make that happen and it goes back to school greats it's how do you convince someone that their neighborhood school that Bandelier Jefferson or Highland or 5:50

[03:54:00]
and it's a fabrication of the way the school grades have been implemented in Jews and there's been a lot of research I think it's on the something that I know that l e s c is talking about and I think it's something really critical for us to look at that is the one thing that's in statute that has to have a statutory resolution but we are mislabeling schools and and I think that that goes hand-in-hand with what the story about Charter Schools is is the disservice that's been done to the traditional Comprehensive High School some traditional neighborhood schools going I just wanted to this morning I was at Academy with

[03:55:00]
superintendent and you have to go out there the students are amazing just the way they they just praise the school and they're so proud of what they are doing with their own hands and they're planting they're getting donations to plant their own trees or digging trenches of the water can go where they need it to go and I mean they're just they're so proud they were just saying oh my gosh like 10 years from now that ash tree is going to be you know 25 feet high and I planted and it'll always be part of me and they were just so proud of their teachers they're happy to be at the school they did leave their neighborhood schools but they love they love where they're at it is fitting their needs and I think that is always very important to allow those choices for our children if you just spoke to spoke to those kids so well spoken and I think the superintendent which is agree they were just

[03:56:00]
happy and that's all we really want for our kids were whatever school they're at we want them to be happy and so when it comes to limiting choices at charter schools that is something that I will never never be for I think that is something that parents should have choices people who have the financial means to send their children to a private school have that financial means I think we need to figure out a way to provide transportation to some of those children who can't get to a charter school they might want to get to are able to and I think that's a way that we need to look at it but to ever limit a parent's choices because they don't have the financial resources I think is a terrible thing to do I'll use that word instead of a word I would prefer to use the other thing I was out I don't know about the Zia Family Focus Center

[03:57:00]
it seems like they don't have the funding somehow and that's maybe what's going on that they don't aren't getting the funding that they would have from the county that's how it sounded to me so that's something just to look at cuz it seems like the kids and parents thought it was wonderful so we just need to figure that one out and this past weekend I was out having coffee and dessert with my with my mom and there was a couple of parents in there with with their children and anytime I see I'm on my way in my district I always go and ask for the kids go to school and go you know talk to the kids and I was talking to the parents as well because I don't like to approach the kids without the parents and so talk to the kids and then the parents I let them know who I was and so they wanted me to pass some information on to the superintendent I did invite them to come and tell their story

[03:58:00]
themselves here at public forum but obviously they didn't come there was one of the one of the children that I spoke to was a middle schooler the other one was in elementary school and part of the problem they wanted to see if there was some way that they could have some kind of a policy that that would inform the problem that they're seeing at the elementary in the Middle School in my district and what they found is that their teachers are going off subject and they're going toward really political liberal Dogma in classes that have nothing to do with history it could be in their band classic it was in that had in their mouth closed and the kids they both they told me that they're afraid to say anything but it's going against with their parents

[03:59:00]
you are teaching or teaching them and so they were and this isn't just the staff at the two schools but it also went on to the some substitutes that the middle schooler told me was doing was doing the same thing so the kids were being told that their parents their parents were wrong that the president was I mean they were using not nice not very nice words that I don't think she should be used in speaking about a president that their family obviously was Voting obviously voted for and was supporting and did say that the kids know who we have supported and they know what we're teaching them and so they're having a really they are having a really hard time we have to remember that in our in our state we did have 50% of people that didn't vote for the candidate that

[04:00:00]
ended up winning in New Mexico and we are educating those children that come from conservative families as well and we need not to forget that there are things that should be taught and there are things that should be taught at school and there are things that should be taught at home and these children are petrified I mean she the middle schooler she was petrified to be able to stand up and to be able to say anything to her teacher because a teacher is in a higher position we all would be afraid to say that the parents are afraid because they don't want anybody to mistreat their child for having the values that they have so I just said I would pass that on to you to let you know that teacher shouldn't be doing that to our children that might think differently than they do it's totally and completely disgusting to do that to a little third grader and a little seventh grader okay

[04:01:00]
I'm always impressed with what this board has to say I'm always a little impatient and I apologize for being impatient because I do learn a lot from what I hear and so as I was sitting back and reflecting as I do as I try to do I appreciate it again the only thing I do want to bring up you know we have this committee the CCA the last time we had quite a few board members there and I think that kind of freaked our our people out so actually the way it's

[04:02:00]
it's supposed to work that the chair of the Capitol which is for remember our meal is supposed to go to the CCAC meeting if she cannot go there then one of the other board members can be delegated to go there so unless we have something very special probably should limit it to one more one more member that doesn't mean we can't go I'm not trying to say we can't but I think it kind of freaks them out when we outnumber them on on the committee so just a message and I heard that little bit from just want to make sure that we feel that that's okay and make sure that I'm not trying to dictate here anyway

[04:03:00]
