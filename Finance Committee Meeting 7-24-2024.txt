[00:13:00]
superintendent Blakey presumed to PD regulation 6.432 Department of Transportation division guidelines submission of all School Bus contracts for review and approval by local boards these three are our current contractors for FY 2425 and I stand for in questions perfect thank you so much members of the committee any questions just have a quick question and so it looks like we've gone down to three best companies based on the previous where there was four now there's three are these companies going to be able to service our transportation needs adequately or I'll stop there clearly right now

[00:14:00]
Transportation needs are done in the house two of the contractors Diane Sanchez and Albert Sanchez are actually one company so really we're down to Bill company is down to about four buses his intentions are probably this might be his final year too so we do have Albert Sanchez who does a lot of the or a portion of the blank the the special operations and so majority of all regularly at some point

[00:15:00]
as far as where we stand today we are currently down about 30 drivers which we are we do have 15 standby drivers and we do have about 20 staff that can drive so we will have those routes covered it's just about 2 weeks in and gets a little tighter because people start calling out sick and so it is a little bit nervous but we are not anywhere near what we were last year period

[00:16:00]
no thank you for that and and I think for that extra information it's good to know that the the the the the concern is being addressed and is being worked on hopefully aggressively cuz that's obviously one of the main issues that we hear is is transportation so so I appreciate knowing that it's for front in your all's mind and board member Jackson additionally when Mr when he's talking about the in-house drivers he has more control over what that means as far as real numbers of drivers and the compensation for them so when we have contractors you know they can tell us that they have a full staff but then they end up the first day of school they actually only have half a staff so these numbers that Mr Ben is talking about are real numbers that he has control over

[00:17:00]
because they are in-house bus drivers so they're much more accurate way of determining whether or not we have drivers for the first day of school because they are all in his shop know and thank you that's that's really good extra information Dr Blakey dot would probably be helpful for the hole boards and to just to be aware of simply because first day of school is coming and transportation is the issue and of course air conditioners so just having that information with us would be would be helpful so I appreciate the conversation thank you sure no thank you for your question board member Jackson any other questions related to this item okay thank you Mr Benz thank you so we will go ahead and continue to item 4.10 so our next items
