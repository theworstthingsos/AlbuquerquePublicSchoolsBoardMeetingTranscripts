play the cast of the 17th public voice has been limited by including presentations by APS staff in the in a time a lot of the public comment the Community Voices That do get airtime are not reflected in meeting minutes and perhaps the most egregiously this current board has never voted on the contract which has been dictating how it governs we've also seen the deleting of our family engagement political policy from the aps website bullying behavior on the board that a trickled down to APS staff repurposing Tapp Middle School without meaningful input from families of the neighborhood or email address is being taken off the ABS website and most recently vote on a contract taking off the table at the last minute when Community organizing resulted in not having the passive we call her vigilance and identifying complex interest on the board looking forward to the future contracts but hearing a strict procurement protocols and codes of ethics and partner with Community if and when a decision is made on the recipient of a new

[00:06:00]
soundtrack thank you thank you period and staff were not informed until months later this breach of trust threatens The Fragile relationship between families and the school district eroding confidence in the district's ability to protect our children this transparency issue trickles down to the schools from the aps Board of Education under the guidance of the Council of great City Schools the board's decision making process has become opaque and communication channels are deliberately throttled board members email addresses have even been removed from the public website and absurdly undemocratic barrier for Citizens trying to connect to their elected officials

[00:07:00]
you're also passed what is essentially a gag order effectively Muslim dissenting board members concerned about the district's Direction the elected board members now consistently pass the buck to the superintendent who does not answer to voters whose children fill our classrooms and the vote that parents anticipated regarding the Council of great City Schools contract is not on tonight's agenda nor has the contract been made publicly available it's time to let light shine in APS and repair their relationship with families by immediately ending the relationship with the Council of great City Schools

students education

[00:09:00]
good evening Board of Education superintendent Blakey over the past several months have followed the discussion about the contract of the Council of the great City schools and its outcome student outcomes Focus governance framework prior to the prayer several meetings you've indicated that the contract would be discussed and that didn't happen and then there was going to be a vote and apparently that's not going to happen either before this meeting I asked board members what was going to what was going on I was told that the board president had initiated in an internal email discussion about a draft of the contract the email board members my understanding was that there was to be a vote on the contract tonight but that's changed anyone who's paying attention to this board knows that the boats are regularly I don't pass on a 43 vote with the majority going in favor of what's For by the board president

[00:10:00]
I'm worried that the president got wind of how the votes lined up essentially I'm concerned that the change was due to an email discussion which would be a violation of the open meetings act it doesn't look good in any case and it smacks of vote counting I urge you to not make the same mistakes of the past I urge you to be transparent in your business with the public and to avoid this anti-democratic framework of the student outcomes Focus governance thank you very much next speaker is in the room Senator Linda Lopez representing the Southwest County I am just made at the lack of information about the sewage dump that happened in my community

[00:11:00]
this is reminiscent of an issue that happened in pajarito elementary school over 20 some years ago I've been elected representative senator of my district for over 28 years I've seen The Good The Bad and The you know what sometimes with regards to education and the school board as well as looking up at the school representation in Santa Fe in our public education department what I want to say tonight is I am just made at currently what is happening with the board as an elected official if I was told I could not respond to any inquiry about a boat that I've taken or anything that decision making representing my families that is taking away representation of what I'm elected to do I am elected just like you are listening to you please wrap up in a quick second

[00:12:00]
Miracle now

[00:13:00]
raise their children scores in math and reading for some of the worst in the country to some after slowly climbing up with some of the best they who had the worst state schools in the country are now in the top 15% of the nation in math and reading and grade some kindergarten in 12th grade it took 10 years and focus on teacher support and training to make the Mississippi miracle happened had nothing to do it had nothing to do with making school boards rather than the state supreme court focused on teachers on the curriculum the community and the parents and the support eventually of the state government they might have to stop here in New Mexico thank you thank you our next speaker is Josephine Chavez

[00:14:00]
owned by Erica Apodaca good evening and a Chavez made this decision without sharing data to back her decision yes her academic scores are low but other data sources indicates the effect in the effectiveness of the school is high such as the family engagement survey with a 99% response rate this decision will more than likely put the school into MRI status it will take for time for new administrators to learn processes build rapport with students staff community and build trust with the staff and community that did not want this change as a community school we were not giving a voice in the placement of administration best goes against which exclusively State the superintendent will not exclude student and Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations the superintendent will not implement

[00:15:00]
programs are procedures in schools without stop Voice our staff feels very unheard the process should be back by data and clear consensus of stakeholders 92% of our staff do not want our principal mood based on a petition signed by our staff which I have here today thank you for listening to my concern I look forward to you supporting La Mesa Elementary through upholding The Golden Girls created by the APS school board thank you Eric copper.com a decision made without explanation 92% of Staff signed a petition requesting a community and I have heard of family petition gathered hundreds of signatures get requests for dialogue with District leadership have gone on answered from what I understand even the principal surveys he elevation tool haven't been compiled yet by the

[00:16:00]
so we don't know what data was used she is not only highly respected by her school she's been recognized across the district just this spring La Mesa was congratulated for being one of the few schools in the district to show growth in all four areas of district court for let me say even surpass the district rules this didn't happen by accident it happens through strong consistent leadership she has received recognition from the mayor's office for her dedication and impact making significant contributions to her respective Community her leadership empowers the families Without Pity offering a hand up and not a hand out early I apologize we respectfully ask why are voice of those closest to the world are not being hurt and considered thank you okay our next speaker is called by Erica McDowell he has one minute what you begin speaking sir

[00:17:00]
good evening bored I'm Joe cardillo I'm a resident of APs District 4 I've noticed an increase in people encouraging book Banning and targeting our lgbtq community so I'd like to offer a couple of brief remarks the first is that it's crucial to understand that most of the people driving these efforts are motivated by personal gain they're seeking to boost their social media get clicks and Views to websites where they promote products get political power and some are even coached by Outsiders for example why an extreme conservative group from Las Cruces most don't even have kids in our schools their goal is to create division not to help our children second we know books help young people understand complex issues limiting access doesn't protect them it only limits their tools for dealing with life's challenges our Educators and our Librarians already follow age appropriate standards and there is a clear and straightforward policy for raising concerns about issues books were Lifeline for me growing up they helped me understand different experiences build a good life and contribute to my

[00:18:00]
continue the focus on creating inclusive open learning environments thank you thank you sir or next speaker is Erica McDowell you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening my name is Erica McDowell I'm a graduate of District 3 and the managing director of listen to New Mexico in the last few board meetings this small group of people has been raising concerns about books in our school libraries they've been cleared to say that they are not anti-lgbtq but I'm not buying this there is a document they've created that list the books they are concerned about with a section called quote explicit content summary for each book from any of the books this section lists quote alternate gender ideologies and quote alternate sexuality as quote explicit content this is the same language that is used to ostracize and discrim

[00:19:00]
play against the lgbtq plus Community broadly it shouldn't have to be said but our students identities are not explicit content I find it incredibly misleading for these folks to say that they are supportive of the lgbtq plus community and I urge everyone to consider what this group is true motivations are in raising these concerns about books instead of raising hysteria we should support the skilled highly trained caring Librarians who work hard every day to ensure all children see themselves reflected in the books they read and have opportunities to read about other perspectives thank you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Diana Martinez Diana are you there you can hear me I can you have one minute once you begin speaking but hold on your unmute sorry have technical difficulties I am Diana Martinez I am a third grade teacher Elementary

[00:20:00]
and I too am coming to speak on behalf of our principal Laura akbal but even more importantly and on behalf of our students I am under the impression that all of us here tonight are here for one reason one goal and that shared goal is or should be our students and that's where I'm coming across this evening is that if we all have the same goal we should be a team and I'm very disheartened to feel right now that I don't feel like I have been heard as a team member Miss Chavez did send her school and email to let us know about the change in leadership with no reasons why so I did I was shocked I did email her back asking if you questions I just thought about was such a great leader and we had met with the district so many times and they came in as a voice of support we had no idea they were going this direction however I

[00:21:00]
add several times to get ahold of Miss Chavez and did not get responded to her got responded to very vaguely so if we want to continue to help our students we need to be a team and not enough against you thank you our next speaker is on Zoom I believe it's Aaron Davis are you there yes yes I'm here can you hear me okay thank you I just wanted to speak tonight about the cgcs contract that is coming up for Renewal I just had a couple of points that I'd like to make the first one is that Dr Gabriella Blakey signed the 2425 cgcs contract which seems to directly conflict with the fact that she is supposed to be under the supervision of the board and yet the contract explicitly

[00:22:00]
what the board is supposed to say and do and their behavior also I understand that the cgcs contract that is currently up for Renewal was supposed to be on this month's agenda and then was pulled there has been no public comment about this particular contract and I just want to know why it was pulled and additionally if there was discussion behind the scenes among board members because that appears to be doing business public business in private thank you very much thank you okay our next speaker is in person and I believe it's been here

[00:23:00]
hello I'm Danby Hill I am a New Mexico state representative for district 15 in the North Valley and I Echo the comments of many of this evening and that there are serious concerns that continue contractual relationship with the council for great City Schools the values of GCS do not Echo the values of our communities instead of the district considers other contractors it is imperative that this process is transparent and available for public comment APS needs to follow up procurement requirements and keep the community informed so secret that many of us want GCS out of APs we need the school board and APS is the contractor that can work in alignment with the state to implement the changes mandated by the recent years willing you need experts who have proven record of reaching communities of color and at-risk students experts will commit to working with the State Legislative Education City committee the New Mexico public education department urban and rural tribes problems and tribes in trouble Nations reflect a contractor that supports the world as representatives of their districts and works to create an environment and respect and

[00:24:00]
retired military officer I wanted to publicly voice my support to this board for taking a position that is proven successful in both business and in military organizations and that is adopting a strategic plan and remaining focused on student outcomes I know leading large organizations is difficult and culture change is incredibly emotional and hard

[00:25:00]
what are those shows that it is working and I just want to thank you for your commitment and what you're doing for our students thank you thank you for next speaker is on Zoom Francesca Bueller hi my name is Francesca as well as Mom to 4 generations of APs graduates I would like to question the need to prepare a consulting firm to give our boards superintendent external support to meet goals of racing scores and standardized tests and life skills I questioned the value of reducing our children to metrics of scores and reading and math as well as efficacy self-management social engagement and perseverance how can these possibly be measured the

[00:26:00]
Journal support in focusing solely on test scores and life skills erases ignores minimizes and devalues the rich culture and history are students present to us every day how will the reparations do in the Aussie Martinez lawsuit be measured in test and life skills scores what is most disturbing hiring externals support focused on test scores distracts and prevents our schools from the work of supporting and uplifting our children families and teachers in learning the critical thinking skills essential and navigating our world today thank you thank you okay or next week is Kathleen Mosley good evening can you hear me yes man you have one minute my name is Cathy a parent of a past two students in district 7 I see tonight's

[00:27:00]
how about staff voice in support and I found a very old Council of great City Schools report 2014 that showed that we spend I think three times as much as Austin city schools on assessment and I have not been able to find an updated report on that but it underlines a concern of teacher friend has shared about assessment versus curriculum and wanted to hear more about that concern and find that an updated report if I could I have not been able to find one I have emails and I will be looking forward to that thank you our next speaker is Kyle period

[00:28:00]
can the mother and the grandmother of Albuquerque Public School graduate as board members you all have a tall job and you've chosen AC crab bills plan of how to affect student outcomes according to crab Bill the two parts of goal setting are learning the current level of student performance and what that desired level should be in 3 to 5 years and to quote crab Bill directly Discerning the communities vision for student outcomes is the school board's job and it should pursue that task wherever it leads only then can you set the goal of learning the current levels of student performance and what the desired level should be in 3 to 5 years based on this integrated model of Community Vision forgo your short-sighted concentration on the school board process to the exclusion of your

[00:29:00]
nothing requires you to abdicate your responsibilities to exercise oversight and address of merging Community concerns thank you thank you our next speaker is Kim Rodriguez give me a minute once you begin speaking good evening board members my name is Rodriguez and I'm speaking to you tonight in regards to the recent principal reassignments that are affecting over two dozen schools in our district aps's very own guard rail number five specific States the superintendent will not Implement programs or procedures in schools without stop voice over 20 principles throughout our district have been abruptly reassigned to different schools without any regard to staff input these changes have the potential to be detrimental to our schools and communities affecting School culture staff morale and stable and thriving learning environments I questioned the justification for such change and urge the board to reconsider these reassignment

[00:30:00]
for not only the sake of our communities but the disregard to the established EPS guardrails thank you thank you thank you Kim all right our next speaker is Ben Roberts but I can't get them to join so I'm going to go on to Lauren Michael John's Pizza schools and their coaches were called into these

[00:31:00]
item is conspicuously absent I understand that the contract with cgcs was up for Renewal and I see it nowhere in the agenda and said there's a discussion item about engaging external professional support I welcome the discussion I look forward to it external professional support should coach APS in the board to connect collaborate and build your engagement not paint parents who give public comments as against Improvement in student outcomes it really shows your true colors say whatever you like and we invite you to but it's your actions that matter our next speaker is Ben Roberts she's still alive is Ben Robertson I'm a

[00:32:00]
open APS student and I'm deeply concerned about ABS in the boards increasing Reliance on out-of-state Consultants including the cdcs and the misapplication of a corporate business model to our District's most pressing challenges the use of outside Consultants drains funding from our classrooms and our community every dollar spent on these contracts is a dollar not spent on teachers and students and does not make you use of our local expertise apses budget has doubled over the past decade while enrollment has declined but we're still told every year that APS needs more money this does not add up where is the money going the adoption of corporate management practices buzzwords like smart goals top down leadership customer service education shouldn't be treated as a scale business process and doing so risk losing side of our corporate purposes within education nurturing intellectual growth Equity critical thinking creativity and social responsibility in the next generation of New Mexico's I urge the board to reject external consultancy investing local expertise honor their professional Judgment of Educators take ownership of understanding and

[00:33:00]
bring your constituents rather than Outsourcing that responsibility step away from the corporate model and remember our schools exist to be partners in serving our children and communities not administrative Process Management and bottom lines thank you thank you thank you okay our next speaker is in person and I believe it's lesbian La vercher you have one minute once you begin speaking my name is Elizabeth

[00:34:00]

[00:38:00]
really completely tranquil when I leave on my daughter to the school because I am because that area is very dangerous and when something happens or any problem he immediately is taking actions to resolve and he has to he's just one year in the school and the school is getting better and better the most important because he speaks also our language Spanish and we are friends we can talk directly to any problems and be listening and that is a lot of confidence and we are very confident with him and like a piece of my mind and in this time that is the reason I'm here

[00:39:00]

[00:40:00]
really we need this type of principles in our area thank you very much for listening and God bless you to everybody thank you both thank you for helping us some boxes

[00:41:00]
got to work and the school has been making progress and the scores of showing it and he's got no more did some some acronyms for the work he's done and I just think it reassigning someone at one year after their position without a good reason is just not that mental to the rest of the school in the students that's it thank you sir our next speaker is on Zoom David Poole are you there now you hear me now so much my name is David cool and I wish to speak to the issue of the removal of principal of La Mesa Elementary schools to provide free after school Arts education for the students of Mesa Elementary School

[00:42:00]
throughout the programs 20 year history its success as measured by enrollment and satisfaction of the students and families has ebbed and flowed depending to a great extent on the support of the school administrators throughout her time at La Mesa Elementary has been nothing but fully supportive of our program she has taken the time to meet with us regularly to ensure full cooperation in the coordination of our efforts and our last meeting he'll just prior to the beginning of the spring 2025 semester new soccer of the value she places on offering wholesome creative and recreational after school options for students she put her money where her mouth is in this regard to give up two afternoons a week to coach soccer first students the school indeed the larger neighborhood would be much the poor without the energy vision and effectiveness of thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is in person it is

[00:43:00]
call Eric okay so I believe that completes public forum I would like to thank our public forum guests and we will move on to our next item which is to consider acceptance of progress monitoring reports for guardrail 5 for this agenda item are facilitator will be remembered home thank you and supports before we begin we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report has been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests otherwise

[00:44:00]
monitoring conversation as a reminder we have questions that are Technical and tactical in nature before tonight's meeting these questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions online to the board's goals and guardrails those questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measured focused oriented results driven in time bound so let's get started

[00:45:00]
no thank you go ahead thank you for so we'll go ahead and let you guys do your presentation if you go ahead OK Google go ahead and start at the end this Courtney

[00:46:00]
thank you so I have two questions okay the first one is in relation to interim guardrail 5.3 and the question is on page 5 in relation to strategy 3 the question is how and this is about how principles will have representation on the instructional so my question is how will principles work to ensure a broad representation on their ICS in order to make it effective and not just a check the box activity is there a particular strategy that the schools are going to use or that you have implemented from the district to make sure that it's truly representative and not just another check the boxes superintendent Dr Blakey yes I think it begins with looking with

[00:47:00]
the requirements of what makes up an instructional Council so using elementary schools for an example we want grade level representation so that we have grade level kindergarten through fifth grade representation we want to make sure that the cross content perhaps more importantly from a voice point of view do we have different voice on the instructional Council and that's something that we are very much lifting up looking at and ensuring that we are monitoring and encouraging and lifting up as practices to where it's not a single Voice or left to Grand Theft chance that we have a parent on the instructional and in high school for example not only pairing voice in addition to the teacher voice but student voice on the instructional Council so really monitoring this this is already I would remind the board delineated in the language that is

[00:48:00]
call agreed-upon in the collective bargaining negotiate agreement so we have these Collective commitments to one another now it's really implementing them and supporting our principles to ensure that they these seats are filled may ask a follow-up question so just the follow-up question on that is are you are we ensuring that there's not duplication that should refer to my check the box that if you're a teacher and also a parent that you get to checks are you insurance that it's one person per box remember Jackson superintendent Dr Blakey that would be the desired state that we achieve and really working to ensure that are parents have awareness of this is an opportunity for them to express their voice at the school in a very deep

[00:49:00]
meaningful way we wouldn't want to have a case where we have the same person feeling multiple roles because that would limit authentic voice specific to the different world groups thank you madam chair I have one more question unless you want me to wait until everybody else has had the opportunity yes we can go back through again yes is there anything else yes thank you thank you for the work that you've done on this report I have a question that's related specifically to interim gold 5.1 on high quality professional learning and stuff feedback on that I appreciate the answers in the pretextual and tactical work and acknowledging that this is Baseline data so this is the first time that we are measuring this is the first time we're collecting the data now that we know at this certain point in time where we stand we have a Baseline

[00:50:00]
I think that's important to acknowledge and I also what I'm curious about is you've proposed some strategies within your report I'm curious if you could just speak to what adult behaviors would need to change in order for the strategies to be effective well good evening Madam president members of the board and superintendent Dr Blakey it's always a pleasure to come before you and talk about the work that we're doing particularly around how we support one of our really great assets and that's our teachers in the classroom and so around what adult behaviors would have to change to align to our strategies I think number one is looking and part of what we're doing is looking at the district offices and the adult behaviors there so looking at how I think we have offered high quality professional learning opportunities but my fear and I think it's more than

[00:51:00]
like we don't have a clear sense of who has received what nor do we have a clear sense of the impact of that professional learning so to the point of adult behaviors changing us coming together as the district administrators to really look at those systems are really look at that assets that we have in the expertise in our departments across the district to bring those together cohesively to begin to really collaborate and create a more cohesive system of professional learning now from the school level that will also require some changes in adult Behavior to begin we really need to work with our leadership to find the time in the school day to work with our adults and so in terms of the organization you know making sure we can provide not only high-quality

[00:52:00]
birds and teaching and learning coaches but also the opportunity for them to work in our classrooms and with our teachers so I would say those are the primary adult behaviors that we would be looking to influence right away period I have a follow-up is that okay yes so you to the adult behaviors that need to change in the district office or the central office which I appreciate that because oftentimes accountability only happens at the bottom and not at the top and so if we're thinking about adult behaviors changing within central office what accountability is there going to be and maybe this is a question for Dr Lee but what accountability is there to ensure that these changes actually happen in order to better support our staff who are at the school level certainly in our departments I'm sure you know are structures usually and executive director and then

[00:53:00]
we often employee what we call a resource teacher below them and they are held accountable according to the the teacher evaluations that we do because they are teachers right and so to that and though as we're reconfiguring what this looks like we are already having conversations about the shift in roles and practices and how that will play and she's their daily work and daily experience as content and professional developers experts in our district the accountability is certainly from the supervisor making clear that expectation and then working consistently not just at a beginning of your middle of your end of your time but saying okay are we really achieving these goals are we really seeing these adult behaviors change secondly to that would be really looking

[00:54:00]
at the central office as resources that are needed by the school sites and so there's some accountability as far as Shifting the like it becoming like we're pushing something on you rather than they're pulling resources from central office which the accountability shows that a central office as you provide resources you have to adapt to make sure you're serving the customer of the teacher that they need that they're pulling the resources from you rather than you're pushing the resources on to them so I think the more we can shift that to central office becoming resources that are pulled upon rather than pushed upon you'll see the accountability on the deliverable that you're being mindful of what is needed in order to make change into the classroom and I appreciate that thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

[00:55:00]
a comprehensive and easily understandable report you guys always report so well thank you I appreciate that so my question my first question is about the overall survey so what I'll ask my question that I asked in the previous document and then I will ask the question to follow up what percentage of total APS teachers completed the fall survey in total 2547 teachers responded and this is roughly a 43 percent response rate that's great but as we all know that the larger sample size the more reliable the data and so I'm curious if there are strategies in place to implement by sorry to increase the response from say 433 percent to

[00:56:00]
and we have had experience with surveys and we have learned a lot about best practice in increasing response on teacher service on surveys in general and I'm pointing to a recent report on with Gulf War we have seen over the last several administrations that are returned on taking of the survey has gone up exponentially and there's a lot of lessons learned you are absolutely right that this ball in a few short months in October we will send this survey out again we recognized a few things number one we want to learn from what we've learned with go for and Implement some of those strategies to get a better return number two we also recognize that there may be some additional information we would like to collect and that would inform us and give us the tools we need to be in our strategy because we learned is we are we equipped ourselves with the responses needed

[00:57:00]
we could use some more information to look at demographic information for example level of teachers grade level departmental areas of specialty how can we look at this information to more better equip us to not only get a higher return on the survey but more strategy in response to raising our performance on the internet on the survey Administration I think that's really important to me in my role is to build the trust of the teachers as well to communicate the way of the survey I think more clearly that's it in

[00:58:00]
I think I could have done better and then what we'll do with that information and so as we begin to roll this out in the fall I want to make it really clear that you know the purpose is for us to get better at the district level in our support and advocacy for teachers that it's a tool for support and hopefully build a higher response rate through that thank you I know you all work really hard on these reports and lots of time and for me it's always specially on the heels of our public comment trying to square

[00:59:00]
what I'm hearing from your reports versus what I'm getting from the community and I can't help but follow up to to your response to board member benavidez and forgive me but it is a technical or a tactical question you mentioned you mentioned in your response very generally you know what we learned from this first iteration of the survey but I guess I'd like to hear more I'd like to hear you elaborate on that and then I've got my own question what did you learn specifically

[01:00:00]
100 Dr Blakey I think we learned a few things and the first thing if I may differentiate guardrail one 5.1 and 5.2 and then guard rail 3 because I think there's a distinction to draw their the first point to 5.3 is we have a structure that we can be proud of with the instructional councils and what we've learned there is that what we have a structure we need to make sure that there is equity around the district with that structure and that we are fostering and harnessing diverse voice at the teacher level at the level and at the student level within our structural councils the representation last year of the instructional council's provided a fairly high response and a favorable response in regards to the questions were they able to influence the instructor program and the

[01:01:00]
within the context of their instructional councils so that was done at a very high threshold therefore what we learned from there is there is a system that we can use capitalize upon and use as such a springboard if you will to continue some of these very robust conversations around some of the most important work we do in the district around instruction and resourcing that instruction so that's the first thing that I learned that reassured the second thing that I learned in regards to 5. 1 5 5

[01:02:00]
what does that look like how can we differentiate that throughout our system is something that I called that was a wonder that I had another thing is how do we evaluate robust professional development what does evaluating professional development look like what are the steps we need to use as adults going back to the change in adult Behavior to really look and say and be honest with ourselves that this was indeed a connection point between what the district is giving and support schools in support to teachers specifically through the professional development and are we connecting are we service seeing are we providing what our teachers need in a meaningful way what is the science word using the quantify that so I think there's some work around definitions and common language that could service well I think there's a national league some work that we could do in terms of increasing in deepening

[01:03:00]
demographic information that we get in terms of the return on the survey that could help inform our strategy moving forward so those are some general takeaways that I took from the responses I think that was a little bit of what I saw as far as the 5.3 and 5.2 particularly in what Dr Gonzalez talked about with how we can better describe or Define what adequate resources mean because it is eye-opening in the data to see the 89 percent of the survey responses did say that they found like the school had stay in their budget and in their instruction but there was a 44 person I can't remember off the top of my head or 41 percent that felt like they didn't have adequate resources

[01:04:00]
and I thought that that discrepancy between the budget that they do have say in their budget but they don't feel they have adequate resources gives us a little bit more questions to ask as far as what do adequate resources mean and if you feel like you have say in the budget because we would think do resources mean something connected to the budget but it could mean time as a resource so looking at how we Define resources to see what that disconnect is between the budget and the resources I think gives us a little bit to dig into for the next time so I just want to clarify the for the public that when we talked about percentages the 5.3 interim is in reference to the school site having say about school budget and that

[01:05:00]
88% but the target is for 2025 was 89% and for 5.2 The the focus was percentage of teaching staff who reported the district provides adequate School resources to support their teaching that came in at 39 percent with the annual Target being 41% for 2025 so we can so yes that's what we're trying to query here the high return on those surveys with regard to 5. 3

[01:06:00]
the general tone of tonight's public comment so and then 5.1 and I'm sorry for the public we were measuring percentage of teaching staff who report that the district provides high quality professional learning opportunities and we came in at 44 percent there with an annual Target of 46% by the 2025 point of clarification with 5.2 and 5.3 as well just a reminder that this guard rail is new these rooms are so this is all Baseline so we have it we're not on or off Target at this point this was just the Baseline so we don't have

[01:07:00]
based on these Baseline we made the targets for the new interims because these are all new correct correct but noting the high response rate for something that a question that addresses School site correct it's the same response rate it's the percent of the end of the question it's the same number of the positive response to the question is that correct or did they just choose not to answer 5.1 and 5.2 surveys it's the answer to the question correct yes yes yes so so I mean there's clearly a disconnect that we

[01:08:00]
I want to pursue my personal question which is this newly formed office of educational resources what is the evidence at least from the budget side of things that a new office is necessary how do we justify that and I'll have a follow up and I would like to know before Chief academic officer ones that it is a repurposing of an existing office

[01:09:00]
these are not new funds these are not it is it is a budget and useful repurposing and reorganization of an existing Department to meet the needs the evolving needs of our district so with that context I know that Chief can give more of a detailed answers to the scope of work for that office thank you Doctor Gonzalez board member Dominguez I appreciate that up because basically what we did when we formed the office of educational resources is we thought about what does what are educational resources and the existing office that transformed into the office of educational resources already was managing our instructional materials as well as our library services and are at Tech team as we looked at on the mini ass

[01:10:00]
is that we have in our resource teachers and the teams we have that do professional learning one thing that really stood out about the ad Tech team was their training and expertise in adult learning about all of our resource teachers have to bearing levels of that but a lot of our resource teachers were are primarily content Specialists and and specialist in teaching children whereas adult learning is different it is far more not that these things are important for students but the differentiation and the choice are really critical as well as the collaboration and the facilitation whereas I think we whether it be right or wrong we tend to be more top down with our students right adults can vote with their feet whether they're going to participate in our learning or not and so much work captive audience and so we really build on the expertise that we had their I'm grateful for the leadership in the department and executive director

[01:11:00]
Marie Harris you could see all of those connections and her senior director Aaron Jaramillo who is just really paying attention to how everything connects across the district and this is particularly important as we roll out the FTE that we're putting in schools to support including teaching and learning coaches our community school impact coordinators and our Student Success systems resource teachers we don't want to leave anything to chance when it comes to supporting these Rogues and truly impacting student outcomes in our schools okay so you're bringing under one umbrella I'm just making sure I understood Library services are instructional materials

[01:12:00]
management and then the edtech team previously addicted exactly what that was says a text they really specialize in using technology tools in the classroom which also give them a different level of expertise to really Drive adult learning in the district model talking about how we use AI ethically responsibly as a tool to support our instruction our teaching and learning so we don't have Tech team as much as we have adult learning experts with a tech expertise okay so then what's the evidence that you have that this reorganization is going to address our required commitment and our desired commitment to

[01:13:00]
improve outcomes for our Martinez Yazzie targeted populations plus African-Americans are you leaving that well right now we don't have any evidence that it is working until we are able to see it in action but we do have evidence that when you work in silos the teachers get different resources that are very scattered and not aligned and so by combining everything teachers aren't getting one Department saying oh here's a resource that can help you with this here's another resource and they're not getting aligned resources so what we do know is that if teachers they don't have the time to discern between different offices of oh wait you went to the wrong person for materials you were supposed to go to edtech and so going to library Services by putting it all together

[01:14:00]
we are able to align the resources and the time for teachers to be able to make sure we're not having duplication and mixed messages to teachers okay so then what's the rationale that includes a commitment to the Martinez specifically this year is based on the goals that are established by the board so the fact that the board has these goals that clearly Define Yazzie Martinez students and that were being held accountable for that I think every decision innately because of that period because it's not in anyone's best interest to make a decision

[01:15:00]
it isn't a line to the outcomes of the students that were accountable for so I think that inherently just why we're doing things differently in the first place is because the goals of the board and specifically calling out that we need to do better in serving our students that are in this group of students okay I guess I'm just not saying enough in the answers I'm not saying enough discussion about I'm not assuming that that that that our goals is are necessarily driving the decisions unless I'm seeing it in in the answers so hence the question and

[01:16:00]
okay I'll hold my next question okay I do have a question based on the October 24th survey and the next one coming in 2025 for the teachers and based on the communication from La Mesa and from Emerson and some of the reports that were coming in from let's talk with Marie Hughes schools and a couple of other schools that were talking about this shift with principles how will that be addressed in this incoming service and

[01:17:00]
no so the way that these interim guardrails are measured are specific to the instructional council is a profession that items that are in here we don't have like Personnel decisions as a measure of the guardrail so there wouldn't be a survey through measuring these interim guardrails that would include Personnel decisions it's not in the it's not in the measure of the interim guard rails with that all of fall because to me it's it's one of these things for sure you know when we're looking at keeping teachers and sustaining them and Longevity it's these ships that I'm wondering about that are really are they going to hurt us in the long run and as in and hopefully we're one

[01:18:00]
what will that look like in the future because the lack of of not only listening but the lack of really understanding that the strength of some of these principles were cheap and how these schools are functioning but I'm just concerned that these shift and changes will drastically shift some of the teachers and in their own teaching and then wanting to make the improvements so I'm just asking hopefully in the near future that I know you're stating that these shifts will not be affecting them but I think with the concerns of the community how are those going to be incorporated because

[01:19:00]
I think some of these responses ask at least we address them in some way so they interim guard rails are connected to the specific measures of the guard rails in this sense there are other data Beyond this this is very high level for the board so that you all don't have to go into the weeds of the day-to-day operations the district as a whole has other data lots of data that they use as far as the principal tools that they use the walkthroughs that they use there's a survey that teachers do take on principles that are used to separate in the park in the monitoring of the board so all of that happens kind of the the principal supervisor tools the principals meet with the principal supervisors meet with principals to ask about their own personal growth

[01:20:00]
Personnel issues those all happen kind of at a different level than this the at the end of the year the union does a survey of all principals all assistant principals all districts supervisors that we get that information to be able to scroll through so those are all like different data that certainly all of these impact each other but for the interim gargles it was what are the internals we're going to measure that have the most direct impact on saying whether or not we are meeting that guard rail because otherwise we would have probably a thousand different measures that were using with something as big as a guardrail so these are the three very specific but there are also indicators that will impact we also do a survey when a staff member leaves that they're able to give feedback on why they left the district or a position so we have all of that data

[01:21:00]
that's all addressed and the community involvement from the schools as well as them getting especially if it's not all of them but if it is a community school there's a different level of community involvement those are all in different areas some of that you'll see in different guard rails but those are all addressed in different areas just not in these rooms for girls so I want to go back to the definition of adequate resources as it relates

[01:22:00]
the answer that came to us from our precautions demonstrated or define adequate resources as being based on individual professional judgment and so we've kind of had a discussion about it but I want to see if there's anything else that you could elaborate on in particular how is the district going to ensure consistency in addressing resource concerns across schools and also how is it possible to fully meet the needs of adequacy if it's a moving Target and is essentially subjective thank you board member Jackson since we received these results and we've worked with them throughout the year what we've learned is that

[01:23:00]
what comes up when you ask somebody if you have adequate resources is as varied as the 6000 teachers who work in our district and what we've also found is that it's incredibly contextual so for example if we asked them during a training on a curriculum then what they provide to us is usually related to the curriculum and then needs they have their if we ask them on a day the wife I went down they might say I need reliable Wi-Fi to have adequate resources so from that what we've determined to answer your question about the consistency in addressing those resources is to number so as we are doing the things that we hope to impact teacher practice we are constantly having an evaluation and feedback loop and then that we are just aggravating and we are recognizing that this is a really contextual question I think to the point of

[01:24:00]
how we do that in a continuous feedback loop and also utilize our education Resources office we are then able to provide more just-in-time supports if you will there will be consistency in that messaging and and those supports across the department so instead of saying I picked up the phone and this is who I got like we have a more predictable response to what the issue is and we are going to be better to we are going to be able to better understand in the long term just what that response needs to look like so it's going to be able to impact our short term responses as well as a long-term responses that we plan for and the organization and how we build the expertise in the Departments so if I may follow up so just to kind of like encapsulate

[01:25:00]
it sounds as though the strategy is to Dr blakey's point is instead of silos of you get this you get that your systematizing the resource allocation so that there's more consistency the the schools and the staff are still receiving the resources that they need from a pool versus push aspect but you're starting at a more higher level to create a strategy assistant that those resources are available so that when they do want to pull them they're there does that was a good summary and I'll probably go back to watch the video to draw on what you just said Thank you thank you thank you

[01:26:00]
but I do want to ask it just to get a definitive answer so I asked where the responses disaggregated by school role of years of experience and you did respond that know this information was not collected but it's an obvious next step and so by what date do you anticipate starting to collect this information and hopefully by school or years of experience and do you have a strategy around doing that President we have already taken steps to ensure that more sophisticated and diverse demographic data so that we are able to add I think that was a very important lesson learned board member Vedas and charms

[01:27:00]
for example how many years experience is this this is teacher bring to their response does demographics matter and so we're even thinking about you know to the survey yes but also in our other feedback loops how do we collect that information what is the most important information to Black without having a teacher go through a whole you know demographics survey but it it does help us tailor that response that we want to build and build consistently period thank you thank you so much so I'll ask this question for every one of your the interim addressing high quality professional learning opportunities 5.2

[01:28:00]
is the district provides School resources to support their teaching and then finally the School site people staff the percentage of school instructional council members actually it's much more specific who report that they make decisions looking at the data whatever evidence supports that your annual targets under each interim Willie impact learning because that's ultimately what it's about especially learning for our most vulnerable students so I can repeat it looking at the data graphs what evidence supports or what rationale do you have

[01:29:00]
impact learning especially for our most vulnerable students I feel like that's a question I asked myself every day and my role in his thought about this guard real and specifically as I thought about how to impact guardrail 5.1 and 5.2 we know from a variety of research sources whether they be business or education that adult learning is one of the strongest indicators of an organization's success and APS in New Mexico we are committed to serving Martinez population as well as our African

[01:30:00]
American population so it is I heard you earlier when you said you want to hear like more of the specifics and the answers but that is like an innate part of the role and the response because our organizational learning has to focus on that if we're truly going to impact student outcomes those are the student outcomes that we have been found basically guilty of not supporting and so we're going to change that and so it is in an inherent part of it and I do believe that the way we're approaching this was some really intentional adult learning strategies will indeed impact teaching and learning for our most vulnerable I guess it's a nice way of my I need to be more direct how will a 2% gold going from 44 percent of teaching

[01:31:00]
Apple report that the district provides high quality professional learning outcomes to a 2% hike by October how does that 2% what's the rationale behind a 2% hike because what are we talking about in terms of rod numbers but I am certain that Mr maybe not right now but we can get that to you I am I hear what you're saying and thank you for the clarification we did follow the same strategy for setting or annual targets as we did with all of the interim guard rails and so we call it a well I'm not going to get it right

[01:32:00]
thank you sleep sweetly we acknowledge that it's going to take a little bit of time to make the significant change and so the target set acknowledged that the change in adult behaviors won't happen overnight but I understand what you're saying I do believe that we can exceed that just through even if we increase our you've done some math I can tell even if we increase our response rate I think we'll be able to see and get a better sense of how these strategies do indeed impact student outcomes say that we've got 6,000 staff about right 2% is 120 steps times maybe 30 students or I mean I understand and I acknowledge so I mean it's 120 more responses

[01:33:00]
right yeah and I hear what you're saying about but I think that could be I think that same argument could be said about a lot of growth that we have in looking at data so I mean we have schools that have 0% Proficiency in reading or math or 250 minutes that's what we're talking about achievement and skills this is a matter of just responding to a survey this is a response of the survey not the right so there's there's a double part of this that yes we want to have and that is what will impact the data as well because we didn't manage that everybody had to fill out the data or the survey the response rate we feel is low if the response rate then next time in October we get higher response then we would have to say that that might come in lower because that's all of the people

[01:34:00]
that are taking it for the first time we're going to have a bigger end value for the next response so to say like okay we're going to grow 5% in the response of of a favorable response but we're also going to have more survey respondents wouldn't be a good day to set to look at because we would be basically basing it on a different and rate of what the first response was so because that's going to be so fluid in the amount of responses we get we do have to give a reasonable value of what we're looking at is if we're moving up because that rate of people responding very well will be different people that responded in this password I hear what you're saying

[01:35:00]
I think it's page 238 or or actually it's maybe it's in this Cascade Cascade and power or hand out where we talked about he talks about a growth Baseline and the investment Baseline right it just seems to me that the investment Baseline and I want to suggest I question whether we challenging the districts and I think in this one as well it's important to know that it takes time to change a large organization it's not going to happen in a year or two years like this is

[01:36:00]
change of practice and in mindset for people so it is a slow it is a slow growth for example the the office of resources is only going to be implemented in August of this year teachers are going to be responding to this survey in October so in 3 months it is most probable that they're not going to see the immediate results of feeling that resources are different in three months where you would see that over the course of time that's why we have the late as the growth over the course of time then teachers would feel like these resources we do feel like now that we've used them but to think that in 3 months to October there would be this giant leap and what teachers have seen I don't think would be fair to the team because it does take time for these things to do

[01:37:00]
start using the resources as well fair enough I'm just questioning the the Baseline and I have another follow-up how are your professional learning strategies and this is for 5.1 high quality professional learning how are your professional learning strategies responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of Martinez's students and families because I heard a lot about this unexpectedly and I didn't invite it but when I went out to celebrations at the end of the year on school campuses and spoke to teachers and families I got an earful which prompted this question can you repeat the question how are you professional learning

[01:38:00]
and on 5.1 that would be page you plan to actions 5 Pages 5 and 6 how are these learning strategies planned actions responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of the Martinez and Yazzie students and families and and I should have added an African Americans to the work that we're doing and certainly one commitment that I have several is differentiated and relevant professional development professional learning that is specific to Martinez and African-American students this is the core group which we really have to

[01:39:00]
learn as Educators how to support so you know the practices that would emphasize our cultural and linguistically responsive instruction and Equity really will take front seat if you will as we work with our teachers as we develop our resources as we curate our resources so that this is how we do it if you will how are we using existing Treasures for lack of a better word and I wouldn't want a better word we have Treasures in the district already who have developed and in the state frankly thank you for remembering goes I agree we have treasures and they reside both in the district departments and in the classrooms and so part of that is looking at how

[01:40:00]
for example our Language and Cultural Equity Department this is their area of expertise how do we being on their expertise is we're developing the content in the resources and really rethinking our approach to adult learning we're going to we're going to need that in the same way we're going to need the experts that we have in our special education department they really are the ones who know how to differentiate instruction and to accommodate students in the very best ways so bringing all of that together and show coherent Department of the educational resources allows us all to be beneficiaries of the expertise that the individual departments bring thank you thank you any other questions okay thank you everyone for your for your productive conversation and

[01:41:00]
I guess I'll leave I'll leave the discussion with that okay okay that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them so in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision

[01:42:00]
end of the gold is there a division to accept the monetary except the progress monitoring report for

[01:43:00]
item which is a presentation on restorative approaches thank you Chief academic officer jet I know Dr Gonzalez you will stay in the hot seat so we'll have a presentation on represent I'm sorry restorative approaches and the Strategic plan initiative aligned to gold for our presenters for this as I have our doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent of leadership and learning on your compost chief of equity and Dr Kenneth Salazar associate superintendent of school climate and supports I will acknowledge that we did see receive a comprehensive report and PowerPoint ahead of time which we've all had the opportunity to review and submit questions

[01:44:00]
on so we're not going to go Page by page on the PowerPoint but we'll go ahead and open it up to additional questions at discussion from the board so does anyone have additional discussions on the presentation related to restorative approaches and go for I'm sorry I have two questions but I'm going to start with potentially will get answered so I am looking at page 13 which is the overall update slide and the I'll start off by saying that the restorative practices I honestly think that this is something that schools have always done teachers have always done and it's just now it's just something that's branded right we've always wanted to make sure that our students are in a caring safe environment and

[01:45:00]
it's just a natural reflection but one thing that I routinely hear is that in the effort to focus on the culture building that we are we are working on which I think is important we have lost the will to administer meaningful consequences okay and on page 13 the sentence the sentence begins okay with okay when when they make bad decisions we want them to know that they are still loved and worthy but what seems to be missing is that there are consequences to your actions so can you expand on how you will marry restorative practices with meaningful consequences within the student handbook

[01:46:00]
good evening Madam president members of the board superintendent Blakey and honored and excited to talk to you about this amazing initiative that we have going on and board member Jackson you are correct this is something that has been in the district even prior to our covid pandemic but what we're looking at is really looking at restorative being more about building a cultural care there's a a mindset that restorative approaches is the after something happens what we are really looking at is what is the proactive and really looking at the need that our student data is telling us so to get to your question the the frame of coaches asks what do students need to learn from this rather than how do we punish this so I think that's the the the balance

[01:47:00]
and the language that we have to look at with the training about how do we look at the traditional approach of discipline which right now when we look at our student handbook there's a lot of the traditional approaches to really looking at building that culture of care to looking at what are proactive measures so that we can be a little bit more understanding of how what what what what what what are the relationships between our kiddos and our students either with himself or with teachers and adults so here so for example when we looked at the date of the data is very specific to certain questions so during our progress monitoring you get the overall self-regulation what I've given you is specific questions that are associated with this initiative so for example the ones that I want to just share is the 3338 of students that feel connected to an adults that is that's alarming that we are looking at it as a district

[01:48:00]
close at 67% of our kids do not feel connected to an adult on campus we know that it just takes one adult to change a life and so that's where it's like okay so what that is an area that we need to look into another one is the question can you stay calm while being bothered less than 50% of our kiddos said favorably said yes they could do that that also looks into what self-regulation aspects we can look at with supporting students and teachers put looking at that and then also looking at self-efficacy being able to do the have the confidence to do the work the hardest work that's about 40% of our students said that as well what we also were looking at is the open responses and there's three that I kind of want to share to kind of connect to the question that you asked about how are we making sure that there's adequate consequences

[01:49:00]
treat us like humans not problems help me without rushing me be fair to everyone not just certain kids so when we look at the question about being marrying the consequences we want to make sure that that we look at these opportunities as teachable moments and that they are Equitable across the board and that there is a connection with the adults that students are doing when they are exhibiting behavior and or getting to the fresh point of not being able to self-regulate himself so if I can encapsulate just so I make sure I understand it sounds like the bulk of the work that you're doing to build culture within the school is the proactive the proactive piece the culture of care

[01:50:00]
and taking a strategy to make sure that it's much more than 33% of our students who feel like they're connected to an adult right okay and so it it it it it it and I'm thinking in a pie chart write the pie chart of the work for for all of this is 80% of the work is the proactive side and that may be 20% is the the consequential side and so you what what you feel strongly is that if we can get the Proactiv part if we can create connections if we can let our kids know that how much you do matter to others at schools all of these all of these questions which as an aside the responses some of the direct responses that came in were a little shocking and heartbreaking right and so I think there's a good recognition that there is a culture of care that needs to be

[01:51:00]
so it it sounds like the way that you're marrying it is to put in the work beforehand so that the consequence side is lessened and I also add that the training that these early adopters have taken that is the bulk of the tier one approach is is but they do three consequences versus versus punishment and the approaches having restorative conversations of harm having a reintegration opportunities so when there is something that happens there's a learning so rather than just sending you home we are actually now being really proactive and involving multiple stakeholders so that it so when you come back or or when the student is back

[01:52:00]
play classroom there is a repair of harm so that is that 20% so there is still this opportunity so it's more of a it's it's rather than just a suspension you're out students really have to think about what they've done and we're training our staff to really support that that restorative Circle approach as well as the reintegration process I think I think it's great I mean it's adding a level of accountability right for actions which is exactly what consequences are meant to invite right and so if you're starting the accountability early essentially with these discussions and then if need be getting to to the other the other 20% so I have another question but I'll see if anybody does anyone else have other questions thank you so much thank you for this

[01:53:00]
I thoroughly enjoyed reading it I'm glad this is happening there's a lot of data provided and I do agree with board member dachshund that some of it is heartbreaking but what I don't agree with is that this has been going on in schools and that's just being branded I think that maybe piecemeal has been done by different teachers counselors administrators but I'm glad that it's being done in an intentional way now because obviously we all know what's needed so could you give us a hypothetical situation where say a student is caught bullying another student and we're past the allegations stage we know what's happened what would be the consequences before restorative approaches is implemented after thank you so one of the two approaches for that example they actually do some practical training with the with that 40 training part of it is having restorative

[01:54:00]
conversations and so they have trained individuals at the school that work with students individually and and the students families on an individual basis and the the main components for this to work is students have to be willing to participate and it is it is important to know that we cannot force a student to participate so they don't want to communicate and we don't force him and and and and so they do talk about what happens if that is the scenario but that is where we look at it as an individual and they talk about what is called the the rest of conference and so they prep the students the families and saying this is what happens when we're going to meet with the other individuals and their families they also have advocates for students so it's not just so that for both parties and they have a restor

[01:55:00]
conference and there is and that is what something that is that tier 3 tier 2223 approach so if if harm was done it's a learning opportunity and they they walk us through with an example that they that they share and so that would be one of the examples of that restorative conference where everyone's involved everyone has a say they set the Norms ahead of time so that way when they go in it's not a bashing or a complete it's really focused on what is moving forward now that's the process thank you so this hypothetical that you just presented how many schools are trained or have been trained have an established process such as the one that you just described

[01:56:00]
and and when did they happen the 8 early adopters was that this year they attended training in the early spring and late spring because it because it's a 4-day conference it's really difficult because the principals are involved in these as well and the administration so it's really hard to pull for 4 days straight so we did two days two days we are actually having another training in July which will be a 40 training for All District staff so we're going to have even more right now the 8 early adopters sent a team of five because we want this to be a team approach not an individual approach and we want this to be schoolwide not just in certain classrooms and so the team is there and learning with this situation and and their role is now part of this is to develop a plan of how we're going to roll this out majority

[01:57:00]
the focus for the plan is tier one really looking at Pier 1 building relationships students to student student staff staff to staff staff to community so that's the approach that they they take and then then they look at to see okay now who needs to be trained to lead some of these restorative conferences with those tier two and tier 3 that is what we are monitoring for next year for these early adopters and remind me the tier two or three are minor and major behaviors incidents I see and so we're starting with h and when you say when you're going to scale up what are we talking about because we've been down this road before we've tried rolling out of approaches and it was a mess so it wasn't that long ago so

[01:58:00]
so what we have now is we have a lot of team members a part of this process we have an actual task force in collaboration with our Albuquerque teacher Federation and a multiple departments are amazing chief of equity who is who is joining us on virtually has been a major partner into this work because a lot of the conversations that we had with our previous five the Asian Martinez student groups we want to make sure that we have those student voices as a part of this plan because even though this is a change in adult Behavior we really also want to encourage those student groups that you saw on the presentation and if Tanya complex wants to talk a little bit more about what we're doing with the BSU groups our Native American groups that Vision to inform these processes because it's even though we do have

[01:59:00]
as well as counseling special education multiple expertise that we have in the rooms and that that is that is a part of it I think another thing to add to a doctor is saying that makes it different is a couple of things but the major one being that it's part of the Strategic plan so it's not like a project in an isolated Department that is being done that doesn't

[02:00:00]
I have like the traction to a bigger picture so everything that we do in the district is connected to achieving the goals and so this is a major initiative in the Strategic plan which is why it's being presented tonight and that hasn't been done before to make it a part of how we're creating systems to be able to address the goals in a very comprehensive way so this being one of the main elements in the Strategic plan and US monitoring it Dr Salazar also presented this to our project management oversight committee which includes school principals so it is part of a bigger system rather than it just being an isolated hey who wants to do this the second thing is that in the past I believe the district tried to work on approaches at the end instead of the beginning and so it was seen as like oh instead of suspension do this

[02:01:00]
and that's the end part that's why Dr Salazar talking about this is the 20% how do you work on it at the beginning so that you see that if students are saying that they don't feel a sense of belonging in school we have to address that first otherwise it becomes the student who's walking out of class and getting written up and then getting suspended for not going to school which is just like a cycle right but if we're able to see it now like how do we how do we build these schools and address these issues that were seeing where kids are calling out for help essentially that they don't feel a sense of belonging and they don't feel connected to something before we get to where we used to try to address it at the end of the beginning so you say that you're looking for student voice I have also part of English language Learners who are also

[02:02:00]
part of the BSU who have some stories but they're activists and they're frustrated because they don't feel like they were ready to move and they're at a community school I would love to connect them and and give them hope that adults are just talking and if their solution is in line then then they need to be we need to restore it of conversation about how their solution they can be part of a different kind of solution so I look forward to reaching out to me so I can connect you to these brilliant and actually you were there and we won't name the school but yeah

[02:03:00]
did you text me that you were able to speak because according to what's really awesome is that what you discussed is we do also in working with Tanya's Workshop sorry just trying to see technical difficulties even in the night so we are also having a plan to reach out to student groups very specifically and we also are looking to partner with with someone to able to do that and that will address exactly what you're discussing so from a system standpoint it would be helpful and it's like Community communicating with the former board member who was a powerful advocate for the kids who were always in trouble and so

[02:04:00]
it'd be helpful to have a baseline understanding of where we stand with discipline referrals the different tiers the different behaviors and I I refer to them I resist using violent Behavior so that's what it is but to me it's more of a crisis communication and extreme crisis behavior that we've ignored over and over and over and over again so who gets punished who gets pushed out and that will Segway into your experience you know what are the demographics of the children in crisis yeah it'd be helpful to have that as a baseline so that we can see going forward now

[02:05:00]
this program that's intended to catch kids at the beginning to avoid these consequences whether or not we see a difference and thank you for your work experience today to go to the graduation at Gordon Burnell the MDC the Metropolitan Detention Center and they had at the 1508 and then tomorrow we'll have them went on to the next program tomorrow I really truly think that she should be one group that you should hear from because their responses in how they come they came to this day of graduating they had 13

[02:06:00]
graduates and then five high school graduates and there was one gentleman there that just cuz they all got to speak and state what brought them to this point one was the teachers that they had that were supporting them and that were there for them they even went into some of the the guards they were really grateful for and they also stated they like the small school setting they were getting the support they needed that they never had before in within the outside the community and public schools they also stated that teachers were teaching they didn't have technology they can't have phones they can't have any of those things they were grateful for that they were also grateful that everyone around there was supporting them and gave them a vision

[02:07:00]
that they could graduate and do this there was one gentleman who stood up and he said Thank You For Hope think cuz he said I've not seen it all my life but I had to see it being incarcerated by graduating today that there's hope many kids are looking for Hope and I hope as we do this restorative approach we really take those conversations got there and what can we do better to support them because I often think those voices are not heard and and as they were graduating today they were and they even got to see their families which is never done they got to even have lunch with them and they saw those families celebrating with them and it was just a unique experience for me

[02:08:00]
but I was also glad to see a young man who was Navajo and Hopi and we exchanged our Clans and we talked about community and he was just really grateful so don't forget those voices and remember because I'm pretty sure they could tell you a lot and why they are where they are and what supports they currently are getting that got them to graduate that's all I need to say thank you I think there were some additional follow-up questions so we'll go back through does anyone have additional questions mine was attacked tactical questions so I will send it in afterwards all right thank you any other questions for both the presentation the discussion but most importantly the work all right with that we will move on to our next agenda

[02:09:00]
which is a discussion of Professional Services agreement regarding governance training and support so I just want to acknowledge that based on feedback and questions from board members as well as the community we made the decision to issue a request for proposals for coaching to support the implementation of our students focused governance so in addition to improving confidence in contractor selection having an open and competitive process with clear evaluation criteria sets expectations ensures high quality RV responses and delivers fairness and transparency to the process this is the same process that the board has used in the past to select contractors for example the superintendent search for the form of the aps strategic plan so during this agenda item we are going to discuss the scope of work or specifically what is the unmatched need that we are trying to meet with these

[02:10:00]
we're going to discuss the values that should inform the process will discuss the timeline and finally evaluation criteria which I shared before again are standards that will guide the scoring of contractor proposals and remove any subjectivity from the process I'd like to acknowledge also that we are not going to speak or talk about specific current past or potential vendors this is an open and competitive process so we're not going to critique or praise any particular vendor during this conversation and certainly there have been some misconceptions about student outcomes Focus governance about coaching about the Council of great City schools and so I want to rewind a bit and start with some contacts and some definitions I'm going to begin by reading directly from our adopted governance manual which says in 2022 Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education shifted its governance structure to Prior

[02:11:00]
pause and focus on student outcomes the student outcomes focused governance framework developed and facilitated by leadership from the Council of the great City Schools centers APS Board of education's work on the communities vision and values in support of what students should know and be able to do so that is the definition that we have integrated by vote into our government's manual this work has continued since 2022 through various stages of implementation and in fact most recently just that our very last meeting at the May 2027 I'm sorry May 7th 2025 board meeting the board voted unanimously to approve the community engagement plan and also voted unanimously to approve the progress monitoring calendar as part of this board adopting the student outcomes focused framework and adopting our governance manual also approved by word vote we have adopted or begun to use several terms

[02:12:00]
so bear with me as I go through these definitions I'm going to start with effective governance all governance activities planning decision-making oversight and leadership are intentionally designed to improve educational results for students with a strong emphasis on transparency accountability and continuous Improvement next term Community engagement the intentional and ongoing collaboration between the school board and the broader public including students family's Educators and local stakeholders to shape educational goals and policies now in the contacts of sosg community engagement also ensures that board goals and values reflect Community aspirations for students it includes listening sessions surveys forums and Partnerships that Center Student Success and build trust affected Community engagement to align its work with public values and

[02:13:00]
needs particularly those of historically underserved populations the next term is progress monitoring the regular and systemic I'm sorry systematic review of student performance data to determine whether the district is making progress towards its board adoptive goals in the context of the framework that we've adopted sosg this also means that the board reviews specific metrics tied to student outcomes at scheduled intervals it means that monitoring is limited to a few clear goals and includes disaggregated data to track Equity this practice helps the Board stay focused on results adjust supports as needed and hold itself accountable for Student Success the next term is governance team which is the school board members and the superintendent working together to lead the district in the context of sfg the framework we have adopted the

[02:14:00]
team collaborates to set Vision adopt student outcome goals and monitor progress it functions with clear roles the board governs the superintendent manages a strong governance team models coherence professionalism and focuses time and energy on improving student outcomes rather than adult inputs or Politics the next term is board work which encompasses the responsibilities and actions of the school board that are directly aligned with setting and monitoring student outcomes goals reflecting the communities vision and values he responsibilities for board work are setting student outcome in the context of sogging student outcome goals clear measurable goals that Define the desired academic achievement for students establishing guardrails which are constrained to ensure that the superintendent's methods align with Community Values and do not violate established boundaries monitoring progress regularly reviewing data and reports as we just

[02:15:00]
goals and ensure accountability and finally Community engagement which is again engaging with stakeholders to gather input and maintain transparency regarding the district's Direction and performance according to student outcomes Focus governance by focusing the boards work on these areas the board ensures that its work remains centered on student outcomes rather than operational details so that brings us to superintendent work which is defined as the operational and managerial duties carried out by the superintendent to achieve the student outcome goals set by the board he responsibilities for superintendent work under the framework are implementing strategies developing and executing plans programs and initiatives aimed and meeting the boards student outcome goals managing operations including overseeing the daily functions of the school district including Staffing budgeting and curriculum development reporting progress providing the board with

[02:16:00]
your updates and data on the district's performance relative to the established goals and finally ensuring compliance which is operating within the guardrails set by the board in the community ensuring that all actions aligned with the Community Values and legal requirements so in essence the superintendent's role is to translate the board's Vision into actionable plans and to manage the district's resources effectively to achieve desired student outcomes so these are the terms and the concepts that we have adopted as part of our government's manual as part of our governance framework and as part of the student outcomes focused model as additional contacts the aps board also has a budget for professional development which includes roughly 30000 29,160 for professional development this fiscal year and in previous the last three or four two or three since we've adopted USG this budget has been divided

[02:17:00]
Play Between the seven board members at 4000 per member totaling 28,000 with the remaining 1600 being available for board services staff for professional development we also used public meeting time to discuss our individual professional development plans for board members during the December 4th meeting this was agenda item 7.1 and that meeting each member had the opportunity to reflect on their individual growth goals on state requirements for board member professional development on shared coaching and Training Services and how best to utilize our professional development funds to meet those needs if there are other learning needs besides student outcomes focused implementation we do have that budget to address those learning needs again that was in December of 2024 that we addressed and discussed each of our own individual professional development needs to keep backing up prior to that throughout September and October of 2024

[02:18:00]
from Individual interviews with each board member these interviews were conducted with all board members and led to a proposal for how are coaching team could support the needs that were identified during that process this summary along with the implementation timeline was presented to the board for discussion and approval in our November 20th 2024 meeting again it was unanimously approved by the board and want to acknowledge that this timeline for implementation of student outcomes Focus governance on November 20th was moved for acceptance by member Jackson and seconded by member Dominguez and again and unanimous approval to implement that students focused governance timeline to back up even further in June of 2024 we also voted to approve Community engagement goals for the board so the first goal focused on increasing student engagement at community events with updated and also emphasizing Beyond just regular

[02:19:00]
identified in APS schools 1 and 2 which we've discussed are those students and families identified in Martinez and Yazzie groups along with African-American students and the third goal that we set for ourselves requires each board member to participate in at least four Outreach events per year starting in 2024 and ending in 2026 so this effort to establish Community engagement goals was to be transparent to be clear and also to hold ourselves accountable to meeting these specific goals I want to acknowledge that no board had ever done this before and this was not happening before we dropped his student outcomes focused governance so now we are tracking progress against these goals how we are engaging these specific communities to get all of this implementation work there was feedback from a few board members during the interview process at the pace was just too much too fast so

[02:20:00]
November 20th it was also extended in time and modified to align with board priorities related to new priorities that surfaced in those interviews which included onboarding new members Community training on effective governance implementation of community engagement phases three and four so the contract was extended to account for this new scope of work that board members surfaced in those 101 conversations and the contract was also extended to avoid fees for non-completion of that scope of work at current contract that we were under is going to end on June 30th so recognizing again that we have work and goals is it relates to sfg implementation recognizing that there have been concerns about the pace there have been concerns about responsiveness we moved to extend that contract again into 2026 with a new implementation time

[02:21:00]
some members expressed concern that they don't want the contract approved without discussion so we again responded to that slowed down the work and offered one-on-one opportunities for members to provide feedback on the implementation plan as well as one-on-one conversations with myself and our attorneys to provide feedback on the contract we moved the agenda item to a discussion and a vote to ensure that there was discussion and vote publicly about that contract now again there are concerns and questions expressed that some at that point did not want governance support delivered by this one specific vendor so we accepted that feedback and open it up to competition all of it being transparent all of it being responsive to the feedback that we received so before we get into developing the scope of the work the last one I want to make is that participating and coaching support is not a requirement of our role as board members

[02:22:00]
you don't have to meet with the coaches you don't have to change your behavior you don't have to do anything but if a majority of the board has adopted a governance model has adopted aligned policies and members want coaching on that implementation model then we as individuals should support that common goal and need so that's how we got to where we are today we're going to dig into the scope of work for what we want as we Implement student outcomes focused government governance sorry so I'd like to ask each member and I'll go down the road to please think about what is the unmet need that you as an individual board member have when it comes to support on implementation of our governance model I also want to clarify that the contract is to Port is to support the governance team in implementing students so I'll be asking you Dr Blakey about needs as being part of the government's team so this is not to discuss additional

[02:23:00]
coaching that's not to discuss additional training needs it's not to discuss additional board professional development or skill development it is specifically to discuss coaching related to implementation of student outcomes focused governance before we get into the scope of work I want to level set on some constraints that we have in policy that are also going to inform our work so we already adopted goals and guardrails a governance manual August monitoring calendar Community engagement plan and goals for Community engagement board member guardrails and a superintendent evaluation process grounded in student outcomes focused governance so none of that stuff is going anywhere all of that has been adopted in policy and I want to assure the aps community that we are sticking with student outcomes Focus governor and sticking with the goals and sticking with all of those other components we have also adopted a board policy for a that expresses our government's commitment in our governance manual

[02:24:00]
so this allows us to focus on states that it allows us to focus on and evaluate the most important student outcome issues while delegating administrative and Management Authority to a superintendent so that is our government's commitment that we have adopted by board vote we've also adopted a policy for be on board accountability that states that the board will monitor its process and performance by regularly conducting formative self-evaluations along with an annual summative self-evaluation using a research-based self-evaluation and so again that's in policy that's not going anywhere policy for D6 we've also adopted which reads the board members will not provide constituent services that belong to the administration and will instead of those requests to the superintendent or board services in policy also policy for E5 that reads all newly elected or appointed board members will attend mandatory onboarding sessions

[02:25:00]
governance we have multiple policies that we have adopted for C2 and 4-H 4 and 4 F the indicate the board will track the amount of time in public meeting spent tracking student outcomes we have policy for C5 that indicates that will track board member use of Staff time dedicated to staff support I'm sorry dedicated to board support so those are some of the constraints that we have because of policies that we have already adopted that we are not going to change or violate a couple of other constraints that I want to acknowledge we have this discussion is that there is an election coming up and we may have up to four new board members so the three members who are not up for election or also in their first term so we also have board members who are still learning are effective governance model and probably not well positioned to train the new members when they come on board so we will have potentially

[02:26:00]
board members coming on board and we have a lot of policy constraints so that's the framework for our conversation I would like for us to as much as possible please focus on Solutions not just complaining or not the past so I shared all of that to give you ample opportunity to think about your unmet need and as it relates to sfg implementation so again and encouragement to please use I statements as you talk about your unmet need it is entirely okay to plus one on someone else's statement but making sure that we're using i-statements and we talk about what we need or what I need in order to more effectively service a board member implementing student outcomes focused governance so go ahead and just start at the end of the line and go through and I will keep track so we'll start with member home worried toe what is the need that you would like to meet as it comes to

[02:27:00]
first and foremost I know you don't want us to go into the history but I am one who did not use coaching and the reason for that is first and foremost I have found that many of the coaches did not know how to not only address Indian education issues and Native American issues I've found that those questions were never answered my second area of concern was that they didn't coach and there was a big problem with that with numerous numerous coaches that were brought forth the other third thing is that I never felt like I belonged with any of the coaching staff I thought in the beginning that I was told to put up with the work or get out there were her statements that were represented Within

[02:28:00]
not only AJ but also in some of the coaches the other issue is I find that we need to address our children of color and my biggest piece in all of this were the two communities that I supported that sosg was not willing to even address the needs again that's what the Native American students and our children with disabilities I found that those conversations didn't go anywhere so I fell as a board member I really didn't need to work with them didn't because they weren't providing me one and when we talked about the the onboarding which we never had the only thing I recall and one training was learning how to do tactical and strategic questions and then that was it

[02:29:00]
and I hope in the future that we have more culturally coaches and that the our communities vast and I didn't appreciate and yes whether we want to call it a corporate model we were all so lacking the ability and the the empathy to really humanize our students and and I hope as we do the RFP that we we really find someone who's going to address the needs of our particular students are communities and really and especially when we're looking at Martinez in Yazi I think those subgroups are vital the special education the e l l the economically disadvantaged and our Native American groups I have found working with USG

[02:30:00]
there was there was a means to try and address the Native American issues and we thought we were moving in that right direction when we did get a coach that was hearing the needs of our children with disabilities and also the Indian education rags and federal regs we thought that was going really well then all of a sudden she was pulled up and then we were there was nothing left for us to even work with or and that's something it was they come in and the council they would come in direct do what was needed then they would pull out and there was no resolve and we were left just I was left on my eye statements I was trying to figure out as a board member I wasn't getting the onboarding I wasn't getting my questions answered and I just found that and currently right now

[02:31:00]
they don't talk to me and maybe that's my choice for my reactions and how I reacted but there is nothing it's just there so that was my sole reason for not coaching but I have often felt that with somg and I hope that one as we move forward that we strongly address the communities right now and and like I said today going to the Detention Center was just like I'm trying to understand what we're really doing when I see students who needs were not being met when they were in public school and we're failing so we need coaches to understand how do we pull ourselves up to a place that we're meeting these children need of pushing them away and that's the other side of it

[02:32:00]
play some kids with disabilities just use as poster children that's all I'm going to say thank you thank you so I'm going to raise a point of order and it's when you say that based on feedback and questions from board members we have made the decision to issue a request for proposals for coaching the we have to reference either a majority vote on the board and this can only happen in public or it has to be by consensus a public discussion and so I find that this decision to do to remove the contract from the agenda to have this RFP

[02:33:00]
have violated our very own governance manual and it's difficult for me to ignore that so I'm reflective we had a contract and I also want to address all the list that you that you read off lots of things it's hard for me to focus on what you're saying because I I wish we had had your your terms and your recap because it's a word I'm not but

[02:34:00]
I did catch was that you reference that in early 2024 and throughout the year we made decisions that we we got to point out that who I was at the early part of a year ago January is not who I am now because I've had time to reflect on conversations we've had in this board events that have and thought Partners thank you to my thought Partners in District Six I've learned so much by doing a deep dive with you on contracts more than I ever thought I would want to know but important and all that is to say since you reference the elections you are not born a board member you walk into a

[02:35:00]
the job or anybody thinking of running and it's taken me this long I'm at 3 years and 6 months and I finally feel like I'm standing on Solid Ground I've learned so much and so I do want to clarify that this Clarity that I have now has changed my mind about that I do not interpret the extension of that time line to be directly to a contract with SOS or I don't want to use that so if you want to be clear it's the council we are all on board on we are all on board about our goals and our guard rails it is it has taken this District I've been in a relationship with this district for 38 years and it's taken that

[02:36:00]
how long to get these kiddos as our Focus I'm not giving that up what I'm referencing is a contract with a vendor who we did not have a discussion ever we'd never as we did with the first contract we never voted on that second contract and we don't know who set up Dr Blake as Acting Superintendent to sign that contract but it was a violation again of open meetings at a violation of our our government's manual and if we talk about violations a lot please understand that this is a new model we're going to trip but yeah we got to get up and learn from that

[02:37:00]
all that is to say I need to reflect and this is what I need to reflect on we had I was promised in early February you assured me that we were going to discuss the contract by April 16th that never happened it was I think it was reassigned to a May date didn't happen it was reassigned to today didn't happen and this is why it's important that we have the discussion in addition to improving confidence in contractor selection having an open and competitive process with clear evaluation criteria

[02:38:00]
wrong not necessarily just because we have an RFP process I think we can cook the numbers on that to cook the definitions but I think it's the right way to go provided that it isn't open an open invitation to many vendors yes I'm happy to offer some to invite but it must be open we might get surprised by what comes in but I want to go back to the fact that we need to reflect on the previous contract and process because process matters what did we get wrong in that process of working with the previous vendor what did we get right what challenges did we face and how were

[02:39:00]
in many respects and I will add yes it's a we not just you alone I take issue with a vendor who coaches me who tells me that tribal consultation has nothing to do with student outcomes that kind of vendor does not understand the Indian Education Act at the federal or the state level and that vendor was with us guiding us the entire year what did we get we need to evaluate the surface is we received from the previous vendor and through that process I think we're going to have a clearer understanding of what we need in the next vendor

[02:40:00]
without that conversation in public we do the public at the service and we do ourselves into service and so I have some once again publicly I'm asking that we put an evaluation a reflection of the previous vendor the Council of great City schools on the agenda so that we can figure out what we got right what we got wrong what were the challenges where are we at this point what are our needs are how much of this can we do because I do want to say even though it's brand new we've been working at this and I would disagree that I think my two colleagues here based on their one year experience have something to offer in on

[02:41:00]
I think that conversation is important before we move forward with an RFP I'm not saying we can't have a discussion and I'm happy to give you a list of what I need from the vendor next vendor but I don't want to lose sight of this reflection piece so may I please be assured and may we please come up with the date that we can have that conversation on the diet we can certainly have a conversation as to whether there's four agreement that that's a conversation we want to have so I've noted that here and we can go there you said you do have a list of your needs but you'd like to share so since that's the agenda item that we have posted in that we're discussing can you just share those I can come

[02:42:00]
we need an intentional framework and by intentional we need I need to reach out I need a thought partner on how I'm going to reach my Native American families in my district and across the city I need help reaching the black community and black organizations that are recognized by their black community as being Advocates I also need to feel comfortable reaching out to I mean I have a connection with organizations that work with children

[02:43:00]
young adults in foster care with the lgbtq plus community and are unhoused population which falls under Title 1 I think we could improve that and if I see hesitant it's because I have not gotten the disaggregated data that I need to be able to understand to work with the district on where are those Pockets those children and those families that need the most support to get our reading scores up our math scores up to improve that sense of belonging we need to

[02:44:00]
I feel a responsibility for mending the Rifts in the community it's not that I don't encounter push back and I appreciate the push back but I also I want to assure everyone here that I have always made the case for student outcomes and why we need to stick with it even when my community was saying damn it get rid of that thing it's it's hurting us it's anti-democratic

[02:45:00]
I was happy to explain why we were doing this work because I believe in it and I think I convinced those Community Voices who were ready to just jettison this whole thing so I need help with that and that's going to to borrow to borrow Mr Dr Salazar's language we have done harm and we have to own that home and I'm happy to walk with everyone who who wants to join me to to address it we're not going to go forward without it I want those outspoken parents those angry as all get out parents I want them on our side we can't afford to keep them on the other side

[02:46:00]
it's exhausting so let's see I would love to have a coach that has had been has gone through a training on the ethics for coaches there is such a council for ethics on coaching I need a professional Services agreement that addresses the board and the superintendent in any contract as the governance team as you pointed out and I need this an understanding that all our work is disgusting public by both entities coaches are not allowed to reach out to us

[02:47:00]
usually and have conversations about public business in private governance team will I need the governance team to be required to report or require a report from the organization that we contract with I need an itemized list of activities and costs associated with those activities and I've got this written down so I'm happy to give it to you who was involved what was the expense and the cost Bill to the district and that can serve as an evaluation piece I need this next contract to be more in line with standard practice itemizing and then evaluation based on that and any termination of

[02:48:00]
must read without cause we are not on the hook based on a timeline that gets extended that benefits the vendor that's just crazy we can end our contract with a vendor at any point without cause the contract must explicitly involve both the superintendent and the full board as owners of any project our timeline as written what's the board president in charge of the project that's crazy all of us need to have a consensus meeting whatever project or whatever purpose was supposed to accomplish and this is important because

[02:49:00]
to quote the thought partner a retired Sandia Labs executive who who dabbled in lots of contracts at least for the perception among parties and the public the agreement on any such contractual changes extensions Etc should be done in an open board meeting by the full board and superintendent and it's important again for perception it's important to be inconsistencies I need that asking board members to submit questions to one board member at regarding board business again we cannot have coaches who are promoting that and three concerns worth noting well I've already noted him first 202

[02:50:00]
also because the 202425 contract dictated the work of the governance Team all year without properly written and standard contract language and without full board public discussion and consent its legality in my mind stands in question and so I never want to be in this situation again and finally using our internal at a glance communication where you provide a report of your happening and that was at my request I think I wanted to know what meetings are bored president was attending and

[02:51:00]
that was sad but using at a glance to gather to discuss agenda items lends itself to Oma violations so we must find a way to post all board business on the aps site including at a glance if that's what occurs again and I'm asking that our webmaster create another button under the table board label that button at a glance and post reports there and frankly post reports of any kind happening on the policy committee and or anything that impacts our community and it's my effort I want to build transparency and trust that is

[02:52:00]
play utmost concern right now I don't want to get mired in this discussion because I want to get to the targeted populations the tribal communities you know traveling to Window Rock is fun but I have to go intentionally and it takes time and I'm happy to invest in that time but I can't do that and put out fires here thank you for listening thank you very much I want to acknowledge that the rules have been set but we're supposed to focus on the past and this discussion I also want to thank you for that fantastic history lesson you gave us I want to acknowledge that I might be the only board member who did not receive any of that information ahead of time but I

[02:53:00]
Dominguez and I don't think she did I would like to read very quickly what we were presented with about this discussion just so that there can be no question as to the difference in what president Gonzalez has just said to us and what we were presented with the Board of Education will discuss engaging external professional support to deepen its work within the student outcomes Focus government's model it implemented several years ago as part of this model the board adopted by adopted five year olds that reflect the communities vision for students along with guardrails that represent its values the board monitors each gold quarterly and each guard rail annually Guided by a progress monitoring calendar that was a earlier this year the support under consideration would provide coaching and other Professional Services to the governing team both the board and superintendent and as needed to District staff that's similar but very very short very very

[02:54:00]
and my immediate my immediate unmet need is not being provided the information I need ahead of time to be able to answer questions about what we need is a board when it comes to coaches I feel like what you provided was done to kind of paint the board in a negative light to to say you all have agreed to all of this now why aren't we moving forward on the same path and that may not be correct but that is how I feel about what's been stated and I don't like being caught off guard so as I stated my my immediate is not being provided all of the information about what the discussion item is to be able to answer each point and that wouldn't happen in court of law

[02:55:00]
so I hope that we can amend that fix that do you want to add any unmet needs you have as it relates to your ability to implement student outcomes Focus governance and what coaching you'd be interested in I would like more time to answer that question because I did not know that that was going to be posted to us honestly what off the top of my head though I can't say that I would like a quote that is not going to pick board members against each other that's going to Foster cohesion board member Dominguez talks about you know correcting the community and I think that that needs to start with the board the board members we cannot be productive as a board if we don't get along and if the questions that we ask ahead of time are being qualified and critique to buy coaches

[02:56:00]
who who and then we get that information and I know who asked which question I know who got a perfect score and who didn't and I don't think that that's very helpful and you know I don't know if my fellow members would disagree or agree with me on that but we need a coach who is has a team mentality because that's what we are great thank you member Jackson so just so I am so I was writing down as you were talking right now we are discussing then we will be discussing the values to inform the process then we will be discussing the standards or the process right that's because you were talking about okay so right now you're asking me for my money okay so

[02:57:00]
I unmet needs are I think we let's see I think one is an unmet need is a capacity building the ability to build capacity for s o f g understanding and I think that the way that we can wait that might be getting into that well I think one way that we can build capacity is we need coaches since we are already going to have a board self-evaluation we already have progress monitoring we already have goals and guardrails I would want a coach who can continue to help us build the capacity on our on the board self-evaluation the progress monitoring and things like that because I do think that there are differentiated learning model

[02:58:00]
and understanding of the somg framework and so we do need somebody who can continue to not only deepen the capacity but broaden the capacity so that is one I think we also need to work on communication particularly as it relates with the public I think that there is a mystification of sosg particularly for those who don't attend board meetings regularly and so I think we have definitely started that work I think we're in we're trying to move into phase 3 and phase four of community engagement but I think that we need somebody who can help support us as we continue to close those feedback loops we do

[02:59:00]
let's talk and we have our community engagement calendars we have our Outreach calendars but I think that we just it would be helpful especially as we're moving forward into the summer when according to our implementation timeline we have a community training that's coming up we have the state of the district that's coming up we have a lot of events and so it would be helpful to have a coach who can continue to support us as we continue on with those events that we are already have scheduled and then I think thirdly is how do we sustain the work we are doing you did point out that a lot of the stuff is already in policy this is stuff that is not going away hopefully but I think that

[03:00:00]
we need the ability to to sustain that work not only through so I'm looking at my notes for how we can continue to reaffirm the the guardrails the implementation timeline and a coach that can help us again and broaden the understanding so that when there is eventual board member turnover the focus of the board as an entity not the board as individuals can remain focused on our students and not on the adults so I think those are three thank you and Dr Blakey so I am the newest member of the governing team so I would say in that

[03:01:00]
since I'm being new to the governing team I need to be assured that we can continue focusing on the goals particularly the goals as outlined with the students that we are focused on I think it's really important to the work of the district that we are aligned and that we don't change course because I think we have a tendency to change course and cause confusion to people that are really dedicated to the work and I need to be able to know that we're focusing on the goals and the work that we have as we heard tonight have established a systems and structures to be able to meet the needs of these schools so

[03:02:00]
my unmet needs is to be able to make sure that we are continuing to align our work to the goals I do recognize that we have onboarding of new board members in the next few months and so I think there's an unmet need I have to make sure that new members to the governing team are able to work as a team and that the coaches are able to really work with us on what it means to govern as a team and not in seven different directions which causes a lot of confusion within the district thank you and I would add that needs are specifically related to community engagement training so we do have as a priority additional implemental Community engagement training specifically on effective governance we have Community engagement work where we're talking about the goals

[03:03:00]
I have is training on how to do the superintendent evaluation under student outcomes Focus governance so we did adopt this model we have tied the superintendent's contract to that we've never done that evaluations so I need training on how to do that evaluation and the last one I have is just phase three and four of community engagement so we've adopted a framework for what community engagement look like and would need some help in implementing those so we're going to move on now to value and so these are the things the principals that will undergird this process so as we were thinking about this selection of a vendor is we're thinking about implementation of students focused governance what are the values that are most important to each board member as we go through this work

[03:04:00]
go ahead and start with you again Chris Gonzalez I'm I'm disheartened that this is not a discussion we got questions that one I didn't know we were supposed to answer I'm just I'm feeling the same way Heather is if we were more prepared than we could have cited 1234 and give you copies and giving you what you wanted but I feel that right now the conversations are just framed to give you what you want and and after going when you proceeded to say what you need to say in the beginning yes she gave us a history but then you gave us conditions and how we need to speak and what we needed to to stay and now we're

[03:05:00]
our conversations are just offering a question and a value and we're sitting here going I'm sitting here figuring out I'm trying to understand the question but it's puzzling as I think that this is supposed to be a discussion but I feel like it's framed more than anything because you want an answer from us to formalize but I just feel it's not a discussion so I'm going to agree with Heather I would like more time to think about this yes so I would like more time because right now I just feel like there's a pressure to give answers but not thought about answers that could give us

[03:06:00]
a really good RFP due to house what we want I just feel right now that it's just framed and I don't feel comfortable in that position so I need more time thank you thank you timeline is I think actually the next thing on the conversation I'm sorry we have evaluation criteria and timeline so we can go to that remember Dominguez would you like to share values that are important to you as we begin this process so I'm going to reiterate what I said earlier I value reflection time I value conversation and then an opportunity to think on what we shared so

[03:07:00]
okay then I can type something up and and present it to you as long as we haven't so the other thing that requires not lettering our calendar with too much busy work so I value Clarity of purpose reflection time conversation with fellow board members I value transparency and I value the community is thought Partners I don't just want to train the community on they're not meant for training

[03:08:00]
I don't mind sharing the work that we're doing like we've been doing alright I think I mean at least I have in my community but I want to listen I want to listen and then make adjustments because continuous Improvement is about making adjustments just like we expect in the progress monitoring to go do a root cause analysis we need to be doing the same thing where are we getting it wrong we can't do that without listening so our community engagement needs a lot more intentionality a lot more listening to happen

[03:09:00]
look at people so much and we all need to connect with the African-American Community Native American Community children with disabilities Community the foster children or rather the children in foster care and that correction I had a child in foster care correct me that I am not a foster child I Am a Child in foster care so I'm sharing that moment with you so that you don't have to be embarrassed the way I was but it was a great lesson so again I but I need the desegregated data I need to know which which kiddos need our attention

[03:10:00]
because that's what I value I don't I don't know I don't know that I'm giving you the answer because this is on the Fly and I'm with the other two I will probably wake up tomorrow morning and have other things to say thank you remember benavidez thank you president Gonzalez I value deeply value the trust in the face that my constituents have placed in Me by electing me to this position and I feel like having this conversation this discussion right now feeling very unprepared is violating that trust and that face but they have placed in me I really don't want to go any further in this conversation and I will try to answer your questions but they're going to be answers like that moving forward thank you member Jackson so I think the

[03:11:00]
value that I've been thinking about over the course of the past few weeks as this discussion has laid out is the one thing that I really want to make sure that as we are receiving coaching on student outcomes focused governance is that it is a CO2 challenges us and not sure leads us I think that cheerleading or you know the term I keep hearing bandied about is gives us Grace personally I believe that that is a deflection tactic but stirs us away from the hard conversations with student needs back towards the adults personalities and the adults insecurities that we have so a value that I think is important in a coach is it is somebody who challenges us challenges our mindset and challenges us is bored

[03:12:00]
as an entity and as board members as individuals to do more to have more urgency and to keep our Focus where it needs to be which is on the students so that's that's a mean value I have for a coach the other value that I would look for is somebody who can ensure structure help us to ensure structure and stability for our goals and our guardrails specifically as they relate to the Strategic plan I think that's crucial Dr Blakey alluded to it but I think one thing that I have been hearing is that oh great so we're not going to do sfg anymore that you know it's like right on cue right on cue we've been doing something for

[03:13:00]
and we're going to we're going to change it we're going to throw it out with the baby with the bathwater so I want a coach who is going to again challenge us that when it gets hard when it gets uncomfortable when it gets difficult and that they say you know here are the taxes that you can use to continue forward and I think that probably goes to a value of accountability and also I said this before but a deepening of our family and Community engagement I think we have made huge strides okay Todd I think we've made huge strides since the implementation in 2022 I did a just for my own knowledge I went back and looked we have done at least 53 Community engagement events since

[03:14:00]
92 and that just includes that doesn't include Outreach events that we as individuals or working in Paris have done that wasn't that there were probably 53 in 10 years before that so I think we have definitely made strides towards our family and Community engagement but that is definitely a value is that we have to continue to engage our families in our communities so oh and I think the last value is just consistency thank you I think of you in this context would be working as a governance team as opposed to individuals and I think a value is a coach being able

[03:15:00]
go to coaches and not tell us what to do so like a coach that's able to understand context and lead you to I guess in coaching I think of how to win a game and I'm looking at Mr Chris house cuz he's my coach so I think of it as a coach of how you're going to win they don't tell you exactly what to do but they coach you along the way thank you and I would focus on changing adult behaviors continuous Improvement as we go and accountability and transparency and Equity so we were going to move to evaluation criteria I've heard some interesting timeline first

[03:16:00]
Dominguez posed asking for an evaluation of the previous vendor before we move forward so with that in mind do you want to have a conversation around the previous vendor now and what works and what didn't so that we capture all of that before we go into new evaluation criteria or do we want to talk about timeline and then go into evaluation criteria what would be most helpful in terms of the next area that we focus on I think we need more time to get well first of all it's that's not on the agenda right evaluating the previous I think we need to tread lightly cuz we have broken so I'm

[03:17:00]
I have plenty to say about the previous so I can pause you there you're asking for a conversation to be added as an agenda item to a future agenda to have a conversation around the previous vendor what works and what didn't correct and then maybe based on that get some clarity about what we're expecting from the next bender and how will evaluate them so we can know that that is a request and I'm willing to listen to others we were going to turn it to others is that a conversation is this a conversation that others want to have around what worked and didn't work with the previous vendor before we move anything forward on selecting a new vendor I agree I think we need to

[03:18:00]
take another time to do that so we can put our thoughts together and formalize them I think that right now on the spur of the moment and like everyone said we can say things but it may be different tomorrow I just think right now this requires a lot of time and and our own space to put our thoughts together I remember going to be does remember Jackson do you want to wait on that whether we should add to an upcoming agenda and evaluation of the previous vendor I think that would be prudent okay and remember Jackson I I think if we're already having a discussion about a potential request for proposal on vendors for coaching

[03:19:00]
think by default that conversation about evaluation criteria can be discussed now because I would imagine and I'm not putting I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth but my guess is is that what you want to just you want to evaluate the previous vendor I would think that the evaluation on the previous vendor could also play into evaluation criteria for this vendor so I am willing to have a discussion about the evaluation criteria that I would look for in a coach moving forward also understanding that and this is I think jumping to timeline but we we have a lot of things coming up in the implementation timeline that potentially we could use a we could use

[03:20:00]
coaching for and so if we continue to put this off we're putting us in a position that doesn't allow us to have the full benefit of help for our students so I'm so that's the way of saying I'm trying to have evaluation criteria discussion now thank you so I will just say that I think I'm of the same mind but defining evaluation criteria for the next vendor was to me most important so that we can be really clear on what we're looking for to implement student outcomes Focus governance hearing desire from three numbers to talk about the previous Thunder that is fine we can do that and so I'd ask for services to just please note in the minutes that we will add an agenda item

[03:21:00]
starting evaluation of the previous student outcomes focused governance coach Bender contractor to the next possible upcoming meeting I know we've already gone you've already gone through the workflow I think of the next June meeting so maybe we're looking at July but I'll defer to you and your time for when that gets added to the next possible meeting so we will have that discussion we will post it it'll be transparent and that will allow opportunity I think for everyone to come into that meeting with reflection of what worked and what didn't work does that sound adequate yes and okay clarification though and I'm glad you brought up the timeline so I think that needs to be Revisited

[03:22:00]
timeline that we you know had that was an agreement with the previous vendor under the guidance of the previous vendor and like I pointed out the amount of growth I've had in the last 2 or 3 weeks is I feel like I've lived a century but yeah I think we need to include that as part of the discussion because you're right that is in the is going to impact that workload okay so I as I said was hoping to have a discussion around an RFP process for Professional Services agreement so I want to keep us as much as possible or entirely on that agenda I do

[03:23:00]
to hear a request for adding to a future agenda a discussion of the current s o f g implementation timeline so as I noted in my conversation of everything that has happened previously that has been adopted so that was adopted by a vote in November 20th of 24th so its policy and so we would have to bring it back to a vote to change the implementation timeline and so I want to open that and see is that an agenda item that folks would like to add to an upcoming agendas question of changing our student outcomes focused governance implementation timeline so I would not say I mean changing I think revisiting and revising so that it aligns with some of the values that we heard here tonight heard a lot about Community engagement and changing that up period

[03:24:00]
okay so I said change your sangria visit and revise I can change my wording to revisit and revise the current sfg implementation timeline I do want to acknowledge that we what we have adopted carries through December 2027 however after a point it's just the same stuff of every single month has invested at least 50% of the boards monthly minutes into gold monitoring receive a monitoring Effectiveness score of 80% and conduct monthly check-ins with the governance team so those are looking at our implementation timeline or basically what we are doing from did you December 2025 forward that I just popped into my head and maybe it's not about what I need is I need to feel like I'm more I have more ownership of that implementation timeline that implementation

[03:25:00]
reflects my values okay let me add that to the need one second timer of changes to the implementation timeline and then we have a vote so if you can help me clarify when you say I need more ownership of the implementation timeline what that would look like so I can make sure that we're getting into upcoming agenda okay so I'm glad that this coming up I had no clue that what I was talking to them about the timeline that this was committing me to a contract with them tying me to a deliverable that

[03:26:00]
heat control which my contract expert retiree from Sandia Labs said that is not a standard practice in a contract the vendor doesn't control your work so so I don't want to have individual conversations I I need to hear from everybody because we need to behave like a team so yeah I want I want those conversations on the Dias okay so I am hearing that we you would like a conversation around us if she implementation timer are there other members who would like to add that also to an upcoming meeting agenda

[03:27:00]
the scope of work might change it may not be the same as that's listed in that timeline and we don't want to strap down a new new contract and they're doing something differently and then they don't apply for the work because they see the timeline and so I think that we have to look at yeah exactly when we get somebody in new it may change or they mean they do it in a different way so we got to keep it down to just do this type of work that the 7045

[03:28:00]
look like would be revisiting revised and potentially repeal the current sfg implementation timeline that's what gets put on to an agenda item I mean it's a discussion it's a discussion absolutely other members have any comments on that I do I just I just want to say the implementation timeline came before us in November we had the time to discuss if there was something on that implementation timeline that we didn't like that we needed to slow down that we aren't comfortable with we had the opportunity to have that discussion to revisit revise revamp I think of value if we can add go back is we need a coach who will

[03:29:00]
continue to push us on the personal responsibility that we need to take as individual board members giving service to the board as a whole president Gonzalez's revisit of the timeline that got us to this point was an acknowledgment that at every step of the way the full board has been engaged in this discussion and I mean I am just shocked that were at this point that we have the opportunity to continue coaching on one of the leading organizations in the

[03:30:00]
Jen who has demonstrated proven results to improve student outcomes that we are that we are questioning this as a tactic of something that we can use to improve this District I haven't slept for two stinking days because of the the headspace and the time in the energy there we go there's another need I am trying so hard to focus on effective governance and this has been so far out of control because of narrative because of misunderstanding because of hurt feelings I have researched I have

[03:31:00]
I have I have put in the work that is required to understand what student outcomes Focus governance is I use a coach when I have questions I don't use them all the time but I use the coach when I have questions when I need help but I do that and I don't blame anybody else when I fall short I take responsibility for that we've had votes we have a 7 to nothing vote on a timeline we have I don't know we have this has been in front of the board and I'm sorry if I am losing my cool I haven't slept in 2 days but I am ready the agenda item says that we are going to have a discussion

[03:32:00]
about the potential for an RFP for a new coaching contract I would like to continue to move forward with that discussion right now and if we need to have discussions about agenda items for later maybe that is something that individual board members can send in as as items but it is 8:38 at night I would like to continue this discussion because I believe we still have Geo bonds that we need to discuss we have there are other things that are important to our constituents as well I represent 90,000 roughly constituents you know what they want me to be focusing on they want to make sure that our kids can read they want to make sure that our kids can do math that's what they want me to do they want me to focus on that so can we move forward with this discussion about whether or not we're going to

[03:33:00]
list an RFP I've got some evaluation criteria that I'm interested in discussing and then if we need to are our grievances later let's do that thank you remember Jackson so I want to talk to member Benavides to this question around whether you think it's important to add an upcoming agenda item to revisit revised and potentially repeal the student outcomes focused governments Implement governance implementation timeline I think the conversation about the timeline is important because I don't believe contract was ever used when we discussed the timeline in the past and you all can correct me if I'm wrong that is alarming to me and it's another area where I feel like we're not getting the information we need if we can continue this conversation we can find ourselves making find ourselves making a decision that we might look back on in six months and say why did we do that I don't want that

[03:34:00]
I don't share her passion for ending the meeting early or ending the meeting soon getting through this conversation forcing it just so we can do that this is very important if we miss something in the past maybe none of us have the courage to say we didn't understand maybe we thought we understood and information was not being provided to us but I feel like this is very rushed and this is not productive and we will find ourselves back in this place and we are here to improve student outcomes and this is not doing that thank you so I do hear interest from three board members on adding a discussion item to a future agenda sauce for services to know that as well to add that for the next possible upcoming meeting the reason I am allowing this conversation to continue is because it relates to the timeline which

[03:35:00]
we will discuss next in the context of issuing an RFP to find a vendor to support effective student outcomes focused governance implementation so we would like to have an upcoming board meeting discussion on evaluation of the previous vendor who would also like to have an upcoming board meeting agenda item on sfg implementation timeline revisit revising and potentially repeal so we'll add those to an upcoming meeting agenda as we think about the timeline so I will share that I was hopeful that we could have a conversation around timeline in this meeting and advance that so we could move to selection of Avenger but I would like to open the conversation now to say what else would apply to the timeline is you're thinking about this so we'll schedule those two agenda items for the next possible meeting that would likely be July 16th so we'll be able to have that conversation on July 16th I have a

[03:36:00]
what needs to happen in terms of the time frame for issuing an RFP determining the evaluation criteria issuing the RFP reviewing contractors checking checking references and selecting a contractor and then getting into contract remember Domingos you have a question I really do not want to we're going to have a timeline so repealing is not I don't I think that's alarmists that's going to I can hear I mean I received an email today that from an organization you know sounding the alarm that the aps board was against student outcomes Focus governance it's not true so if we put in repeal it's going to alarm the community I was being responsive comment that we don't want to bring

[03:37:00]
send a new vendor who is responsible for implementing a timeline from a previous vendor it is our timeline and that's the conversation I'm trying to have do we want to revisit the timeline which we adopted in policy as a board 70 November 20th 2024 if so we can do that and we can repeal that calendar we can change dates we can remove dates we could revise it we can do all of that time when we did adopt it we thought so if you was here we didn't know that we were going to go into an hour but that's what I'm saying so there's there's things on on that we you mentioned that we adopted in our governance manual and all those things but I think many times we have to be open if we're going to ask somebody to come in and give him a contract to what deliverables they're going to get and what we expect yes

[03:38:00]
but I think yes but I think we're you know it's one of these things where we were sending things in motion and stating they are and we're going to stick to this we have you know I get it I get it but I'm also saying that Sophie we're not trying and it's the same thing we keep reiterating is we're not trying to get rid of it and we understand the need for goals for guardrails but sometimes it's misconstrued somewhere that because we want more time then we're trying to get rid of it and just says about the article that came out it's it's alarming that I don't know where they get this information that we there's a few of us who wanted to end but it's just standing to me that we can't really at least for a moment to figure out

[03:39:00]
why we are in the state we are and we disagree with what we disagree with that's what I'm trying to get us to yeah but we're going to pause we have as an agenda item on the July 8th on July 18th meeting to discuss the evaluation of the previous vendor I heard I'm sorry July 16th I heard interest in three board members to also add an agenda item to revisit Pandora State interest and potentially removing the timeline know nothing about if we're going to go back and just address some of the things it's not getting rid of it it's trying to to focus and like we said when we look at the time line it takes us it's our work that we have to do absolutely so we've added as a discussion item implementation revisit and revise afg implementation timeline

[03:40:00]
that can happen on July 16th you're asking for time so let's look at our calendars July 16th that we have a conversation around the evaluation of the previous vendor and the current that's a revisiting and revising the sfg current implementation timeline at what point after that might be ready to establish evaluation criteria for the vendor will be will we be ready to come into that meeting July 16th and propose evaluation criteria or standards that are going to guide the scoring of the contract or do we need more time so July 16th is over a month from now so we'll have that discussion on the evaluation of the previous Fender another way of framing it is in that same meeting on July 16th are we able to establish

[03:41:00]
which evaluation criteria in open meeting has been requested for that vendor or would you like to push that forward to a subsequent meeting in which case Dr Albright I would ask if you could take a look at the workflow and let us know if we're not deciding July 16th and then we want to get something on an agenda for the future meeting what meeting that would be the earliest possible so the question on the floor related to the timeline is if we're having a conversation on July 16th related to about evaluation of the previous vendor and the current sfg implementation timeline are we able to discuss evaluation criteria to create the RFP or are we doing that in a separate meeting what's the timeline how are we playing that out I can't speak for other board members but as long as I have all the information and I'm able to be prepared and answer the question to head of time then I am I will be fully prepared to have that conversation

[03:42:00]
creepy evaluation at that meeting okay members Jackson tell me to Dominguez likewise as long as I've got all the information and no new details of materialized during the meeting I agree as long as we're open and we have all documents before us and that that we can make the decisions we need to make yes I'll be ready I'm ready to have a discussion tonight because the discussion item was regarding an RFP for a potential new coaching contract so I did the research on what that potentially could look like so I am ready to have that discussion tonight but I am hearing that it's probably

[03:43:00]
will you going to be pushed which I would assume that means that the current contract that we are under with Council of great City Schools remains in effect and that we can continue to use their coaching Services until that point remains in effect until June 30th yes that's what you're saying and we have the right to terminate it before then if we want okay remains in effect until June 30th so we will come into that July 16th meeting and established criteria for selecting a vendor to support implementation of student outcomes focused governments once we have that criteria well I'll ask between now and that date if you can which I was going to discuss tonight have a email or shared names of potential vendors are contractors so that we can invite them to apply so can that also be done around July 16th we'll have potential name so we have a list

[03:44:00]
evaluation criteria typically we like to give vendors a couple of weeks to apply so if we are issuing the RFP let's say July 18th 2 weeks after that would be August 1st proposals due August 1st what else do you need to be able to go

[03:45:00]
is that an appropriate that would be how many weeks that's two weeks after the RFP has issued is that is the president for that that's pretty standard practice that's what we've done with prior contracts okay and and as long as it's an open invitation absolutely open required by law okay so we will ask for proposals to be due by August 1st typically it's a week of a scoring process which would take us to August 8th and then following that is review of references which is typically a couple of days would take us to around August 12th 13th building in some wiggle room

[03:46:00]
do you have our meeting schedule open so if we're now into August we're looking at an August let's say at the earliest possible we would be August 15th where we could potentially have a vendor in mind in terms of the workflow following August 15th what would be the next possible earliest board meeting agenda 17 September 17th okay so we would discuss and vote on that on September 16th numbers

[03:47:00]
I have time to contact references and then the next possible meeting that we could get it on would be September 16th for a vote what does it need to go to 17016 does it need to go to the finance committee before it goes to the full board

[03:48:00]
it does not go to I'm sorry that Mr Gonzales was trying to get you a microphone if I attempt to summarize Dr Blakey asked our Chief Financial Officer if the contract would need to go to our finance committee before it comes to full the full board approval in the September 16th meeting her answer was that it would need to be over $500,000 so for right now is it okay if we operate with the timeline of this would come forth on a September 16th

[03:49:00]
unless for some reason it needs to go to finance committee which is I'm sorry when is that finance committee it's September 17th of September 2nd sorry September 24th okay so it would go to the October meeting instead or if it went to find us then it would be fine at the October 1st that's not necessarily so we won't move forward with the plan it'll go forth for September 17th vote unless for some reason it needs to go to finance committee for approval in which case it would go to the September 24th finance committee meeting and come forward to the full board vote on October 1st thank you all right so in which case we would be able to get a vendor under contract if we approve them

[03:50:00]
on October on September 17th let's just assume that let's say end of September would be when we have a new vendor under contract okay so we have discussed the timeline we have put off the conversation evaluation criteria until July 16th also on July 16th asking the board members come with suggestions of potential contractors we will have time afterwards if you don't have those ready because they will need to it'll be posted publicly so it's available to anyone public that's what's required and we can make sure that those vendors get the contract I'm sorry get the RFP as well so with that in mind the agenda item was to discuss the Professional Services agreement regarding governance training and support we have had that discussion I don't believe that this was an action item

[03:51:00]
so we so we don't need to postpone an action to a future meeting all right before we close out this discussion item are there any final closing comments anything that you or anyone wants to not anyone any of the board members want to say with respect to this process to make sure that we are meeting your needs and accomplishing what we need to as it relates to student outcomes focused governments I just have one question I just wanted to know when the executive committee decided to make go into the RFP process see the community match it's the second Friday of every month that would be me 16th also I meet regularly with the superintendent to discuss board meeting agendas and what goes on which agenda and so we have our meetings on Wednesday

[03:52:00]
Dr Blakey and I as well as the board Services team met on May 28th to discuss the know maybe 21st sorry to discuss the agenda for this meeting any other additional questions or comments all right then with that when we move on to our next item which is to consider approval of the consent agenda so I do need a motion and a second for items 6.1 through 6:23 I move we approve the consent agenda for items 6.1 to 6.23 seconds
