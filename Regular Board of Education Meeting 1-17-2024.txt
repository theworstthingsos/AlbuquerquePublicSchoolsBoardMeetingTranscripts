[00:11:00]
yes I'm here can you hear me once again for Madam president school board members I love humans we are all so mysteriously and wonderfully made each with our own unique features our own height our own weight our own hair our own pair of beautiful array of colored eyes our own beautiful skin our own fingerprints our own blood type that's so unique that it could be different from even our own siblings we all started babies depending on a mother and father a unit perfectly suitable for fruitfulness and child bearing and nurture a young being into cognizance of course this young being will be absolutely dependent on their caretakers though they have their own individual uniqueness they are still down to the harsh conditions of Life To Survive which we are all bound to this is our Common Ground The Human Condition young ones must be fed they must be bathed they must be told what is good what is bad what could hurt them and what could not this is

[00:12:00]
roles of those Guardians to impart such knowledge not for the young dependent to feel for themselves what life is it is the role of a parent to guide their children into prosperity in a virtuous life to protect them diligently and maturely through their own experiences it is the parents that shape the minds of these young ones first without being dogmatic did you know that Biblical teaching show that the age of 31 is able to serve in the congregation at the age of 30 but here in America the age of consent for almost anything is 181 has now decided that 18 was too much time and life too much to forbid somebody from making a very drastic choice in their life so I turned to the parents HB one says that 18 years of life is too late for life experiences to forbid a child to make decisions that will pass the rest of their life so my parents in the building do you think 18 is old enough to make that decision how about 10 or 11:00

[00:13:00]
does HB one is not at the is at the very least not for bidding a 1011 year old to participate I on the other hand I just do not trust the mental stability of those teaching that a child has any capacity to make such an extreme decision based in reality with such little life experiences so it doesn't matter go ahead and wrap up and one quick settings please let's get rid of HB one and play responsibility back to the parents to teach such a drastic topic thank you thank you for president Gonzalez and board members that completes public forum thank you to all of our president is agenda item 5.1 discussion on board time use evaluation and our presenter is board member Courtney Johnson number

[00:14:00]
thank you I am going to share my screen so that we can have a better discussion so let me get to where I need to get to okay can everybody see the November 23rd yes can you guys okay I'll have that little bit better okay you're welcome okay so let me get to my nose so the reason that I am doing this presentation tonight is because we are going over the time use management for November and December which closest

[00:15:00]
the last of the the quarterly report going forward Secretary of Sturgis because she is the board secretary will own this this exercise but that doesn't mean that she does the exercise all by herself she's just the manager of it and it is incumbent upon all of the board members to at least take one month throughout the year to do this time management exercise so Secretary of storegga Will from this point forward be the one to to manage that and to make assignments or however she decides that she wants to to manage that but for now I will do this time you used to evaluation for November and December and to the point of the fact that every board member needs to own this I was the one who did it for November and board president

[00:16:00]
Gonzalez is the one who did the time use evaluation for December so just a couple things that I really wanted to highlight here and if one thing that I thought might be helpful for the board members is if you go to page 3 in your packet where it has the time use the evaluation form which is very similar to what is on the screen that might help as we go through this this discussion the first thing that I thought was important to highlight was just a reminder of why we're doing this and the ultimate reminder is that school systems exist only to improve student outcomes that is why we're here we're here to to improve the student outcomes this is why we adopted the goals in the guard rails so that we would definitively State what those student outcomes are and how we were going to

[00:17:00]
the what the goals in the guardrails are really what we are focusing on but the how we are going to focus on student outcomes is by aligning both are what we're saying is important to us aligning that with what we are doing and really what this time is evaluation tracking your point tracking instrument does it measures our time it's a measurement of are we actually doing what we say is important to us and when I met with secretary historica to kind of introduced this what I said was this is the accountability this is not only accountability to us as board members to each other about what how we are going to spend our time but it's accountability to our community that when we say that the goals in the guardrails are important that we are focusing on student out

[00:18:00]
we want to prove it to you by how we choose to use our time so what I want to turn to First is the November tracking and first thing that I wanted to highlight is along the bottom you can see all of the events that are being tracked so we have the engagement events we had two events in November November 13th and November 16th so those are being tracked we had the board meetings both on November 1st and November 15th we had a policy meeting on November 6th and we had our special board meeting that focused on charters on November 8th now I hope a question that comes up is well why isn't financed and why isn't audit on that spreadsheet why is that not being tracked great question the reason that it's not

[00:19:00]
committees are legally mandated we have to have those meetings so what that means is that those are not meetings that are created by the board they are a requirement so the only meetings that we track are the ones that the board collectively decides we're going to have this is why it's so important that when we think like how many meanings we want to have in a month those are created by us and so we need to be really cognizant of how we're using our time and are those meetings focused on student outcomes or are they focused on the will of what the adults in the room want so that was the first thing that I wanted to point out if you notice down the slide it says we have under the framework we have the vision and goals values and guardrails monitoring and accountability communication and collaboration and continuous Improvement

[00:20:00]
now they're all extremely important and they work within the student outcomes framework but what I'm about to really discuss is the fact that for the month of November we had 0% of our time was spent focusing on student outcomes zero and some might say but wait a minute on November 15th we had an 80 we had 81 minutes where we were just discussing gold number two well unfortunately I'm going to scroll down here all 141 minutes that we spent in the meeting on November 15th the entirety goes into the other column the reason being is that those 81 minutes that we spent discussing

[00:21:00]
two was deemed ineffective by our coach are great City Schools coach so a question that I had for our coach was but surely there were some good questions that we asked right like the whole thing couldn't have been ineffective and this is this is true like there were some good questions that were asked but the point is that the first point when we were asking questions we were not asking smart questions so we were not asking questions that were strategy focused measure focused ask oriented results focused or time bound some of those questions were approaching that and in fact our coach mentioned that former board member Peggy Muller Aragon was actually one of the only ones who was really getting

[00:22:00]
do the Strategic questions because if you remember she was really trying to focus in on why there was that Gap there was an there was a gap between the high performers and the English language Learners so she was really trying to ask her team why that Gap was there but the rest of the time was was kind of spent on questions that were offering advice questions that didn't really focus on the data in the report I will I will call myself out and say we started talking about Middle School cohorts Middle School Academy and I started talking about the Albuquerque Academy well Albuquerque Academy has nothing to do with with us so I won't believe the point except to say we as a board need to be very cognizant that when we are asking questions during progress monitoring we are asking smart questions

[00:23:00]
Technical and our technical questions or questions that need to be asked beforehand and then our strategic questions are the ones that need to be asked during the board meeting the other point that I would make is that in order for our we don't have to be perfect every time right 100% of our questions don't have to be perfect but according to student outcomes Focus governance framework if we are at 69% and below then the entirety of the meeting is deemed ineffective and unfortunately our November 15th we didn't have enough of a bump to to get us over that 70% so here's what I do want to show you that I think really matters is that's why I have this here if we had added in oops sorry not 9181 if we had added that in

[00:24:00]
57% of the time of that meeting would have counted towards student outcomes Focus governance and so do you guys see that cuz now I'm repeat that now I'm reconnecting here that I get kicked off cell phone so if you see on the screen see where I punched in 81 had our questions been strategic and smart then 81 of those minutes out of the total $141 of that meeting would have counted towards student outcomes focused discussions and 57 percent of that meeting would have counted which would have put us over the 50%

[00:25:00]
goal that we have as a board so unfortunately you didn't count so so that's that was the one thing one thing that I wanted to point out the other question that I have that I think would be really good for us to discuss as a board and I think Ashley you're listening so as we have this discussion if you want to pop in that would be great can you guys see the December meeting up there yes okay so first December we have right there 111 minutes if you guys recall that meeting was when we be a students came in and we're presenting to us about the goals about

[00:26:00]
how they were trying to to move towards the goals and and all of the wonderful things that they were doing do you think that that 111 minutes should count as two-way communication opportunity where board members listen for and discuss the vision and values of their students or do you think it's possible that it could go into goal setting where we are reviewing discussing and or selecting goals I'm using the Socratic method on you personally board member Jackson I don't think it goes into the two-way because it personally I don't believe it was a two-way conversation they were speaking at us letting us know what they were working on and how they were tying the goals but it wasn't a conversation that we were having back with them so

[00:27:00]
I'll be quite Frank I thought it should go in the two-way communication president Gonzalez thought it should go in the the goal setting so this is truly like let's have this discussion because I think it matters as a board how we how we want to frame that I I don't have a hill to die on I'm just curious like what are your thoughts personally I would believe it should be up with the goal setting under like cuz I think it fits better into the reviewing discussing approving monitoring reports only because the conversation wasn't a two-way combo like we didn't get to go back and forth with if we thought the cheese balls were ineffective reward you know or not or why they used it you know it was just them presenting to us

[00:28:00]
it was a great presentation cuz I felt like it finally we're finally getting feedback on how they were doing their best to align to our goals so that's why I guess I just I would like to put it under Vision in goals but okay we'll see what I mean you have to give me music

[00:29:00]
but it's a review of one and I'm not sure that and we got a review of middle school though it did not come from students and we got good feedback from from high schoolers but you know I'm I'm I'm I'm stumped our president Gonzalez yes thank you for pointing out that I didn't sleep review

[00:30:00]
stop the Ramirez comment on the two-way conversation because as I watched the video they're what there was Q&A and there was a pretty robust back and forth between the participants and so it did come across as a genuine discussion a two-way discussion of the goals so it was definitely reviewing And discussing but not selecting so as you can see here you can tell by the editing I did put it up in column 8 Notting the time and it was the presentation on goals but had a bit of a discussion with member Jackson on this and really look forward to hearing what other people have to say as well I do want to say that even if we don't get the credit I think it was a best practice and it's really important and helpful to hear from those closest to our education system and so really appreciate that we had that opportunity in December well I'm happy to be at the meeting so that was a good thing I agree I think it was

[00:31:00]
play I think the questions were age-appropriate because you were both conversing with the students at the time and they were responding but I think that it was also like I said age appropriate they were excited they were happy I was sitting by the young man in the back and listening to him and they were trying to figure out who was going to go first and at the same time the teacher was letting them know we worked on this presentation just remember how to speak how to get up there and they were all afraid but they did it and but I was really glad that you guys took the time to really acknowledge them and they were pretty proud of that when they came to sit back down so I think the conversation was too late okay okay I'll give up or board member Benavides do you guys have any comments and then I see that Ashley did pop on so any any

[00:32:00]
weather comments before Ashley Johnson it sounds like if there was a discussion then I was not there so I'm going off of what I'm hearing now then it can be classified as a discussion under that measurement but a review I don't know it just depends on what the definition of review is for this it was not a formal review where you reviewing it looking at it very in a very cursory way I guess so we're listening to them I mean Missouri weather

[00:33:00]
thinking back now to the conversation I feel a lot of it was like out of courtesy and like to engage maybe in the process but I don't think our questions were very intentional and strategic as in trying to I guess reach like a common destination of where we're trying to go with that I think it was more just out of courtesy and we were happy we loved hearing the students present but there was no intentionality behind it okay which would cause you to put it down into the communication and collaboration section right okay okay board members of do you have anything to add before we call Ashley on no just listening to the conversation and I kind of feel like I'm a green a lot with board members and Crystal

[00:34:00]
yeah as an engagement collaboration setting more than an intentional strategic planning or goal-setting but I do want to hear what our coach says so thank you and I'll just remind this was in no way that this was truly like we were stumped and wanted to have a conversation with the whole board so Ashley tell us the right answer so I want to start by saying I really am I am really enjoying this conversation the dialogue about where this would land and really the conversation about you know the questions that board member of Topia Romero is asked about you know did we actually

[00:35:00]
I have questions that were intentional did we were we being strategic with the way that our questions were asked which is when the board member Dominguez asked these are really great questions that are going to help this board improve its processes over time so I just want to look that up first and acknowledge like this is a really great conversation so I actually I did not watch I didn't see this board meeting I didn't see this presentation from the students that you're mentioning so I think one of the questions that I would have so I will first start by saying I don't think that it would it would qualify under goal setting because you were in the process of setting goals and you're really only ever going to apply minutes to goal setting when you were actually as a board engaging in the goal setting process so

[00:36:00]
because the conversation so you definitely were talking about goals or the students were talking about goals but as a board that wasn't really what what was on the agenda that wasn't the intention for that part of the board meeting as I understand it now whether or not it would fall under the category of community communication and collaboration as student family engagement it sounds like it probably would fall under that category and so you know the two-way communication you know the the process of the board members asking the student's questions I don't know what kinds of questions were asked but the fact that there was a two-way flow of information is helpful and really the sounds like the intention

[00:37:00]
of of this agenda item was to hear from students about how they're engaging with this work and it sounds like maybe they shared some feedback about the vision and values that they have in this work and the way that they have been engaging and their vision for how they will continue to engage with the goals and the guardrail so I I am inclined to apply it to that to that section even if the quality of the boards questions were not you know perfect I really think that any any time that you are engaging students or in the conversation about your goals and you're talking to them about what their vision and their values are definitely give credit where credit is due fantastic okay so the good news is we the good news is

[00:38:00]
that was sent an 11 minutes with two-way conversation the bad news is we didn't get 50% student outcomes goals but I think the the really good news about all of this is that it really does highlight the work that we are doing the intentionality that we need to have behind the questions that we ask the being very deliberate in the meetings that we decide to have and how we are spending our time so to not believe her spending time I will wrap up and say that we need to but I'll take that off but we need to do better on focusing on student outcomes as we're having discussions and the final thing that I want to point out is the only time that we get student outcomes minutes is if we are discussing

[00:39:00]
call monitoring not guardrail monitoring not superintendent evaluation not Community engagement the only time we get student outcomes minutes as if we are actively monitoring the goals and the reason being is that the goals are the only thing that focus on student outcomes the guardrails are adult behaviors Community engagement is adult behaviors so I will leave it at that unless there's anything else president Gonzalez that you think I need to touch on but that is our time evaluation for December and November and December Jackson I did want to touch briefly on how we use this since I'm wondering if you could just sort of connect to our board guard rails that we sent that we sent sorry and how we use this tool in terms of tracking if we're meeting

[00:40:00]
and just asked self evaluation process so the the self evaluation process occurs quarterly so that's why I mentioned that November and December where the end of the quarter we will start again in January and as it relates to the the board guard rails we've said it's it's that we have set a guardrail for ourselves that 50% of our time were we would like to have 50% of our time discussing student outcomes and so I will just highlight again that this is a tool for us to use for us to hold ourselves accountable to the guard rails that we have set for ourselves so that we again are very intentional about how we are spending our time because here's the main point what we are doing from the diets the board work that we are doing is what happens

[00:41:00]
in the classroom and if we are using our time intentionally focusing on student outcomes I'm sorry like I got my back to you if we are focusing our time on student outcomes then the administration is focusing on student outcomes the teachers the students so we have to we have to use this as the tool to make sure that we are doing that as well thank you can we get this these reports yes so I'm sorry I will I will share the reports with you so that you guys can see what we've done and then as actually I'll send them to board to secretary historica and then secretary historica will own it and then she can decide how she's going to to send all of this out thank you thank you I didn't want to also know that we do have

[00:42:00]
unpause available for additional coaching I know she's shared some coaching documents and has reached out to board members so if you haven't had a chance yet to chat with her about effective monitoring or other sfg related questions you can reach out to her directly and that would be a good opportunity to for any clarifying questions to be asked of either member Jackson or a member of the time keeping process but also gold monitoring in general so we're going to go ahead and move to our next item for on the agenda which is agenda item 5.2 consideration of acceptance of progress monitoring reports for guardrail 4 in rooms 4.1 4.2 and 4.3 focusing on family and Community engagement excuse me our first step is to confirm that the reports contain all of the required criteria and typically I'm just sort of walking through the steps in the process first with

[00:43:00]
does anyone have evidence that any element of the required criteria give me for high quality report is not present the recommendation is to review each of the interim reports together and then if anyone has items anyone has concerns about missing items in the report the recommendation is that you raise those concerns prior to the meeting so is this is our first monitoring session with our new board will allow for concerns or recommendations to be stated here within the meeting the required criteria for acceptance of this monitoring report is presence of the guardrail does it clearly show which specific hardware and interim guard rails are being monitored presence of the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods preferably on the line graph does it clearly show the current reporting period and does it clearly show the target reporting periods the next criteria is the

[00:44:00]
Artesia does it clearly show the superintendent's understanding a system performance relative to the guardrail and the next is the evidence and the plan does it clearly shows supporting documentation that evidences the superintendent's understanding of system performance if the school system is not on Target or the superintendent's understanding of system performance indicates that information is not on track does the monitoring report clearly describe systemic root causes strategic responses including rational and any native next steps if this is unclear then it suggested that we proceed to the presentation and expect this to be addressed addressed and providing an opportunity to hear about route costs so what I'm going to do is what I am going to do tonight is recommend that we do that we proceed to the presentation so we can hear the full presentation before we talked about accepting the report or not but I did want to run through

[00:45:00]
all of the steps of the monitoring process in which I think there's like eight or nine so step five is the presentation of the reports the aps Administration will use flies which you can see up right now or any other visuals that will make the information acceptable to the community these documents these presentations the size of data has been posted on the aps website as well and is publicly available so that will be presented by our presenters and upon concluding that presentation then return the floor to the board chair so in Step 6 will thank them for the presentation will note that tactical and Technical questions have typically already been submitted in advance and that we're going to move to strategic questions but we'll have a little bit of flexibility in this step for tonight step 7 is after those questions are completed the board and the superintendent will have a discussion where we will alternate asking and answering questions about the report until everyone has participated and it's complete stop

[00:46:00]
is having completed the monitoring conversation we choose whether to accept or not accept the report based on three questions one does reality match the values expressed by our community so does this match what we heard our community Express when we set these guardrails is their growth toward the values and three is there a strategy and sufficient to cause growth towards those values or guard rails and so if there is then go ahead and accept emotion to accept the monitoring report confident that the data is accurate and that the superintendent and District are performing so I'll go through steps six through eight again when we get to that part of this conversation but we're on step five which is the presentation on guardrail for and this is from superintendent Elder Dr uncle's and Dr Richard Bowman Chief Information and strategy

[00:47:00]
so we are here to talk about in interim Garden real 4.1 and 4.50 legal guardian student and Community engagement in school and District Operations 4.1 the number of times District leadership meets with an Advisory Group to provide information and get feedback on the implementation of the Strategic plan will increase in place and school year 2033 to 4 times by school year 2026 so this is a funny number and we really kind of battle

[00:48:00]
strategic plan and as you know we hosted literally hundreds of focus groups meetings so why is the number two will we decided that the way this actually means it's District leadership so for example you guys had a number of meetings that we were attended at so we might be able to count those who weren't sure we looked for a very formal meetings that included more than just one member of the district leadership to your the way you guys go and do your community meeting you have to have at least two members so for example during the development of the Strategic plan I had an advisory committee that was made up of numbers that you all right selected people we had those members we have teachers we had principals those meetings are here because I was the only District leadership number there so they were literally there was a lot

[00:49:00]
more when you look at that number I don't want people to think District leadership isn't meeting with community members but the reason it's at 2:00 is we identify two Summits that we did that were specific to the Strategic plan that we had more than one member of the leadership team present and that was was two that we could point to very clearly that were specific we do a lot of meetings a lot of feedback but we really look for ones that are specific to the Strategic plan to try to stay inside this room so when you look at what's going well we actually have several committees established to engage the community engagement in the Strategic plan there are examples like the Asian Martinez Equity Council the district school health advisory Council the Indian advisory the special education community school calendars the emerging stronger Community Summits and presentations have provided a model for the district's moving forward note that each School maintains required by

[00:50:00]
please cancel facilitate family and Community voice and those are in the title 1 School specifically I want to make that clear early steps have begun to align the goals guard rails and strategic priorities for example of family engagement core team has been established to begin conceptualizing this work early intentional steps have begun to Garner student voice around the goals guard rails and strategic priorities super sack and his example of an established model for dialogue with students for those new that's a superintendent stood advisory committee and then within the 63 designated Community Schools 44 have established community school calendars what is a number of committees and initiatives in place to engage the community in their voice they do not seem to be aligned with a specific intent or outcome in mind specific to the Strategic plan at this point not all family and Community engagement committees have had the opportunity to engage deeper and deeper with this strategic master plan

[00:51:00]
there has been incoherent district-wide approach to family and Community engagement that impacts School implementation there is no standard expectation of process for family and Community engagement in order of documenting when and who meets what we mean is that the centralized location the school's collect that data we collect that data but we don't have any Central Data Bank all that data together in one place departments are working in isolation is the incorporate the next steps the goals and guardrails and not all Community Schools have been fully established with stakeholders so that leads us to next steps which is an articulated approach for family and Community engagement which will be designed with measurable outcomes and collaboration with the chief academic officer and chief of schools and their respective teams assistance will be planned for the spring of the 2024 semester for the family and Community engagement committees to engage with the Strategic master plan the next

[00:52:00]
steps of the golden guard rails to ensure alignment clear expectations and proper execution of next steps and then they are an attempt to engage in a root cause analysis process to identify barriers needs and assets to improve diversity and frequency of community school council meetings and community school council development moving on to interim guardrail 4.2 the percentage of parents report their school staff consider their opinion when making decisions about their child will increase from 77% of May of 2385 in May of 2026 and you can see over the last three years of data that we have in 2021 about 76% of parents reported that school staff consider their opinion it was 78% in 2122 and then back to 77% and 22.23 so that's fairly consistent response what's going well resource teachers works with schools on understanding the data found in the quality of education and family engagement

[00:53:00]
dashboard there is a section that shows the data from the quality of education and family engagement survey survey broken down by district and individual School schools have been invited to send teams to stop to school training for engagement planning step Workshops the workshops build the capacity of staff to understand effective family engagement provide time for the teams to conduct a school family engagement self-assessment as well as to plan next steps and currently APS has 63 Community Schools that utilize the transformation guide to increase family and Community engagement at all levels what's not going well currently only Title 1 schools receive this targeted support around family and Community engagement schools without the Community Schools framework do not have a consistent expectation or system of support to engage families and communities and at this point there's not a clear dish strategy for how to use the data from the survey to inform

[00:54:00]
what are we going to do a district-wide development of guidance for schools on interventions and trainings they can do with their staff and response to the survey results regardless using the tools we have in place the quality of education and family engagement survey a district-wide strategy for all schools needs to be created for ongoing School sites specific family and Community engagement and can you continue to promote School participation in school training for engagement planning workshops finally interim card real 4.3 the percentage of families participating in the quality of education and family engagement survey will increase from 20% in 2023 to 60% in 2026 again you can see the last three years we 2021 is about 14% at bumped up to 24% to 2122 and then to 20% 222.23 we consistently sat around 20% over the years what's going

[00:55:00]
well APS is currently affected by engaging with some of our families at certain schools what is not going well APS is not effectively engaging with all of our families at all of our schools but some families are completing the surveys there is not always consistent follow up with ways to inform families of the results and to inform next steps for increased engagement and APS is not made clear how Community Partners can engage with the district and school sites in Waze to partner to increase authentic collaboration what we're going to do is establish a district-wide strategy on how to engage all families in the importance of completing the survey reporting out to families the results of the survey and collaborating with families and community on next steps to improve develop a clear simple and streamline process to be communicated to internal and external Partners in an effort to ensure increase collaboration so that is the

[00:56:00]
official form report at this time we stand open for questions thank you superintendent Elder for the presentation so I'd like to remind the board and the public that Technical and tactical questions have been submitted in advance of the meeting and responses to those questions are posted with the agenda materials for everyone to see so tonight's conversation is going to start with asking past focused strategic question to understand what was learned from the data and then we'll move to a few forward focused questions to understand how what we have the how what the district has learned will inform the future and so I'd like to begin by asking who has tonight's first question and turning it over to vice president's home to manage this process and so we're going to go person by person so when when vice president calls on you you'll ask one question you want to ask 12345

[00:57:00]
is that the board in the superintendent have a discussion so we'll be alternating asking and answering your questions until everyone has participated in discussion is complete so vice president Tom worried I'll turn it over to you to facilitate the question and answer portion of the meeting okay is there anyone who has a question would like to start I have a question vice president tell me to and president Gonzalez please shut me down if this is not a question that's on track but I just want to know on I believe it's 4.1 that we were talking about more strategic planning and goal setting or action that we can do after these surveys and after information comes from the Committees

[00:58:00]
how are we utilizing the community school coordinators effectively in that role to engage community and put whatever we learn into action or you know organizing and in that way if that hopefully that makes sense it does thank you board member astorga what I would say is this when you look specifically at 4.1 it is specific to District leadership and it is specific to the Strategic plan one of the things we recognized out of this data and we realized we need to improve is okay we're going to take feedback from the community on the Strategic plan that's not going to be that what this 4.1 specific is specific leadership to the people you see in front of you right we participate in multiple focus groups for participate in multiple advisory committees but we need to do is make sure a two things one that we attend these meetings in more than one person so we don't

[00:59:00]
that person's area of responsibility somebody else is going to have to go into we need some specific questions to the Strategic plan that we can also utilize those across the district we can give those to schools and they can utilize it with say their instructional councils and they can take feedback at the site level but 4.1 is specific to District leadership and what we would do so we have plenty of groups that we can take this type of feedback from but what we need is that the strategy of what are the specific questions whether it's three to five that we're going to ask consistently over time regarding each of the goals in the Strategic plan period

[01:00:00]
best equipped to do it one of the things we know is that when the district hosts a meeting very few people come they're just not drawn to the district but if the school level they can get better feedback and more consistent feedback there's just a reality that parents are involved with their local school and I don't care what school you're in parents want to be involved in their kids lives they want to feel welcome and that's something we need to figure out and so we know there's some schools that are doing a better job with surveying their parents and getting feedback than others and we know we need to help with best practices along those lines but as far as this Community Schools they're in the best shape because those coordinators are really getting connected in the community and have the ability to drive on a variety of voices but they need the question

[01:01:00]
so my question is kind of is looking at two of the charts so both chart 4.2 and 4.3 and how those two interact so what I noticed is that chart 4.3 says that only 20% of our parents are filling out this survey but chart 4.2 says 777% feel as though their their being listened to but if only 20% of our families are feeling these out what what does that tell us about the percentage of families that maybe are left out of the discussion

[01:02:00]
Michael Jackson I would say what it tells you is it 77% of the 20% Fielder being listened to what does it say about other people so we've been giving the quality of Education survey for a very long time write the issue with the survey quite frankly is that there is no what you might say skin in the game for people to respond it's not incentivized at the schools necessarily there's no set requirement really to there's a goal but there's no punitive measures taken if you don't get 40% for example now what we saw with the Panorama 50% so if we're going to make

[01:03:00]
then there are some things we need to do on our end and the schools need to do on their end to increase that participation rate and we would I don't want to get too much in the Weeds on that but there has to be incentives and there have to be reasons for the schools to make an effort on this this particular survey that for a long time quite frankly has been a compliance piece thank you for that the respondents even if it's only 20% could be representative of the entire population however 20% is absolutely not where we want to be and so you can see how the increase that we're looking for for this particular card real estate from 20 to 60 and that is across the whole grade levels from elementary

[01:04:00]
middle and high school so we are looking to have more parents complete the survey in the future and I think that would give us all a lot more confidence that we're not leaving anyone out so that actually breeds a second question for me which you probably will not be able to answer today you might be I don't know you're kind of a genius you mentioned that can't can this does this the percentage of elementary middle and high school parent families that are filling this out and when I think of like me personally when I was in elementary school I'm like let's do it all right and then as we get older we tried to pull back from what our like involvement in our kids because they don't want us around thank you for the question for members and board members Jackson

[01:05:00]
I have a really awesome team that does a whole lot of work every single day trying to help us all make these sorts of decisions and so you can have the data available that information is one of the pieces that's on our dashboard and you can look at it by school and by level and a couple other ways it's available it's just not in this report okay so this 20% is a conglomeration of everything okay board member Jackson and I may not be a genius but I'm going to go out on a limb here again compliance little different in elementary when I was a middle school principal I remember handing out these papers send home and then spend the next two days picking up those papers in the Middle School my experience would concur with that so I think it says it we're not forward focused yet so I'll leave it there with

[01:06:00]
document there is a question about the equity councils which asked a tactical question around I'm looking for it in the Q&A who was on the equity Council what progress have they made against their equity in action items and what advancements have they created for the board or for the administration so I just wanted to know that these are tactical and yet the answer that was provided was only the district Equity Council meets by weekly and so I just wanted to put forth a request if you could provide a full answer to this question I could be following an email format I don't think we need all of that now to spend our time on it but I just wanted to call up at that question was not completely answered and see if we can get

[01:07:00]
absolutely any other questions are going to have the opportunity to discuss what strategies do we have moving forward so I just I guess the point of clarification are we saying that we don't know who is being left out in that 2020

[01:08:00]
I don't think it's any shocked that we would say traditionally people that respond to those families that had the time to be more engaged at the school who are more connected to the school so it's going to be hiring income families it's going to be families that have resources we know that there are some schools that have you know their Title 1 schools or the community schools that are low so she can get good results but it takes that one person being out there really beating the bushes and you know like for example one of the examples we have is meeting the parents that pick up and drop off and handing them the survey and having them do it right there while they're waiting for their kid now that can happen anywhere right now in the car waiting for their child or walking up but I don't I don't have that data directly in front of me but I think we know who it is okay

[01:09:00]
it is an anonymous survey so we we don't know the names of the people who responded and but we do know by school and I would also say we know bicycle I have a question I know that during the pandemic did you take the survey through online did you and so if so are you also doing that presently with the current survey to have it online and to also maybe look at how that survey is also being implemented through phones and through a parent could easily access that information and instead of having to wait and submit a paper form

[01:10:00]
community room that happens you can do it on your phone I've got a point I can't do it anymore because I can't see it but that's just an age thing so but again be done on the phone and we were just trying to make it as easy as possible for families to to give the game they have to want to and I think the families that want to or families have something to say they're angry about something that something didn't work with the school so you get you know and then you've got the great mass in the middle don't really understand the purpose of their survey or feel

[01:11:00]
reason to do it they're satisfied with things things are fine things aren't that bad you know so they don't do it because everybody's busy and there is no skin like I said there's no there's no real incentive there's no computer to measure you know nothing kid doesn't bring it back well get that bring you back then turn it in we don't know we don't know who does it cuz it's that's a part of the problem is it's Anonymous we don't know who hasn't done it it's not like I can go up and say Hey you haven't done this because I don't know you haven't done this survey yet thank you for life coaching so if you want help with a question that you don't want to State your need for help out loud you could text her or you could also just say I'd like some coaching for this question in our coach will come on camera so if you do

[01:12:00]
have some thought something you're trying to put together and are not quite sure and don't want to get it wrong again this is all about continuous Improvement in learning and it's okay to get it wrong so if you want to ask for help you can do that otherwise we can move to the forward Focus strategy future Focus strategy questions okay anybody else any more discussions what future Focus strategy questions they have and then similarly just facilitating one question at a time and back and forth discussion with the administration so I'm curious what what have you learned what have your conversations look like and in terms of how

[01:13:00]
I'm going to proceed with some the topics that you've freed up and what is not going well okay there's not a clear District write strategy or this is under 4.2 and so next I mean I know at this point you're just brainstorming but I'm curious about what are those yeah actually I think we're past brainstorming at this point but I would just say I'll let chief of schools really answer this question but I would say a few things that we've learned and this is important to understand so we recognize that we're as family and Community engagement doesn't have an overarching District strategy there's a reason for that

[01:14:00]
because a lot of schools we talked about family and Community engagement it looks really different across the district and what families are asking for in one set of schools in one part of town looks very different than what the families are asking for in terms of Engagement and what they're looking to to be engaged to school but we recognize is is if we're going to focus on the Strategic plan specifically that we have to have some very specific questions regarding the Strategic plan that we need to get a wide range of voices to weigh in on so Dr Gonzalez was mentioned there are some schools that have ptas and then there are some schools that that meets talk about Services right those are two very different groups of people who are both engaged theoretically engagement so how do we get a school without a PTA how do we

[01:15:00]
get those families engaged in this conversation to answer these questions their asking across the city so that's a learning step for us it's something that we recognize like hey this is actually fairly because if we continue to say specific to the Strategic plan and we give people the tools and we say we'd like you to do this this could help you and your work in your school and we is District leaders are doing the same thing kind of like you guys say you need to set the tone for the board we need to set the tone of the district level we're asking those questions to improve our processes to get that very specific level of work done now I'll let you thank you so much thank you madam chair and board member Dominguez I think what we need to think about is every time we sit as a team and with our respective teams to monitor what this looks like in our

[01:16:00]
District we learn so much and we learn again we're going through what's working well what's not working well and juxtaposing that with our next steps so when we do that we realize we have gaps and then we start drilling down a little bit to the root cause of why do we have those gaps without trying to make assumptions that are common assumptions that oh these schools aren't getting a good turnout because you know their parents are working and they don't have access and well you know I'm just going to put it out there some people think the parents don't care and that is not true so we are looking at how to keep we keep saying it how do we keep the thing the thing we're looking at the Strategic plan we're looking at our goals and our strategic priorities so specifically with guardrail 4.1 and looking at you know how do we meet with with our constituents our families are students as a whole

[01:17:00]
fighting embracing reminding all of our groups to come together it's important that we keep the thing the thing so we as we look at strategy moving forward are looking at creating focus groups and each quarter as we as a board and District are going through these monitoring reports we then take that to the community and we show them here's the data this is what we're doing this is how we're doing it and ask them what do you think is working what do you think is still not working and what next steps do you have as far as recommendations so putting that very strategically into a I guess it would be our Cadence of accountability we do that for each quarter focusing specifically on our goals guardrails and our strategic priorities because right now it is here and there oh yes we do have these committees this

[01:18:00]
what is a focus group that's meeting but we're all doing it like superintendent Elder said a lot of the time in isolation depending on what department you're in and so we want to bring all of that together so that we can have really rich conversations around this work looking at 4.2% Elder stated this has been this started as a ped survey that we incorporated for all all of our schools and Incorporated some other components and so with that it's been a Compliance Document an option and what this data is telling us is that we are missing 80% of our families so without incentivizing with things how do we use the data and that's something I think we realized in this what are we doing with the data that we're collecting do we know what it's saying

[01:19:00]
how do we work with our school sites to communicate with their communities about what that means and make it important and do something about it not just post it not just present it but put strategies in place to address where are those gaps are our families feeling this way then how do we change that and maybe it is the community school coordinator coming in maybe it is the instructional Council working to bring an equity as a focus it could be many many things but it has created a very clear I think Focus for us as a team and how we are using the information to engage our families so that they can start trusting they're not just doing something for compliance and nothing is done with it so we're really excited about it thank you

[01:20:00]
present in front of us because I gained so much knowledge about what is actually happening in the district so thank you for that and through the 2 minutes of you just discussing I came up with two more questions so you mentioned that the quality engagement form is has been a Compliance Document so a question that kind of arises from that is you move forward I guess the question I have is if it has been a Compliance Document in the past is it still the most appropriate form to be using for the district to gather the knowledge that you're you're wanting to to grasp on guardrail for thank you madam chair and board member Jackson We it is the components of the survey are really important topics and so I think we don't want to negate what's currently

[01:21:00]
in the survey what we can do and what's a great idea I think for our team is to look and see how does this feed into our strategic plan and each of the priorities and goals maybe we need to add a few things that we want to collect a little bit more information on we don't want to make it overwhelming because we know in a survey if there's too many questions or if you start asking them to give a verbal response about something they're going to exit out so we have to be strategic about how many questions what does that look like and once we begin to communicate what we're doing with the results that's the district strategy that we need to create Dr Gonzalez tonight with our respective teams and also Dr Bowman to be able to do that so I think that the questions are valid and

[01:22:00]
we can take another look with a different lens to see if there's something we need to add or if something is not as meaningful and then my second question if it's if it's all right and if I didn't I didn't parliamentary myself I'm sorry I have a question about the 20% by your conversations and just addressing to you stating that within Community Schools that looks different and then parents in elementary looks different and then I was looking at the numbers with Community Schools which is that 44 or what is that number 63 and then some of the other events you were stating superintendent Elder that

[01:23:00]
it does look different how do you think based on this 20% rating and guardrail 4.1 can we within the conversations of these other items you mentioned or events you have mentioned that parents are involved if we found a way to contrived that information and bring it together would that increase that 20% based on the Outlook of the variance of parenting engagement that you mentioned that if we formalize or put that in a way to find out what's going on with that increase that 20% of President and board member answered the question for me I'm sorry well I'm just I'm just asking yes yes yes the thing we've been given the survey a long long time we've never

[01:24:00]
so we did it because it had to be done right and there have been years I know that is a principal I would occasionally take that and tell her we need to look at this and I get in front of the staff and I would take you know 15 minutes of the the staff meeting to go over the community survey but I don't know that we did a whole lot with it after that we don't really currently have a situation where we allow our principles to get together and to compare results to compare for example we don't talk to them about you got 15% and he got 55% those conversations have an I think just the basic beginning of saying look this is something we value now and we value it because it gives us important data towards moving towards strategic plan that will make a difference when the principal see a reason and a purpose to the survey right now it's just do it because somebody said do it somewhere out there in the other said do this okay what happens if I don't know nothing you know

[01:25:00]
what happens if I do nothing so just that but when you start looking at strategies and best practices we go to those schools that have better results we're going to find out that they did exactly what you're talking about they had the 5th grade hosted the literacy night the parents came you can meet him with quality bad surveys right there and said before you leave your exit ticket parents is your turning in your survey right that's going to run your numbers up little things like that make a difference so they just have been in Santa Fe to do it because they don't see a purpose to it we need to make it purposeful and I think you tie it to strategic plan and that makes it purposeful thank you to call

[01:26:00]
but my question is essentially what is your theory of change that connects the root cause to the proposed strategies that were discussing here and I think what sort of what I'm missing here is what is the problem we're trying to solve so the guardrail is the superintendent will not exclude parent legal guardian student and Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations and so why and I think what we heard in the community engagement sessions with the community was because there is a feeling that there is a barrier between the district the schools the administration's and families or there is a reluctance to provide information or is there is a reluctance to respond to the feedback that the district gets from families and so why and I think if I understand a little bit more about the root cause and the why then all better understand how

[01:27:00]
to ask questions related to your proposed strategies but also thinking about your proposed strategies and so my question is essentially what is the problem we're trying to solve what's the root cause what's your theory of change and what's the timeline for this I'm hearing in the on all of these in the sort of what's ahead you're going to develop an articulated approach you're going to develop a plan you're going to bring more people together but sort of what is the timeline for those things in relation to the overall theory of change does that make sense or Ashley maybe you can help me if it doesn't make sense but thank you got several questions in in there I think that is what is what is driving the results that we're seeing and so I think that

[01:28:00]
getting getting to the core of that you know you like there have been several items identify this challenges and so maybe it's that you want to see or do you like to see that what does challenges are a really big like a more succinct explanation of what those are and then maybe what is the superintendent's understanding of the root cause it's driving the results so what is driving the results of the challenges and what is the root cause what is so what is the root cause that is driving the results that were seeing a specific to the challenge that you're looking at so what what are the what are the challenges that we're seeing

[01:29:00]
succinctly and then what is driving what is causing that what are what are the is the driving force that's leading to the challenges that we're looking at okay so I felt like we had gotten a lot on the challenges and so I wasn't going to ask that but if you could stay succinctly what are the challenges and then after that what is the root cause driving the results specific to those challenges thank you president Gonzalez actually liked your first question behind me and this thing so it's hard to see your face and I know turning around doesn't help but so the all right there's a couple of challenges here and what I would say is the overall was specific to include was to not exclude

[01:30:00]
parents and legal Guardians and so on in engagement in both school and District Operations so when you look at the interim guardrails they're really broken down by district and then by school all right so the challenge on number one quite frankly is like I said when the district hosts meetings we don't get a large turnout traditionally you may recall when we were doing the Strategic plan and we have the big event at Albany High we have a turnout but it was not the numbers we really beat the bushes on that one and it's because it's it's somewhat impersonal it just feels like we're going to have to be a little bit more strategic and thoughtful and utilizing the

[01:31:00]
country groups that we currently have and we may even create another one but let's not commit to that yet we have these committees they represent a wide spectrum of the of the community you know for example the inner tribal meetings that we have with the the Native American governments the meetings we have with for example the African-American advisory committee and I are meeting on Monday these are great groups that have tremendous feedback to provide we just need to make sure that we are specific and what we're asking and now we collect that day so that would be the challenges how do we get past that impersonal aspect and then the solution I think is utilizing what we've got but in a different way and a more thoughtful and more strategic way when you look at rails two and three be start to get down into the school level and you know you look at two and that's

[01:32:00]
Pacific about do parents fill their opinion is considered that gives us a real interesting thought on how parents feel about their involvement in their child's education what's the challenge I think it's one getting people to answer the survey which then is answered in interim guardrail 4.3 and then to get a more representative number there and see if we can ride that up a little bit there are parents who feel disenfranchised for very specific very clear reasons and sometimes those are very individual but there's also data indicates we may be doing some things systemically that we could improve so but with all this stuff is one focuses on why are parents feeling this way and the school level they can address that if that's low at a school they need to I'll ask that question and we haven't asked them to do that necessarily in the past so as far as

[01:33:00]
we have begun developing teams to to one just work on the type of question we need to ask consistently and I think at the end of the year we're going to try to push more participation on this quality of Education survey because it's only given once a year and it's usually at the end of the year obviously so we're going to really try to push that and then we can look at beginning of next year how to utilize that data when the results come in and give the principal's time at one of our principal meetings to actually look at the data and consider it and then have strategies for taking it back to their staff thank you I appreciate that and I think if I were to try to sum up succinctly the challenges that I heard about getting parenting Community engagement or family and Community engagement is a typical

[01:34:00]
Prodigy there's a history of disenfranchisement so I think understanding all of those root causes and aligning solutions to that is going to be important and I think your point around systems change in particular is the big one I do have a follow-up question but I'll wait to let others be get their first questions on the table before I go with that Heather has a question so this is probably a silly question and forgive me for asking it but at the bottom of each graph there's a note and it says these data do not include APS Charter Schools why is that well the reason is we have no control over those schools we have no Authority we don't we don't help them professional development we don't know so they have no they made themselves to our goals and guard rails

[01:35:00]
the bean sponsored by the board but technically they are independent operators so we don't have any specific control over what they're doing now there may be a data reason for that but yeah so so these goals and guardrails work for the superintendent care and the superintendent doesn't control the schools the other the charter schools sorry the charter schools the charter schools that are APS sponsored Charters that we provide services to we do have their information on our website thank you I have a question to ask you mentioned systemic and the issues Within These guard rails I was wondering when you do comprise the data for the equity councils will we see the

[01:36:00]
challenges and maybe even some problems that exist within that report that you'll be seeking out in the future one more time when you say I could cancel I think we have an equity Council I don't I don't think we have more councils which is part of the negotiated agreement and they can work on Equity related issues but they have quite a bit of control and we have a number of councils I think like for example you have a penis cancel you have an African-American advisory Council you can see what they do in the title 1 schools they have family engagement so what we have done is exactly what you just asked you know you get this data what are you

[01:37:00]
do we have never really is a systemic way said look here's what the quality of Education Service telling this school versus that school you know here's an opportunity for you guys to share best practices here's an opportunity to explain why you think this is happening why you think this isn't happening so that's what the systemic change I think is the opportunity at least to begin to look at this data and say it does matter and it matters in the context of the Strategic plan okay thank you I just thought you know okay so these particular groups of what you're asking here are those particular counsels someone very specifically Define

[01:38:00]
making sure they have some very important members of the community engaged in in that work and so they did go out and find people when we meet with the inner tribal governments are all invited right but they don't all attend but they are all invited and some of them are very very good about attending or very very specific because again they all want what's best for their kids very specific changes in that particular meeting towards become a much more effective and engaging meeting then it may have been before thank you

[01:39:00]
there's something that was organically created at some particular school because they felt that it was important right like that that is the heart of the problem which I think to board member Gonzales this question that's the heart of the problem that you guys are trying to fix that's not a question is recognizing that those those different groups exist because the school felt it was important to have that group and that Community we need to engage with that group strategically and like I said kind of goes back to okay

[01:40:00]
what are we going to ask these groups about the Strategic plan you know I mean very specifically are you seeing changes in the classroom are you seeing your kids come home and you feel that they're learning how to read those are questions we can ask of those groups and that's good feedback so that wasn't my question so my question is is we keep you keep mentioning incentivizing and what I what has I've realized again these are all adult behaviors right that you were trying to incentivize so moving forward what thoughts do you have two incentivized those adult behaviors which I think the core of that is the is we haven't built Trust

[01:41:00]
but how are you how are you going to incentivize adult behaviors that's actually the members of the board full stop simply by prioritizing it okay so let's talk about the survey specifically because that's really kind of drives you that really drives 4.2 also right we haven't made this a priority for our principals and therefore they haven't made it Priority for their schools which means it hasn't been a priority for the teachers or the community how do we incentivize it when we tell them we this is important it's being collected it's being looked at and you should be looking at it to give them time to do that and we have to make the time for them we can't expect them to find it on their own we have to carve that time out to the meetings we ask them to come to so we find it for them and then three we help them with okay what am I supposed to do with this

[01:42:00]
okay even if it's something as simple as identifying the top two areas you excelled in and the top two areas you you fail or not fail but when the least favorable okay and putting that in front of your staff and letting them look at root causes and let them understand the challenges because so far we just haven't done that we haven't said to the staff you know here's something look the parents here don't feel we listen to them why is that or they don't feel they're getting enough Communication in regards to their child's progress why is that and how can we improve that so that's really the incentivization for the adults is to it's going to start with the principles and I don't want to give them one more thing to do but they're already doing this so it's just how do we do it better okay just so I can wrap my head is the system that you're creating is one from a district push

[01:43:00]
did the district the administration is saying this is a priority then you're going to work with the school principals to help them to understand how it's a priority which will then trickle to the parents in the families for them to have an understanding is am I encapsulating how your systematizing this correctly the factor of time building in the time I think is absolutely critical so Madam chair and board member Jackson when we look at the information this is kind of our formative assessment of where we are with this card real as a district so I think we all are coming up with ideas and like oh well what about this will how are you going to approach that we have realized that in our work we have to remain focused on the Strategic plan

[01:44:00]
and anything beyond that is going to distract us from the work so when we look specifically at family and Community engagement when we look at the root causes that were identified with maybe lack of trust we put out surveys but APS does whatever they want to anyways so why why give my feedback you know not welcoming if schools family is filled at the school environment is not welcoming then we need to work on that and that goes down specifically to coaching and within the work of the Strategic plan it then goes down to a principal and working with them on their professional development plan what are those Focus areas for your school that we want you to focus on we're doing that work right now that then needs to be trickled down to each school's 90 day plan because in that

[01:45:00]
they are focusing on tier 1 instruction they're focusing on Intervention they're focusing on math and Ela achievements they're looking at school culture and all of that contributes to the school's environment but as was stated before every school is different so when we look at this stuff we have specifically looking at each of the questions in the survey to see what is that telling us and as a district bird's eye view where are we seeing the gaps that we can tackle and then when we drill down to each of the schools and the even the different levels to see the level of Engagement and the parent responses how do we tackle that so those are the conversations that we are going to have and from there come up with a strategy so that it's clear looking at responsive systems right and

[01:46:00]
play expectations creating a framework for our principles to use with their school sites giving them that framework so that they're not having to create it on their own and that is our work but we first have to see what are the challenges that as to the why why are families not engaging and without the assumptions and then when they start seeing that we actually care and we're doing something with the information that we're asking them to provide to us trust will start to be built I believe that so I think yes yes and yes to all of the stuff again as we do these their formative assessments and it gives us ideas as to move how we move forward but it is a work in progress and that's why it's a five-year plan we want to do it all at once but we know we can't because a superintendent Elder said our principles plates are full so if we give them one

[01:47:00]
what are taking off and that trickles down to the classroom so we need to be aware of that President Gonzalez your question thank you this was sort of a follow-up to my theory of change question and I think threads of this have already come out in the conversation a little bit but I think we had a bit of a conversation around systems change and what strategies the district is going to use to advance that systemic change my question is around mindset change and what strategies the district is going to use to fundamentally change the mindset around whose voice matters or whose voice matters more or who decides cuz there is a cultural norm in our society in our education system but including an APS around compliance and control and not

[01:48:00]
providing agency to those for this from opportunity and that really that while that has to do with some systems change some technical assistance and tactical supports and PD and plans and tools which doctor Segura just described some of this is also related to adults mindsets around again around his voice matters if you could just speak to any strategies that you have to address this issue of mindsets around voice and agency Madame President members of the board for the question a couple things and simply put I think one of the things that a couple of our initiatives step training and Community Schools offer us is looking at our communities as assets and celebrating our communities in that lens looking at the community school framework to see how we facilitate and work with our principles to look at that

[01:49:00]
and connect their plans around the community engagement their family engagement down to the connections they're making to the Strategic plan and to their school 90-day plan families parents trust their schools and they have a connection to their schools helping our leaders see that Empower them to lead in that way will enable them to take the feedback that we do eventually get at a higher rate from our quality of Education surveys to implement continuous Improvement plans based on what it's telling us at a higher level and celebrating the access from within our community to build continuous Improvement in that way it takes investment it takes time and it's going to take what we've talked about the Common Thread is going to be investment of time in our leaders

[01:50:00]
conceptually see themselves as change agents in the way that we engage our communities are distinct and unique communities in very individual individualized ways one other thing I'd like to add to that is that when you look at the survey we're getting 20% right now we're not really asking for anything so what's going to happen when we ask yeah I think just saying we now value this and a little bit more in terms of changing mindsets we haven't really focused on any specific questions in that survey but in this case we do and it's a question about parental voice in their child's education again you want to change my sets you going to have to find those people that are doing it make them Champions and let other people say that that's what we value this is what we're seeing in this guard rail this is what we value and we're going to

[01:51:00]
the time in effort into it that been in itself will help people to understand something has to change now I think doctor Gonzalez and his teams have much more specific strategies but I'm saying just as an overall you evaluate you spend your time and we're going to spend time on this people who learn that that's what's valued any more questions for your presentations at the beginning that we're going to go a little bit differently than we should and I stayed at the beginning that typically we should review the required criteria and a report and make sure that we all agree

[01:52:00]
that that required criteria is there I skip that part in order to give us an opportunity to really dig into the report into the presentation a little more but I'm going to circle back to that which is what we're typically supposed to do before we even start the conversation and so the required criteria is in the report do we see the guardrail the data the interpretation the evidence and the plan yes I believe we do is there anyone who feels otherwise I'm just trying to get the president is asking if we feel otherwise if we feel that everything was meant so so there was

[01:53:00]
question if if this if the strategy that you are wanting to articulate is not in the documents then does that mean that we cannot move forward with the with the approval I would say and I don't know if Ashley is still there that part what were actually just looking at is the data that is in the document that was given to us because the strategy is ongoing so what we're just looking at is the the materials that were presented to us do we have enough information to be able to answer the questions that we need answered right now so that I would say yes we do I think that's right and I'm seeing nodding across the board and I think the distinction is if the

[01:54:00]
strategies are not included in the what's next or what we're going to do portion of the plan is there at least information or strategies for how we will put together the strategy put together the plan or put or gather more information order to answer those questions and I think we heard and saw that in the presentation so given that we're hearing that we're willing to even have the conversation again this is a little bit out of order because I wanted to just give us an opportunity to dig in so that's what we would have done first and then we would have had the presentation had the questions and so now we are at 8:00 where we've completed the monitoring conversation so we must choose whether to accept or not accept the report based on three questions so these questions are does reality match the values expressed by our community

[01:55:00]
the answer to all three is yes then we the board can accept the monitoring report confident that the data is accurate in the superintendent is performing the answer to only one or two of these is yes the board May opt to table the matter and asked if you intended to complete the information and bring it back at the next meeting within a month and if the answer is no we should consider voting to not accept the report and so the floor is open for I believe emotion to accept the report is that right Ashley based on that criteria okay yes that's on the floor is open for a motion to accept the monitoring report for the guardrail for to accept the monitoring progress monitoring report for guardrail for so I will second but then would like to open it up for discussion thank you so

[01:56:00]
do you have a motion from Member Dominguez and the second from Member Jackson and will open it up to discussion remember Jackson did you want to kick us off and then again vice president to amorito if you could help facilitate any additional discussion yes so I will pick us up because this is where I always get stuck so Ashley I'd love to see your beautiful face again I think that the reality does match and I think that there is a strategy to cause growth but where I always get stuck on this question is does the data show growth and because this is our first set we act it cannot possibly show growth so how do I how do I resolve that being able to answer two out of three rights that's a great that's a great question so because this is the first time you all have monitored the scar girl this really is kind of your Baseline

[01:57:00]
conversation so you don't you're not going to actually see growth because this is really the first data point that you have so it is it's not the question isn't are we isn't necessarily are we seeing growth it is are we on track with the with where we want to be and if we're not on track do we have we had has the conversation indicated that there is a plan in place that will sufficiently get us on track and I think that that's really the question okay thank you so I think that that then then yes I am able to answer in the affirmative and leave it open for other discussion if there is any I just wanted to point out if I make that I see you know the ideas or the clarifications that emerge out of this discussion or documented

[01:58:00]
and so I think that's important it's serendipitous and and organic and recorded for for future reference so and I appreciate that aspect I just want to make mention to the guardrail number for the superintendent legal guardian student and Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations and based on the conversations I fully hope that we do take that guardrail seriously and that we not only hear the conversations that we just had but I just hope that this will become Central to what we do need to do because based on the

[01:59:00]
turn everything on and I just want to see change and I just want to see us moving forward and realizing that there needs to be growth so thank you is there any additional discussion I think we're done all right thank you very much pleased and thank you to the aps team for the presentation thank you all so to miss pause for your support and your coaching

[02:00:00]
we made our way through that agenda item our next item for discussion and action we're on action items now is consideration for approval of the aps open meetings act resolution and are presenter is Johanna King executive director Board of Education Services office Miss King you have the four thank you madam president board members superintendent Elder the aps open meeting each year to reflect changes in officers chairs and meeting times and locations the board has agreed to time States and locations for regular meetings and for finance and policy committee meetings board members will discuss meeting dates and times for the audit committee during meeting on Tuesday January 23rd at 7:38 a.m. here in the boardroom website which can be accessed from the aps website at

[02:01:00]
best edu thank you Miss King is there any are there any questions about this agenda item or is there a motion for approval of the aps open meetings act resolution I will move to approve the aps open meetings act resolution this is Courtney I will send it to me thank you is there any discussion or questions and a second give me a roll call vote please Janella yes yes Crystal Gonzalez yes thank you our next item is our discussion items on the agenda now since the agenda item 7

[02:02:00]
board members to serve on boards so you had in your packet a list of boards for which the aps Board of Education members serve on some of these are required by law statute or joint resolution or agreement some of this is written into our policies and our procedural directives and some of this is just been practiced and procedure many of these are optional I'm like to draw your attention to that document on agenda item 7.1 which lists out the potential boards and groups task forces that we can serve on this is a discussion item so for today we're just going to have a discussion around which boards folks are interested in serving on and then the decisions will be made offline and communicated to board numbers to public separately and so if you're looking

[02:03:00]
watch the the attachment for board members on other boards we start with boards and committees that include APS board members the first is the Capital Community Capital advisory commission which requires that one board member serve on the commission which is comprised of community members and this has oversight of the district's Capital master plan and so sticking with actually let me pause what would be more helpful that I run through them all and give a brief description and opportunity for Q&A clarification or if we go one by one I would suggest for the new members to sorry sorry I was just go through all of them and then Circle back with questions and so this one I don't know the frequency with which the Community Capital advisory commission meeting

[02:04:00]
the next one is the aps Education Foundation so this is one of the board president serves on the board of the foundation and so this is an ex official role which I will serve so we won't be discussing this one tonight the next is the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Community Schools partnership this one requires it to board members and the superintendent serve on the partnership there is a joint Powers agreement in place between the aps Board of Education Albuquerque city council and mayor and the Bernalillo County Commission United Way Albuquerque business education Compact and others that essentially dictates that two members will serve on this one this is really an opportunity to talk through that ABC Community Schools partnership and engage around it provided advice and guidance and this one meets how office

[02:05:00]
beauty schools beats monthly on Zooey on Zoom from about 8:45 on a Thursday morning till about 9:45 they tended to do two face-to-face meetings a year same time friend was this the one where we did not have a vote to board members and the superintendent thank you thank you for that information but

[02:06:00]
play this is the group that advocates for the continuation of the schools you know it's funded by Bernalillo County us and the City of Albuquerque and they we have developed quite frankly a national presence and it certainly State presence and I think that there's a lot of bush for Community Schools and there's also a lot of pushback because they say what what does a community school do in terms of improving the test scores for example and again you can make a very interesting it's very interesting discussion that if you can't stay alive kids you can't you know so I think having both there is is important it is going through a transition they have a new executive director of course there's quite a few this year and it's not because the county representative

[02:07:00]
left and there's one other person that left so it's an opportunity I think to develop strong leadership opportunities in in that particular organization thank you superintendent so we'll continue moving and then we'll Circle back around and go one by one for for questions the next is this is my favorite acronym in the whole wide world abcdc plus APS the Albuquerque County government commission so this is two board members serve as non-voting members this is the one member that you were clarifying on the commission so this is a joint government commission that's the city council the Bernalillo County Commission as voting members in the aps two numbers is this one is reconstituted every calendar year so when I started on at the first year at monthly the second year that I served on it at every other month they also alternate the chairmanship so from

[02:08:00]
city council chair in one year to County Commission cheering another year so County Commission shared it last year so city council will be tearing it this year and I believe it's counselor fiebelkorn but maybe anyone who's there might correct me if that's incorrect and so cancel people call this first meeting to order and during that meeting I'll talk about the frequency of the meetings I suspect that will continue to be every other meeting every other month sorry and they're usually Thursday evenings I think like 5 to 7:00 and they typically discuss issues that are related to the whole community so how's it going and homelessness drug use crime Behavioral Health as well as Partnerships between these government entities like for example with Jim's tracks pools that type of thing that we might share Community Center is this one does meet its hybrids so it means in person in the County Commission Chambers with an opportunity to be

[02:09:00]
online for the most part both member president Montoya Court of and I participated online and again because we're not voting members we're just sort of sitting there and listening and asking questions so sometimes it's easier just to be online for that but we did also participate in person a couple of times then next one is the mid-region Council of government I think we like to call this one Mr Cog this is where we appoint one board member and then also an alternate to serve on this again it's a government agency that helps the region plan for growth so this includes representatives from the counties in the middle region so early County Valencia County Torrance County in Sandoval County can anyone share when this one meets and how frequently so they tried we regularly meet at least once a month

[02:10:00]
sometimes it's twice a month on Thursdays or Fridays and and its hybrid it goes from about APS has a position on the executive board and we are voting members and usually that executive board meets half an hour and then we go into the the board of directors meeting and that goes about another hour so 10:30 to 11:30 p.m. so it's possible that you might have more meetings but I think is is the Central and probably the most important

[02:11:00]
it's pretty fascinating you learn a lot about rail systems Transportation Systems we have aps's is benefiting from that through the I think it's 0 Vision zero programs teaching kids how to be Street safe and so you know the benefit is that it was good to have me as an alternate

[02:12:00]
I was able to to watch and and get a feel for how the meetings go when it's appropriate for APS to to weigh in on matters of transportation for example they forget sometimes that we have the largest Transportation Systems advisory Council this one requires at least one board member to participate on it and it's essentially to discuss Schoolhouse it's a diverse Council that includes Educators staff District staff School staff students teachers parents as well as a board member and you can see their listed the topics that are

[02:13:00]
discussed this one is virtually every other month during the school year I do want to know that it is in our policy that requires that one board member serve on the council and so we will appoint a member but I think according to smfg guidance this isn't one that makes sense for us to serve so as we work on revising policy we may decide to change that and not have a board member served but for the time being this one is related to school health is zoom and it's every other month the next is the Council of great City Schools so this is a National Organization of which we remember it's the organization that represents all of the school districts 70 District that have the 40,000 I can't remember but it's a larger urban districts we are all numbers of this we all have an opportunity to attend the conferences events training Etc typically when there is a conference because we don't have large budget will have a

[02:14:00]
location of the side who of the seven will attend those there is also the opportunity though for the board president or a designee and the superintendent to serve on the board of the account of the board of directors for the Council of great City Schools so that person would attend bi-weekly Zoom meetings superintendent I think those are Friday mornings do you know the board for the board meetings for the council know the by weekly Zoom meeting

[02:15:00]
one that's biweekly on Fridays as well as administrative one but you should know then that if you're interested in this one it is bi-weekly on zoom and then there's also the in-person meetings and it's not mandatory that you attend those meetings it's it's just a benefit I think that the council offers for people to grow and learn from each other yes and then there are the board of directors of the council which is held at their annual conference in October so that could also be attended by a designated and then we have meetings and events that board members may want to attend and so these are all on a rotating basis and so we're not going to spend much time on this board services staff sends out emails in the board at a glance indicating when these meetings are coming up and seeking volunteers to serve so there's the Indian policies and procedures monthly

[02:16:00]
are invited to participate on a rotating basis and the IPP consists of tribal education leaders for the 12th as well as educational staff so this is monthly and will alternate through board members to participate in that one we have the equity advisory Council again board members are invited to participate on a rotating basis the superintendent's student student advisory Council or the super sack board members are also invited to participate on a rotating basis and again board services will coordinate that I think important to know that these are learning opportunities opportunities to hear learn discuss ask questions but we're there and more of a observation role in active participants don't take over the meeting economic Forum I think is all folks know is a business is an organization here in Albuquerque that needs typically monthly and has speakers

[02:17:00]
we're invited to the to participate in those invitations go out on a monthly basis there is a fee and if you do decide to attend that fee will become from will come from each board members professional development funds the greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce again this is an ex-officio role where the board president is invited to attend those meetings and the superintendent is an honorary board member and then we have some school board governance and professional development so there's a couple of things nobody here and again there's a whole host of PD opportunities for board members so we do have our individual professional development funds that you would use on these things should you want to so the National Association of Latino elected and appointed officials not Leo is something that board members have the option of joining there's a fee if you want to become a member and there's a process for that as well but that gives you access to additional meetings conferences training webinars and other events New Mexico school boards Association all

[02:18:00]
what numbers are automatically members and is I think you've already seen we are invited to the training institutes the webinars the conferences and you we basically work a board services to attend those it's important to note that we are required by New Mexico Lodge to earn at least 5 hours of training per year of PD that is offered through nmsba so those training hours are tracked by board services and reported back to nmsba every year but you do you are required to have a minimum of five hours and you earn those credits by attending nmsa events there's also opportunity for us to earn those PD hours through basically submit a request to msba sort of justifying why the training you want to do is beneficial to your role and how it's different from what nmsba is currently offering so for tonight we're going to kind of go back up to the top fish

[02:19:00]
are the document page one where we have Community Capital advisory commission there and we're going to go through these another opportunity for question discussion and then just to hear what folks are interested in serving on so the ones that were seeking volunteers are Community Capital advisory commission ABC Community Schools board the mid-region Council of governments The Shack which I've just learned late coming announcement that this is required by ped for us to participate so we can't opt out of that so we do have to have a more board member on our Shack and then the council of great City Schools if you're interested in serving as a designee on that board or in those meetings so I'll go ahead and we can move up to Community Capital advisory commission we'll start with any clarifying questions discussion and then just if you want to put forth your name will note that as well I'd like to continue

[02:20:00]
no one else wants to do that yeah I don't have any clarifying but I'll put my name in for that one as well I think that's no more Jackson I was just the discussion to ABC Community Schools vice president if you could just let me know or facilitate if there's discussion questions Etc but then we'll also take volunteers I don't have any I have interest but no discuss

[02:21:00]
on that particular one I'm interested as well me too this is Janelle to Danielle just so it's it's Heather Crystal Janelle so far any other volunteers discussion or questions around ABC Community Schools of government so questions clarification and volunteers I'm interested in continuing but I need an alternate I'm interested in being an alternative no one else the next is the district

[02:22:00]
school health advisory Council I'm interested this is Jenelle board of directors I don't have any questions I'm interested in that one this is Courtney I'm also interested

[02:23:00]
remember to serve on the board which is what I'm trying to assess interest right now and then all members are invited to participate in Council trainings as well as the bi-weekly Zoom meetings and so I want to next assess who's interested in being a part of those by losing meetings so I have a sense of who to talk to participate in those but for now I have interest in the board from Member Jackson morito anyone else on the board interested in the board okay and then anyone interested in serving as the designee when needed on the Bi weekly Zoom meetings

[02:24:00]
I'd be happy to do that as well so just okay thank you are we ready to move to abcdc plus APS thank you for that so for this one are there any clarifying questions

[02:25:00]
what does Jackson is interested all right so for this one we have members Benavides don't worry too and Jackson that's for the ABC GC plus APS yes okay Miss King thank you for keeping me on tasks I believe you got them and then are there any questions about any of the other ones that are on here before we move on from this agenda item I have a question in regards to the nmsba meetings can we get an update like I guess semi-annually if we met our required hours or if we just to make sure we don't miss that requirement for the annual I know it's only five

[02:26:00]
please and then do we know what our budget is for each board member I don't remember Danielle saying yes we do and so I think maybe following this once we assign people to these committees will send an email out to the board with the committee assignments and then we can also provide that reminder on the budget does that work perfect thank you thank you thank you are there any other questions or discussions we will move on then to agenda item number 8 which is the president's report and for this I just want to say yay this is our our first beginning to end board meeting with this new board and as noted

[02:27:00]
is a little clunky in this hybrid style but I really appreciate everyone leaning in and supporting and helping us get through it a lot has happened in the last couple of weeks and it's been really fun and incredible and humbling to be able to work with all of you incredible leaders and a true honor and a pleasure and so I really appreciate you placing your trust in me to lead our board for this next year and also appreciate all of your support during this transition period your feedback both constructive as well as I don't know formative so I hope to welcome continue to welcome that feedback and so if you have any ideas suggestions please share that with me or with another member of the executive committee or bird services so as you heard tonight we did assign two of our free committees and so I just want to state that this was up in our open meetings act resolution so this was all so in the board report last week in email but just to restate the

[02:28:00]
dance committee which is chaired by member Tapia Romero that will be virtually at 8:00 a.m. on the 4th Wednesday of the month and for this one the next meeting is on January 24th the policy committee meeting which the policy committee rather which is chaired by board member Dominguez will be virtually also at 5 p.m. on the first meeting sorry first Monday of every other month and this one the policy committees next meeting is on March 4th next Tuesday this is for the audit committee at 7:30 a.m. all board members are invited to attend the audit committee meeting which will be held here in the John Miller boardroom and during that meeting we will discuss who will serve on the committee along with chair morito the state law does have some requirements around who participates in terms of the minimum of board members but also staff and community members will talk through that in that first meeting and proposed times and dates for future meetings

[02:29:00]
so you have more information on the audit committee after we complete that first meeting on Tuesday the 23rd all of these meeting times will be posted on the Board of Education meeting website and are also attached to the resolution that we approve tonight also as you probably know I hope you know you better know I hope the community knows the board will be meeting an executive session on January 31st to select the new APS superintendent which is really exciting and I think one of the most consequential decisions that we're going to be making in our term in office so pleased to share that we did narrow down the field to three finalists during an executive session meeting on Tuesday of this week those three finalists are Dr Thomas a heart the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools and a consultant with the Council of great City Schools Dr Mason Bellamy the chief of academics in schools for Metro Nashville Public Schools who formerly worked for the Clarksville Montgomery County School System

[02:30:00]
is Dr Gabriela Duran Blakey chief operations officer at APS who previously served as one of the district's associate superintendents for leadership and learning the day before the board interviews the three finalists were also hosting several events for the public to meet them to listen to answers to pre submitted questions and to provide comments to the board as we evaluate which candidate can best lead APS as our new superintendent more information on this January 3rd public forum is available on the aps website along with the link for submitting questions I do you want to know that those questions are due by January 26th we do invite questions from everybody in the community this includes family staff community members and students as well students please submit those questions you can work directly with your teachers your principals your Associates your parents anyone to help get those questions in but these are questions that will be asked during the student panel which is super exciting at the public forum so major encouragement everyone who knows a student

[02:31:00]
please ask them to submit a question and let's really try to amplify student voice their and the last thing is I just want to acknowledge that next week which is January 22nd through the 26th is National gun violence survivors week the sad reality is that many of our students and their families are members of this group according to the group New Mexico Moms Demand Action for gun sense in America by early February more Americans are killed with guns that are killed in our peer countries and entire calendar year and Firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens so in recognition of gun violence survivors week we encourage students and families to support Community efforts to prevent the tragic events of gun violence and to honor and to Value human lives so that concludes the president's report next is agenda item number 9 which is statement of the next Board of Education meeting the next Board of Education meeting is February 7th 2024 at 5:00 p.m. the next special Board of Education meeting is January

[02:32:00]
all meetings will be held at the Allison Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live streamed at Epps dot edu and with that this meeting is adjourned thank you
