[00:14:00] board member Dominguez I believe that this is like an open contract just depending on what the need is and it isn't necessarily for cabinet I have Dr malign who can speak to it yeah hi good morning period what he was doing was what they were doing was creating the
[00:15:00] pictures in the systems in which we can monitor the 90-day plans and monitor in and actually Implement and execute the board goals in the schools and that plan began at the executive level and is working its way through so this year right now I'm working I've been on board and working very closely with the Consultants the Consultants have done very intensive multigrade training with our new team of assistant superintendents to create the system in the structure so they can work with our with our site level leaders to really aligned 90 Day plans that will in turn execute strategies all the way into the classroom to our four goals so at this point we're going to continue to work through that and they will be working they really they work with me basically basis I give them feedback they give me ideas
[00:16:00] and then we build together the professional development with our assistant superintendent yesterday I began the conversation for what next steps look like and what next steps look like is there going to continue that process throughout the rest of this year with and I worked with Dr Gonzalez and Dr Blakey on this idea so this wasn't just me and isolation just so you know I don't do anything in isolation we're a team here but we are going to look at continuing to work with the assistant superintendent this year really refining the strategies and the systems for them to work with the principals in the next year we are going to bring that professional development directly to our site level leaders so they can be able to communicate in a very high level very high level actually look at what are the strategies that that are going to improve our instructions in the classroom we know that we have some we have tons of very skilled teachers in
[00:17:00] our system those teachers that are that are doing well we will let them operate for but for those teachers that are struggling or need additional supports what the what this consultancy will do will work with the principles on how to give them the supports that they need so the classroom environment is enhanced for our students now what what up a doctor said is my understanding is this is an open po not to exceed a certain amount of money I don't believe that we are going to spend that money but it was really just the kind of a framework to execute and I'll share with you that we are we are looking to streaming finances in every situation to be very responsible with our taxpayer money as well as is making sure our dollars are being spent in the most effective way that land in the classroom to support our teachers and our site level leaders so it does start a little bit to answer your question at the cabinet level but it is it is Shifting throughout our system very quickly the work that we're doing with
[00:18:00] is there some collaboration with teachers the teachers weigh in not not at this point okay to the the work that the governing board has I guess empowered us to do period
[00:19:00] I just want to be clear that this does not involve any kind of PD there's no expectation that that you saw will work at this point with the board I'm sorry I'm not prepared to answer that I don't know one way or another one thank you as I stated this contract is like open depending on need and budget so I would say if there's no need to request from the board Services then we would not initiate a separate task order under the contract for that okay
[00:20:00] I was going to say it would have to be requested by the next board great thank you I have a question on there specifically with special education there's redesign and re-strategize can you clarify to what that is and how that will improve special education and I also see there's some professional development yes yes in the in the world of a special education they're working directly with Ms jet is she is she oversees the special ed to streamline services and create more efficiency
[00:21:00] Play services in the classroom because we know that that that that that really they just learned they just learned slightly different in each of them we want to meet their needs so I think that what that speaks to is the work they're doing directly with Ms Chad who then is working directly with the assistant superintendent of special and Mrs Riser Riser so this is specifically geared toward IEPs because I'm just looking at the redesign or is it just a portion of yes ma'am I think I just kind of mentioned a little bit of what we had spoke about in the last meeting the things that are but it's really an overall looking at just to improve our efficiency to make sure our special ed students are getting what they need we know they're a big it's a group of our and we really want to make sure that we're we're working directly with
[00:22:00] Miss Chad who's working with directly with our assistant super of special ed and then obviously it'll it'll Cascade throughout that special ed Department to increase efficiency okay thank you for that any other questions thank you so much for that presentation we will go ahead and continue our next item is to consider approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 500,000 this is for Sheet Metal Fabrication and installation services and are presenter for this is the Action Memo the board report and also the evaluation sheet this is for purchase of
