[00:14:00]
we want to try and be there for APS as much as possible and that's why I'm also grateful for a wonderful new generation of APs leaders of course first and foremost it starts with our new superintendent that we're all very excited about and she has been nothing but open and willing to further collaboration with everyone she's worked with and of course also the school board which continues to set new standards when it comes to integrating our children's lives and our communities lives that is why I'm very excited to announce your school board president Daniel Gonzalez president thank you so much and God bless God bless her children

[00:20:00]
increase in Reading proficiency by the third grade two making sure that more students from those same groups are improved in math proficiency by 8th grade three better preparing our high school students for life after graduation by increasing the percentage of students who are taking two or more advanced placement courses International Baccalaureate courses or dual credit courses and increasing the number of students who are earning an industry certification through career connected learning and students who are earning a bilingual seal and finally number four increasing the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills habits and mindsets that are most aligned to success self-regulation self-efficacy perseverance and social awareness and it's important to know that these goals aren't things that just fell out of the sky these goals are

[00:21:00]
actually rooted in the skills and the capabilities that you are communities say you want our students to have when they leave Albuquerque Public Schools equally important as the goals are our guard rails are guardrails are essentially the values that our community told us that they have and they're also the lines with which the administration cannot cross as they go about trying to achieve the goals so as an example our guard rails are ensuring that our students get grade level and culturally relevant instruction in their classrooms that students and families and communities have a voice in the education and the decisions in our district and the resources will be distributed equitably those Community Values are affirmed by this boards and I just recognized the boards if you can raise your hand again but by this board's

[00:22:00]
United commitment to students to student outcomes to equity and to preserving and creating a robust public education system for the state of New Mexico and that public education system We Believe needs to provide wraparound supports safety a sense of belonging and connectedness to school especially for our most vulnerable students as they are working to achieve their academic Pursuits it was actually one year ago that many of you were here I believe it was August 28th that we stood up here on the same stage to release these goals and the Strategic plan and his president of the aps Board of Education myself go Vikings as a parent of APs students myself I am really proud that we have fully embraced these goals and these guard rails and that were holding the district accountable

[00:23:00]
it's all part of student outcomes focused governance model that we're now operating under and I know that word that name sounds really Technical and wonky and maybe I don't know government speak but the name really does say it all student outcomes focused student outcomes focused governance every decision that we are making that the administration is making needs to come through a lens of students first and we as a complete District are now laser focused on those student outcomes on those goals we all know I think that so often institutions create set goals and create strategic plans and then they put it in that have a big nice event like this they put it in a binder and they let it go sit on that shelf to collect dust and I'm here to tell you today that is not what is happening in Albuquerque Public Schools we expect these goals to be met and we've actually changed the way that we

[00:24:00]
I need to place them at the center of everything that we do and I want to pause here until just a short personal story so I mentioned that I'm a parent of several kiddos I've got four at home one of them a couple years ago he was about four or five and he came to me one evening and he said mommy can you do that thing where I have clean clothes in the dresser and I looked at him and I said laundry because to this 4 year old all he knows is that he takes his shirt out he wears it he throws it on the floor and then they show up again folded in the dresser and he doesn't see what to him feels like magic behind the scenes the clothes show up and their folded but it's not magic it's a lot of hard work and sometimes we don't get all the way to the stage of having them folded in back in the drawer but it is hard work happening behind the scenes and that's exactly what's happening behind the scenes at APS 2 that I want to open up the curtains a little bit today and show you what has been happening

[00:25:00]
how we are living into this commitment for student outcomes focused governance so that means that we as a board again raise your hand board members we as a board have made a commitment to be more intentional about embracing our statutory responsibilities and student outcomes as our work and leaving the day-to-day management of the district to The Experts to the superintendent and the staff were also receiving reviewing And discussing reports almost every month on the progress being made against the goals in the guardrails we're spending more of our board meetings focused exclusively on those goals and guardrails and posing strategic questions to the administration about that work and about that data we also as you hopefully know launched a national search to hire a superintendent who understands the urgency

[00:26:00]
of improving student outcomes for all of our students and we've made it clear to our new superintendent that her job is to improve student outcomes and that her success or failure at APS hinges on the ability to do just that the only thing we are evaluating the superintendent on is her ability to meet The Targets in our goals and our guard rails and for the first time ever we have actually tied her contract to Improvement towards those goals and those cards I am happy to say that Dr Gabrielle she has already made bold moves to realign The District in an effort to align the work across the district with those goals and today's date of the

[00:27:00]
to provide an honest assessment of where APS currently stands and to outline her plans for moving the district forward this is the magic behind the scenes more importantly this event is a way for us to hold ourselves accountable and for all of you to hold us accountable to Our intention is to make the state of the district event and annual event where we come out and we tell you our community the progress that we've been making improving student outcomes and we're also tracking that engagement tracking tracking who is coming and holding ourselves accountable for increasing those numbers now we all know that we may experience setbacks along the way as I said sometimes the laundry just doesn't make it out of the dryer and that's okay as long as we are honest about it as long as we learn

[00:28:00]
turn from what's not working as long as we change our approach and stop making excuses finally I'd like to point out that while the board adopted these goals we held Community meetings we sent out surveys thank you for filling those out we met with various Community organizations and groups as we were developing them and during that process you told us that you want students to graduate with the life skills they need to be ready with the tenacity and drive and follow up needed to make their dreams a reality for our students so in a few minutes you're going to hear doctor Blakey present the first ever state of the district address but first here is a short

[00:29:00]
video about Gabriella revelation of a society sold in the way in which it treats its children Nelson Mandela said that quote and it's always been something that kind of guides me and how we as a community look at education and treating our children and so it's really important to me that the business Community the parents everybody works together to lift up our children so to impact student outcomes we have to give opportunity to our students but we also have to make sure that they know that they can do it and that we're here to help them a lot of people talk negatively in front of our students about their Community their schools their teachers and to me I see addressing problems as opportunities and that's why I'm really focused on making sure we lift up our community by talking positively in front of our children about what they can do and what they can become in their schools I attended San Diego Elementary School

[00:30:00]
Van Buren middle school and graduated from Highland High School I really want the outcomes for our children all across Albuquerque to be the same outcomes that I had and so it is a sense of Pride to be superintendent of the town in which I grew up in but it's also a sense of responsibility that I have to do the right thing for our kids as a change maker it's really important to get into the schools to talk to the people on the front lines to hear from staff from what they need to be able to do their work to talk to students about what will make school better and to be able to deliver on what they say so getting into the schools and being part of the work of the day-to-day classroom is really important to me so that I'm able to provide the resources and support that they need to be successful in the classroom resources are you know a constraint and we can't provide everything all the time but meeting in the middle and being able to compromise and know that in the end we are putting

[00:31:00]
Vision that our graduates graduate with this sense of Pride and confidence that we have instilled over the course of our work together to be able to really Inspire children and have student outcomes that we didn't know were possible before ladies and Gentlemen please welcome our new superintendent to the podium thank you thank you

[00:32:00]
I do want to start off this morning by thinking the La Cueva string quartet the guitar group from Rio Grande High School and our Volcano Vista Huck band for performing for all of you this morning so big thanks and thank you to k a n w and New Mexico music it's honor to be in Albuquerque and be able to have a walk out song that is w and all of our New Mexico artists and thank you to all of the students who are here today we have representatives from all of 13 of our comprehensive high schools and I'm really happy that they could be here so welcome students and thank you to all of you because you are here today it means that you care about our students and about our future in Albuquerque

[00:33:00]
no thank you for all taking the time to be here I am standing here today as a superintendent of one of the largest school districts in the country and it's because of the foundation that I received here as a student at Sandia base Van Buren and Highland High School Albuquerque Public Schools set up for me success and I want that to be the same for every student that walks through our doors I want it to be true for a Native American students are black students are English language Learners are economically disadvantaged students and those with disabilities just as it was for me and I recognize that we have a lot of work ahead of us and we have a long road to get there but I assure you that my sleeves are rolled up and I'm ready to do whatever is necessary to improve the academic outcomes for each and every one of our students at every level of APs from our central office to our classrooms we have hard working

[00:34:00]
play very dedicated Educators each one of them want our students to succeed and that's as true today as it was $133 years ago when Albuquerque Public Schools was founded but are good work and good intentions haven't always translated into good outcomes many of our students are struggling in fact only 38% of our third graders are proficient in Reading 26 of our percent of our 8th graders are proficient in math only 72% of our seniors are graduating on time and where are Yazzie Martinez students they're even further behind despite those realities we have largely operated the way we always have making slight connections here and there but generally shying away from big changes out of fear that it might ruffle feathers and the fact is business as usual is not working for us we have to reject

[00:35:00]
the status quo and embrace a culture of accountability if we're going to move the needle on student outcomes for students in Albuquerque we must put kids first and that's exactly what our board has done by working with the community to come up with our four overarching goals for a district improving reading and math proficiency rates preparing our students for life after graduation and equipping them with the life skills that they need to be successful achieving these goals means our kids will have the tools they need to thrive in the world and to be masters of their own fate these five year olds were unveiled last year which is when we also unveiled are emerging stronger strategic plan are road map for achieving the goals I formally took over a superintendent 59 days ago

[00:36:00]
in that time I just want to share a few things that we have done we implemented an administrative reorganization that geared towards better positioning of centrally to meet our goals we find tune to the work of our strategic plan to better align it with our goals we worked with our teachers to create units of study that will align what is being taught in each grade level throughout the district and when it is being taught we committed to getting every Elementary School teacher and principal trained in letters which is a professional development program that has shown promising results in boosting literacy scores we pledged to increase Community School Partnerships to provide our students with the support that they need we recently launched let's talk which is a new communication tool aimed at making us more responsive to the people that we serve I assigned members of the leadership team to visit every school in the district during the first two days of school to ensure that we had a smooth

[00:37:00]
start and set up our students for Success during the school year and we have completed our Fine Arts expansion which allows every APS Elementary School to have access to Art and music every year we have also implemented a new system that gives greater autonomy to schools that are doing well and invest more of our time and resources into schools that are struggling in need our help the idea is pretty simple schools that need more help will get it and they will get it faster schools that are doing well will have more freedom to innovate new strategies to take them even further and another problem that we are working diligently to address is chronic absenteeism we know that we cannot improve student outcomes if our students simply are not in school and last year nearly 31% of our students were chronically absent

[00:38:00]
which was a slight Improvement but we have a lot of work to do so we're expanding a program that now will alert School staff and students to develop attendance and academic challenges this will enable our staff to provide interventions to support these students and their families and beyond that we have to engage our students by figuring out what is the excites them to be in school and using them to get excited about learning our Fine Arts expansion we completed this year is a great example of that another example is genius hour which is a block of time each day that allows students to explore their interests and that's why I would like to expand genius hour into every APS Elementary School I can't guarantee that every one of these changes will have the impact that we expect but what I can promise you is that we will monitor the results we're getting and we will

[00:39:00]
change course if we find that the Investments aren't paying dividends so board president Gonzalez members of the school board students families APS colleagues community members what is the state of the district well last year we were emerging stronger and today I can say we are APS strong we clearly know where we are and we recognize the hard work ahead of us that we strive to improve outcomes for all of our students we are embracing the hard work and the journey and the road that lies ahead for our students it's important to acknowledge these problems and to commit ourselves to addressing them but it's just as important to celebrate our successes and build on the things that are going well at East San Jose Elementary School which is one of our top schools third through fifth grade

[00:40:00]
reading scores increased by 19.1% points and math scores increased by 19.7% points those are incredible games for our students and hard work that our staff has been doing I want to recognize the East San Jose principal Mr Eder Ortiz his students and staff for their hard work Mr Ortiz will you please stand thank you to the hardware to help students and struggling schools by increasing staff time and instructional time at those schools and the East San Jose students weren't the only ones who made games baseball

[00:41:00]
students at Sandia Base Elementary my alma mater was saw a 27.8% increase in Reading Mission Avenue Elementary School which is part of our engineering the future magnet pathway their reading scores went up 23.6% points and MacArthur Elementary School 32 percentage increase in their math scores and this school is very noteworthy because MacArthur welcome schools from a very small school that we closed down the road which allowed us to combine the schools and provide the students with more resources than we were able to give them in the small school are students at Sy Jackson Elementary School 46.8 percentage Improvement in math and are middle schools are working hard as well Grant Middle School 154 percentage increase in Mass scores and Eisenhower Middle School

[00:42:00]
I had a 16.8% increase in math and it's not just about the reading and math scores let's talk about our career connected learning our career connected learning classes are engaging students and opening the doors to good careers ahead for them just asked Mr Sean coffee students Mr Coffee is a 35 year older who has been inspiring students at Valley high school for the last five years the welding fabrication program is also part of our engineering the future magnet it is a gateway for students to Hands-On work in the trade Fields his students focus on real world applications and leave the program with OSHA certification many have already landed good paying jobs after graduating and Mr Coffee couldn't be here today because he's busy with his students but let's give him a round of

[00:43:00]
pause while he's doing the hard work this morning are Community Schools are providing our students with wrap around supports that they need to succeed in the classroom they are using the assets of their individual communities to collaboratively address resolutions to root cause barriers their work takes many forms Kelly Davis our community school coordinator at Wilson Middle School work with the community school calendars from her school and Whittier Elementary School to organize a walking school bus with the community to ensure that students are safe when walking to school and addresses them getting to school safely and on time Miss Davis police station

[00:44:00]
MC students Misha and Kaylee are student masters of Ceremonies at this event they are poised they are calm under pressure and extraordinary people so let's thank them for their hard work and these really are just a handful of the success stories that abound in our district from our newcomer program and our clothing and food banks to our drug counseling programs and our schools of choice are employees are making a difference in our students lives each and every day and we need to stop to celebrate these successes while also recognizing that we must do a better job in reading and math proficiency and improving our graduation rates and I can assure you that I am committed to doing everything I can to improve outcomes for all of our students and give our staff what they need to be successful in the classroom and as I said before I

[00:45:00]
their responsibility to ensure that we have a system that is working for our kids and to intervene if that is not happening in fact before the school year started this year I met with all of our principals assistant principals and leaders of every Department in Albuquerque Public Schools and I urge them to be bold and to push their staff and students to strive for excellence and help them achieve things they didn't know were possible for our leaders who don't work directly with students I stress to them that it's their job to remove any obstacles that are standing in the way of our kids getting what they need I'm asking teachers to embrace high quality instruction and work with our kids to teach at every grade level try parents and family I ask that you recognize the importance of education for your child's future

[00:46:00]
