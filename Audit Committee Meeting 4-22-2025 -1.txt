Burnett Apodaca yes Courtney Jackson yes all right so we do not have any action items tonight so I'll move to discussion items our next item is the report on the ethical Advocate statistics for the period of December 1st 2024 through March 31st 2025 are presented tonight is Gene Saavedra the executive director of student parent and employee service center Mr savagery you have the floor Madam chair members of the committee and superintendent Blakey good evening again on Tuesday executive director of student parent and employee service center on before to you the ethical Advocate data from December 1st 2024 to March 31st 2025 primarily through ethical advocates

[00:04:00]
allows for anonymous reporting I follow the procedural directive when receiving reports I reviewed the reports and then send them to the direct supervisors and an individual one level above the chain of command so the two levels of supervision are notified or supervisors are notified as you can see we've received 75 whistleblower complaints from July 20th 2024 to the end of March 31st 2025 the reports of your packet provide a breakdown of the data by several different categories the types of complaint seen typical for to previous report time frames and at this point I stand for any questions I'll open it up to the committee are there any questions on the ethical advocate

[00:05:00]
remember Dominguez I've got a strategic question what new insights does this report offer and how are we documenting Trends if we're able to do that thank you for the question board member Dominguez I think on the first part of it what insights the the concerns are complaining to be typical I don't know that there's any you know specific Insight that that you could say that there's a category one or more that we see as far as being reported I can tell you that you know it's down from previous years and I think that's based on the fact that a lot of people will call us and voice her concerns through let's talk which is helped a lot because we're able to in a timely manner take care of those concerns as far as

[00:06:00]
anything that you know of collecting the data the trends that's within the data that I provided so you can see that you know there are different reports coming in a different ways for different reasons as far as the data is concerned you know it's you know elementary schools and then High School seem to be right there with you know the higher numbers but and that's how we you know continue to track the data is just looking at where those complaints are coming in and what's actually coming in and working with the Departments that are getting a receiving those concerns and complaints so how did the stats and yes I did notice elementary schools and that doesn't surprise me they are I think well the reasons are for

[00:07:00]
the higher numbers at the elementary school level and then how do the stats and form a strategy to impact guardrails five before or 5:00 I wish I could say anything for the elementary schools that you know some of these concerns at elementary schools if you can see those numbers there that's where the highest number is as far as a strategy you know as we work with the supervisors of the different schools for example those conversations as they have those with their principal or the principals have them with their teachers based on what's going on with that complaint or that concerned

[00:08:00]
that's where they developed the plans we don't necessarily you know work with that plan for them or you know sometimes if they ask for advice will guide them in that way but the supervisor of the one that directly work with the school principals in the principal's work directly with their teachers based on any concerns or complaints that come in I hope that answer the question I mean as best as you can yes and I was going to ask their some of these complaints are so I looked at your charts and a lot of them fall up under other and do you have like a what is other mean well so we don't we don't I don't categorize those what happens when they fill out the report they pick the category so they go in and pick other they'll pick the reason for their

[00:09:00]
concern or complaint and that's how it's categorized so we don't you know we don't classify that here they do it the person voicing that picture so your system doesn't have like the let's talk thematic it seems that let's talk can identify a theme an ongoing theme somehow not necessarily because it's not consistent they just you know they pick up because they can't find a category that they feel is something that they want to divorce yes and I know you can only report on what your program allows you the information to you and I appreciate your answers thank you thank you thank you board member Dominguez are there any

[00:10:00]
any other questions from committee members okay see none I will just kind of follow up on something board member Dominguez said in regards to the fact that we do see employee numbers a little bit higher in the elementary school and it might be who've us at the district to maybe try to understand why they're coming in on the employee Elementary side a little bit higher that's probably an important data point that the district can take into consideration especially if those issues beat start to become consistent so seems like this is a good data point to maybe dig into a little bit further is is my comment on on that board member told I see that you have your hand up

[00:11:00]
yes my question falls into the I think it's the last topic where the internal numbers seem to manifest most of the complaints would like to know since their internal one are we looking at not only how we address them but it just says Josefina stated the patterns that exist are we looking at in any way to change some of those internal mechanism mechanisms to make it better or look at some of the patterns that are facing you know these complaints that are internalized so because those are the things that we can change so I'm just wondering if that's a possibility I'll do my best to answer that question but I think one of the things just again

[00:12:00]
play every one of these reports go to the direct supervisor okay and so the supervisors have those reports and the information within those reports to address the concern or issue that comes with it I think that again in working with the supervisors of the schools some of those some of those might be consistent within a school and some of them might be you know we have a lot of elementary schools over 88 elementary schools for example 144 school but we have a lot of schools and so it could be that one school gets to to concerns or complaints and and then the rest are spread out and so I don't know in the supervisors meeting if they're looking at specifics within those meetings but I know as far as us tracking it we're tracking it by categories and we're tracking it by types not necessarily by specific you know within the school what's happening specifically with the school that's the supervisors

[00:13:00]
do that as I get that information and then as a report back they they they have those conversations with the principles and or the principles have those conversations with their teachers as these things come in and or those things are investigated outside of the district depending on the on the type of concern or complaining and then report it back to do you have a follow-up or any further questions now okay all right any other members of the committee okay seen none I'm going to move on to item 5.2 our next item is the overview of APs internal controls are presenters tonight's officer Mark Turnbull executive director of accounting and Amanda Boyle District controller of accounting and before I turn the

[00:14:00]
pour over I will say this as nerdy as this sounds it's always been one of my favorite presentations cuz I think it lays out very well what what internal controls you guys have and it always warms my heart to know that you have such a robust control mechanism so I will turn the floor over to you Miss out the DACA thank you madam chair members of the committee superintendent Dr Blakey the presentation in your pocket is our annual overview of internal controls to mitigate risk associated with Broadway and abused I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Mr Turnbull to provide information on our legal obligations thank you very much regulations

[00:15:00]
in guidance we follow for or where are internal control guidance comes from first we are have we are obligated by law to establish and maintain an internal control control structure including board policies and procedures in order to establish that structure we reference several sources first is in framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the Chevrolet commission this framework aims to enhance the reliability of financial reporting and ensure compliance regulations from the American Institute of certified public accountants and promoting internal controls particularly in the context of financial reporting they offer resources and guidance

[00:16:00]
can internal control Frameworks including the coastal framework and provide training and understanding and implementing effective internal controls we also get guidance from the federal Office of Management and budget for the publication of BM circular a -23 this publication outlines the managers management responsibility for internal control and federal agencies it provides guidance on establishing and maintaining internal controls to ensure efficient and effective operations financial management and accountability the circular also requires agencies to report annually on effectiveness of their internal controls which is included in our annual audit share the district have a publication from a general accounting office called the standards for internal control in the federal government

[00:17:00]
this publication provides guidance to Federal Managers on improving the accountability and effectiveness of federal programs and operations by establishing assessing correcting and Reporting on management controls so with this I'm going to turn it over to Amanda boil the controller for the district she's going to discuss the types of controls okay chairman of the committee members of the committee on this side you'll see that we have three types of internal controls the first is preventive and these are designed controls that are designed to deter or prevent and adverse event from occurring the second type is detective and these are controls that will discover or detect an issue and then the third type is corrective these are controls that are implemented after the detective controls discover an issue so if we can go to the next slide a good way to be back up one

[00:18:00]
a good way to think of the difference between these is if we imagine the district like the school building so are preventive controls those would be things like locks on doors ID badges there again designed to stop a problem so if anyone with without authorization tries to enter the lock prevents it similarly in our division things like segregation of duties or approval of purchases those are designed as preventive controls next detective controls those would be things in a school building like security cameras motion detectors or are synergic badges so they don't stop someone from getting in but they help identify or detect when something suspicious happens and in our world that includes things like reviewing monthly Financial reports or bank statements and audits so it doesn't stop an issue but it helps catch

[00:19:00]
quickly and the third control corrective controls that is if someone did manage to get in or break a window so our response would be to fix a window update security procedures install Better locks again in our world and finance that would be things like disciplinary action or training or improving or strengthening policies to make sure the problem doesn't happen again and I would like to point out that we have a very detailed control environment maintain here at APS we use it to minimize our wrist reinforce our internal controls and make sure that are spending is stays aligned with student-based outcomes and goals and guardrails basically that means that all of our financial functions go through a structured review and approval process each request goes through multiple levels of scrutiny including cited administrators finance approvers and Leadership oversight before any funds are released Financial functions are not made un

[00:20:00]
even at the highest levels of our organization they require consensus and documented approvals from the appropriate departments and these decisions of course are presented to the board for approval and review and are of course submitted to ped and so with that I will turn it back over to renette thank you Renee you are on mute outline some of each of the controls so we have a preventive controls and then we outlined preventive controls in each of the areas budget procurement payroll management general ledger Capital fiscal and then we also have a listing of detective controls we do do 100% audit on

[00:21:00]
out of our transactions and 100% approvals on our transactions additionally we put in some information on corrective controls I think one of the most important things is we do a root cause analysis and we do look at the audit Trail to make sure that we update our processes and if necessary we work with HR we do require mandatory training and we do report back to the Board of Education you will see that in our external audit and also in the audits you will be looking at today in executive session in addition to all of these items that are in your packet we also conducted an internal risk assessment so we looked at every area and

[00:22:00]
we identified any risk associated and then we identified internal controls to mitigate that risk this exercise of doing the internal risk assessment is above and beyond any legal requirements or standards but it is a best practice so we insured to do that we look at that risk assessment every year like we look at this so it doesn't just go on the Shelf but it is continuing updating if there's any changes in laws or regulations so with that we stand for any questions right thank you very much and as you guys will notice I did ask the the finance team not to just read the power

[00:23:00]
play to us since we had access to this early so I appreciate you still giving us really good information and so I will open it up to the committee members are there any questions regarding the aps internal controls board member Dominguez and so I hope it's not that it's quiet here but I'm afraid to mute because they may not come back on how do these controls impact and I can't our overall CP I can't figure out what I meant by CP Forgive Me overall

[00:24:00]
and maybe that's accounting I'm not sure because as I was listening it occurred to me that some of the complaints last year were about or came from the CTE area instructors it was mostly homemade teachers who felt like they couldn't get their hands on materials quickly enough to get their students doing what they were supposed to be doing in the class so as I'm hearing the report we have very strict control but we haven't heard complaints this year that doesn't mean they're not there but I'm hoping that

[00:25:00]
so how does your department how do you resolve those concerns about too much control board member Dominguez Madam chair members of the committee superintendent blankie something that we discovered that is helpful as we started to develop an aging report on the requisitions that are entered into the system and this aging report looks to see if they are stuck at a specific approval level for an extended amount of time so we sent out a notice one day three day and 5 day to be able to see if an needs additional help to get the requisition moving because that was

[00:26:00]
part of the root cause analysis we did last year was to be able to pinpoint where requisition was in an approval for an extended amount of time so that that help with the with the streamlining without losing the internal controls the second thing we did was allow purchases with the procurement card so the procurement card has a little bit more flexibility and most of the purchases fell in what's considered a small purchase so again if we look at risk and impact most of those fell into the category of low risk low impact so we were able to use the procurement card another thing that we did was

[00:27:00]
be able to identify where there was purchases that were frequent and be able to establish contracts with vendors so if we had those contracts in place multiple quotes are not needed and the internal control and compliance is done ahead of the purchase so it helped us anticipate and be strategic so I believe those three items really helped with the issues you identified thank you that was a great answer and I hope people are listening thank you have any further questions I think that's it thank you any other

[00:28:00]
members of the committee with questions OKC none the the only statement I will make is I really appreciate again the robust internal controls that are present within APS and I think the more that we can have this information out in the public the the better because ultimately what we're attempting to do is to protect the funding from fraud and embezzlement and make sure that the money that is meant for our students actually gets to our students so thank you for keeping a Keen Eye on on how all this stuff flows through the aps system so thank you thank you okay not seeing any further questions I will move to our executive session item 6.1 our next item is to consider approval for the Board of Education to convene in executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section

[00:29:00]
10 - 15 - 182 to discuss limited Personnel matters in connection with activity funds may I have a motion please I move that we can be an executive session as authorized by the public meeting Zack section 10-15-2019 personnel management connection with activity fundus this is board member benefits may I have a second this is a board member Dominguez thank you we have a motion and a second may have a roll call vote please Ronaldo yes have there been any videos the meeting
