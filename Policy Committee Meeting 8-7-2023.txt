[00:01:00]
June 6th 2022 and June 5th 2023 policy committee meeting minutes do we have emotion from a second from Member Dominguez please yes yes yes yes our first discussion is consideration for approval of revisions to board policy GB equal employment with Albuquerque Public Schools we have Jessica Martinez policy analyst and government Affairs on and Heather Cohen Opportunity Services and Title Nine you have the four good evening sir console is thank you members of the board doctor Blakey we have three policies on the agenda for this evening but before we do I do want to know that there will be changes to the department directors on multiple policies

[00:02:00]
moving forward due to the recent administrative organization so just a little note on that as for tonight's agenda we are starting with board policy GB equal employment with Albuquerque Public Schools it can be found on page 11 of your packets the policy has been updated to identify specific federally protected groups and to include pregnant and lactating workers in compliance with the pregnant workers Fairness Act which went into effect on June 27th 2023 this is a discussion and action item and Heather Cohen director of Equal Opportunity Services and Title Nine is here to assist with any questions great thank you do we have a motion for this policy between we have a motion from member

[00:03:00]
Peterson in a second from member of the Mingus is there any discussion or questions around this one place for discussion and action is it consideration for approval of revision to board policy I hate Community Schools we have Martinez again and also joined by Brian Garcia specialist for Community Schools development you have the floor thank you madam chair the next item is on page 15 of your packets I hate Community Schools language to this policy has been reviewed and updated to admit language that is more appropriate for the administrative procedural directive as a guide to implementation the current up

[00:04:00]
good policy language affirms the need for a strategy to identify and support the development of community schools within the district and to recognize that Community Schools provides an evidence-based model that supports the integration of student learning stronger families and healthier communities in alignment with our district goals and guardrails this side of was reviewed collaboratively between APS Community Schools and ABC Community Schools and I'd like to know that there have been some questions regarding the clarity of paragraph two that the board should discuss this is a discussion in action items specialist for Community Schools development Brian Garcia is here to respond to any questions great thank you and before we move to discussion can I have a motion for approval a move for approval of the revisions to board policy I hate Community Schools this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion for a quart and a second Romero and we can move to any discussion

[00:05:00]
so I'll start because I did send in the recommended changes actually additions because I think the basic policy is very good but there are two things that I think need to be Spilled Out more clearly one is that really looking at the essential framework for Community Schools and one of the things that have been going on over a decade now is to really examine what aspects of Community Schools really have the impact and I think we did a good job of encapsulating support services but I think there's also a real recognition on the part of community schools of the importance of their acknowledgment and alignment with the

[00:06:00]
portion of the life in the school and at the same time one of the key factors really is collaborative leadership that you know we in education have talked about engagement for years and years and years and wonder why we always come up against a brick wall that we are really good at getting parents in for the student performances but we never seem to get over that hump of what it really means for Community to have that level of interaction commitment leadership within a school that we know all of our communities are really capable of and so one of the one of the aspects of the community school framework is to really look at collaborative leadership that simply saying we have this great stuff going on and we want you to be engaged with it is different from

[00:07:00]
families and school communities and it's the school community in the broader sense really being able to participate in what that development looks like and what it means to have that aspect of collaborative leadership and when that exists I mean I think we can see from schools both with within staff and within that larger family and community group when we start really doing more than simply the engagement but the listening working with disagreeing and working out it doesn't mean that we are all on the same page at the same time but it means that there is a respectful deliberation of what are schools need to look like what what do we need to do to really meet the needs of communication

[00:08:00]
fact that I think we don't recognize strongly enough in the policy I think it would I think it would strengthen the policy to Simply add that language and I apologize I'm trying to find it on my computer I know I did send it in and so it was shared with people so that's that's one aspect the other aspect is that I think it is important for us as a district to recognize the commitment to community schools that Burnley County that the City of Albuquerque that the state of New Mexico has made for Community Schools and this is not take what you want and leave the rest or you know we have an active PTA so we can be a community school know they're really is and I think it's very important to look at the more comprehensive part of what Community Schools

[00:09:00]
the whole of Community Schools ABC has been a leader in that our relationship to them is critical I think in developing our community schools and partnership with them so I would like to see the policy go beyond just what's in statute but to really acknowledge the relationship that we've had with ABC Community School partnership and to put that firmly into policy so the first thing is more potentially on the concept of collaborative leadership and the purpose of community schools and contributing not just to wrap around support academics and then I know remember Peterson sentence which I was looking for as well do you have those do you believe they've been shared are they in the office

[00:10:00]
so the email came from Johanna on August 4th at 2:27 p.m. if that helps you find it so the proposed changes in the second paragraph would read the community school strategy is and is an equity strategy for which fairness has achieved through collaborative comma shared decision-making and systematically dot dot dot dot dot yes so is everyone okay with that proposed edit I think I'm I'm okay with the proposed edits my only question is and I think this is a question for you guys is we have to be really careful about making sure that we're not putting administrative duties into our policies and I don't know the answer to this I mean I think that what the proposed is in here seems great seems fine to me and I'm not against it but I just want to make sure that we're not stepping into what is maybe more

[00:11:00]
Pedro aspect instead of a policy aspect so that's neither that that's a you question of board member Jackson we actually discussed that at length as we were looking over this policy and the need to specifically articulate a procedural directive I think the language that's being proposed will be fine because there will be a whole separate set of language that is more specific Direction in the procedural directive perfect thank you around the final paragraph would end with strategies with New Mexico State Statute in the central practices for Community School transportation as a line with ABC Community School partnership and that's that work for the administration yes and for for members I mean I just think that sentence is just kind of wonky

[00:12:00]
cuz I don't I don't have it with me either but I think if you would just sounds weird those last maybe five or six words I think if it would just end or you would somehow end it quicker than what you did I just don't if you could like read it again maybe I can give you cuz I don't have it last paragraph is that the currently reads Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education in the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Community School partnership in order to ensure the development and implementation of evidence-based practices and what part are we moving remember Peterson or is it would add on to see if

[00:13:00]
final paragraph strategies aligned with New Mexico State Statute and it would add and the essential practices for Community School transformation as aligned with the ABC Community School partnership in it it does read a little odd what if you ended sorry to address the essential practices for Community School transformation so I think our policy analyst can capture the gist of what we're trying to accomplish which is essentially saying that will continue to align with essential practices for Community School transformation as that continues to

[00:14:00]
is there any additional discussion or questions on this one just to clarify I mean I think ABC Community School partnership is playing a leading role not just in New Mexico actually not just now the turkey in New Mexico and actually I think is there's more data about Community Schools there's more experienced that you know that the practice shifted from the four pillars to the sixth essential practices because because because of the alignment that was really seen as critical and so I think I am good with just leaving it in this capable hands of our

[00:15:00]
to do the word smithing but I but I do think it's really important to include that Madam chair or whatever Peterson thank you yes we will take care of that can you just if it's okay with you can you just read it to me since I still can't find I just wanted the whole policy with whatever revisions everybody had had sent in and I think that wasn't maybe available so if you could call the entire revision from the beginning please I hate Community Schools the Albuquerque Public Schools or the belief that community school strategy transforms a school into a place where Educators local community members families and students work together to strengthen conditions for student learning and healthy developments as partners they organized in and out of school resources supports and opportunities so that young people thrive the community school straight

[00:16:00]
is grounded in a dressing on Equity strategy for which fairness is achieved through systematically assessing and addressing disparities in Opportunities and outcomes so that all students experience high quality instruction and receive effective and family supports and services that they need to succeed in school in the community Albuquerque Public School Board of Education commits and its and the superintendent's participation and the Albuquerque Bernalillo County community board partnership school board partnership excuse me Albuquerque Public Schools help partner with appropriate federal state and local entities including community-based organizations Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes and values that Community Schools have a collective impact on the surrounding community that improves conditions for all those living there all those the specific Services supports and opportunities available at Community Schools may vary dependent on local needs and resources Albuquerque Public Schools will strive to strategically

[00:17:00]
identify potential Community Schools and integrate specific programs and services that students that support students families and community and aligned with the current New Mexico statute and I do see where you're looking at this extra line that says into those Community Schools the following components and strategies aligned with New Mexico State should be stricken so Miss Martinez just to clarify the last part that you read I have as strong so the part that starts Albuquerque Public Schools shall partner with appropriate federal state and local through New Mexico State Statute really the rest of the policy you madam chair you have it in starting with which three words Public School shall partner with appropriate federal state and local entities the second sentence that's what I think I'm confused and when you start

[00:18:00]
had asked about a portion that she saw that I didn't so we can take that definitely back to the drawing board and figure out what's what's wrong with this cuz it looks like just to be clear the blue underlying section that says specific programs and services that support students families and community and aligned with the current New Mexico State Statute you were wanting to keep well we currently have that all struck okay and we do not yes our packet had a completely different opening paragraph too right there was a there was a revised version of this document sent and update there was an Original Scent and then Jennifer had updated with a secondary

[00:19:00]
401 401 on July 31st in the second paragraph which follows a whole chunk of stroke language

[00:20:00]
did the first paragraph ends with and the opportunities that young people thrive then there's a whole bunch of struck language and then the next paragraph would say the Community Schools strategies grounded in addressing an equity Equity strategy for which fairness is achieved through and then my Edition was is achieved through collaborative shared decision-making and systematically assessing and addressing disparities and opportunities and outcomes so that all students experience high quality instruction etcetera etcetera so just want to make sure everyone has open the document that came from Jennifer of 401 on July 31st the subject line of the email is Doc added August 7th policy

[00:21:00]
and then if we can all pull that up and just we'll just take a minute for everyone to read through that it does have the I just emailed it to everybody if you want to look so it's either July 31st or it's the top of your inbox so it has IH Community Schools and it still starts Albuquerque Public Schools board affirms and then instead of the need for a strategy which is language that's cut below there's a new sentence which Miss Martinez the belief that the community school strategy dot dot dot dot dot so if everyone can review that now and we'll give as much time as people need to make sure that that's okay and then the other sentence I think that member Peterson promote proposed adding people agreed with the spirit of that the content of it that it's an equity strategy and evidence base transformation strategies so we agree to add that in the appropriate place so we're going to give her time to

[00:22:00]
and then we're going to come back to the final sentence which relates to alignment with New Mexico strategy and the central practices of community schools and I think that's where it can be where there can be a period because the sentence that I added the part that I added that says and the essential practices for Community Schools transformation aligned with the ABC Community School partnership doesn't read well what also says the following components and strategies and then it's all cut so instead of following components and strategies it would just say with the central practices for Community School transformation right now I think we're focused really on the first paragraph those changes and so if everyone has a chance to

[00:23:00]
about and then if you have any concerns if you can raise your hand and I'll get to you is on the last sentence where it says as partners I would because we are just talking about the ABC Community School partnership and APS right we're not talking about anything else besides you guys right besides ABC Community Schools partnership correct I'm sure maybe in terms of are we still in the first paragraph period okay thank you for that

[00:24:00]
so with that point of clarification on the first paragraph sentence is everyone okay with that with those changes review nodding okay so we're okay with those changes in the revised document that came on July 31st at 4:00 we agreed to add the sentence around equity and transformation and then we're going to move now to the final paragraph and the final sentence which reads or me readers may vary dependent on local needs and I'm just starting on the top of the page made me very dependent on local news and resources Albuquerque Public Schools shall strive to strategically identify potential Community Schools and integrate specific programs and services that support students families and community and aligned with the current New Mexico statute period and then that last sentence that's kind of hanging their into those Community Schools the following components

[00:25:00]
essential practices of Community Schools where would you propose we add to that so the blue the first part of the underlined blue that got added so that it reads and line with the current New Mexico statute and what's in Black after that should be struck because the list got cut so that next part so it would be longer with the current New Mexico Community School partnership in the previous

[00:26:00]
forgot about participation with the ABC Community School partnership maybe we don't need that there maybe it can just say and the essential practices for Community School transformation and put a period there and believe that is aligned with the ABC Community School partnership I think my my point and the only thing that I would like to see convey strongly is that we do have a really critical partnership with ABC and ABC nationally is really leading that work around the community schools and we are privileged to be able to be part of that we gaining support

[00:27:00]
Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education commits it's in the superintendent's partnership in the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Community School partnership board so we can add a and commits to the essential practices or something like that or we could add it to the final sentence where you have an align with current New Mexico statute as well as essential practices I like your edit okay just adding in that paragraph and commits to the essential practices so at the third paragraph after Community School partnership and we have our administrative staff nodding so I think the motion for approval with changes is the changes are the revised version that we received the addition of the sentence around equity and transformation and then the addition of the language around commitment to essential practices in that third paragraph actually do

[00:28:00]
collaborative shared decision-making and so that in that second kept paragraph it would read the community school strategy is grounded in addressing Equity strategy in equity strategy for which fairness is achieved through and then it would add through collaborative shared decision-making and systematically assessing and addressing disparities so that collaborative shared would be because that's where I wanted that's right and then I have on on the last paragraph where

[00:29:00]
it's in the superintendent's participation in Albuquerque Bernalillo County Community School partnership and then it says Albuquerque Public Schools should partner with appropriate federal state and local entities including Community Based organization is that needed there when we're just talking about the partnership with Community Schools is that like needed their Madam chair remember and I think if the board decides that it would like to include the necessary Partnerships with the participating organizations we can certainly move it if it seems like it doesn't make sense in that paragraph that's an easy fix I like the inclusion of are you questioning the inclusion of Community Based organizations know I think that's that you're just saying that whole sentence just doesn't need it I don't know if that's

[00:30:00]
because I understand a lot of those community-based organizations are State and they are local etcetera so if you think that's where it should go that's fine if you think that you know it should be somewhere else then that's fine as well and then the only other thing that I wanted to I know in this I think it's in the second paragraph after everything that was struck where it's talks about the community school strategy and then that's where we added what Barbara wanted to add the community school strategies grounded in addressing and Equity strategy for strategy for which fairness is achieved through collaborative share decision-making and systematically assessing correct systematically assessing and addressing disparities and opportunities and outcomes so that all just because there was like seven

[00:31:00]
who's in there and it just like drove me crazy I believe that Brian has a recommendation for that I was just like can we had an as well as somewhere in there you know or at the end when it says and services they need to hear your proposal I want to add before I read it is catching up on all the other language in that paragraph So let's keep an eye on that as I read this in the sense that we acknowledge that there was a few hands in there so this is the way we read it but keep an eye on this other language that we wanted to put in there so the Community Schools strategy is grounded in addressing Equity by systematically assessing and addressing disparities in opportunities

[00:32:00]
so that all students Max has high quality instruction acquire effective individual and family services and receive additional support to achieve positive outcomes in the school and the community so it's a little bit different there's it's the same content we did acknowledged and needed to put like you say some commas instead of ants but I wanted to make sure we caught the other language that we have been discussing since we drafted this language in response to your concerns remember dramatically it's beautiful I think it's still missing the shared

[00:33:00]
the only thing that I the only other thing I would do is anywhere where you have a list where it puts I would always put students first cuz I think students should always come first before anybody else so I know that's probably in the first paragraph I don't know if it's anywhere else but if you could just always put students first I think that's what we're here for so other than that I think that's it at the very beginning you're talking about the very first sentence of the document or wherever it were still in the same paragraph oh I see so instead of saying the Community School's make it addresses

[00:34:00]
I think we will continue to allow the administration to manage the grammatical and word choice and commas and everything else the typographical stuff and we just want to make sure that we get through the essence so we would like a paragraph as clear and make sense that adds collaborative and shared decision making as well as equity which I think are captured in there so I was going to try to summarize the changes but I may not have them all anymore but I will try anyway so again it was the revised language that was received on July 31st in the third paragraph we are using Mr Garcia's proposed cleaned up language adding a comma or closed around shared decision-making up to the first paragraph and elsewhere in the document in terms of orders of pronouns we're having students first

[00:35:00]
always instead of Educators local community members families and students and in the sorry still in the third paragraph after the period with participation in the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Community Schools partnership board ratting commitment to the essential practices in central practices something like that and then back to the end the last paragraph period after with the current New Mexico statute and then cutting what's currently black into those Community Schools the following components etc for the rest of the document is there anything that is missed in that summary okay so we have a motion to accept the document with changes from Member Montoya Cordova and we had a second I believe from member

[00:36:00]
consideration for approval of revision to board policy IH 9 Indian education we still have Miss Martinez and we will have so thank you so in this one I'd like to get asked for a motion in a second for the changes to the policy and then we'll move into discussion I'll move or approval of the revision to board policy IH 9 internet education I'll second this is Courtney thank you so we have a motion for a second from remember Jackson and so I'll open it up to discussion and questions acknowledging that member Domingos sent in a proposed change this afternoon so I'll

[00:37:00]
we're here if you want to put that on the table and then we can talk through that and I recognize that I don't want to hold up the approval so I'm just offering this as a suggested change down the road I'd like to see if saying in the first sentence Board of Education of the Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes the importance of Native American students recognizes the importance of public schools incorporating Native American students traditions and values into their educational experience to enable them to be responsible and then we pick up the language responsible

[00:38:00]
productive students and members of both their tribal and mainstream societies so essentially instead of students maintaining their Traditions it's the schools are enabling to maintain their Traditions correct to the action is upon the school system yes okay other members of the board any reactions to that are we okay I think it's the same question then I mean that's a that's a delegation to the schools like we set the policy is that now creating an administrative task within a policy I think it's a question sorry just on who is the actor in the sentence or the students maintaining their Traditions are the school system and I can't remember that you used enabling

[00:39:00]
native American traditions and values which is in line with culturally relevant teaching and curriculum so Miss Martinez I think that if the language were to be something similar to the way that we have it in Iha that the board commits and the superintendents commitment would be would be language that would avoid any kind of Delegation I should point out that any changes that we make this document will still have to be reviewed by the IPP as they have their input on the you know on the document itself so no just a just a question to throw out their right because the next document that we're reviewing is all about what's our stuff and what's your stuff

[00:40:00]
so I think we're just trying to be very cognizant of that as we move forward that we're not putting administrative tasks into policies and I see it that it could be an administrative task as possible it could be comfortable then with language that says that the board commits it's and the superintendents you know participation of specific I guess for me it's less about delegation of Authority or instructing the administration to do anything it's on who is responsible for what is are we committing our school system to being responsible for any Native American students to maintain their traditions and values or are we saying the students are responsible for maintaining their traditions and values so I agree with member Dominguez on this but I do think it's it is a I don't think the issue is around

[00:41:00]
getting the district to administrative action I think it's largely a wording now it recognizes the importance that's where the Board of Education of the Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes and so the question is what is what are we recognizes recognizing the importance of native the importance of us Public Schools incorporating Native American students students traditions and values into their educational experience to join the conversation you certainly welcome to join we would love that I know remember Peterson has any common commentary questions clarification on this but then I'll go ahead and return to the board members

[00:42:00]
thank you board members for having me here as well my main thought and you know the conversation that we've had around the ih9 and the Indian policies and procedures has been focused on ensuring that the school board's goals and guardrails and and you know strategic plan is incorporated into how we're thinking about this so the main thing that I would just encourages whatever language consistent with that approach I'm going to go down the line we have Peterson language and linguistically responsive and it and it does say we need to not just have a passive role that we really do is

[00:43:00]
educational system have a responsibility to support and to support and not just say Okay so very much in action support I mean I would just make sure that we just use the the right the right word and not make it so wordy I'm just worried about making it so wordy I just think if we could find a word that we could put in there that speaks to what was talking about and not you could kind of maybe diluted by adding so much so I don't know what Mr for some might think about wording that might work there or if he even agrees with that I don't know you could end it educational experience

[00:44:00]
I do I was like the Board of Education of Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes the importance of Native American traditions and values while obtaining educational skills and educational opportunities for all students including Native American students I mean we just basically stated that it's we just value those traditions and values and I don't think we need to say to enable them to do this or to do that because I think that that could be you know that I think that could be separate but I think the value statement that we're seeing here is that we value the importance of Native American traditions and values while obtaining educational skills and educational opportunities for all students including Native American students it's because then it's just embedded as part of a piece that could be available to all of our students around cultural and linguistic

[00:45:00]
available opportunities when you read that I'm sorry I just read it like that I realized what it's saying is that somehow their traditions and values wouldn't support them and becoming valuable members in support of the change that you made but I think we could even strike out more about and I think the Board of Education of Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes the importance of Native American students traditions and values period the Board of Education Works to ensure educational opportunities for all students including American students

[00:46:00]
I'm having a hard time with this one I think fostering partnership cooperation and an open line of communication I want to put the partnership in there rather than just the cooperation

[00:47:00]
if I've learned anything from attending the IPP is that that two-way communication is really important it's not about just cooperating but it's that partnership piece so I'm a board of education shall Foster partnership comma cooperation and maintain two-way communication with tribal governments and then continuing on as written other comments responses to that are we good with that proposed change all right I think we're good so we had the motion for the second from Member Jackson with the changes as proposed which were to the first paragraph and then also the first sentence of the second paragraph all right Miss King can we have a roll call vote please and then until today

[00:48:00]
5A which is the update on the policy review and diet so as members of the board know president Montoya Cordova appointed an ad hoc policy Review Committee and so board member Peterson and I have been working on a policy review to ensure that all of our policies aligned with the community's vision and values or goals and guard rails and this review is part of our boards larger shift to student outcomes focused governance so remember Peterson and I reviewed all of the board policies it was awesome every word of every policy over a couple of months and except for the government section which we're going to get to in our next agenda item because that was being reviewed by the ad hoc

[00:49:00]
on the policy governance the board governance manual so we're going to hear from there shortly but as part of the process we essentially looked at all of those policies and we rated them on a scale of one of 0 to 10 that it is exclusively administrative issue so there are certainly their policies and they're around payroll and it's not just that people get paid it's when and how payroll happens so we decided that's pretty exclusively administrative issue the board doesn't need to be involved in that so I think we probably rated that one like a 0 or 1 on to the other and which was 10 which is indicating that they're exclusive responsibility of the board so the things that tend to be more towards the nines are the 10s were really ones that were very related to the goals in the guard rails related to accountability transparency monitoring as well as evaluation of the superintendent so we did that and then we had sort of in between but we essentially set a threshold of a five so if it was a five

[00:50:00]
above we decided it will stay with the board if it's for below those essentially would get relegated to administrative policies so we discussed it through all that we had lots of conversation around it in general and generally agreed like it took a little bit of some calibrating but in general once we sort of got into the weeds of every policy and what's the purpose it was pretty clear so after all of that review and all of that rating we're going to bring those policies forward essentially for everyone to review and discuss but the next step that happens is basically they get categorized into whether it's a board sorry governance policy golden real policy or administrative policy so that's the next step of which we have a spreadsheet and we're basically just categorizing them into those three based on that rating so what this ad hoc committee will present to you is that it's a spreadsheet will which will basically tell you these are the policies that fall in each of those different categories and I think

[00:51:00]
repeat that last step is not going to take that much time honestly based on the level of agreement that we had and also just the the rating against the rubric the other thing that I'll say is this is subject to change right like we're just starting this s o f g work we may decide that and I think where there is question about it we were like well let's put it on keep it on board policy so let's keep it over there for now and as we get more into sfg as we get more into our monitoring we need to decide that we delegate that to administrative policy but when in doubt we kept it as a board policy and so that's essentially what the ad hoc committee did there I will pause to allow a member Peterson to add anything that I have forgotten and then we can open it up just now I think he's some very well it was actually amazingly easy to slash and burn because something's were so clearly really really not our business in my only question was

[00:52:00]
in the way was will this make it easier or harder for the administration to carry out its role in pretty much the feedback that we got was he'll make it way easier to not be back down with with our policies and so I I think that it is more it is way more straightforward than what I thought it would be going into it and really appreciate the work of the chair thank you questions comments discussion I have a question so just totally curious and it doesn't need to be exact but how many would you say how many got slashed how many were like obviously administrative and 50/50 or just totally curious yes we did actually Martinez and we are looking at

[00:53:00]
69 out of 155 that fall below the 3/4 threshold that is 45% of your existing policies are administrative like fell below the are clearly administrative I'm going to defer to the committee members on that one but yes they were below wow yeah I mean cuz once we got into reading all of them there's a lot that is just like that the board has no role in that Facilities Management facilities naming payroll Administration some benefits stuff just a lot of detail but I do have to say the facilities thing but there's nothing that makes it black and white there's nothing that makes it impossible for an issue to come to us if someone really strongly feels like it needs to but I am large

[00:54:00]
but it seems like the burden then really was on just how much time we would spend reviewing those 69 of them because if they had to come in and just make a change because there was a change in staff or changing wording has changed because I feel like we were bogged down looking at a ton of procedural directives that made no sense cool that's exciting he is always exciting are there any other questions about the government's policies which were and that's very much related to our board procedure manual so our next item for discussion is agenda item 5B which is the update on the board procedure manual so remember Jackson I will turn to you for that update you have the form okay

[00:55:00]
so I mean yes it was very exciting right to review so basically I'll just kind of give you the background give you the process hop in whenever I'm missing something but the background basically is that we were given the directive to review all the board policies and so those are all of the B policies as well as the associated procedures that are attached to that and we were tasked with the same thing of is this is this board work or is this administrative work and so what we then did is put all of the we put everything into a document and so I'll kind of go through the process because I think it's important to understand how how this came to be so first of all both boards and I we read through all the bee policies and all the procedural directives

[00:56:00]
we were then given a template from the Council of great City schools for the joyful school district and to use as an outline and thankfully are lovely board Services director over there took all of our policies and procedures and helped us by inserting all of them into the template that we were given from the great City Schools one thing that I did is I went out to other districts I went to Houston at Atlanta Fort Worth panelist County Des Moines and others to see what their board operating procedure with their board operating manuals looked like just so that we so that I could get into my head what it is that we were actually doing because the direction was sometimes a little not direct I would say so I had to go look at others to see what we were supposed to be doing and the document

[00:57:00]
so we inserted all the policies and procedures under four categories goals guardrails delegation and governing then what board member Dominguez and I did was we started going through those documents and deciding between the two of us if the policy should stay under those headings if they should move to a different place if they should be edited if they should be eliminated all together sometimes they were eliminated because they were redundant sometimes they were eliminated because they were actually administrative and shouldn't be in our manual because this is a manual for us and how we are supposed to operate we also had to decide how we were going to incorporate the Council of great cities schools materials into our document so that we could more aligned with sosg government the sosg governance structure

[00:58:00]
and that is why you got you'll see in the text that you guys should all have sorry I mean document not text but you'll see different colors and so black was what Josefina and I is a committee added to the document if it's in read the text came directly from our policies or procedures and you'll also know that if they are in red they are our policies we did not change any of the language in the red text because that would require a change to our policy so you'll see that there are suggestions like she's very good about the passive voice and about noticing the passive voice and we have passive voice in a lot of our policies but we deliberately didn't change it because if we want to change out of the passive voice it's going to

[00:59:00]
change to the the grammar and then blue text was pulled directly from Council of great City Schools language or things that are coach had added as suggestions so if it's blue it's cancel great City Schools so then after after both of us edited we put it into one final document and we sent it to you guys so that you could see the see the editing that the final editing we did we didn't burden you with all of the editing did you see all the editing that we did you could see where it's flagged where we need to continue for more discussion as the board and I think that is all for the process do you have anything to add

[01:00:00]
Eddie world it was hard to go from the template that was given to us right right and then go back and forth back and forth but it was it was good in that it had to focused on this new approach so I don't know how you'd like us to proceed would you like us to just go through each section would you like us to know would you like us to just skip to the parts that required discussion yes I think it would be helpful to the parts that require discussion I guess I do have a question on process in terms of what comes next so would we need we would do we need to approve this as a policy of the board the manual

[01:01:00]
well so tonight but in general yes yes so yes we this will eventually be approved as a policy for a manual when when suggestion that I have just right off the bat is it's called a board procedure manual I honestly feel like that's like a misnomer because we were just talking about how procedures are not really our venue I would suggest we change it to board governance manual or board operating manual or something like that just to clarify but sorry yes your question is yes this will eventually become policy moving forward and I like the idea of calling it a governance manual because that is the focus in terms of process that I think it sounds like we are basically treating this as first read and then we'll have conversation discussion edits for a month it would come back for the next street for the September Pol

[01:02:00]
play committee meeting additional edits acceptances and everything there and then it would go on consent to approval for on a consent approval to the September board meeting correct that would be the process potentially if we stick with all of our deadlines yeah and and just something to tag for the future if there are changes to this document that then require changes to policy we're going to have to fly that because it will will have to change change that but that's a cascading event that we don't have to worry about right now I see it real similar to like you know just for kind of like for a comparison it's like the student handbook you know where it gets reviewed and then if there's like things that that change because there are things that could change also as the board changes because I think they're you know there will be new members or there will be new directives or things that you're doing so it does what I

[01:03:00]
Stan from the s o f g approach is that on a continuous quality improvement approach is to also continuously review our operating procedures and not procedures or are governance manual or whatever it is so it might be one of those things that's just going to be done on an annual basis just then if there's no changes there's no changes and just adopt it so it sounds like it could just be adopted through a regular board meeting could also be incorporated as baby perhaps as an annual review of the boards when we do an annual assessment of like our performance or re-evaluation we can also look at that and suggest changes at that time okay so we're clear on the process I know we had a chance to review in advance and some folks sent in questions concerns and areas for discussion so you're going to walk us through now what it is that we need to discuss yes so and and some of them were pre flagged by myself and board member domingue

[01:04:00]
so we did we got one question is it relates to the conflict of interest policy so may I say something about the conflict of interest do you want to just go straight there I was trying to stay with him okay so the first that I that comes up is that was flagged for discussion is the board accountability process underneath its on it's under the governing policies it was flagged for discussion flag this section for discussion the board will monitor its process and performance and will regularly conduct formative self-evaluations

[01:05:00]
City Schools recommendation as you're just trying to see if we're okay with this around annual summative self-evaluations formative self-evaluations and then the time frame around 45 days prior to the annual superintendent evaluation yes which is in annually around the world and 45 days prior would be January and we have a new board typically coming in in January it might be with this particular board is to do that with ourselves maybe at the end of the year you know so like

[01:06:00]
our last board meeting of the Year something to our annual evaluation then but I mean cuz the super I know it's really going to be really lucky because you guys will have that new reason that they're recommending 45 days prior to the superintendent's evaluation I think it was just I mean so that we are all on the same page before we go in for an evaluation I mean I I just pulled it directly from the document so I think we're acknowledging that we agree with the essence of the maybe the timing might be an issue so maybe we might move that to the end of the calendar year to be done in December but we can continue to Noodle on that one and revisit that to help me if we gave page numbers

[01:07:00]
that doesn't help people mine does mine does stop at the top on the on the top right yeah oh yeah it does bottom half of page 5 so what will do if it's okay is while we're discussing these changes I'm going to flag it with comments so that we can go back and review it that sounds great okay so the within 45 days prior to conducting the annual self attendant annual superintendent evaluation we're going to comment that that potentially should be moved to the end of the year yeah just answer the annual summative self evaluation for the board would be at the end of the calendar year I mean it seems to me like the reason why it's there is that

[01:08:00]
we have talked about how superintendent can only be as good as the board is that we are in this together and so if we're going to evaluate the superintendent it's only right that we should evaluate ourselves first I think it's more just a question of the timing like if it was done in December it would be this board versus if it was done in January would be the new board who hasn't really right has no basis yeah so we will revisit the timing but agree on the commitment to self-evaluate prior to the superintendent evaluation right remember Jackson the next area for discussion okay next flag this was flagged by our coach Ashley and I'm just reviewing it because it was flagged I don't it's the board membership requirements which you'll notice two down at the bottom that we added if something

[01:09:00]
procedural directive we put it in there oh okay I'm so sorry the bottom of the page six so sorry about that so bored membership requirements you know that that's that doesn't change I mean that's just how you know there is additional down at the bottom where we discuss number six all new elected or appointed local school board members will also attend mandatory onboarding session that is new language how does everybody that's on page 7 that's on Facebook everybody feel about that I highly recommend it yeah I also and I would say Miss Jackson all newly elected

[01:10:00]
all right so right below that is this is kind of now we're getting into the conflict of interest so right above that is the governing values or as it currently stands in our policy right now is the code of ethics following below that now the code of ethics came directly from a procedural directive okay so following below that is the code of conduct which is policy these two do need to have a discussion do we want to include the code of ethics in their technically it's a procedural directive and also code of ethics this particular list

[01:11:00]
what's the code of ethics is also implied throughout the rest of the document as well as the conflict of interest policy however the flip side of that is does it really hurt to have a code of ethics listed out within a procedural governance manual so that's a flag for discussion what do you guys think I mean I think it's important to have it in there that's just my belief I think it's good to be explicit does anyone disagree does anyone think that we should remove the code of ethics governing values for and these are so because they're red they're it's just the way that they're currently stated correct correct and procedural directive which we do vote on because they're be right because they're us because some of these I mean I have concerns with only because I think it's like that piece where we should

[01:12:00]
be involved in so I mean I think we also just need to make sure that we're clear on that like for example the One support person's best qualified to serve as school staff and make every effort to ascertain that all employees are properly so you know so I was like that's not ours right so let's go with striking that I think there's agreement that we want to keep a code of ethics and a code of conflict of interest we want to review the procedural directive on board members which is the governing values to see if there's anything we ought to review that is not really our job but definitely the one number and right now but the committee will also go back through with that one yeah and so and the question becomes it's like the cart before the horse right if we

[01:13:00]
remove it from here it necessitates a it just by default necessitates a removal from the procedural directive so I think we're okay with right so so I'm going to just comment there that that that that this will be removed and I did ask for clarification around number nine refuse themselves matters involving individuals directions to see if there's anything that needs to come out if so that'll have to be approved by vote and blah blah blah all that stuff so on conflict of interest I know there's some discussion needed on number nine member Jackson was there anything else that you wanted to frame about

[01:14:00]
which is what we're about to discuss come straight off of the s o f g manuals in regards to our self-evaluations where we're trying to get as many points as possible so that's where this that's why this is in here you know the red language is our it is our current conflict of interest policies so we can see that there is a note that that language we are going to have to kind of have an attorney in analysis on that like what does that actually which is this actually mean as far as you know when do you have to

[01:15:00]
it's a discussion that we need to have for sure but it is suggested sosg policy so there's the question around what does it mean in terms of the specifics around individuals or organizations who made campaign contributions is it everybody who contributed is it a certain threshold how do we know what that's the just of the questions but before we get into that I just want to make sure like is everyone okay with adding something like nine if we work out some of these details I think I'm okay with adding language around recusal because I think that requires a personal Integrity then because if you've disclosed and you know that you need to recuse you should yeah because I think there's a I mean there's a thing around the whole conflict of

[01:16:00]
best and that disclosure piece if you sign that and you say I have a vested interest in this particular thing and it's impacting then the Integrity falls on that individual this one I'm a little because this is a directed recusal on a specific action around individuals or organizations who made campaign contributions which I think kind of makes it a little bit I think that that's a little harder for me and I brought this up with Ashley and in her explanation she delved into a more layered conversation it's not so cut and dry so it was an explanation about or discussion around

[01:17:00]
so it would be helpful to have her as well as an attorney at a follow-up discussion on these two so I think we can definitely have a follow-up discussion and we can clarify what we mean but I think there's still maybe some hesitancy around including nine at all the refusal from matters involving campaign contributions is that what I'm hearing from I don't I mean I kind of agree with board member Montoya Court of I think there is an expectation of Integrity I mean I it it's been stated you know if if the Realtor Association showed up here and one is something done I'm pretty sure there would be an expectation that I would recuse myself but you know if it's you know and on

[01:18:00]
so I don't know if there needs to be a monetary level you know I mean if I mean let's be honest everybody you know you stated in the paper this is the the realtor person but what if they only give me 100 bucks you know I mean what if it might be wise it might be wise to you know have a statement again I think it would be very helpful to have our coach and Consultants so I'm just so I think we're in agreement that we want more guidance more advice more support and we need to consider what's the level in which situations which types of organizations so get into the weeds but I think we're open to having a conversation it sounds like around

[01:19:00]
who's this and so for the purpose of further deliberation and conversation with the coach and maybe other school districts and our legal counsel what else do we want to clarify besides the like threshold for the amount matters involving what that means and then individuals and what types of organizations are there other things that we want to clarify and I know remember Peterson has been trying to get it so is there anything else well yeah I mean I think it definitely needs to be clarified legal rights and legal restrictions that go along with this so for instance and I did have a conversation with Ashley and I think it would help to have a more in-depth conversation with her that for instance because I know there are people on the sport who would strongly feel I should not have voted for instance on the ATF contract and I don't think

[01:20:00]
maybe I'm reading things into it but I think that's probably a true statement but unions just like Realty Realtors just like any other number of organizations have different different roles and different portions of their organization so for instance unions have a political action committee those that money is raised voluntarily it is not completely separate money that is voluntarily contributed into it is not it has nothing to do with juice it is separate from juice for instance and that legally that puts it in the same relationship as any 5013 versus 5014

[01:21:00]
when's the political entity ones in educational entity and so any one of us on this board you know we all have we all have our district constituents we all have people who have supported us in one way or another because they believe in our position they believe in the policies that we would support you know whether it's Mom's for liberty or the ACLU whether it's the Realtor Association or the Carpenters Union every one of us has some kind of belief system that aligns with some organization that would that would put it conflict of interest if it's not fear and at the same time as absolutely make a board nonfunctional for actually caring issues of

[01:22:00]
of seriousness and concerned so I think that I think that the conversation with Ashley would be really helpful just so that we all have Clarity over what is it that we're talking about and that it's not to mute someone but it's rather to make sure and and in my conversation that's why I hopefully we do have one every conversation with Ashley that that's different from saying you vote for this and you will receive x amount of money or I own the Paper Supply and so working to have a contract with that paper Supply Company those are two very different things so we can definitely have the conversation now I think that there has been concerned raised and so it sounds like the an appropriate next step is to include Ashley

[01:23:00]
play in our next hopefully policy committee meeting and in the meantime get some information get some clarification I think the things that we want to clarify are what is matters involving so like what types of issues would we be talking about it's different from the business interests piece which member Montoya Cordova spoke to which comes up in our conflict of interest disclosure form we want to clarify like a threshold amount what are we really talking about here we want to clarify what we mean by organizations so started as an example and the cope Committees of unions so I think Union is a question too in terms of organizations I think we want to specifically asked about the collective bargaining agreement vote in particular like what would what would be the scenario around that in this context are there any other questions we want to try to send in advance to miss pause before we include her in our next meeting or any other questions I just need to clarify

[01:24:00]
on it or who appointed them I don't I don't know what that means so campaign contributions to them or who appointed them and I think these are this is language that is has to accommodate a national but I was appointed by the board right so like it could be a tip to your position you do something for me so I think like that's the intense or you could pick up my dry cleaning

[01:25:00]
just to make sure that I have captured the questions into the document we would like to have more coaching and clarification on threshold amounts organizations to include the union a CBA vote in particular legal rights and restrictions what is matters involving and who appointed them is that did I capture everything okay and to be clear it's a we're getting the opinion not only of Ashley but also illegal opinion as well yeah because illegal opinion is that's what matters in the end so it was an action step bar board services will capture that as well and we'll get that legal opinion do we need to have any conversation on 10 the proposed Edition they're not giving operational advice or instruction to staff members is everyone's cool with that all right then continue okay and we're moving

[01:26:00]
133 B any item listed on a consent calendar must be removed from the consent calendar by a member of the Board of Education if a number of objects to the presence of the item on the consent calendar this is in our current board policy which was why it wasn't changed but she's noting that it's in conflict with the

[01:27:00]
propose meeting materials process that we have listed above one of the concerns that was mentioned was any member can remove like is that something that we want to keep is that is that something we have a concern with my my thought on it honestly was we just reviewed this policy a year ago and so we voted this in we all said that we were okay with it but our coach wanted us to flag it for our future discussion or for current discussion well I think she's her concern was that we're trying to shift over to or we're trying to change our Behavior right so that we're reading things ahead of time and getting them on concerned so there is the commitment to the process with materials and the timelines there so I think the question is around this any member

[01:28:00]
just to acknowledge all so that we do have the ad hoc committee to look at financial matters in particular so it might help if that committee can just sort of maybe think through use of consent in general in the process and maybe have a conversation around this discrepancy between these two things and then we can bring that back to the September meeting as well I think that would be fair because that's where our consenting is probably the most utilized so that's definitely something we should look at that ad hoc committee I'm looking over top of Romero but we'll look at it then and then so I'm capturing that and as well this is current board policy so if that changes it Flags a while you're looking at where we're going to move next remember Peterson had a comment I'm sorry I mean I think I think it is important that one we used the procedure that we found out of questions in

[01:29:00]
and all of that in good faith into the best to the best of our ability that there are exceptions where there may be times when for whatever reason one of us feels like we really have to have further debate and discussion for clarity and so I think that there needs to be an allowance for that it does seem like if we could somehow clarify whether it's in the code of ethics or outright policy something where if we have had that thorough discussion if we really have had an opportunity to address an issue as deeply as possible that having the same discussion again probably doesn't make sure that we all have our voice and that we're respected for that and that we also

[01:30:00]
I have some some efficiency in our operations and I know and Robert's Rules and served traditional Robert's Rules questions can be reopened if votes are changed if someone who voted in the affirmative votes in the negative or vice versa it's an opportunity to re-examine an issue we've never had that level of strictness in our operations we've always been you know we can we can move forward we really can have discussion so I have no solution I'm throwing those out as soon as the issues that we need to consider so that when we do have this finalized we really respect both sides of that so I think the potential solution is consider what might be the conditions under which these things happen so I think the committee will consider that and bring forth some recommendations

[01:31:00]
so could it be that someone who is taking someone off of consent calendar a thought or I'd say a request to be because I do want to debate the issue in open in an open discussion rather than just the fact that we've had it just on the notes I mean because but at the same time I don't want to get ourselves caught up in all of that because we've gone back and forth with notes we see it there so or is it just removing it I mean so it's like it's like you said what are the conditions for removing something off of consent especially if there's been like a dialogue that's already been happening there's not going to be a different dialogue that's going to occur so is it just like unless there's something we can agree to consider all that and maybe clarify with some conditions okay and maybe it doesn't have to be involved in policy to

[01:32:00]
14 and so this is kind of a joint discussion between the board and board services so again pulling this straight from sfg this is the board meeting material process where 14 days before a board meeting the superintendent will provide the items to be considered this was flagged in discussion with word Services because 14 days right now is aspirational is that what the correct okay 140 so the question then becomes with input from board services do we keep it at 14 days to keep that aspiration do we reduce it in the manual and then this is something that we addressed in a year as we've become much more efficient thoughts

[01:33:00]
I mean I I like the 14 days but like we can look at what happened tonight and we didn't all we didn't have the revisions even though you know we got for a few weeks ago I think we got all the policy stuff but we didn't really get the revisions so this is just not pertaining at all to the revisions because it would have been helpful to have that all put together and we didn't so that's just a concern sometimes it may tonight go I mean take a little bit longer than if we would have had it in our packet two weeks ago so we're after at least after we had a chance to do our changes matter so there's there's a couple of issues there one issue of revisions versus the first documents coming so I think I'd be helpful just to get any insights from board services around remember Jackson's Jackson's question should we keep it as 14 days or should we

[01:34:00]
change it to 10 days or whatever for now and then as we progress we can change it back so Madam chair right now we're 7 days for regular board meetings in about 10:00 for committees the 14th is very aspirational right now but we are trying to move in that direction so at 10 feel better mine I just hate if we don't make 10 what happens often is something gets out at the last minute and that's where it gets a little tricky for us and we had so it's a mindset it's a mind shift right we have to get people used to have to get him used to getting their documents in early and that's not something they'll get used to today so I was

[01:35:00]
I'm going to suggest that I mean we just keep it as 14 cuz it's aspirational because we are doing evaluations on ourselves so then it's not it's not a horrible thing I mean but it's just like then we start to sort of look at like how how many times have we gotten close and you know where are we going but if we're just going to keep it there and then just you know cuz then we could start to look and we could start to identify what the challenge is are for our board Services office because it's you know it's kind of like I don't want to move the bar because I think we keep the bar but we just keep seeing how close we get to the bar it's the same thing we're doing with our goals and our guardrails keep the bar and then we just kind of see where we're going because we're going to have to I think we're going to have to just be aspirational in in everything we do but it's not a horrible thing it's not about gotcha governance it's on about oh you bad people but it's really about also helping us to identify where a challenges lie

[01:36:00]
and the places where improvements have been made and we celebrate places where it is getting better where the where the challenges still lie I'm seeing lots of nodding to that so I think keeping with the goal of 14 and then sort of monitoring for continuous Improvement I know member Peterson wants to get in there yeah the only thing I have to add to that is that this is when we create our governments it's stuff that we as board members can control and I think the only difference with this is the and I say this is a former set chair where as a chair suddenly your responsible for within a very limited number of days collecting all of the materials from other people and when you start having to collect other materials from other people they don't always have the same urgency I mean something that you work on it something

[01:37:00]
you keep working on improving but that it's not something that's directly in our control or Johannes control because there are 100 people in this building that sometimes have a role to play in getting that to her and sometimes they're really legitimate reasons sometimes there are just not being used to it and not having that that serve systems set up so I don't have it I think this is partly in line with the broader changes to board governance overall so if we're cutting 60% of our policies then we are having ideally 60% less materials that have to be prepared by different departments to come to us if we're having a conversation around and what goes to consent versus not then we're potentially cutting some stuff too so I think putting it in the holistic View and acknowledging that there's a mindset shift it's a behavior shift there's a lot of things that need to happen but I think there's

[01:38:00]
which includes 14 days before meeting deadlines and all of these other things so I think for the problem for the purpose of moving forward on this tonight there's lots of nodding on keeping with the goal and figuring some ways to track I think there was conversation to around this issue of additional materials or docs added and when revisions come through I think there have been examples of many of us missing those emails and those one off so I think that's another thing that we can work to improve and I and I know we're changing our software and other stuff as well so that will just fly all so is there anything else around the board meeting materials piece before we move ahead and acknowledging that other comments and questions we can continue to share that I think from the administration side to with the monitoring calendar I think the 14 days is much more doable like if we focus on the

[01:39:00]
14 days for that part of the monitoring calendar then acknowledging that there's always like Miss King said last minute things that have to be added to certain board agendas but in the evaluation of how we did I think looking at how well we met the 14 days for the monitoring calendar really helps us as a staff be able to calendar 14 days in advance so we have two more so moving to page 17 and I'm sure as you notice as you were reading through the procedural manual there were three sections where there were grievance there were there were ways to bring forth the Grievances and the last one is non superintendent employee performance concerns and so there were grievance policies throughout there is a suggestion

[01:40:00]
that we include all of those grievance procedures into a policy so I've noticed there hasn't been any discussion on the grievance procedures that are that were incorporated into here so I'm assuming that there is agreement on them but I'm just flagging the need to potentially create a policy that corresponds or I guess if this is the if we adopt this entire thing and naturally becomes the policy right okay so maybe we don't need to I just talked myself out of more work and you discussion no okay so sorry I missed a big a big one and it's the board guard rails and I'm going back to the page so it's on it's at the bottom of page five

[01:41:00]
which did want us to have a discussion around guardrails for the board the guard rails that I that we posted into here again they're pulled straight from sosg our coach wanted us to discuss are these guard rails for the board sufficient enough for us if you click click on it and then if you look at the the coaching that's attached to it these are common boilerplate guardrails she would not necessarily recommend them for us she would suggest that we have guardrails the the process would begin with identifying what behaviors are bored our board finds it to be more difficult to be successful and then adopt those as guardrails some suggestions are guard rails for this

[01:42:00]
around acting on individual Authority not offering advice to staff and Performing or appearing to perform the responsibilities of the superintendent but that should be a conversation for the full board so you know I think that I don't think this is going to be hammered out today right obviously and I think it's something that we need to think about do we want to get more specific on guardrails for the board besides these three that are in sosg materials so it looks like people are ruminating my answer would be yes it was after reviewing some other boards so as an example the board will not conduct its duties without including students families teachers and

[01:43:00]
community members inclusive of those that speak languages other than English in a manner that inspires broad Community ownership of board policy that's an example of a guardrail from another District another example the board will not support recommendations or policy that contribute to Historic patterns of disproportionate discipline so there's I think the board will not allow five years to pass without an equity I think there's other examples of things that we might want to commit to based really on what we heard from the communities values and guardrails themselves I think in particular the one around committing to not acting with output and feedback from community members so I just put those on the table as I thinking through what additionals on top of the three that cancel great City Schools proposed because I agree with those but I think there's some other things that might be important to our community as well so I don't know if others have had a chance to ruminate more and have other opinions or discussion I agree with you

[01:44:00]
because I'm looking at these I mean like the first two to me seemed really important the third one is already sort of stated everywhere else right because we've got and we're not going to violate policies and procedures or so to me that once like nebulous I don't think but I like the idea of going back to you know and I keep thinking about board member Taco with your hard work and our support kind of thing so what is a guardrail what are what is the what is that mean or things that we're not going to do to in support of those goals and guardrails too so we have to also sort of walk the talk here and what that means but I don't have any thoughts in my mind about what those would be but the first two I definitely agree with third one I don't think we need in their to Media suggestion because this really is our first readers discussion on this what I added

[01:45:00]
here is that the board members will bring forth suggested board guardrails prior to the September policy meeting and if we could ask for 10:14 days out from the policy meeting is when they should maybe be sent to Johanna you could you could kind of do what you do for everything else just collect the the suggestions and then we can and maybe that's something that the committee can do there's there's going to be overlaps in places so maybe the committee we can go through see what's kind of redundant and then maybe present a set of guardrails for the next policy meeting but that's great I think the way that we did it even for these guardrails where we sent in and there was a running Google doc and things just got added and so we were able to review and edit 14 days would be August 28th for what it's worth so we would have some fair amount of time three weeks come up with some ideas for first conversation

[01:46:00]
August 28th December 7th August 28th okay that would be like the end deadline so ideally you're getting your stuff in before that okay by the 25th okay anything else either well I'll just stop there anything else on the guardrails for the board conversation okay so I think we got everything that was flagged is there anything else members related to the government's manual that you want to get on the table for additional discussion that this will come forth again in September and then forever and ever always know just thank you to board members and Jackson incredible amount of work that you did on this one I think about how valuable it's going to be because I know for us

[01:47:00]
right now it's like it's a scattering of stuff we have to pull it all together and make sense of it but I like the idea of a manual that makes it so much easier but great orientation document for Newport News so we will finish before 7:00 because the last thing we have is agenda item for discussion is just the policy chair report so just want to acknowledge as your agenda says the next policy committee will be September 11th so this is just pushed back a week typically these are the first Monday of the month the labor day was the first Monday of the month so the next policy committee meeting will be September 11th during that meeting we expect to continue our work on our policy review and diet or policy review Peterson and I will continue that work and we'll be able to present fourth to you some of those recommendations for additional conversation will continue this conversation on the

[01:48:00]
the word policy manual so all of these issues that we highlighted tonight as well as if there's anything else that comes up between now and 28 if you want to send that to our board Services team we can definitely cover those two and then we'll also be thinking about if they're necessary changes to policy or procedural directive or board procedural directive based on all of this we can start to calendar out when those would come forth the next other policy on the sort of docket Amanda circle is the First Street of the budget policy so you may recall we reviewed a model budget policy from another district and started to talk through what were the principles and values that we would like to see in our finances and budget policy now the finance department has been working on that they're taking all of that feedback and working with Miss Martinez so we'll review that first draft in that September meeting again that's the First Street in that September meeting so we'd have conversation we'd have 30-day opportunity for public comment it would then come for a final read in October and then it would go to

[01:49:00]
votes in the I guess in October board meeting on consent or with discussion if needed and then just wanted to acknowledge just all of the the work that's been going on across the district and all the Departments and reviewing all of these policies and all of this work and as we the board are we thinking our role our responsibility and our approach to governance just recognizing the ripple effect that it does have on the rest of the administration so we're tremendously appreciative to all of you for your work and being responsive to that but also hope that it does help as well in terms of just your workload and how things come before us so definitely want to thank the committee members from the various committees that have put forth time on these things we discussed that there is a separate committee on finance that will be working with legal and the financial officer and board services so we will be looking closer at fiscal management policies

[01:50:00]
procedural directives and then I think just are sort of consent policies practicing practices in general so that'll be meeting as well and coming forward are there any questions around any of that I just would add that conversation we're going to wait until September to get started on the finance pieces a lot of it's because there's just been a flurry of work that's going on right now through August with everything that we've got stabbed doing we want to kind of stopped the Whirlwind so board member topping Romero and I agreed that we would start in September also gives her a break to because August is incredibly busy for for you as well I did send you an email if we could schedule that after Labor Day okay so we're moving on that great all right any other comments or questions so our next meeting will be

[01:51:00]
Monday September 11th in the John Miller Community boardroom of the Alice and Bruce King educational complex and live stream to aps.edu and this committee is adjourned thank you to 2 our meetings
