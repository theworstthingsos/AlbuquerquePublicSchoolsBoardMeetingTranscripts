[00:03:00]
English language arts instructional materials for Albuquerque public high schools this is discussion action item and I will actually turn it over to board member Mirada going for further questions okay so I know I got a lot of answers to we got answers to a lot of our questions but then that just spurred more questions so the first question that I have is I know that you all said that there would be safeguards put in place that would ensure classroom use so can you I know that you said that the boards and guard rails are going to going to help with that and that's what will function as the safeguards so is there anything else besides the goals and guard rails that will ensure classroom use the other

[00:04:00]
good evening Madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder as far as safeguards go it's looking at the whole process in general and making sure that all of our teachers had input regarding the materials so that they could have ownership instead of buying and and build that excitement to use the materials and so I think that by doing that as well as a strong alignment of professional development to make sure that they know how to use the materials all the tools that come with them and will be a much better experience for all in the classroom okay and I mean I I did see that there but I also

[00:05:00]
saw that I think it was only 20% of people that really gave formal feedback and others just gave quote some feedback so it's still not a lot I mean I don't consider 20% formal feedback a lot and then I also saw that professional development which I know or you can correct me if I'm wrong that professional development has been used in previous adoptions correct what was that that professional development has been used in previous adoptions with previous you know Ela material adoption I mean I I know that it has been so what would make this difference if it has been used before if that's going to kind of be one of the safeguards and it was my expectation that every teacher be exposed to the materials and I know that are instructional staff literally physically took the materials to every school to have the teachers look at them ask questions

[00:06:00]
and provide feedback and so I think that's a huge shift from what has happened in the past so that it's not so much the professional development it's more the what you would consider the engagement so not necessarily the professional development cuz that's been used before and it didn't result in that curriculum being used very right the process was not what it is right now okay and then I saw that Odell not sure if that's correct way to pronounce it but one of the things that was said it was found to quote be to be strong resources but I just don't see based on what because as we were told is neither of the programs that we are considering had any Fidelity data based on any districts I guess using the curriculum with Fidelity so we're picking a program

[00:07:00]
it has no data that we can really use and I'm just confused about why we would do that and the fact to not find any districts that have implemented it with Fidelity so that there is like no data whatsoever and then I know we get told what we weren't here the last time this was adopted you know I just don't consider that an excuse for not having really good materials for our kids what president members of the board superintendent Elder I will say that you are correct there's not a lot of data on Fidelity as a matter of fact Odell was not reviewed by the NPD but it has been reviewed by Edwards and I read those very strongly I'm also going to ask Tanya and Mary if they wanted him in because they can really give you the the teacher inside piece on why these materials were selected and and how

[00:08:00]
we started in Pare down to two and why these two were the strongest of of what was started out as maybe five or more programs there was a process to go through the evaluation to get down to two and then these two were vetted more closely and I know teachers also used sample lessons from each and gave me back on those sample lessons so Tonya or Mary do you want to chime in absolutely thank you for your questions so I guess to speak to the changes in the process and one thing that was really important for us as we work to revise this process as an instructional materials committee was including teacher voice from the beginning that's never happened before in APS so all English teachers at the high school level were invited to view materials and give feedback and the initial narrowing down of those two choices after that as

[00:09:00]
with materials and so that we did it during their collaboration time so they didn't have to sacrifice any time outside of their day it was all part of what was built into their contract day and and even though the formal survey results didn't have every single teacher's voice indicated it was higher than 20% and I think it was 20% for the initial review participation but regardless we felt like we got really great anecdotal evidence as well we also for the first time had teachers do practice lessons from both of those top two curricular choices and that feedback was probably the most telling for the Review Committee when we made our decision we were told by practitioners who did lessons from the other option that we had narrowed down to that this students found the summative tasks engaging they like

[00:10:00]
but the teachers had to do a lot of work to adapt those materials to make them accessible for all of their students they often had to adjust the order of things some of the examples they gave us were that vocabulary support was not front-loaded and so they had to like kind of go back and work with that diction in advance and not necessarily follow the materials they also had to create documents for their students because they aren't easily workable within our Google platform the feedback from Odell was very different the teachers and students both enjoyed the lessons and the readings but they also told us that they found the lessons to push them to really think deeply about their teaching practices and a way that they hadn't been pushed before and when the Review Committee heard that are our teachers could have really strong reflection just from being exposed to lessons

[00:11:00]
even without professional development that was really positive for us and it helped reinforce the feedback we had received from teachers who did submit formal feedback as well okay I mean I'm glad to hear that the kids felt like they were being challenged I think that's really important so then that leads to I know that there was a lot in there that said it allowed for Teacher autonomy for Teacher Fidelity and what we've heard from a tuned is that a lot of the choices that Educators have have made have been below grade level and so then that's concerning because the kids feel it's they're being challenged but then what's going to happen when there is that autonomy and how do you keep that from happening that they're choosing materials what you know reading materials whatever kind of materials that are below grade level because we know if you don't teach a grade level we'll kids can't get there so how

[00:12:00]
would you ensure that that autonomy that allows for Teacher choice is going to be at grade level whatever so we have really started to work to shift the I mean just with our goal our new goals for the district with the instructional materials a strong push for that and working with principles to build their capacity you know what what we've been doing we haven't seen the outputs that were really expecting our kids to be performing at grade level and so for us we can't insure anything I can't guarantee every anything all I can say is that we are going to do our due diligence to make sure that teachers have high quality instructional materials in their classrooms that kids have

[00:13:00]
access to them and that we're providing those teachers with strong professional development opportunities and and tying it back to if not this then what are you using and having those conversations as well so no longer just you know teachers can just do whatever they want it's not that but it is as a district what is our vision for literacy and as a district we are determining that so when a student is in you know 9th grade at La Cueva they have the same access to the instructional materials that a 9th grader at Rio Grande has or cable and I think as a parent that is that is an expectation that my kids regardless of where they are have access to the same grade level high quality instructional materials and when it comes to teacher autonomy you know yes

[00:14:00]
there might be another strategy that I want to use to you know deliver this lesson instead of what you know is prescribed but I ultimately feel that we we are gaining some strong momentum in our community around what are expectations are for our schools and our classrooms and that's what we're committed to so okay so then I know springboard was the one that supposedly wasn't used very well at all so was it not used because it was so inferior I mean there's a reason that teachers know what they're doing there was a reason they didn't use it and there was a reason I'm assuming that none of the administrators made sure or took responsibility for making sure that they were using the curriculum that you know was

[00:15:00]
I think in 2015 I was told board member Aragon board members in superintendent Elder I was here it was one of my last year's here when we started looking at springboard and at that time it wasn't a choice we were told that this is this would be your new curriculum I was actually teaching middle school math and it was going to be a new middle school math curriculum we didn't really have a choice at the time and so I don't know how much Choice was given when springboard was adopted and you mentioned the autonomy that teachers have and and the economy is not choose from grade level tasks that are below your grade level some of the autonomy given by Odell is you made this novel or this novel so these are Lexile level tasks appropriate to those grade levels and the South are rich in engaging grade level tasks so the autonomy doesn't come in

[00:16:00]
to that you can choose any book that you want there's a teachers did get a list of books to choose from it wasn't it wasn't a complete you know use whatever novel you'd like and so it was the so there's a little bit of autonomy but still the the control to talk to me so I mean I don't know if anybody who is here remembers back to springboard I think that's Barbara and I were here when I think we approved debt that you all are saying that you were giving like no choice that that was the only choice there was there wasn't a choice you said you have to use it was from your perspective and I don't remember that far that far back that seems odd that you know

[00:17:00]
we would just choose from one but then the process I know is Shifting and hopefully getting hopefully getting better I hope I still need people to take responsibility though the people that were here to make sure that the teachers are using the approved curriculum because it was chosen for a reason and somebody that is just going to say well we aren't here and it's just not you know maybe five years from a lot of you won't be here and we'll have this program and we'll say well then you people say well we weren't here and it's not a good curriculum either and so we just we have to get over that and people have to take responsibility at the school level for making sure that the curriculum is being taught at grade level and that's just something I would hope that everybody thinks is important for our kids it's like not difficult like teach what was approved you know

[00:18:00]
said the kids at Rio Grande are getting the same thing that they are at Cibola that they are at La Cueva and that's the only way that we make sure that that happens is Administration make sure the teachers are teaching the curriculum and that may be some of problems that we may be having we don't know if that is so the last 7 years then that a lot of people teachers weren't using this curriculum what what the heck were they using I mean I I mean I'm sure some people that have children

[00:19:00]
curricular resource at the elementary and then it gets looser and looser as we get into secondary and so knowing that data we you know again and establishing a new vision for literacy a vision for numeracy is some of the work that were beginning to say this is what APS does in our literacy Focus this is what APS does and stands for in our math and so I think again picturing that you know trying to tighten that up and ensure equity and access to grade level standard is a priority for our district and so I'll turn it over to Tanya and Mary if you want to add to that well I'd like to jump in on that because I actually really adopted it

[00:20:00]
Cleveland's won the Pops to mind Cleveland really threw themselves into the great deal of fidelity and they were beginning to show some good results I think some I think what happened is like what happens with a lot of initiatives there's an early burst of activity the professional development happens and then people move people change old habits start to think back in and what we have learned is if we're going to do this if we're going to bring in any because no Silver Bullet all right whatever quickly bring there's some that are better than others in the Joyce mentioned the group that approve this particular curriculum we have to have good PD around it and it has to be ongoing it can't just be one time and hope they get it because we hire new people people leave the district we're going to have to continue it and part of that one of the things we did this year was the same for example with letters is we asked the principals attend the administrators for letters

[00:21:00]
so that they could do what you're asking them to do they would know what they should be looking for in a classroom that is using those techniques using those skills so it'll have to be the same for them along with these curriculums that it's not just the teachers that are trained off in a room for a day or two principal has to be there has to understand exactly what they're doing that's where we can start doing the accountability measures and saying okay I don't see what I believe I'm supposed to be seen here and I know that doctors said it's impossible to ensure that something is being done but if we want to improve student outcomes or know that something works we have to somehow make sure that the teachers are teaching the curriculum otherwise how do we know if it works or it doesn't work so I think that we just everybody just has to jump on the bandwagon and just say you guys are going to use I mean as a

[00:22:00]
when something came in to my classroom new curriculum I use it cuz I thought that was what I was supposed to do you know so I'm just I don't know maybe I'm one of those people that just follow the rules or whatever I'm just shocked that so many teachers don't do that but I mean I didn't see it very much at the elementary level and I didn't teach at the high school or middle school level so I can't talk about that at all I just know what most of us at the elementary level did so what I would say to that is that part of the principal professional development is how to have those type of conversations with teachers how to support them how to help them get over the hump of trying something new I can tell you many conversations many examples where I asked teachers you've got to do more of whatever more group work you can't just sit there and talk the entire time it's got to be more and they try it didn't work as well as it should have some not going to do it anymore and you know you got to have those continual convers

[00:23:00]
it can be tiring it can be difficult but that's why you do the training I think when we talked about freedom of to teach I think what we're talking about is the ability to augment off of that Tier 1 instruction and we're just going to have to get back and really Define that and work with our Union to make sure that we are doing that and I don't think people feel bad about that when you get away completely from The Core Curriculum that's when we have problems more and more you start to slip and fall away and I've got this great resource and I've got this resource and I got this resource and then you're not using the initial resource and that's it's a slow progression and we've got people been teaching for a very long time and sometimes they say I've got all this great stuff I'm not going to do the new thing I've been doing this a long time those are conversations that hard it's different with the new teacher than is the veteran teacher but it's the same

[00:24:00]
say miss you and it's a that's what we have to work on I mean I know that if the teachers had this great flexibility these last 7 years and did whatever they wanted to do obviously that didn't work for student outcomes right we didn't really move the needle there so that allowing that much flexibility and we can just say look at our data it didn't it didn't work and I understand specifically that instructional materials you said were chosen specifically to improve academic outcomes yet we can't really say it wasn't used so how are we going to ever know if something works if we don't use it I'm just I think it's impossible even though we have springboard starting back in 2015

[00:25:00]
and you're saying there is no data but we can still look at assessments right that the kids took in 2015 and 2016 1718 even you know in her own assessments that they took so to say that there isn't any data there is we just don't know if it's related to the flexible programs teachers used or if it's related to springboard I'm assuming that that's a case but if superintendent Elder said there are some schools that really use springboard with Fidelity and if you know which schools are right if you know them then you should have been able to look at that data to see well that was working that worked really well there so to say that there isn't data is in my opinion not it isn't it isn't true because it is out there just probably take some time to figure it out but superintendent and Elder came up with a school right that used it just I remember top of his head

[00:26:00]
play I Remember Cleveland being very very happy and talking about it but that's that's we could go back and see how long they were Fidelity Fidelis along the used it and we can look at some data points from that I mean I just think we need to do that and exact impacts and you know my opinion are measured through observation obviously they're measured by interim assessments or by teacher assessments there's lots of ways to find exact impacts so to say that there isn't any way I know as a teacher that's that's not true just takes a lot more time because I think this assessments would tell us that the materials were not working and you're in broadly implemented I'm just going through some of the other questions that I had more

[00:27:00]
people took part in adoption process even though it was low and you're thinking that that's going to help with the implementation that's I hope it does I hope when people are gone that the people that come forward will remember all this so what I know there was something in an answer to one of the questions that there was that one of the good things about this is It's a shift from established practices so are you talking about using more the science of reading about using letters is that the shift from established practices like what's the difference in ela then and I don't know who answered that question but so either Tanya or Mary thank you for your question so I'm going to jump in just in case so Odell OD

[00:28:00]
what is a slightly different curricular program than our teachers are used to and for a couple of reasons one it's not a traditional bound textbook like they had prior to springboard prior to springboard we adopted Pearson and I think Mifflin and it was a very traditional textbook kind of like an anthology where it would have an excerpt from a reading and then reading questions like close reading questions there weren't really discussion activities built-in there's not a whole lot of student choice in the prompts they respond to for their writing tasks their discussions there's not a whole lot of independent reading built-in to help Foster those good reading skills and then when we adopted springboard Publishers were moving more to the consumable workbook style which is really similar to the textbooks with continuing on with shorter excerpts instead of full text and then just kind of Q&A springboard did building more opportunities

[00:29:00]
for discussion and critical thinking but not at a really student-centered level so Odell offers kind of a good blending because it embeds full text in a way that other programs don't and that they haven't traditionally so instead of taking just one chapter from a text or for one act from a play students are offered the opportunity to read a text in its entirety which most English teachers prefer we know that kids need that reading stamina especially at the higher grades and that they need that to be able to deeply analyze the text as well so adult offers those full text options they all offer options for students in a variety of ways through the choice of their writing prompts so they might all be writing and argument task but the program offers say five different prompts for the students to choose from based on their interests so they work with a reading they build their skills on

[00:30:00]
standards for argument writing and then the students get to individually select what to write about I know I found in the classroom and we know that research tells us that students who have some of that choice and autonomy with their own learning tend to be more engaged and the more engaged they are the better they tend to perform because they actually want to do that or not just forcing them to do it and Odell also builds in student Choice through discussion tasks allow students to autonomy me to step back when they don't feel comfortable helps teachers kind of work through some of those critical discussion type activities with students in a way that other programs don't typically support the other thing that we found really interesting about Odell as a Review Committee and with teachers is that it was the only curriculum that helps support students becoming critical consumers of text and if we look at our nape data and comparison

[00:31:00]
other places in our country and in our state that is one of our lowest performing areas are students aren't able to understand what is factual and not in things that they read and most curriculum will ask students to maybe review a source for research but it won't go any further than that and Odell offers multiple ways for the students to become more critical consumers of text and really think about how to pull truth from what they're reading and that's something that we know with our data that we do have that our students do need so those were just kind of some of some of the highlights okay so I know that this PD is going to be a big part of this adoption right so they're going to have a lot of PD it's going to continue it's not going to be just one shot at the beginning and then so it will

[00:32:00]
can you is that going to be a yearly thing that the teachers will go through how is the PD going to work thank you again for your question board member I can I can try and answer again so after if if we receive approval from you all this evening we will be sending out a survey to teachers to find out what types of professional development they would prefer what they would like it to focus on and then the Review Committee the instructional materials committee will be working to craft a long-term 6 year plan that we will also collaborate with the publisher on to ensure that that professional development is ongoing and meets the needs of our teachers something we heard every time we visited a school was that teachers asked for guided collaboration time to analyze the materials as grade level Partners at their site and that that time together was really important so not just showing them

[00:33:00]
materials there are and how to access them and how to use them but giving them that collaboration and conversational time to make decisions as a department because there are so many robust choices with this curriculum may I add something here at this point because it's appropriate PD I hope expands Beyond a canned PD the best PD I had was when I worked with Joe Culvert who was the 12th grade English teacher and we read Together made no sense to me until we did it when I brought in a Native American Author Leslie Marmon Silko who graduated from Highland High School

[00:34:00]
that novel I required my working with in mentorship with Ramona Nez and so what what I'm not hearing enough of is tapping the great teachers that we have in this District because I think they are going to be critical in guiding some of the newer less experienced teachers and while I appreciate that Publishers provide a general understanding of the material it's it's the experience teachers and we need to tap them quickly because we're losing them even the greatest

[00:35:00]
so I think maybe the last thing I have on the ELA materials is it said it was aligning with the guardrail high-quality curriculum and instruction and I read the Ed reports but I don't know how you can say this without having any real data I think maybe that's a hope that you think it's going to be high quality but I think that we're hoping it's going to align and that's the reason you're choosing it but to say that it does align when we don't really have any data I would you know kind of question that one I think that's it Madam chair and members of the board I do want to state that throughout the time it was coincidence I attended the

[00:36:00]
Council for a chief State schools and I spoke with multiple districts as well as other contractors who support schools for school Improvement and you know they asked you know what are you guys looking at as far as Ela adoption and I told them the options and it was almost unanimous that Odell was a strong resource and so I just want to state that it's not just our feeling that we think that it's high quality that we did some research behind that as well to say you know why is it high quality we looked through them I mean I even put my teacher hat on as a as a high school English teacher and I wish that I could have had the opportunity to use this kind of material versus the hardbound period I was expected to use so I just want to put that out there that

[00:37:00]
you know we do have a strong commitment to ensuring that these materials will be used in classrooms as our Tier 1 instructional material and supporting teachers through our constructs within the district to ensure that there's ongoing professional development and support throughout the years as we get teacher turnover to make sure we have some stop gaps in place to make sure that those teachers get trained and feel strong in the delivery of of grade level standards and make sure they're used when you come back and 6 years or whatever that you have data to say this was this was a good program so do your best I know you can't insure but do your best to make sure that Madam chair if I may offer just two additional points of information so one is there's actually a webinar coming up on April 20th which highlights one of the districts that is currently using this curriculum it's

[00:38:00]
who is Christy and they're talking about how the webinar is with their cni director and the professional development director and they're talking about how they rolled it out in the context of their district and how they shifted from having an implementation and I'm sorry an adoption committee to having an implementation committee and really utilizing some of that teacher leadership teacher expertise to do the Deep implementation work that you're talking about so lots of opportunities for us to learn from other districts specifically in the context of this curricula the other thing that I'll just share is that because Odell is a relatively small and relatively new curriculum developer they want more business and having a contract like this size will potentially help them if they do a really good job and so they are also more likely to work with our cni team to develop additional complementary resources and so to that ended as an example specific lessons related to for example the history of Albuquerque or local authors or Native American Authors so there's just a lot much more

[00:39:00]
customer service and expertise that can be learned from a vendor like this than one of the big Publishers and I think that's one of the things that we saw from some curriculum developers in if we look at Baltimore they developed a whole curriculum called be more me which is super awesome and so I just I'm happy to share the information on the webinar but I think despite not having any sort of RCT type of data there is really strong alignment to Ed reports really strong sort of support potentially from the center so with that I would like to move for approval of agenda item you consideration for approval of District purchase for the expenditure of English language instructional materials before we do that I know we had another question board member Jackson I did and I will second and then I will take take that time to ask my question and this is more towards the process that you guys have went through you went through and first of all

[00:40:00]
thank you for reviewing previous adoption processes to see what went wrong what right and so my question is have you started at like a codification process so that this next like as we move through all of these adoption processes and I hope to God you guys are still here in five six years if for some reason you are not do we have manuals do we have best practices to pass along would remember Jackson blood pressure and superintendent Elder we're definitely moving in that direction to have a standard selection process whether it's math or science or social studies that we come up with a process we know who needs to be at the table from the beginning how to request materials how to get materials and and potential lessons in teachers hands and so yes we have pages and pages on Google Documents

[00:41:00]
identify every step that we that we've taken and we continue to learn from these experience and we've been very fortunate this year to work with school kids through the nmped nmped received a grant and they hired School kit to work with a few districts in the state in a couple of races to develop a really strong high-quality instructional material adoption process and so we meet with our coach Brad every other week for a couple hours and then we once a month there's the the Statewide community of practice meeting and we've gotten a lot of feedback and support through this process and I will say that I think I'm going to mentioned it before but both Brad and the CEO of school kid has sent me a personal letter saying how impressed they were with the work of the team from the 912 adoption and even how

[00:42:00]
progressed and has changed and improved through the beginning of the K-8 Ela adoption and the CEO said that in a matter of I think what he said was in a few months Albuquerque Public Schools has is developing a program to become a national leader in instructional material adoption and I'm happy to share that email with you know I think that we would love to see that email and congratulations congratulations on that because the adoption process is critical write the adoption and then the implementation after that so thank you for making those key and necessary changes and you did mention that you guys are moving into the K through 8 adoption and so that that's coming right and kind of using the same processes on on okay my last question I think is and this is probably a more kind of

[00:43:00]
how does Odell pertain to like the honors classes in it is the same material used no matter it's just all Ela and then you have some honors you have some regular yes so board member Jackson with honors honors doesn't have any type of prescribed curriculum or standards which is problematic in and of itself you know sometimes it's well we can expect more from these kids or I'm going to give them more homework or I'm going to give them you know more assignments more more more more for honors so there isn't anything that's different with this versus an honors class besides how the teacher would augment to make it more rigorous however I'm excited because I feel like this is rigorous AP on the other hand does have different texts prescribed have to be approved by college

[00:44:00]
so there you know I have a personal struggle with honors because I feel like it doesn't have those clear expectations that an AP class does so I feel like all kids should have access to high-quality rigorous instructions but no it's a quick answer no okay okay but but this this is rigorous I2 so I'm going to work on that myself I think that that was all those were my main questions but thank you for what you guys have done and I do want to add that we are working to codify all of these procedures so that they're not human Reliant but system within a system yes sorry which brought

[00:45:00]
did have another question so do you have any feedback because I too I was really disappointed to see the 20% teacher feedback and then super disappointed to see the parent and Community feedback on the text that there were only about 7:00 that that came that reviewed so do you have just Top Line three things that you think that you could do as we move forward to increase parent community and teacher feedback so yes board member at Jackson and members of the board and I believe the 20% was from the initial pairing down of here's some you know options that we have and 20% was to pair it down to the two hmhn Odell after that all teachers should have had that opportunity okay so somewhere at

[00:46:00]
and so going back where am I what we're talking about parenting Community feedback no actually we had 14 people come to the 5th floor see an eye department and sit at the table look at materials 7 of those or more work for the health curriculum but that is 100 is it 100% Improvement of what we've had in the past in the past we've had open meetings and have the curriculum available and have I don't believe we've ever had a Community member show up and so to say like I was really I would walk in the office and go other Sunbury they're looking at books because I'm I was told that you can stay here till 5:30 or 6:30 but no one will come and I said I was there and I'd walk in and in the middle of the day at night people would were there and so it was

[00:47:00]
I thought that was pretty exciting I know it doesn't sound like much to go from zero to 14 that day that it's all about perspective so good okay but we have discussed you know what does this look like to get greater input from our families and community members and so we were discussing how we could align work with our principals to align like what is ptc's to have the materials there so when schools have their PTC meetings we can schedule that so that they're able to interact and we can have a greater engagement so I think it just comes down to a different strategy and plan to get greater family and Community but we're aware of it and are working on it thank you okay awesome thank you so we do have a vote emotion oh we have more discussion yes

[00:48:00]
what's the process and our decisions being made and so I really appreciate this is a huge step forward and I just one bit of clarification I think is really important that we need Fidelity to the standards the curriculum is just a tool that teachers use to get there and so when we start talking about Fidelity I think it's really important to realize that our students come with a vast array of skills of black background knowledge of interest and what's going to grab them inside is how do we make this curriculum accessible to my students and how do I show the Fidelity to standards not to this page on this particular

[00:49:00]
how do I make use of that and I mean a perfect example of things like glad strategies of how do we make how do we make language accessible to students that may not have that as part of their repertoire and how do you build on what their repertoire is and show respect for that so I am really impressed with the possibilities that this opens up I hope that listen study can be one model that we use because there's nothing more effective than grappling with how are we teaching what does it look like what am I missing what do I need to do better how am I paying attention to where my kids are and where that level of Engagement is so I am very pleased with the direction that we're going in with this adoption and look forward to the future

[00:50:00]
thank you any other questions board member Dominguez well I had a very specific question but I think I can follow up it has to do with vocabulary building because that was always the the challenge but I'm happy to talk with you or others but I want to Echo exactly what board member Peterson said you know we were the conversation and maybe it was an intended this way I think the larger questions were about culturally relevant materials and controlled autonomy you know I want to explain that when you're a midsole teacher and a high school teacher I always used the framework what am I what is the standard time

[00:51:00]
but I had choice and thank God I did because otherwise my kids would not have gotten The House on Mango Street or American hunger Richard Wright's autobiography about his experience growing up black in the South and yeah I took Liberties I did but my standards were always framed and so I think we need to be very careful about how we discuss this thank you

[00:52:00]
I'm going to ask for a roll call vote please yes so our next item for consideration is item fee which is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 this is for fourth year mathematics instructional materials for Albuquerque Public Schools and I am going to go going to ask as we go into questions and discussion if we could please keep it related to our topic and questions only if we have any comments we could have those afterwards with our staff but for today if we could just keep it to the question listed on the item so I will open it up to board member Miller article one for your question so my concern was I saw that a lot of these materials were

[00:53:00]
go to 18 years old like why that was shocking to me and I know people have have taken snapshots you know screenshots of their kids books and sent them and they're falling to literally to pieces and so what has gone on then we missed getting those materials for them for 10 to I mean goodness gracious it's a long time a decade or longer would remember to it and there's there's a variety of choices in some of our high schools they can offer up to seven different choices for 4th grade math or math and I think because

[00:54:00]
nothing's been vetted the focus has been on those first three years and not on fourth year and so it was very clear after the the math adoption last year that we need to do something and so I really can't tell you except that I think it's because it's not a single content it's a variety and it makes it it's it makes it an interesting and a heavier lift because you can't find any information on any textbook necessarily for a precalculus or a trigonometry or a calculus unless it's an AP calculus or so I think that's why okay because I know that you all did say that probably these materials that we did have were not high quality because you did say a lot of high quality materials could have contributed to lower academic outcomes so I don't know if that's something that just one person that

[00:55:00]
who's answering the question thought but you know that's that's concerning so do we think that these materials are going to be more high quality so I think that because they're more recent there they tend to be more aligned to come and core standards because they were published during that time after the 2010 I think that they have more built-in supports for students than previous instructional materials had in the past or much more mindful of building in supports for students with exceptionalities and so I think that they will be a much better quality than what we're currently using and the other thing that that we've done is in the beginning of this adoption teachers were schools were going to get money and purchase what they wanted and I my team really felt like that is not an equitable

[00:56:00]
play distribute high quality materials into ensure that students who may move from one school to another school can pick up where they left off and not repeat units and so we took an extra year to dig into what was available and make sure that we selected something that that was appropriate for any student not just what one school wanted or what another school wanted and just in financial literacy for example which is a very common fourth year math there was seven different requests for different and some of them were very heavy and algebra others were business math and so we really felt like we needed to wait a year and and make sure that we used our money wisely so a Calculus class at 1 High School 4th year math is going to have the same textbook as a fourth year calculus

[00:57:00]
implementation of the materials and there's no way I currently have we have two secondary math teacher support specialist I'm hoping that maybe next year we can add a third but imagine two teachers trying to support not only Algebra 1 geometry and Algebra 2 but then 7 to 10 different courses using different materials so this will help us I think provide better support to teachers and students and it is hard if you have all these different materials to assess student outcomes as well so that makes it but just to kind of speak I know somebody said that student achievement gains in the speaks to what number Dominguez was talking about in the previous agenda item is student achievement gains are more greatly influenced by teacher instructional practices so I think

[00:58:00]
whoever wrote that you need to use the teachers that have great instructional practices on the best that you can to have them trained people you know train their peers I mean you get better by watching people that are fabulous so right there I think that says everything a great teacher can do amazing things even with something that's you know inferior and I think we can always learn from those teachers thank you I was just I'll make a move emotive 250,000 fourth year mathematics instructional materials for Albuquerque Public Schools thank you perfect

[00:59:00]
Boney Jackson sorry next time for discussion thank you ladies thank you is Item B which is special issues this is an update on the fiscal year 2023 budget and pre-planning for fiscal year 2024 this is a discussion item and I have Miss Rosalinda Montoya who's our executive director of budget strategic planning you have the floor thank you madam chairman Elder I am here to present an update to our budget planning process next question I will go over where we are in the year round process our budget planning timeline the aps at the list of funded projects preliminary legislative update budget guidelines and the sample display of budget

[01:00:00]
consideration of the goals next as our time as okay so the year round process graph shows that the budget office sent out the budget call templates to the schools and departments we budget workshops and the legislative session ended on March 18th next the deadline for as our time was March 20th and the department store on the 24th the budget analyst or working with the Departments that have not yet returned them to us we did ask for supplemental information so it did kind of slow down the process a little bit

[01:01:00]
we asked that each portion of their budget relay back to the four goals set forth by the board and as we receive them we are compiling the budgets and we will get the numbers finalized and we will present those numbers to you in the April presentation our next slide shows are decrease in funded enrollment so we are funded on an average of our prior year 80 day and one day enrollment and these bars on this graph show the average enrollment for each of those years so both 8120 enrollment is 68,902 students and we will be funded on that enrollment for a fiscal year 2460 enrollment

[01:02:00]
directly correlates to our funding this slide is significant and that's why we always know this and as you can see this continues to the degrees our next slide shows what we are calling the Esser Cliff the green line signifies the 242 million dollars of Esther funds that has provided us supplemental funding to keep the district running the Blue Line signifies the state Equalization guaranteed funds that we receive each year from the state and that's what correlates to the enrollment and the peach line indicates are enrollment numbers for the fiscal year we are funded for 71,461 students which was the increase of 1.5% from the prior

[01:03:00]
here and but we have the supplemental as their funds of about 120 million if we divide the funding and half for the two fiscal years we will be using this funding as we move to the budget year that we were building now FY 2400 we will be funded for Less students only $68,902 a decrease of 3.6% from this year we will be funded similarly to this year so that's why the line because of the State Surplus and we're hoping that that's going to keep it a little stable for us this year so when building this budget is 24 year budget we asked schools and departments to be mindful of the goals and guardrail set forth and also to keep in mind that as their funds will end at the end of this next fiscal year

[01:04:00]
because we don't want any group you know lots of growth happening that we won't be able to sustain and so then in FY 25 budget the SR funds will be gone and so that's where that Arrow just shoots down because we won't have that funding anymore and we will also probably start to see an economic slowdown because of all the infusion that the funds have you know brought into the economy will be going away so it'll affect a lot of businesses that will affect a lot of things and with the state it'll probably affect our fuel you know because we've been using you see all those semi trucks delivering things all the time and because of the infusion Across the Nation cuz all of the districts have had these sorts and so we hope that it'll it won't be

[01:05:00]
a great decrease but we will we are planning for it to start to decrease a little bit and so this year we really are maximizing the federal funds to help us to be in a better place to handle the wiener years that are coming to our district so the next slide we have what we have set aside so far from our phones and how we kind of divided it up and so 91.8 million will go to what we call Our Calling unfinished learning 6.3 million to social emotional and mental health 20 million for technology initiatives 28 million for facility projects 51.3 million for safe operations of schools and 44.3 million to the charter schools and on the next slide I have listed some of the initiatives that fall in each of these

[01:06:00]
6 groupings that were listed on that fire page so they include tutoring Library supplies math curriculum vocabulary materials summer school initiatives glassware room well-being software therapist for Mental Health Services Network Security District wireless network interactive panels HVAC sanitation services and supplies and funds for the charter schools for their initiatives on the next slide we start to kind of go back to what about coming out of the legislative session and the funding that we will receive from these outcomes so in the highlights column

[01:07:00]
are the initiatives listed below the second column indicates how much the state set aside for the entire State third column is aps's portion which we are projecting to be around 23.2 8% and I have requested the enrollment numbers for each district in the state so I can calculate the correct percentage hopefully you know it all depends if some grew and some at a higher rate than we did maybe our portion will go down if it is if it affected everybody's enrollment the same it may stay right where we projected or if ours was less than other districts it might go up we're kind of hoping that might go up a little bit the fourth column is what we have cost what it will cost the district to

[01:08:00]
legislative outcomes and the last column is the difference between the cost and what we are being funded and currently as you can see at the bottom we will be funded 10.5 million under what it will cost us now we are hoping that our portion again of the pie might be greater than the 23.28 which will help us and we hope that also the unit value my increase significantly which will also help us because those two factors really say how much are portion will be so if we go down these each one of the highlights the Extended Learning programs the state as a whole has 2502 million we will receive about 58

[01:09:00]
7 or Kostas 61.8 and there's a deficit the average 5% salary increase to all public school Personnel is 139 million Statewide or portion 32.3 million are cost is $31 so they were a little positive then an addition there was a separate legislation that added an additional percent salary increase the inflation and health premium costs and the state portion is 2027.8 or portion 6.4 and our cost is right about that one was good the minimum wage increase for licensed educational assistance to 25,000 the state's portion was

[01:10:00]
14.5 million hours is 3.3 but our cost is 8.3 so this is a one area that we're really going to get hit hard and then Transportation employees 5% salary increase that's just for the transportation individuals that was 2.2 set aside Statewide or portion is 514,000 or cost $484 so right there that was right on the money and then the increase of minimum employer contributions for employee group health benefits the state of 31.9 million or portion will be 7.4 and are cost are 14.2 now there's an additional bill that had an appropriation for health benefits also which will give an additional

[01:11:00]
3.6 million so the difference is those two lines together but it's still significant and then are on the instructional materials and structured literacy of course we will spend what we are given and so there is no deficit there and we will be updating these numbers as well on our next presentation so on the next slide where is the four goals and I was just noticing how wonderful you are displayed here on the side and giant really big big big font but and it's kind of nice but we sent it out with all of our budget calls so that they could keep in mind these goals as kind of guidelines when building their budgets and by doing so we were able to quantify some of the following information

[01:12:00]
but first I wanted to make a note that this data that we have currently on this presentation is only about half of the school's reporting we're still compiling the information but we just wanted to have it out here as kind of so you guys can start to see kind of what we have done this year that's different so another reminder is just the school budgets are 0 best and that's dependent on the enrollment and the legislative increases so that's how those are built and then the department budgets are what we are calling incremental which means they pretty much stay flat from the prior year and just have the additional legislative increase on the next flight we start to see some of the data that as we compiled it so what these graphs are showing

[01:13:00]
how much the principals when they did their budgets we had the mask you know how much goes to each of the goals and there was also an other column and then they would justify if it was otherwise they felt it didn't go to one of the goals so like I said it's only about half the school's reporting at this time and so far for the elementary schools we saw that one that is pretty much where they put most of their money 26.3 million going towards that goal 15.6 million for go to 11 million gold 316.4 million for golf 4 and 7.1 million to items they felt did not fit into one of these goals and some of those items bowling into the other category

[01:14:00]
kind of like clerks secretaries custodial supplies differentials testing coordinator abortion of the principals duties a portion of the library assistant and that type of thing where they just felt you know it didn't fully go into the goals so in some of these they split it out you know 25% 30% went to this so that's how these started to fall out and it is our hope that as we go through the process with errs cuz this is just kind of how we felt maybe we could start moving in the direction that they will give us more guidance and training for both my budget staff and for the principals so that they can better quantify each budgetary item but I will say that the results we receive from the principles this year with minimal guidance shows that they

[01:15:00]
should not have a difficult time in transitioning to student based budgeting as they already consider the effect of their budgets on student outcomes we just haven't until now showing that in the budget building process so then the next flight goes on to the middle schools and in the middle schools 6.4 million to go to 4.5 million to go three by 6 million to go for and 2.72 other then we moved to the next slide with shows the K-8 schools and they spent you know mostly on one and two 4.3 million for gold one for 4.442 1.1 gold 31

[01:16:00]
5 or go forward and half a million in other than moving on to the high schools they spent mostly everything on goal 323.3 million to go 3 from the school's reporting and 6 million to go for and of course this is just our first attempt to line our budget to the goals as and as we work with Ernest we will build on a plan and training to better reach that goal of fully showing how everything aligns to the goals and then the next portion so on the next slide we move over to how the program side is capturing out comes for the budget building process so

[01:17:00]
capturing how schools will support you as a Martinez subgroups they capture any Cuts made at each school and they're captured how the schools are aligning their spending to support the goals at forth by the board of education so on the following three slides we will show examples of these so the first wide is Sy Jackson Elementary School and they have this little checklist and and these this individual School checked staff certified and other and for staff they indicated that they were going to put their budget towards a dean of students instructional staff interventionist counselors and Community coordinator and other stuff and then also on the other portion they put

[01:18:00]
room steam EA and then on the next slide is an example from of some budget cuts and from Ernie Pyle Middle School they have a little bit of loss of FTE due to enrollment which was an instructional Council decision and they will how they will handle this is they will offer less sections of each content area while still offering all the previously offered classes they also have some Cuts in Orchestra and chorus due to students having greater interest in Guitar courses that's an example of that and then the third one the next one is on high school and how they align their budgets to the goals through strong and instructional programs

[01:19:00]
such as Avid advanced placement bilingual Heritage and CTE programs and funding positions to oversee these programs and they allocated resources in the area of restorative practices and an intervention is to work closely with the early Warning Systems team to build upon the bank of social emotional learning lessons and this is just a sample of the data collected during the budget building process all the data for all the schools will be available to the board or at our April 26th budget presentation and with that I stand for questions awesome thank you thank you for your presentation so I'm actually open it up to the board we will just go down the line for any questions that we have related to the presentation and I will start to my left over with board member Dominguez so thank you

[01:20:00]
it was interesting to see the graphs by grade level or yeah what caught my attention was at the high school level especially on the heels of today's tribal council meeting so and it's just an observation I don't know if it's I don't know what to make of it but there's such a small amount going to soft skills go for and based on what I've been reading all the information we get in our emails inbox teenagers are the ones struggling the most pandemic and so

[01:21:00]
I don't know what that means I know that Manzano has the ews system in place and that that's helpful but not all schools do have those resources so I'll be curious to see how the other schools pan out yeah hopefully when all of it we may see a little bit of change there but yeah that is interesting and I'm hoping that when we have all the schools will also have both the program side and the budget side and with both of them combined we should be able to get more details from that that's our hope and so one final question how has the your training with a genomics impacted

[01:22:00]
find the preparation of this information that's a good question one of the things that it has really helped us to to just be mindful of is just to really not that we didn't keep the students in mind but just always relaying everything back to the student you know and so when we do the cost we're always figuring out what is it per student like in that even in that answer cliff in between you'll see those little red numbers and that is because we're funded about 11,000 per student so you can kind of quantify it for every student that we're losing its it's that amount and so in those in that particular one where we Quantified you know like the declining enrollment also shows what is the effect is so that first

[01:23:00]
this next year that we're going to be building the budget it's a 28 million hit to US 19 million for the next projected years 1819 and so it really has just helped us to really be thinking in every way out to bring it back to the students thank you thank you I'm born member Jackson thank you so I too wrote three exclamation points over at the high school spending on the facts I mean don't get me wrong I love that they're spending on proficiency and I don't think this is a you question I think it's a question you know I I know there was a funeral today

[01:24:00]
is it for a kid in El Dorado right if you and because of that I've received several calls and and again I've received several calls what are we doing to help our kids our mental health to give them the skills that they need to cope and it kind of it's a balance right because we sit up here and we say we want the schools to fund the way they need to fund and then there's a funeral for a kid and you wonder like are we doing what we need to do or kids so I would hope that we could think about that and make sure that our kids get what they need can I come back okay president

[01:25:00]
I'm struggling with my allergies so bad I can't even think my head is all clouded my question is just coming back to the analysis on March 23rd where you have it at 23.283% we kind of project low but then it generally comes back a little bit I'm just curious about where it tends to turn back the projections of the enrollment decline on page 9 where you had that you know the state general fund and APS is projected at 23.58% but it could potentially be higher and I know that traditionally has usually ticks up a little bit whereas where does it usually land yeah this past year it was 23.5 so it'll take up

[01:26:00]
a tiny bit it's in the points okay it will probably be 23 something so it can range from like 22 you know right now we're predicting about 0.28 but it could go up to about 5 and so all of that money in the first one and Extended Learning programs that's all just for personnel right I mean that's pretty much a Personnel cost yes okay I just wanted to make sure that I also appreciate the the graphs and only got half of the school's reporting so I'm so I'm a little confident but I think it does definitely tell us something you know in terms of high schools where they are terms of thinking of the social emotional side in terms of how they allocate funds to that I would imagine it's probably really difficult for them because they're all so looking at their personnel costs right in terms of what they're supporting and it's all towards the

[01:27:00]
the SEL side on the goal for side would all be all the other kinds of support that they would hope that they could afford would be things like more counselors you know things like substance abuse which tends to be augmented by our family and community supports Division I think that's where that money comes in or that's where those supports come from but the school itself is not spending it correct oh that's correct most of the mental health services come out of the department the only element that really reflects their counselors as their counselors so I mean technically supposed to try to hire if they wanted to but the mental health supports really do flow out of our health departments it's really dependent on building

[01:28:00]
what those classes that they need to build out in terms of yeah and the other thing that I like to point out is this is just the operational portion so of course you know there's supplemented like even the SR funds we have mentioned that some of them was for therapists and SEL and all that and so that is being supplemented quite a bit for this year and next year with the answer for funds of course we won't have that forever but there are other portions the granted you know what on top of that some so they'll be other portions to really get the full picture of everything you have to almost see all of the different funding sources the you know and and operational so on the SR funds on page 7 in terms of the percentages and where we are and you notice at the top where we've got unfinished learning and socially emotional actually safe

[01:29:00]
operations of schools it seems like are we considering that we're going to be moving some money around into different categories or do we have I mean is this money that also just gets floated out to the school districts I mean to each of the school sites to supplement those pieces if they need it okay yeah well most of this is already you know designated in those areas and there are designated initiatives within that now when the next couple of months we only have about a couple months to really reallocate and move things around so we're really working closely with all the Departments or anyone that we've given these funds to to to to to you know let us know if you're not going to be able to spend it let us know so we can rearrange and move forward but we have a really small window to to Really reallocate things cuz we need to get moving on them so it was the fun so I mean I guess what my question is

[01:30:00]
unfinished learning your social emotional for those built into like site budgets or is it only at the it's only at the department levels and then the Departments are allocating it it's we have it kind of at a district level in the grant area and then we distributed out some of them like let's say technology or unfinished learning yeah is kind of a mixed bag so we've had to really distributed out to like cni you know all the different areas and then they're moving forward with them so it is kind of allocated out into a bunch of different areas and so we that's been kind of a big job for us as kind of just keeping them all moving and and just you know we meet with Chanel and Joyce and just kind of keep making sure that everything's

[01:31:00]
on track and we're still moving forward with all our initiatives so I know it looks kind of low and that's another thing but it is all planned you know we have plans for it and it's just a matter of getting the purchase requisitions in place and heard a lot of that at the council a great City Schools it seems like all the districts were definitely struggling with that part especially just getting to that final push on the on the spending and there was like a request with you know secretary Cardona listening in it's like please kind of extend that deadline I know there's a big push for that I don't know that it will happen under this particular Administration or you know the way that it's set up right now but know that there was a push for that so hopefully that does happen really disappointed on the minimum wage increase for the EA's and it's falling so short for us you know that that's really disappointing do we anticipate that we're going to have to cut some positions or

[01:32:00]
lose some EA's or we're hoping to keep all our ears yeah first we have to get all the budgets back from everyone so I can see where we played to everyone that still has your budgets out there get them to us so that we can see what those numbers are going to be and then the second thing is you know we going to be waiting in the next couple weeks to get those enrollment numbers to see what our percentage is and also the unit value from ped to really know what our revenues are we're hopeful that some of these this funding will you know be able to some of it that's a little bit higher and some of the areas will be able to cover everything but until we have the all those numbers we won't really know what needs to be done thank you lots of great work really appreciate the effort that you guys are making in our finance department to get the song line this way so thank you so much thank you I mean some of this will be

[01:33:00]
also when we look at the enrollment and there may be do you think they're going to be cuts to staff though to anticipate that happening because of the enrollment eventually it seems like that you know seems to be the case like in future years down I think this year is kind this FY 24 is kind of going to be the Calm before the storm in a sense because it's kind of you know everything's staying pretty stable even though the Roman is low we still have that they're funds we still have a lot of stuff so we don't really have to be thinking of that too much right now we're not in the future you know 2025 2026 Nationwide they've been saying the Roman looks like it's going to continue to go down so

[01:34:00]
so when we're looking at you know all the funding with you know the are all the arpa spending and we're looking at a lot of these that we know are really important so we're not going to have the money from those funds so do we have any idea what's going to go by the wayside after 2020 for all right now we know that we will need to bring back into operational about 10 million dollars worth of expenses that we have already designated as a must bring it back so that's in 2025 budget and of course if the enrollment keeps going down and then the economic slowdown and no answer funds we will have to be making some tough decisions then and that's coming we don't want to hear music I guess

[01:35:00]
probably not I know that you just you didn't give an exact date cuz you probably don't have it but when you're talking about having maybe having to reallocate some of these funds so we didn't lose any of them so if they have to move from here to somewhere else so that they get spent by September I think of 2024 when do you I know everything's going to be a little bit different but when do you think is like the drop dead date that you really have to reallocate I'm saying when you only have a couple months really because lead times or anything that might change or just putting a plan in place for stuff it takes takes time so where hoping that we have everything fully designated and we've if they're not going to use it they let us know we can do the best that we can we probably will reverse a few of the funds if something falls through but

[01:36:00]
we are making sure that we get pre-approval from ped up front also because we do not want to come to the end of these funds ending and then realize that something is not allowable or we're not going to get and then it comes on to operational so we're being very Mindful and careful about everything up front so that takes a little bit of time to that's why I'm saying just we really have to make our final decisions in the next couple of months okay and then kind of the last question when I'm looking at the elementary schools and where they wanted to spend and the middle schools in the high schools and I'm looking at the elementary school so what I assumed that the elementary did is they didn't look at the goal and go okay go to is just about 8th graders they looked at it that this is about math for elementary right I'm assuming that that's what they did

[01:37:00]
you know if they get those good foundation course it'll build later into math along the way is especially cuz Matt does build on itself and then I thought it was interesting that middle schools didn't think that way about Ela like there's like nothing there they just didn't have that same perspective and then high schools like didn't at all and that's why I'm hopeful that with ERS coming in and giving us training and kind of you know helping us identify like how to to Really identify dollars to how it can affect stuff will help with this but this is I think has been a great attempt in it first attempt and like I said just seeing the the way they did think about it I thought was was was great good first started so I'm excited about it

[01:38:00]
yeah with the high schools I mean with you know go for I think some of that is just having a little bit more information and education for them to kind of realize that we thought and the community thought that that was an important goal or it would have been put in there and so hopefully they'll be able to see that as well thank you though this is wonderful thank you board member Peterson additional amounts of money for the family and come and dicks in the afternoon calculated into the 23.28 it'll be coming in through the unit value so when we get that the unit

[01:39:00]
we will probably increase from what we have now and all all the additional stuff all the legislative stuff that's not celery related will be part of the unit value so it all comes through this little portion of calculations the big complex calculation but yeah it'll come through the it ends up being in the universe do we have a way of targeting it where it is most needed for the schools that actually generate that money do we have the calculation for when we're out of the calculation

[01:40:00]
they're all important and yet I think schools are so used to being in test mode in in hard number mode so they look at goals one and two especially in a bit with three and those are the ones that has practice says that's what we're paying attention to so hopefully there can be some real support or looking at Gulfport is being very foundational to everything else that's that's not unusual to make sure we can do that thanks for the work thank you I'll just build off the last comment by member Peterson's training because if we are teaching to the standards then we are teaching these

[01:41:00]
soft skills and those standards are built into the I mean so those girls are built into the Common Core if you think about productive struggle as an element of the math standards that's what we're talking about here in terms of resilience and so I think just sort of some understanding around how just use of instructional materials contributes to that that was one observation I had my first question is can you just explain a little bit more about the reason for the big Delta's of the about 5 million on the minimum wage increase to about 7 million on the minimum employer contributions for group benefits is that just they underestimated the number of employees overall or what's the reason for that yeah that's usually the case and especially in the EA's I think they they took what we had at a certain time we have to upload all this data to them at a certain point in time and so

[01:42:00]
it's just whenever we pulled it they're probably was less EA's in that at that time that we pulled the data that we actually had employed and then so they're doing their they start doing their calculations throughout the years on those for those that amount of employees and then we we have grown tremendously in our ears to help supplement the teachers as the teachers are you know their salaries are much higher and so I think that that's just that Delta I'd have to really dig into the data more but I think that that's just a quick also been a recruitment issue right I mean because I think we had a hard time recruiting our lowest paid positions so maybe at the time when the number one in we hadn't fully you know been able to fully

[01:43:00]
There's an opportunity to revisit the timing if this is just a timing issue or a definitional issue to make sure that we're getting closer estimates from the LFC or whomever on that and could it be a title federal dollars out of title funds that not going up so I know we raised this during the session Federal but I

[01:44:00]
pleasantly surprised that or not surprised but because we've worked with lfcn and trying to see where those discrepancies are and at least they you know in the regular salaries where we had had underfunding greater under funding in Prior years it came pretty good so we're getting there but hopefully we can get to a point where we're fully funded great so I want to Echo the Kudos from the other board members about this process and the improvement from prior years so it's really great and exciting to see it and even as we have some indication at least from about half of the schools of their budget alignment the goals we don't have any indication of the role of the guard rails and so looking specifically at two of the guard rails that are related to funding Garfield's one and two are related to the Equitable essentially distribution of

[01:45:00]
what is the role of the guardrails in this process because I think that's the reason we put the guardrail so if if a budget were to come in from a school and it says you know look we're deciding we're going to cut the social worker and the counselor and the mental health support and everything else even though we potentially know that that may be needed in the community how did the guardrails come in for at the district level to say no that's not okay that's not aligned with the vision of values in the community I'd like to answer that if you don't mind so board member Gonzales each school budget is reviewed and approved by the Zone Associates who were becoming more intimate with the girls all the time and we are actually beginning to see across the district people are interpreting guardrails in very different ways and sometimes they're trying to utilize them in ways that they were not intended and so I think there is the process beginning with people not just in schools but in departments

[01:46:00]
that they are they're trying to understand and apply those guardrails and maybe protect something and say well this is Equitable that I get to protect this and we're saying no that's not how it was intended and it was so if the school with your scenario were to come out I can assure you it would be sent back and said there's no way a couple reasons one they wouldn't have that type of funding control over those positions but to it's like you can't walk away from go for and and you got to have the supports to make sure we can create a safe and healthy environment so that guard rail kicks in with the work that the associates are beginning to do on their reviews and then it will do later as a budget steering committee this is our first run at it I think the goals are a lot easier for people to understand there's still a lot of people struggling with guardrails to be honest so I think of the two areas you're going to find us to be a little bit weaker there

[01:47:00]
as we begin but it's certainly something we have had a real good conversation with Russell Linda about a week ago specific to this issue with guardrails and and they're definitely thinking about it in in the budget office thank you my next question is do you know what is the average per pupil expenditure is across the district with this proposed budget this proposed number of student not propose numbers students anticipated number of students and how does that compare to Prior years it's approximately about 10 and actually very we have some schools like them some of the non-traditional schools are very you know it seems really high like 20,000 people and it goes all the way from probably about 7,000 people expenditures is kind of staying

[01:48:00]
is there a plan for how we might fill that Gap or how does did you get both both of those things were already preparing for this gap of course this year we still do have this but if we needed to and we didn't have that funds we usually would that's when we would probably go into the fun balance but before that or the cash reserves and so before that what I what we've been doing this year and everything when there's vacancy savings where sweeping that and building the deficit first and then

[01:49:00]
and I'm using it to build anything else that we need to do and this year we used those vacancy savings to start to fill the Gap then we got that additional funding from the unit value increase which helped with that and gave us a little bit extra which we're going to use to build our insurance reserves which have gotten really low so that's kind of how we work with that great to know the 1.5% is about the average that we've dealt with over the last decade or so and with attrition we've been able to manage the vacancy savings has been a large component of that so bad will be part of it will be looking at positions and saying you only have so many have to eat for this size School while I have two teachers retiring another usually works out and a lot of the money in that way that's great and that's helpful and that resonates and makes sense I think

[01:50:00]
sing a natural question from the community is sort of how does this relate then to the right sizing proposals that are also going to be in front of the board for vote and I know that one of the things that we discussed in the last right-sizing committee was just the cost-benefit analysis and fiscal analysis of all of the proposed decisions and so I think just in the context of our overall messaging and how we think some of these issues we've talked about the amount of money that could potentially be saved from rightsizing or closing schools isn't that much but I think thinking sort of in the bigger picture it's easy for people to like ask well you're closing schools but you're still in the whole what's going on so I think just sort of keeping all of that in perspective as we think about public messaging and just sort of use of taxpayer dollars but do you want to just Express extreme appreciation to to you and the team for this work and for your ongoing learning thank you thank you so I have a couple of questions I board member Gonzalez asked part of it but I want to make sure I fully understand the answer that was giving

[01:51:00]
so in terms of like loss of FTE and we talked about guardrails and making sure that we're protecting certain rules what what was decided in terms of social worker and I guess I'll direct it more to superintendent Elder are our social workers being cut from schools or are those positions protected under our guard rails social workers are funded very differently than other positions it's almost all title money there's not a goal to cut social workers however as we look at need you may have a large school that needs more support and so there may be some transitioning of social workers from one area to another well I'll ask a little bit more specific only because I think of the schools within my district specifically West Mesa where they lost a social worker and they have one that spends their time now between a middle school and high school and just seeing them lose

[01:52:00]
right now it's just doesn't seem like that's just I don't know how they lost the person I don't have the employment situation we may have an opening and we may be advertising but there are just like everything else there's not a line of social workers beating down the doors to come work in the public school so I don't know what the situation is and I understand it would be an attempt to replace it if the person left because they left the district okay but those positions will not be cut just for clarification continues to shrink they may I don't think there's any immediate intent to to not have some large social worker cut coming now okay I haven't heard of any movement in that direction okay and then I'm back on page eight when we talked about unfinished learning and summer school initiatives is the plan to continue to offer summer school at no

[01:53:00]
for our students continuing for this for this summer I believe that's how we use the extra money is the last 2 years and this is your last chance to do it so I would say let's do it while we can write I mean we got to try to recover as many credits as we can I do think we're going to see the first impact of of the pandemic on our graduation rates this year going to happen I've been saying that I hope I'm wrong but I have a feeling we're going to see it so we can assist kids and get them get them on in life and get it done free we should do it and final comment not question I'm actually going to recognize zone two I believe that's our Zone doctor yes we have successfully submitted all of our budgets and have turned them in so I'm calling out all you other zones we did it we

[01:54:00]
it's a great job Zone too and I'll turn it over Jackson did you have any more questions so and and it's actually great because all of my questions most of my questions were asked going down the lane lines so I think my question kind of Builds on the role of the associate superintendents and the budgeting process when we're talking with the principles and because you'll be surprised to know that I received phone calls when Cuts were being made at schools and so I think just kind of an overall question is and I had very specific questions that I sent along so they haven't been answered yet so I will probably resend those questions because I don't want to take up time on on specificity but in the discussions that happened with with our principles with his own Associates were the like where the schools kind of retrained on on how this process was

[01:55:00]
I'm going to go why certain budget why why certain Cuts were being made wear certain cutoffs occurred and all of that like and I guess if any of you want to pop up Zone Associates looking at you Troy just cuz your phone for what what kind of trainings were received Medical Center job in presenting this new approach and refocusing on the four goals and so we did an initial training with very detailed documents to help guide our principals and their school sites to make some of these decisions and then at that point the Zone Associates know where we're headed some of the things that were considering and their role has been to coach and guidance support

[01:56:00]
about this process when principles maybe have some questions like how does this tie to this like a goal to help have those conversations to to navigate that process so instead of the micromanaging what it should look like they've allowed it to be a natural process and I think we saw the first beginning steps there which show us there's some gaps so it gives us the opportunity to go back and meet with principles to to support them and to show them a little bit more to say well let's think about this a little bit differently so that's that's been my expectation of them is just guide support and Coach the principles through this new process yeah and it seems like it's it has gone well I would offer up that maybe the next step because I get the community feedback so I think as we move along again in this process next step in the coaching might be

[01:57:00]
and then how do you turn this around to speak to your community because obviously the community you know we love our schools alright we love what happens there and so we just need to kind of work through that messaging process from you know from you to the associates and and eventually to the community yeah yeah you're welcome and yeah just want to Echo thank you again thank you for you've changed the process and it's very obvious it's very apparent it's easy to follow I appreciate that you have given that you've started to give justifications for the budget optimization process so thank you I'm going to look forward to the April 26th presentation where maybe we have like comprehensive data I don't know if all of zone for Scott in their stuff in but
