[00:05:00]
Uniondale meet yourself please there we go 2 minutes when you begin speaking thank you good afternoon Madam president and members of the board and also I'm the chair of the board of directors of the greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce I'm here to speak in support of East Mountain High School's contract Amendment great leadership and students and his teaching are the keys to make sure every student has the skill they need to succeed in life and he's not high school has both of these I visited the school just a few months ago and I was thoroughly impressed with what I saw engaged students who are generally eager to learn I saw a science class working on hands on project that got them outside to collect samples around the school's property I said students gave each other thoughtful feedback to improve their arguments and I got to walk around in History Class where students were excited to tell me about the group projects that kind of confused

[00:06:00]
passionate and effective teachers and to see this commitment in almost everyone of East Mountain students is a testament to the culture there built by an incredibly committed team of Educators but even without a visit the school's performance data speaks volume at 98% graduation rate strong reading and math proficiency eastbound students master the skills they need for the future and so many of them go on to excel in colleges and universities for this kind of quality in our community and this cools long wait list you have to hear shows this we want more other cookie students to be able to benefit from the high quality extraction East Mountain offers and we asked you to prove their request thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Alyssa romaine and she'll be in person

[00:07:00]
then you'll have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good afternoon thank you for your service to our community and for the opportunity to speak today my name is Alyssa Romine and my child attends Colette Park Elementary I am here again today to express my profound concern about a new District policy that is reducing funding for schools like call it Park the server large number of special education students under this policy my child is counted as just 38% of a student in order to determine school funding I'm just disappointed and alarmed that APS has decided to implement this policy by law all students have a right to be free from discrimination the result of this policy is that the students at College Park will have less access to instruction in art music and physical education then their peers at schools with fewer special education students it will also mean that one special education students are

[00:08:00]
who did in a general Ed setting those classes will be overcrowded this misguided clearly disabled policy is punishing Colette park for serving students with special needs I asked that this policy be revised at the very least at the elementary school level it is fundamentally unfair and openly discriminatory to allocate funds in this way our school should not be punished for welcoming special education students the policy must be changed so that all of our students will be guaranteed the free and appropriate public education that is their legal right thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Katrina Garcia Spillman you have two minutes thank you I'm Katrina Garcia Spielman you've seen me many times before I'm head teacher and Gonzalez in a 55 teacher at Edward Gonzales in Kit Carson and I'm here to speak in opposition to some of the details of the proposed calendar

[00:09:00]
biggest issue with the calendar is the modified Wednesdays for everyone as a head teacher who worked in a school with modified Wednesdays for 7 and a half years this made scheduling very very difficult with the short day and the mix we have very little wiggle room for scheduling and it's hard for our students to have a regular schedules our students with special needs or some of the ones who need routine the most and this impacts them greatly also as a teacher now with two schools due to lack of gifted identification and gifted funding I have no idea how I'll provide Equitable Services to my two schools both full of low-income students of color I with the school schedule right now we have five Mondays off short Wednesdays and two Fridays and I have no idea how I will make that work in two half-time positions I'm concerned that the short Wednesdays will make scheduling a challenge for everyone short Wednesdays all so make it a challenge for families and as we heard it at Fred Council last night many families choose just not to bring their students to school on Wednesdays because they can't arrange for

[00:10:00]
we recognized already that the eltp calendar with extra days for schools didn't work and cause an increase of absences and I'm worried that the short Wednesday is especially the irregular short one day Wednesdays will just result in more absences if we are truly focused on the student outcomes we need to look at the effect of an irregular schedule that would have for gifted students and special education students because they deserve to have their needs met as well I would much rather have one day a week to stay after school for two hours for my professional development then have to have an irregular schedule thank you thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Marcy may be in person do you have two minutes thank you for allowing us to speak I have been

[00:11:00]
sing emails to our school board in superintendent very regularly especially these past two and a half years regarding various subjects the last one that I sent a few weeks ago was in regards to the videos that have been shown by project Veritas exposing teacher training that is basically telling teachers that they cannot even if they think that a child it might be good for a child to inform parents of health issues and this is in regards with gendering care and everyone can have their opinion on it but when you were talking about with surgeries that according to Chloe Cole who is an 18 year old who went through some transition and she is his quoted that each one of these surgeries cost at least one million dollars at the start this

[00:12:00]
put these children who don't even know how to say no to drugs and and things like that but when they are subjected to having their bodies being being requiring lifetime hormonal treatments that are leading to emblems and stroke and you can smoke all that you want but when it comes to knowing what the actual consequences of these the I'm sorry hormonal treatments that are going on any ask any woman who goes through their monthly cycle if they're not affected by these hormones and here we have artificial hormones that are actually class one carcinogens these into their kids and now when they start this

[00:13:00]
is procedure of their subjected to doing this Chloe called I'm sorry that's your 2 minutes please wrap it up in one quick sentence what I'm saying is that APS is allowing this to be going on we have not yet had a statement from the board regarding these videos they're being neglected and you might as well just put let's get if you want to put this kind of treatment in let's get some vending machines with cigarettes thank you ma'am our next speaker is Reginae told me last week I would be wasting my breath because the calendar for next year is a done deal I want to believe that parents needs

[00:14:00]
wishes are going to be considered when making the final decision I speak with concerns about the proposed 2324 schedule I believe that several of the proposed changes are ill-advised and others have spoken about some of them and probably others will speak but I would like to talk about two that are particularly problematic for teenagers one is the extremely early start in the year and the other is the extended winner break the issue of the early start is compounded by how late it has been announced for families a very short period of time before suddenly we will start again starting school on August the 3rd during the height of Summer causes problems for facilities and reduces summer opportunities for students and families APS has a history of having problems with air conditioning at the beginning of the year starting early

[00:15:00]
call strain on overworked systems and is likely to result in students trying to concentrate during scorching heat many students work during the summer to earn money for college taking an extra week off and already short summer paycheck is unfair to them others catch up on credits take additional classes or engage in various enrichment opportunities offered by other entities during the summer months these changes would reduce that time in there for the opportunities available families often schedule travel or visits with extended family during the summer Albuquerque is already out of sync with many other places in the country if we start an entire month before Labor Day when much of the rest of the country begins our families get cut out of a large chunk of time they might otherwise have to connect with friends and family

[00:16:00]
2 weeks is standard for everywhere in the country and none of the reasons for having a longer summer break apply in January given the alternative alternative job travel educational and enrichment activities available then two weeks off of school for winter break is plenty thank you ma'am our next speaker is that hill or Sergio Schwartz 2 minutes when you begin Schwartz I'm the father of four students in APS and some of you may know me as the community school coordinator at Rio Grande High I want my children to grow up in a world where they do not fear going to school where are swords and arms have been beaten into plowshares where guns are a relic of the past I

[00:17:00]
to feel and to hear Freedom ringing out in the Beloved Community for the dream of justice and safety to been manifested and to reality and deferred no more but I know that that's something that we're not able to provide them today what we are what we do have the power to do is continue to lay the foundations and equip our children and students with the tools necessary to truly realize a dream for future Generations the burgeoning social science service store to practices provide the most effective tools for today restorative practices and power our students with the ability to see how their actions impact their peers and community so they may become protagonists for the World of Tomorrow it empowers them with humility vulnerability and a deep and abiding capacity to see their neighbors Humanity as well as their own it empowers them with the practice and language of unity kindness empathy

[00:18:00]
love equity and Justice a cultivates an environment of safety and care and engenders hope in a time of division disillusionment and apathy I humbly ask that the board as a United institution deep in and reflect on the implementation and theories of restorative practices free from any Prejudice or preconceived notions I ask that you consider its far-reaching impact as you deliberate on the 4th and final five years old and as well as the the last guardrail thank you all very much for your time thank you sir our next speaker is Carrie Jordan you have two minutes once you begin speaking hi I'm Carrie Jordan I'm from the East mountains speaking in opposition to the proposed

[00:19:00]
first I find it very misleading to count Wednesdays as full instructional days the early release is not a full 6 1/2 regular our day the challenges of a short and Wednesday schedule already evidenced in winter when we have a similar time schedule for snow days with reduced teaching hours this change would ensure a significant disruption every week in addition to inevitably when it snows again in the East mountains my elementary Schooler and middle schooler are both on IEPs and we all know that that can mean anything from gifted programs to very subject specific assistance and sometimes time management type structural needs that last part in packs the classroom routines and learning time with teachers as well as our home from my children on short and school days in a way that decelerates my students educational momentum for the entire week every single school week

[00:20:00]
it's also affects the after-school schedule and makes it a social Equity issue it disproportionately impacts the working capacity of low income parents who can least afford expensive enrichment programs much less basic Child Care some middle schools May simply be alone doing extra homework that could be done in class prior to my children attending our district schools we were at an APS Charter School in a 50/50 homeschool program so we have first-hand experience with a commitment needed to be successful Learners with Homebase school work nearly six months ago my husband and I began to scrutinize budget and string together a whole Summer's worth of diverse educational camps swim team music lessons etc for both our kids it is unreasonable to change the dates of this last late point when so many parents have similar let alone maybe even vacations family reunions and other non-refundable events

[00:21:00]
can you please wrap it up in one very quick sentence that have just been anticipated in these past couple of weeks when we received superintendent Elders letter on March 16th until that point we were expected to be wholly responsible for this precious time with our children I hope you'll reconsider this scheduled proposal thank you thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on June Parker Berg yes hello thank you yeah I'd like to say that I'm trying to get to my my notes Here We Go

[00:22:00]
Garnet phone yes hello my name is Parker Bergen I'm a pair of two children at APS as well my intention seems to close the learning Gap it creates it doesn't create and other in attendance

[00:23:00]
educational enrichment programs are not free everyone of course has been anticipating the summer family time and many of the others invested in educational extracurricular opportunities starting in 2022 so much of these plans are largely at this time my family has 5 months to coordinate efforts to plan for our children's upcoming summer making healthy balance between academic and enrichments activities including music Sports art and family downtown here's just a couple of examples of advance planning I'm aware of because my kids are attending math Discovery Academy which is through APS gifted program and they began advertising this month long full-day camp on January 7th YMCA registration on November 8th and their final week overlaps with the first week of this proposed calendar

[00:24:00]
it is unreasonable to expect changes for this summer at this late date I know these that these schedule changes will not catch up our kids instead of the Gap widens even more I would really like to just say that it's about momentum and both the teachers and the parents you know strive to have their kids in that 6 1/2 hours every day I know my son being having an IEP 504 struggles and a lot of stuff to you I have to stop up your what you're saying in your statement in a quick settings please please please don't do that without like informing us first and having a real serious dialogue before you implement this thank you thank you sir for next speaker is Daniel

[00:25:00]
give 2 minutes once you begin speaking sir hi thank you bored and Madam chairwoman August 3rd that's a huge bummer I have a week-long camping trip in Montana that the kid it's either first week of high school or week-long camping trip with the family dang so I'm here because of Elementary science education so Albuquerque prescribes to the New Mexico State science Elementary standard that is the ngss standards topics Arrangement so science is 5X it's chemistry biology physics geology and astronomy now you all with whole teaching students to definition of an atom until middle school and then you complain that you have high Dropout rates that starred in Middle School

[00:26:00]
play the last two meetings teach the kids science they're interested in it but why withhold the definition of an atom until middle school when in first and second grade they can learn all about molecules and chemical reactions and polymers and biology and plants this is a debate at the state level because the school board is obligated to follow the state standards in the state standards are the topics arrangement for the ngss in page one of 102 page 1 of 102 for the njss standard you can arrange your content in any order that you so choose and that's okay really have you ever learned anything backwards to front cuz I haven't I start from the beginning and I progress my way down Adams they're the smallest thing in the

[00:27:00]
start their Adam's molecules chemical reactions everything thereafter is a derivation my name is Dan I'm a parent to students thank you for your time thank you sir our next speaker is Ruth Porter of 2 minutes because I haven't been cleared as a provider I'm not opposed of public schools open in early childhood education because that is the beauty of New Mexico New Mexico

[00:28:00]
Guillain public education give that service his Department's choice we are looking at the needs of the balance apparent can select any program according to their values and their needs so we cannot get that one away expansion the aps has in future plans that doesn't include 14,000 children at 3:45 schedule so they don't care about the needs of the family and the community

[00:29:00]
So the plan of my suspension is going to monopolize and is going to take away the beauty of mix a living in early childhood and we're going to go right now we are returning the nation and it's because Parent's Choice unfortunately K to 12 they don't have that right that will fix education but anyway that's another story Parent's Choice so my second point is the lack of collaboration so I have to stop there's no collaboration we had yesterday in New Mexico officials went to the meeting I was so excited but there's no collaboration thank you thank you thank you next speaker is Theresa Wilkinson

[00:30:00]
Tracy of 2 minutes hello my name is Theresa illegal and I'm a teacher at West Mesa High School I also in support of safe schools and I'm just going to roll into what action now has been doing but I wanted to re-quote Sergio I really like that you said Justin safety can manifest into reality but we're a long way from that I agree to meet on Wednesdays during lunch and our library some of the things that we've been doing is that we sent out a student survey to kind of gauge their ideas on what would make a compass safer and like many of us have been coming and communicating to the board we have 3005 responses and they said you know more security csa's and social workers we left the survey open still for more responses but that's

[00:31:00]
10% of West Mesa student population of about like 1650 the other thing that we've been discussing is the fact that Epps has a handbook committee that has been meeting and we are just wondering that when those handbook changes are ready if there is going to be Community input and Community review of the changes made to the handbook or if it's just going to be something that gets pushed through and like that we met here are the changes to the handbook and this is what we're adopting another thing that I would like to say is that yesterday we had Tanya Covington coming speak to or staff about restorative justice which is really nice because I think that it's a really foggy area for many people and how it's been implemented at many schools has been completely Incorrect and not effective and it is kind of been used as a crutch to say that we're doing it but we are not doing it properly and and then that kind of hits on all my points there and

[00:32:00]
speaking to the schedule I don't know how to feel about the schedule but I do know that the air conditioning really doesn't work in my building so and I was the winner of the hottest room 2 years ago in West mesa's Air Conditioning went out and I lost 15 lb in sweat and my room over 2 minutes wrap it up very quickly please at 90% at the end of every class day and it was like a state of delusion for me and you're going to burn teachers out thank you yes I am can you hear me thank you and thank you 8:00 p.m. school counselor of the year and I was very proud to represent APS and the state of New Mexico

[00:33:00]
Washington DC tonight I'd like to talk to you about the new calendar that's proposed and I understand this is a hard issue but it's something that really tugs at my heart I work in an elementary school and right now we go to school for 1,089 hours a year that's the time from 7:48 to 1:55 for students are actually in my building under the proposed plan my students are going to lose a lot of time at school we're going to have 152 days of full day and 30 days of half day which only totals $1,053 hours so sadly for kids at school at my school at Northstar we're going to lose 36 hours of instructional time which equals 64 school days my kids need to be in class more than losing 64 School

[00:34:00]
week of school plus one so we're adding four days to the calendar and I don't mind coming in early staying late having extended school year or whatever but we're heading for 4 days but our students are losing 6 days it just the math I was like holy shmoly it just didn't make sense to me so what we're doing is the proposed calendar it's sort of like 8:00 p.m. staff is gaining at the expense of our students please we are asking for kids to be at my hours we would love an extra 20 minutes a day does taking days of school of

[00:35:00]
okay okay please with our new guard rails and guidelines please don't take 6 days of school away from me please when you look at this calendar tonight I've been told it's a done deal I know the school board I don't believe that please take into hours that children are actually learning in the classroom thank you our next speaker is in person Susie girl you have two minutes for the students so increase

[00:36:00]
and on Wednesday only half day does not make any sense logically you know in terms of child care and education continuity is our problem there and second thing I want to speak about the reason the Undercover videos about what APS some stuff in their hiding information from parents about the you know the troubles or the problem of students have at a schools so 1000 say that last year when APS was organizing the community outreach events and to get in the important and to engage parents to improve for student outcome I was very excited and was very hopeful I was kind of participate in multiples of events but that looks like the other video showed just the opposite because of helping those vulnerable students who you know we work with the parents together some real help for those people who are

[00:37:00]
they're promoting encouraging gender transition plan for the students who need the actual help now another thing I want to say that seem like APS is openly promote this trans agenda because there's this flyer called a transfer me pride and that will be flyer was found at this building here so this very very concerning I have right now to to kill her 10:00 p.m. videos give me I'm very concerned so I'm kind of thinking I need to alternative for about to say where my kids to go for hire you know middle higher schools go to two minutes and I need you to wrap it up in one spot for the PS we're already in the bottom of the education and secondly you should be

[00:38:00]
what's your attitude do actually agree that parental rights stop when they send their children to Public Schools thank you thank you very much thank you our next speaker is Laura Vickers you have two minutes I work at West Mesa High School and I'm part of Action Now helping out with you know issues at the school meeting on our lunches and I'm here to ask just actually reiterate with which is please before you put out the handbook next year to get community feedback for that because we are looking at

[00:39:00]
our own handbook and we're trying to make sure that it's fair it's put together correctly and that it's something that goes out right away to set the tone for the school year so that we don't have as many discipline problems restorative practices I wanted to talk about that because we had a speaker named Tanya Covington come see us and she said that she has been trying to contact the board and the superintendent's office and that she has not received a call back or anything so I have her business card right here and I'm going to give it to you guys somehow maybe somebody could take it up or something thank you and and it would be nice to have actual training on what restorative practices are instead of leaving people you know just kind of in the dark so please consider

[00:40:00]
her training she's offering us teachers money to go for a week in June to learn this and that's a very wonderful thing to to have an opportunity like that so please please give her a call and consider her and also on the schedule I've always thought August was too much I didn't grow up like that we went to school in September we got out in June 1980 thank you ma'am you have two minutes won't be in speaking hi my name is Laura and I am a parent of a child at John Baker Elementary School and I wanted to speak about the calendar primarily about the

[00:41:00]
feedback opportunity I remember not so many months ago that the board delayed voting on the teacher can teachers contract because you didn't have sufficient time to review it we didn't have sufficient time to review these changes and I have no belief that you had sufficient time to read all of our feedback many of the parents took a lot of time to give very diligent feedback on this calendar I happen to be a person who is very much in favor of balanced breaks this is a step towards that it's not there yet research also supports that however there are some things on this calendar that are not thought out Wednesday early release is not that out in October there are two three-day weeks back to back everybody has seen that three-day weeks cause excessive absences as well as instructional gaps so there are things in this calendar that were not thought out because it was rushed and I understand that we had to respond to legislation but to be honest we all know this legislation was coming so we could have been prepared we could have had options

[00:42:00]
parents had adequate time to get feedback I also understand I did read your Q&A in advance and I understand that you are looking at lengthening the day therefore the hour calculation does add up to adding hours to the calendar however that's dependent on a hopeful that the negotiated time with the teachers is going to work out and we're going to have the 15 minutes volunteered for by teachers to cover drop off and pick up for elementary students that's a little concerning from a safety perspective and I think that nobody feels confident that our feedback was actually taken and so I would just really challenged you to have a way to reply to our feedback so that we can continue to take these surveys and we can continue to give our valuable time to you thanks thank you and board members that complete that completes public forum thank you first I just want to say thanks to everyone that

[00:43:00]
I spoke tonight we are going to be taking up a conversation on the calendar so for those that had some concerns about that but that's like first on the item so you could be here and watch us get through all of that and then I just want to say to everyone else thank you for the input on concerns around restorative practices safe schools the special ed concern and just the support for approving one of our Charter School East Side so change and also just we do continue to hear in terms of the feedback regarding the project Veritas and we do take that seriously and we have been looking at it so we'll move on to the next item our special issues our first our next item for discussion in action is consideration for review and approval of the 2023 2024 calendar and this is going to be a discussion action we've got doctors

[00:44:00]
we're going to guide us through this process I do want to remind the board that and you know there is a lot of validity to some of the Russians in this because legislation was just passed on the 16th and while there was you know we were anticipating that this was going to be added we weren't sure how it was going to be added because there was some discussions and there was a lot of play about where the professional development was going to be in so yes there was some calendars that were being tossed about but now is like here's the calendar here's with the actual item that before us and the time and the hours that they've added they didn't add days they just added hours and so we're having to figure all that out

[00:45:00]
I'm going to turn it over to you and you can walk us through what you've got before us great thank you madam chair members of the board and superintendent Elder I do have a presentation to go over some of all of the variables that we've had to consider this has been a very heavy lift and time has been of the essence and has been a challenge and so we do recognize that but I want to take us through a little bit of the journey so I don't have control but if we can move to the next slide I do want to thank the aps calendar committee the aps District in school base staff APS school board members ATF and afcp unions students families and community members for feedback questions collaboration contributions and Care throughout this very difficult process

[00:46:00]
so a little bit about House Bill 130 what it does is it increases the minimum instructional hours for all students Elementary are moving from a minimum of 990 to 11:40 and secondary are moving from a minimum of 1080 to 11:40 districts May subtract up to 60 hours of professional time of the 11:40 for elementary schools which would put them at the 1080 and 30 hours of the 11:40 for secondary schools which would put them at the minimum of 1,110 funding also increases for additional days Beyond 180 in the bill so the aps calendar timeline October 17th and discuss the development of a traditional and the Topsfield calendars principles took to their schools

[00:47:00]
add to collect preliminary feedback on October 24th the calendar committee convened and finalized proposed calendars based on the feedback December 7th originally scheduled to present calendars to school board but it was postponed due to information that we all received from legislators about possible legislation to add instructional time January 19th hb130 and HB 194 were introduced January 19th through March 13th District staff worked to create a potential 1140 calendar and there have been multiple scenarios and considerations March 13th the calendar committee met and discussed the proposed 1140 calendar to get feedback on the 15th we met in voted to approve the calendar on March 16th HB 130 was signed into law on the 16th the same day that it was signed into law we sent developed and distributed to our constituents of survey for us some feedback

[00:48:00]
and it was out for 2 weeks March 29th survey closed and the data was coded analyzed and considered April 5th here we are we're proposing an 11:40 and tops as well as a college and career high school calendars presenting them to you all April 14th District calendars are due to nmped per our last meeting APS calendar approval will allow for schools to build and finalize their Master schedules for next school year as well as online registration May open for next school year as well so there were many many many many many considerations in this calendar and you know some of us personally I'm you know a staff member here for APS I'm also a parent and a Community member and so I had to really put myself into each of those places in development

[00:49:00]
have this calendar and take into consideration many of the constituents concerns students concerns staff concerns and our families as well and so it was like I said a heavy lift so our committee consisted of District staff School site staff representatives of ATF and afcp unions as well as parents we received feedback from our superintendent student advisory Council we considered recommendations also from our Middle School and High School task forces which were inclusive of the following recommendations professional learning time for grade level content alike and interdisciplinary team teachers a later start for high school students teacher and student fatigue I need to boost scl supports and restorative practices in schools increased support Staffing counselors social workers nurses Etc advisory

[00:50:00]
time and increased student voice at the secondary level flexible scheduling at the secondary level to allow for project-based learning opportunities and transition jumpstart half days for our fifth graders moving on to 6th and our 8th graders moving on tonight additional considerations in the building of this calendar we wanted to honor the intent of House Bill 130 which was to increase instructional time for students as well as embed teacher professional learning and collaboration time we have to consider contractual federal holidays and they land where they land we don't get to move them which we wanted to many times built in time for inclement weather days the negotiated agreement to ensure that we allowed for the number of days after a grading term before having parent-teacher conferences balance degrading terms so consistency

[00:51:00]
across all grade levels in schools professional learning and collaboration time for teachers k12 and also our APS goals and guardrails so when we look at our alignment to the goals and guardrails we look at it increased instructional time for all students and which we feel directly aligns with goals one through three as well as guardrails to and 4 professional learning time for grade level content to like and interdisciplinary team teachers it's all four of our goals as well as guardrails 24 and 5 a later start for high school students goals 3 and 4:00 and guardrail for and longer breaks to address student and teacher fatigue goals one through four and guardrails one and two so I put a two column of what we are doing now versus next year's proposal currently we have multiple

[00:52:00]
which makes it very confusing our goal now is to shift to One calendar with one start date of August 3rd and two end dates the traditional being May 31st and for our top schools June 10th we currently have different professional development dates for traditional and top Schools staff next year we will have the same professional development dates this year we have multiple grade reporting Cycles some schools are on three summer on four and some are on 6th which makes that very confusing for families as well so we will be shifting to one district-wide reporting cycle which is 4 top schools currently with 10 additional days of instruction next year top schools will have six additional days of instruction and it will be the last year of the Topps model the ltp and 8-hour pilot schools are currently

[00:53:00]
in place next school year we will no longer have eltp is that is now going to roll into the 11:40 and it will be the last year for the 8-hour pilot currently we have 178 instructional days we will be shifting to 182 for additional days and staff will be compensated for those additional days I know there was confusion and concern their 184 teacher contract days will now be 188 teacher contract days we are maintaining a 7-hour teacher contract day the minimum hours for elementary is 990 next year will be 11:40 and currently for secondary is 1080 and we will move to 1140 this year we have early release Wednesdays at some of our elementary schools and in this proposal early release Wednesdays throughout the year for Teacher professional learning and collaboration

[00:54:00]
at all Elementary K-8 and middle schools this year no professional learning and collaboration time for elementary and middle school teachers and next year we're proposing the two aligned hours on most Wednesdays for elementary and middle school professional learning and collaboration for teachers right now High School professional learning and collaboration time is built into the school day for high schools at an additional prep period and that will continue next year we have one day labor day break this year next year will have a 2:00 this year we have a two-day fall break next year will have one this year we have a three week or three days Thanksgiving break next year we'll have one week this year we have a 2 week winter break next year and 1/2 weeks this year one week spring break next year two weeks spring break and then this year's graduation

[00:55:00]
the week is May 15th through the 20th and next year will be May 20th through the 25th so why early release Wednesdays for elementary and middle schools currently our elementary and middle and our teachers don't have dedicated professional learning and collaboration time and if they want to collaborate with each other they have to use their their personal preps to do so this will provide our middle schools with more flexibility and less conflicts in the building of their master schedule this will allow for the development of stronger Partnerships with the City of Albuquerque and our other out of school learning providers such as campfire Boys and Girls Club Children's Choice Rio Grande Community collaborative YMCA Center for Learning and I know that there are more that we did not capture we will work to create genius our type activities as well as tutoring for students at their school

[00:56:00]
fights proposed draft bell schedule for next school year we have been looking at this and we just recently received what could possibly happen and so this is the current proposal and it may change based on some variables but tops elementary schools and middle schools would go from 7:30 to 2:30 first Elementary group from 805 to 305 high schools from 8:40 to 3:40 and the second Elementary group from 9:15 to 4:15 we've looked at some states such as California and Florida have already made it law that high school's not begin school before 8:30 a.m. so when we look at the survey that was out for two weeks it was a qualitative survey we did one

[00:57:00]
I want to hear from individuals and and their thoughts around this calendar we received feedback from over 4700 individuals the majority of the feedback was from those who identified as a parent or Guardian so 63% APS staff followed at 19% and community members at 3% the remainder identified as a combination of the above which was 15% so with that and looking at the support or do not support so when we look at the addition of four more days to the calendar it was pretty evenly split at 49 to 51 of 49 to 51 split of support and do not support when we look at the longer breaks throughout the school year 6436 split of support and do not support early release Wednesdays for elementary and middle school students of 4654

[00:58:00]
list of support and do not support and the later start time for high school students a 7129 split of support and do not support and I do want to make this clear that this was not a quantitative survey so looking at specific percentages we coded and pulled out felt very strongly about or against to create this so based on survey feedback we're here to discuss the calendar with you but also because there has been great concern for the early release Wednesdays I want to ask that we may consider a calendar that instead of early release Wednesdays has 7 built-in professional learning days for Elementary K-8 and Middle School teachers instead of the early release Wednesdays it would be less disruption to families which we've heard loud and clear regarding after school care

[00:59:00]
as well as instructional time for students and staff and we have looked at what those proposed days could be to be as least disruptive as well as meeting the needs and recommendations from community members as well and so that would be one day in September one day in October one day in November we will not have one in December or January because they're shorter months and then when in February March April and then make so thank you very much and we are open for comments and questions at this time okay so I for board members I know they left the two calendar proposals on for us so we had the one that we received in our packet which had the Wednesdays and then on the dice they gave us the second

[01:00:00]
one which was the last part of The Proposal where Dr Segundo was talking about those proposed professional development days and eliminating the Wednesday early release and so I'll just I'll just go down the road and I'll start with board member going question mark you know what I have so many questions because my questions were not answered and so why don't you just go ahead because I'm hopefully they'll be answered but my questions that I had sent in none of my questions were answered so I'm going to have a whole bunch of them hopefully I'll let you guys go and then I'll go after birth Peterson just general feedback from

[01:01:00]
I have heard the feedback I've gotten a lot of the concern dealt with the shortened Wednesdays and I know as a teacher Wednesday afternoons were helpful I mean we never had I we never is General a teacher's managed to get sub coverage for IEPs and so our IEPs and staff work ended up it wasn't professional learning time it was taken care of business that we had to take care of and I don't know when we would have done it without Wednesday afternoon because that's I mean is that chair I never had prep on my Wednesday cuz it was because every second was taken with with work and so I know that the Wednesday's provide time in a way that's not organized in any other

[01:02:00]
Elementary School teachers you know high school justifiably has their time in collaboration time built in on a daily basis and that is not and never has been the case for elementary yet you know Elementary School teachers have a gazillion preps and so anyway I understand where the Wednesday proposal came from because it's a real name is underestimate the amount of time in collaboration time and parents contact time the elementary school teachers need but listening to the responses you know about

[01:03:00]
specials it seems like we have so many other moving parts right now that it's really altered the way that when stays look for Staffing community and so I as I look at the proposal that doesn't include that it looks at the 7 Days embedded is probably a more friendly schedule for both Community families and staff teachers trying to make this needs I appreciate the fact that you looked at it because I think that it was looking at a serious need the elementary school teachers in middle school teachers have that they don't get so that's my general feedback about concerned I do have though

[01:04:00]
is the what what is still within the day for elementary and middle school in terms of coverage and you know again teachers step up and go above and beyond but at some point there's burnout at some point the one group of people who day in day out try to meet the needs of students say will put students first and I think stuff goes what do you think we've been doing for the X number of years that we've been teaching at some point we've got to have some recognition of the kind of embedded in a day to be ready for the teaching that we do and that is a very real practical need so how within the within the day what structure in if we go to the calendar without Wednesdays what does that look like

[01:05:00]
teachers just having that transition period that that time to get your math manipulatives out so you can teach math and meanwhile get the book boxes put away and the language arts stuff organized so board member Peterson and thank you very much yes with the other calendar it would remain as is and they would have that time during their specials time to okay so then the seven days could be would be in addition to what's already people

[01:06:00]
families that have plans and especially for this transition years knowing how important that transition from 5 to 6 is from 8:00 to 9 is starting for this year only pushing back the start date for everyone except the top schools so then instead of instead of everyone starting on the same day everyone would finish on the same day what would that do to the calendar board member Peterson that would constitute the development of a new calendar and we like I said we have considered multiple iterations of this as well as variables knowing that we're not going to meet the needs of everybody and that's really tough for us because we really want to but yeah it would it would take

[01:07:00]
anytime you move it's like kind of like a master calendar master schedule if you move one thing it has an impact on everything else and so we would have to relook at that I know it would impact the 50/50 semester split for high school in particular and I know that's a huge concern that we can that we hear every year of the need to contain the semesters I understand that we are in a bind I mean no matter what we do it is not going to fit for some families and I definitely understand that the legislature made a decision and we need to make sure it works for us the best way possible I appreciate the work cuz I understand all of this moving parts

[01:08:00]
the the one other thing I think this is alleviated somewhat with taking away the Wednesdays but we still know that we have a huge need for extended days and that it is prohibitive cost wise for many families to find help the good things for their kids so my one General comment and this isn't to you so much is our whole school community that we've got to keep working on finding more strong good options for out of school time for kids and that's something that I appreciate the work that started with the city and the different providers some of them are free some because they've gotten grants not because there's magical funding somewhere but because they found other money sources

[01:09:00]
and then the ones that are way expensive for a lot of families so that's I mean that sort of a charge for everyone that's for the city for us for the county for private providers how we keep going with that to have better options for kids but I again I we are in a bind we can't make everyone happy and I don't like not being able to make everyone happy we can always come back to you to board member Peterson I'm going to jump around thank you so I do have some questions so in relation to because when you put the different schedules up and you specifically said the seven our teacher contract day would still be in place how are we going to handle since it's essentially I've heard the term now about

[01:10:00]
and allowing teachers to be there early or have to stay late like we're pretty much asking them to arrive at the same time students are arriving and leave at the same time so how does that work with when the bus arrives parent pick-up Duty time it just doesn't seem to be effective efficient and even proper use of making sure overall we're putting our students first so how are we addressing that so board member at top your Romero thank you right now we are looking what's currently in place is we have a system where teachers and staff will volunteer to get paid differential to cover before school after school as well as lunch duty and that's currently what we have so essentially they would have to I'm just trying to make sense of it like I even think of my own stuff

[01:11:00]
I couldn't imagine them showing up when the parents and students are showing up at the exact same time like not having their time to be ready be present have materials prepared we're literally asking them to show up when your students are arriving so are you saying there's absolutely no wiggle room to be able to have them to spend an extra 10-15 minutes before or after as it is right now we teachers are there for 7 hours a day and we rely on teachers and staff to volunteer to get that differential to cover those drop off morning drop off and afternoon departures wow adequately fund 15 I'm sorry just 15 minutes would be roughly 12.5 million we were looking at trying to add an hour of time to the staff

[01:12:00]
they had time for adult work and it was around 50 million is what I recall my budget people just keep staring at me but okay thumbs up so I'm doing a brief brief mathematical formula that I come up it's about 12 and a half million dollars so we are in negotiations and we are looking at ways that we can provide some funding to help with things like drop off pick up and lunch duty right I just look at the challenges like worst case scenario you don't get anyone to volunteer or you don't have a sufficient amount of stuff to volunteer to handle will say they have over 1600 students and you get five people to volunteer what is that look like for our school in terms of safety you know and that's just a huge concern that we don't have the ability to have our teachers ready prepared and even just to be able to be present for the day

[01:13:00]
I'm in favor of not having early dismissal on Wednesdays I think that does post some concerns specifically even for a middle school students getting out early however I will put a plug in for community-based providers cuz I know board member Peterson said added a little bit to it this is why we need to keep Early Childhood providers active present and thriving because they bridge that Gap you know they're there to provide before and after school care for all of these additional breaks that were plugging in this is why we have to keep them and sustain their services and make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to do because APS cannot meet the needs and all of these areas so we do have it and it is free for families I'm going to say this to you know because many times people say what you can't afford it well fortunately left the funding was provided there were it is

[01:14:00]
completely free to all families and a family of four can make $110,000 a year and still qualify for free services so there's the plug I'm just going to say there are some options there's some great programs out there that want to make sure that they're providing before and after care specifically from kinder through 5th grade so next question how are we going to do with proper HVAC in our obviously in our schools with starting early earlier we've heard everybody talk about how it's already hot now with our current time starting early we're going to have issues we just received an email today I believe yesterday where we had the capital plan of all of the updates that are going to be made to schools and several are not being addressed for HVAC and I'm hearing from several teachers within our schools like what are we going to do to to fix that with having such an early start time so what are our plans Miss Gabrielle

[01:15:00]
1422 Cordova on board member Tapia Romero there isn't much we can do to control the temperature in the Summers so I don't want to give like false advertising that everything will be fine most of what we've replaced so far with evaporative cooling so we put new units and you can see on the dashboard I think you will have the link to it which schools have already been completed but the problem is that there are they are evaporative coolers so the more that they are functional and they're working but the more moisture we have in the higher the temperature right then you know they can only pull room about 15° so a lot of times I love calls we get over the summer for air conditioning that isn't working it is working but the outside conditions aren't providing the

[01:16:00]
ideal conditions so the further we get past like monsoon season and the Heat of the summer then the more functional so a lot of times people like oh now it's now it's working I fixed it but we didn't need your kind of fixed it over the course of time so I can't guarantee that you know classrooms won't be hot the beginning of August will continue to service the HVAC systems that aren't working right but 70% of our systems are evaporative coolers they're being replaced with much more efficient evaporative coolers but they are still evaporative coolers that you know I have one in my own home so I know that certain times were and I'm aware like I know humidity affects it and if it's raining it's pretty much useless but at what point and maybe I'm just a little lost here cuz I was under the impression like through S or fun

[01:17:00]
HVAC and I would like when you're saying 70% like to me even saying the unit is functioning ultimately when you're in class and it's hot like you're it's not regardless of how we put it it's still not making like a great environment and a teachable atmosphere for students to be able to learn effectively so at what point are we going to say we're not going to use these units and we're actually going to transition to units for our students can learn so if we were so we have spent about 20 million dollars that we're spending on upgrading the equipment which is going to make a huge difference to a lot of our really old systems that just we're not working very well it even with I mean that we're putting in very like upgraded HVAC units or are handling units that are going to you'll definitely notice a difference in them if we were to replace

[01:18:00]
convert completely to refrigerated air we did a school a couple of years ago so prior to the rates even going up and it was 12.5 million for one school so we would only be able to convert to schools were right now we're upgrading about 40% of our schools with new equipment so the other issue that happened was one of the schools that we were going to look at converting it was a 52 weight 52 week weight for parts so the money would I mean so so because of that we do still and the upgrades they will definitely noticed a change of it but when it's hot in the desert in the beginning of August we definitely see that that's when we get the most calls obviously for HVAC and some of the calls are you know there's something wrong and then some of the calls

[01:19:00]
are just because of the weather right now so like hearing what you just said and obviously there's things outside of our control even not within our budget which I get would and maybe I don't know if this is necessary rhetorical question but to me it sounds like having an earlier start time is just going to make it harder you know cuz there's a lot of things outside of our control versus keeping it mid or later August and taking some of the other time that we've given extra throughout the year so we don't have this issue in Midsummer just my thought because I'm like I hear that we can't fix some of this stuff so I'm like then how do we make adjustments again so everyone can learn the way they're supposed to I think what happens with the balance of the calendar is kind of what was saying is like you move one piece and then something else Falls in this particular case we could move school to start later

[01:20:00]
and then it would end later and what it does is it upsets the balance of the semesters so then the like high school finals for the semester because of the number of days will happen after winter break and I don't think I'm sorry let me cuz I don't think I'm saying start later but I know we gave out a whole lot more breaks than what we typically did like for like we mentioned two weeks spring break extra now we have to turn to send next week but I'm like this is I think there's going to be no there's going to be holes no matter how we look at it but to recap and I'll pass it over in favor of no early dismissal Wednesdays and the bell to Bell not having teachers ready before and after is a huge huge concern of mine so that's it for now super

[01:21:00]
we can solve one problem but there's multiple variables that went in to try to decide this so you've got four grading periods and now you want four Equitable or equal grading periods you want to have a semester that completes before the winter holidays that kind of pushes your your day up and I hear yeah you can take days but you can't take days from semester to to balance semester one it doesn't doesn't work so the other we can get a few days I think the difference right now is four days and I will remind you it's still pretty hot and September we get a lot of the climate has changed and we as a as a district the

[01:22:00]
high temperature in June is 93 degrees the average high temperature in August is 90 so I think we're stuck either way period you know I can appreciate some of the concerns the red flag is a board member of a time when my son-in-law was working for FedEx and this is years ago and the great thing about that job was that he realized he needed to get back to school he had to go

[01:23:00]
at 4:30 and volunteer an hour of time to set up his truck just so so that he could start his route on time and do his deliveries without with precision and then at the end he had to clock out and then do his reports and I remember telling him Steve you should be a teacher so we have to pay people for their time and you know the the the the issue is that we're not getting enough money to do that we also are not getting enough

[01:24:00]
funding to convert and and I wanted to tell Dr Blakey don't leave I have a question for you maybe you can shout it out and that is to convert from to HVAC entirely air conditioning school like or I don't know if I suspect not because they still have some really old boiler heater so what what does it cost to do that kind of conversion so it depends on what kind of system the school has at the time so if we're converting completely it also involves a new roof so that's why the price goes up so much so for an elementary school

[01:25:00]
well it probably would be around like 7 8 million dollars all new construction has some sort of upgraded like refrigerated air but then you also have electrical that you have to upgrade and it's not that they're bad I mean the evaporative cooling system and the boilers are very efficient and in a lot of cases especially for some of you I'm just looking at board member Miller Aragon because she's familiar with new construction isn't always in what they have to so in some ways there are a lot easier to maintain and they work really efficiently it's just when it really is when it's the moisture is high during monsoon season is when it's really difficult right now still see a significant change in the functionality in the quality of those but it's

[01:26:00]
not necessarily the heat it's the humidity that sounds like that was like I've heard that before but really it's like it's the combination of the humidity during monsoon season so there's just this like you know a few weeks of time that it's to get them functional and so and what is it costing for elementary schools to to upgrade their that's what it would be probably about 7 million dollars okay so that's an upgrade of a swamp cooler to convert 422 okay so what is it called is that what you're talking about when you are when you mention upgrades yeah so there's yes there's different kinds of upgrades so upgrades were currently doing on a lot of our schools with the assert money is upgrading to newer more efficient equipment complete conversion

[01:27:00]
evaporative cooling to refrigerate it pulling at this time we do in new construction okay but not old old buildings because of the cost is the cost because we would only be able to do you know one schools maybe two is because the parts the lead time is 52 weeks to get the units in and third is because as we do phase out schools and rebuild we're putting new systems in where is now with evaporative cooling if we have the schools don't have to wait for it so if you were going to say oh well in five years of school is going to be rebuilt you're not going to put 20 million dollars worth of new HVAC in the school when you're going to rebuild it whereas we can put new evaporative coolers because as we

[01:28:00]
is that building we can take those off and put them at another school so it allows us to be much more flexible and I think responsible with the money because we can put it on a new school we can move something that's getting ready that's getting rebuilt and utilize the new units thank you for all that detail and it may seem like I'm laboring something but I want to live for consideration all the details that you all work through to I get frustrated because I get the phone calls from schools right and I understand because I worked in those buildings and it's hard it's hard it impacts learning but I also understand that you're doing you're making

[01:29:00]
the best use of limited resources and so I kind of got off on on Capital outlay details as they relate to this calendar but I hope people who are plugged in or understanding that 93 degrees over 90 may not seem like a big deal but I'll take the 90 it matters when you're in a room with in my case with lots of teenagers who were very unhappy I also I'm leaning toward

[01:30:00]
the calendar that does not include a an early dismissal because the community has spoken loud and clearly loudly and clearly I guess I'm the the the unfortunate consequence and here here we are right we need we need time for teachers embedded and I hear that one hour one hour of to do that to give teachers one hour more and frankly Wednesday so that 50 million becomes 100 million if we if we pay for it outside of the

[01:31:00]
the workday the classroom time and we need to invest we need if if we want teachers to be well prepared the state needs to invest because in the end it does impact student learning and I won't believe it we can always come back so let's go to board member Jackson so I think the the first thing that I want to say and are you Patricia okay hi Patricia so nice to meet you in person finally sorry I'm sorry but it's nice to meet you in person with like these big calendar first I just want to like we have to take a moment

[01:32:00]
you guys have worked your tails off and we know that we appreciate it and I really hope that the community that is sitting in here and I know there's tons of people that are listening at home please know that the administration Dr Segura and your team you guys worked so hard to basically try to fit a square peg into a round hole is what you were doing and while you were doing that you were trying to take into account everything that all of the different factions within Albuquerque were trying to tell you they want it so I just want to tell you that I appreciate what you guys have done its it was hard and I know that and I know you know that because I asked you about 4000 7,728 different questions so so thank you for taking continuing to take my calls so

[01:33:00]
the other thing that I just kind of want to highlight is first of all this comes from my my sweet husband but you know I was talking about this day and that day and can we lengthen it and can we do this and can we do that and and he said he said why are you arguing over days he said an hour he said you you have we have a district where 80% of our kids cannot do math and 70% of our kids cannot read and I think we just need to remember that right like we are at the bottom our kids need to be in school more and we're arguing over days and hours or we're concerned over days and hours and we we need to give our kids

[01:34:00]
as much quality instruction time and I'm looking at you guys but I'll look at everybody as much quality instruction time as absolutely possible and I again want to recognize you guys were trying to do that working within the legislation working within the negotiated agreement working within the budget working within you know what what I'm asking and what you want does asking and I don't know if you're asking but you're just right here so I appreciate that so I have some questions first of all I I agree I do not like the early release days I don't think that it works for kids I don't think that it puts students and family needs first and like I said I'm I

[01:35:00]
I'm a visual person so I visualized this little kindergartener who's getting out at noon and then has to sit in after care until 6:00 when their parents can pick them up when they could have had more instruction during the day so I don't I think it creates in a regular schedule that doesn't work for a families and then I have to give a shout out to Kathleen Hagar and her very Karl Rove type presentation where you know he likes to write on the the Whiteboard it doesn't make sense I I again I cannot figure out how adding four days but taking away how we're actually creating more instruction time so with that being said I of the two prefer the this one the second one where it takes away the early release and in beds the professional days

[01:36:00]
to the calendar okay so I said I would get to my questions so what specifically for elementary school because this has come up what would the instruction what would the hours be during the day what what are what are the instruction hours during the day for elementary school so board member Jackson thank you for your questions and thank you for recognizing the heavy lift my shoulders are for you but you know right now currently it's very interesting that schools there's a variation from 5.3 hours to 6558 to 6. 3 0 5

[01:37:00]
who are the elementary is going to fill it much more than the secondary and so that's where the the time it's been buried is going to become unified okay so again I need to conceptualize this so I'm thinking my kids went to school from for spell 753 they got out at 2 but we'll just bump it to make it easy from 8 to 2:00 does that mean like instructions starts right at 8:00 and instructions to and they get that full that's not that's not that's 7 hours that's six hours can you realize that for me yes so it would be from 8:00 to 2:30 now okay and within an elementary day there are different things happening they have recess

[01:38:00]
according to a statute I believe two recesses are mandatory at every elementary school and they also count for instructional time so there's things that you know we know that the whole Community doesn't know that we're having to consider as well so that's part of it then they have their specials time so yes it'll go from that schedule that your child had releasing it to they will now be releasing it 2:30 okay okay so we so it is extending the day a little bit to incorporate in an extension of the hours yes okay so that brings me to my next question on here you did write 182 days * 6.5 hours of instruction is 1183 I think that that was just for high school so what would the instructional instructional hours in this new scenario

[01:39:00]
before middle school and elementary school so with middle Elementary and K-8 schools it would be $175 days * 6.5 which is 1137.5 okay sorry that was Middle School Elementary in k38 okay okay got it got it okay okay so 11:37 for K through 8 and 1183 for high school okay bouncing back to the question about the elementary school and the bell to Bell conversation that we've been having is there a way that we can pay for that extra time or like is there a way

[01:40:00]
is there a way to fix that kinda sort of answered that question already and that it's something that we're working on but it is a budgetary issue and it's the initial thought was oh we'll have enough money from these extra days cuz there's a little bump you get from it that we thought could help pay for that and we really had hoped that we could give everybody an extra hour that was not even close so we're now looking at what can we do and that ultimately have to be negotiated on our radar in a concern and we understand it out will work on it and negotiations first and then once we know

[01:41:00]
what is the funding that we get past the 180 days so each day above 180 days you take your District enrollment you multiply it by 012 and you multiply that times the additional number of days above the 180 times enrollment do we have do you have a rough figure no no okay yeah I don't need exact time period

[01:42:00]
okay and I'm I'm sorry can you remind me what we think what superintendent Elder was saying was going to cost was like 14 1/2 14 million so when we look at adding an additional 15 minutes it would be roughly 9 million per day or no total okay okay so we're getting about approximately four and a half million so about 9 million over the by adding two days these are but you need to remember that these are projections we haven't seen anything yet they haven't shown us the unit about it we can't so we're waiting to be told how much money there is so our budget office it's not going to be worse so we have a good idea but we don't have a precise idea and other costs have gone up it you

[01:43:00]
gas you know we have higher operating costs of some of that money gets eaten up and keep school school so if I can editorialize for a second how frustrating is it that the budget that the the the calendars do on a certain day from ped but they haven't even bothered to tell us what the funding is going to look like because we haven't received the unit value told us the exact amount we know from the releases how to figure it and what it could look like so we I mean they're capable of producing very close projections but we don't have the actual number itself okay back to my questions cuz I have a list

[01:44:00]
okay this this May 24th TD can you just seems a little late in the year just did we did just bump it because it would was it asked for is that useful I'm just curious about that particular day so we looked at giving some time between each of the professional learning days and with the 24th a lot of it sounds strange but I mean we're already planning for next school year teachers as well are looking at what does next school year look like as a district we are able then to also provide professional development on certain programming adoptions to get teachers ready for

[01:45:00]
next school year so it does seem strange but it does get used well okay okay going to and I'm just kind of trying to go through some of the questions that were sent to me and this is kind of in relation to this May 24th so as I'm looking at it as a parent I'm thinking okay so my high school kid has to go to school on the 24th my Elementary School kiddo doesn't it's right before Memorial Day I'm going to leave I might not come back right so I'm wondering if there are ways so now we jump to January 24th or January we have two days there on the 8th and the 9th he's me is there a way to bump those

[01:46:00]
9 days to the 4th and the 5th which would give two days in January wish we could possibly take away in may like I'm sorry I don't know what's going on my voice here but but we could take away from me would add so it would bump it and day to May 29th and then move that PD to the 28th and then the last day of school is the 24th I think the challenge with high school is that our high schoolers are going to have finals that week and so we have to allow at least 4 days for each of the classes to have an extended amount of time for each of their finals for a seven period day and then sometime for makeup for finals last night at 31st okay okay and then the I have more questions but I'll stop here and and and and reserve my time

[01:47:00]
can you just kind of explain the the October 19th 20 the reasoning for a split and also the 25th and the 26th the reasoning for the split with the Middle School in the high school so for parent-teacher conference time the state and statue allows for a greater number of hours to be utilized by Elementary School teachers because they sit with each family for roughly half an hour they get them scheduled sit with them to get through their entire class takes more than just one day so they have the two days on in both the fall and the spring secondary schools do not require or their I guess the maximum is less than the elementary and so each of those would be just the one single day so I'm not answering your question

[01:48:00]
I think it was just confusing with like so Elementary School is 2 days but Middle School is one day in high school is one day oh okay so we were able to capture some of the students being in school so we're trying to also maximize the instructional time for kids and allowing for that time so we can also count it for instructional time for the calendar and not have to add additional days okay so you were you were doing your best to keep this as close to a traditional calendar as possible while still increasing instructional hours without having to add as many days and it was loud and clear from a lot of individuals they did not want to start school in July and they did not want to end in June

[01:49:00]
so we did our best to start in August and end in May I reserve my time okay thank you board member Mueller out of gone okay you're probably going to have to clarify some things for me again but first of all I want to say we have listened to our constituents cuz that's who we represent that's who we have to listen to and over the last several years overwhelmingly they have rejected any extra time adding whether it's adding extra days adding extra hours they've overwhelmingly said what if they said superintendent Elder whatever they said in 29 schools they agreed to extend and the rest of the majority what did they say they said they didn't want to extend the correct so that is what they have overwhelmingly said over and over and over again that's who I

[01:50:00]
I want to listen to but yeah what were what the state did is they said you have you have no choice so it really I want everybody to know that it isn't us not listening to you it is who's in Santa Fe that wasn't listening to you so we have no choice but to go to the 11:40 that's correct it's the law we have no choice okay so that doesn't make a lot of people happy and I went through you know these thousands of responses I don't think I think it was at like 8:00 or something I I swear I didn't get to all of them I'm so sorry I didn't but I got to like 5500 and so I basically saw the same thing that the overwhelming I mean the majority were just saying no we don't want this extra extra extra time they didn't but

[01:51:00]
we're having in a way to get to the 11th 11:40 so then my question is Dr Segundo you said that 11:37 instructional hours will be for the elementary school and then for the k8s now on top of that because we can use the 60 hours I think right as counted as instructional hours so for Middle School is 30 right Elementary is 60 so we have looked at 30 right for middle school and then 60 so then we would add the instructional hours that you just said 11:37 that is exactly how much time then that the children are going to be spending in the classroom this isn't the PD et cetera correct correct

[01:52:00]
so then my question is if we only had to go to 1140 inclusive of the PD why are we doing that when our community said that that's not what they wanted I don't know if I understand your question I'm sorry so we just we have to do 11:40 but inclusive in that I'll talk to us about elementary school is 60 of those hours are still considered instructional even though they're professional development for the teachers is that right yes okay but we are doing in the classroom 11:37 for elementary school last we had 60 hours because those that PD is considered instructional hours is that what you're telling me sorry we're making some calculations

[01:53:00]
okay the width of those six professional learning days comes out to 4 5. 5 7 5

[01:54:00]
so I'm just trying to get all those all those numbers you know in my head so 1,111.5 the elementary will be inside their classroom and then we have the 60 hours of professional development so then when we add that together that's where you come up with $1,171.55 so we can use up to and in this second calendar we're not using the entire 60 hours or utilizing the 45.5 okay I'm just so it's just too many numbers for me to try to figure out where we're at we're going to be here

[01:55:00]
four students and the rationale for that is that that's what legislative intent was the law says you have to do this the legislative intent was to increase more hours so we tried to balance as many variables as we could but there's always going to be some give and take on either side when you're doing that so we're going to be as close to the 11:40 hours and not so much above what they're asking us that that's taking as much into consideration of what are constituents asked of us okay I just want everybody to hear that that we are not so then my I know you said that we get 4.5 for everyday added above 180 so that would be about 9 million dollars so did we need those days in order in these

[01:56:00]
send a calendar in order to get as close to the 1140 like did we need those extra days above 180 or is this just about money and not about what's best for kids so we were looking at the time that we that we have and hearing loud and clear also about the duty time considering that are enrollment is also going down which means less funding we are trying to figure out how we can maximize as much as possible and so when we look at before and after school that was a consideration that we thought about we don't have the exact number but I guess the approximation of the 4.5 per day can help pay for that before and after school time for for students and stuff

[01:57:00]
okay so that will be for the teachers that would almost cover the amount for the volunteers that will be doing it not because we don't have the was it 50 million I don't remember the number anymore if we had every teacher you have to pay every teacher for that extra 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after which is what it right now to see and correct me if I'm wrong Julianne it's the it would be an average of 9 million to cover 15 minutes per staff member per teacher an additional on top of their seven-hour day so it would cover it would cover the 9 million about would cover every single it would cover every teacher so then that would help away some of the concerns that remember Topia Romero was talking about then we wouldn't have to worry about volunteer volunteers okay so then those

[01:58:00]
I just want to make it very clear again that's still pending type of negotiation okay and so then I as I thought it was really about money and about the adults and not really about the kids so that's sad so these extra two days and I'm sure that you can't when we are looking about trying to improve student outcomes right academic Transformer kids having more time and all the kindergarten preschool kindergarten up to they're all going to be in school for six and a half hours a day so it'll be the same for our elementary poor little angels that are four and five years old are going to have to be in school for six and a half hours same as our high school kids correct yes K through 12 sad okay that is just say I mean

[01:59:00]
it was and I will go back to where we're thinking that adding more time and I will take you back to you know 2000 when we were implementing all-day kindergarten right and they wanted to and the school I was at was the last phase of that adding hours so it doubled obviously double the day for the kindergarteners with the intention that the kids they would say they're not ready to read when they're in first grade they're not ready academically they're just not prepared so we're going to add time not do anything any differently for our kindergarteners just add more time I'm hoping that things are our goal is that we are going to we have Newport goals we have you know a strong understanding of what instruction needs to look like SEL all of that in the classroom and so it's in my mind it's not the time it's

[02:00:00]
we're doing in that time and I know that our teachers they're working really hard and so our job I feel is to you know help support them by giving them the best resources access to the resources training them on how to use those resources so that all of our kids have access to those high quality materials and activities and and some fun hopefully so I mean we're saying that these four days are going to be done differently they're going to be done the whole entire 100 and 182 days is going to be done differently so that you're saying is different than how kindergarten just doubling the day didn't make any difference because we know that it didn't I mean the putting we've had a whole generation of kids go through all day kindergarten and didn't see that it made any difference in our reading math scores Etc so we're hopeful that it will be something

[02:01:00]
novel that hopefully teachers were going to be doing but I as I read through all of the comments and I'm sure you did as well that many parents were saying more of the same is not going to make any difference it's just it's not going to make any difference if you do things the same entire you know the same way for every child the thing also is when you're talking about I'm for targeting towards those children that need the extra help doing something novel and different that would take a lot of thought and I know you all to do this calendar it took a lot of your time I understand that but to really do something to Target those children we know who those children are already are but yeah we're giving this time to everybody every single child who doesn't need it hoping that that Gap that we've seen is going to

[02:02:00]
listen disappear without thinking that those children like probably like my kids and your children many people in here that have children that have these extra things that they get to do Beyond School my child needed extra tutoring an hour a week they got that extra tutoring where many of these children are not going to have those resources they got to go to extracurricular activities that's another hour they got to you know go to museums and go on vacations all these extra hours that are added on that help our kids that many of our children don't have the opportunity to say that you're giving this to everybody and saying it's going to make a difference when all those other children that are proficient or above are still going to have all that extra stuff I just don't see how you see it and I just don't see the evidence that four more days is going to make that big of

[02:03:00]
change honestly I'm hopeful Dr Segura that things are going to look different I think from what I've seen it's going to be much like how kindergarten was we do something novel you know give vouchers let parents interview teachers so they match better with you know we just don't get along with everybody provide scores for teachers so that they can see it just like we see them for lawyers and doctors in Realtors etcetera and for administrators as well so do something do something novel I would say obviously I am not for adding more time more hours for our elementary kids I'm just not just having been a teacher I think it's cruel I think kids have a very little very little time they spend his children

[02:04:00]
Penn Elementary School is just that absolutely fun time and just to have them in school for basically for 7 hours as almost as long as an 8-hour day that we as adults have and we expect that from 4:57 year olds I'm not for that at all I am not I am not for having the you know I like the early release Wednesdays I just don't think that that is going to work for our community at all it's going to make it very difficult I think so I'm not for that but then I'm also not for having our elementary kids in school and having them start school on August I'm with I think there's a way to to do this where they at least do not have to start school on on the third and just and not have to come back I just don't see the kids coming back

[02:05:00]
after Memorial Day and if there's a way to move those and I understand needing the PD like during the you know during the school year etcetera is I just don't know why we just can't have it like we front load some of it at the beginning of the three days at the beginning of the school year but most teachers that I've talked to have said they they wanted a whole entire week so I don't know why we can't do we're saying we can't do it even though I always believed there that we should instead say we can figure it out yes and board member Mueller had to go and thank you for your comments I do just want to point out that the development of this calendar doesn't mean that we agree or disagree with that we just try to honor the rule of the legislation to try to create a calendar that we did listen to our communities feedback to adjust

[02:06:00]
but where we can but yes throughout the school year I mean that is our role is to continuous Improvement and I think that that's our our efforts but the calendar the way it's created doesn't I don't want I just want it to be clear it's not that we agree or disagree with the legislation I understand that it's not you know parents were obviously not listen to and then we we have no choice so I can you just kind of go I know you kind of explained this but why we have a whole entire week of during Thanksgiving break or we used to just have Wednesday Thursday Friday and now it's like that whole entire week you know is it just trying you're trying to just put different breaks during the year to visit what you're trying to do if not like why can't you take those two days and take them away and then just have the kids start on

[02:07:00]
7th instead and take those away I mean just these long weekends where the parents aren't off they may be off on Labor Day or they may be off on Memorial day but they're not off all these other ones that you Interstate into the calendar parents are working I mean and you know two and a half weeks at Chris we're at Spring break was at 2 weeks at Spring break and two and a half I mean parents are working and you're going to try it's much easier for them to find daycare for their kids in the summer time then to have to try to find things everywhere and yes we want to depend on you know the city and different people that are going to help us you know sometimes we're just left on our own and we know that and that is not fair to parents either yes and we did follow the process of having the calendar committee and in the timeline you know we did have the principal's take back to

[02:08:00]
High School sites for feedback and so the development of this is based on a lot of feedback and there was a lot of support for extended breaks and that's what we did ask in the survey and don't remember I have to pull up the presentation for the split but it was pretty I also just want to remind everyone one is we're already at 7:00 and I really want to be able to move on this because what's really unique about where we are bored remember to go on is one it got passed very late generally a calendar comes to us in February and we're already communicating it out to the community so this is very unique I mean and so like it's not going to be a perfect year but I think what we have kind of like our best foot forward to start with this next school year it doesn't mean that this is going to be in perpetuity

[02:09:00]
we're going to also look into see what happens with this next year we can always come back and I know that Dr Segura and I don't want to just call you Patty I was at your last name but I mean we are going to be turning around immediately to start thinking about strategizing for a calendar for the the subsequent school year so we're up against it and I know our goal and the goal of the district is to have something that we have we can clearly communicate to the to our district to our staff to our parents so they can start planning now because it is already April and so we need to put something forward and we need to also get started on all of these other pieces so that we can finalize it and we can put this into play it's not perfect it is not a perfect calendar I will admit to that

[02:10:00]
for sure I also am grateful that you came up with an alternative calendar based on feedback on know Wednesdays please help us here and that I think was a great compromise and something that you've done that really has pushed has definitely with our constituents in mind and I and I'm reminded that while our constituents for sure didn't want extra days nobody did I mean but I wouldn't say that I shouldn't say that I think there was there's also a loud cry out there we also need to do something different because we all know that New Mexico as a whole needs to improve in education and just for us and Albuquerque we also need to improve our outcomes and so this was the best foot forward there was additional instructional hours that were given to us and this is what's before us now I am hopeful I am definitely

[02:11:00]
full and I trust our staff to also be thinking about how these 6.5 hours are going to be utilized because I don't I don't see kids just sitting at a desk for like 6.5 hours I think it also gives an opportunity for that creativity in terms of project-based learning that sometimes never has enough time right so there's also an opportunity for us to sort of look at how those things are going to play out whether how art music plays into this and how PE I mean there are things that could make it actually even be a fun day it's like Doctor Who does telling us so I just I just wanted to point that out board member going is that what you know once the toothpaste is out of the tube and you're saying we're going to have our all of our children from Little 4 year olds all the way we don't have a choice in the same know we have a choice about that that they have to be there for six and

[02:12:00]
half hours there there's just has to be a different way to to figure out that $1,140 hours and to do that to children say oh will change that can change later well we didn't go back to half day kindergarten cuz all day kindergarten didn't didn't work so the fact that our little kids don't get to be kids is Despicable so so go ahead board member to me as I can hear you want to I was going to move okay go ahead of the option of the calendar so we're calling so option A was the calendar that include the Wednesday

[02:13:00]
the early release option b is the calendar that does not have the early release but has professional development days built into the calendar and so there is a motion and there is a second do I have any other discussion no just give me I have a real call please know Robert Peterson will carry on that and I just want to thank you again for your your time that you gave us your presentation and for presenting all the feedback you know just to our constituents out there we know that it's not going to be a perfect year but we've got to get started and we've got to be able to communicate with the with the with the community about what is going to look like and so go team thank you thank you

[02:14:00]
all right full bottle of wine yes Calgon take me away all right so our next item is an update on the right sizing discussion group and board member mulatto and you're going to give us an update please keep in mind too that the boundary changes and all that is included in the next item so maybe inclusive just some of the conversations beyond that yeah this will be quick so the discussion that we had at the last right so I've seen discussion group on in March was mostly just around boundary changes that would be able to be implemented this coming school year so as far as Corrales Elementary the community's priority has always been to try to keep their children in their Community School right in their Community which they haven't been able to do with their middle school

[02:15:00]
and so that was really the driving force behind the move to make Corrales a K-8 school and it has only it seems like only support for changing from an elementary to K-8 retaining and recruiting students was one of the main factors in recommending that Corrales become a small K-8 school which wouldn't be larger and I been 560 students if I remember correctly in the first year that would be just so far there's been 30 students at have been interested in insane and so they would be just a single sixth grade class and they would remain in the K-5 model and then the following year 7th grade would be outdated and then 8th grade would be out of the following year and then the Middle School model would then take over and then as far as I understand the boundary is going to be the same as it was for Carell's Elementary for

[02:16:00]
play 8 score and that's really it about Corrales and then for Janet Cohn it's set to become a non boundary Magnet School staying focused on the Arts and one of the benefits real big benefit for that is being able to do some of the recruiting to grow that school from you know students across the city and retain and I think their goal was to be about $500 I think they're at right around 300 or so right now and I know a family survey was was done that the results show even with the boundary changes that most of the families wanted their kids to stay at Janet Cohen and every student that there's going to have the option to to stay sixth grade will be added and then 7th grade and then 8th grade will be added each year after 6:00 a.m. and due to I as I understand this is a little

[02:17:00]
little bit this is going to be a little bit different than the K-8 and Corrales that it may be possible that there would be two sixth grade classes not just one that there was the interest for that and I know that they we were told that there was going to be a big advertisement campaign to advertise the changes and the kids that neighborhood kids that would go to Belhaven and Apache if they didn't choose they could shoot if they didn't choose Janet Kahn but there were also for those children that are kind of out of the neighborhood there's going to be super stops and those will be based on driven by numbers and so we were assured that that wouldn't be a strain on on buses and that you would just look at clusters of families and then decide on where those super stops would be and then the last boundary boundary kind of changes here is Laos and MacArthur which I know we did hear a lot

[02:18:00]
what about but the Lalu students are going to be redistricted to MacArthur which is I remember there was some Renovations already done and they have capacity to have close to 400 students so I think when they combined the enrollment of loose and MacArthur will still be under $300 students so there's still be a lot of capacity and the Pre-K for both of those schools in MacArthur are going to move to duranes and so I'm assuming that there's you know enough space for for all the Pre-K from La Luz and MacArthur what we want they wanted to make sure that everyone needs is that by increasing the school size that can bring along with that a lot more resources than a lot of the schools small schools really have and in the past from what I remember is they have these two schools have shared staff and principles before

[02:19:00]
so that will be helpful in the Lawless campus is going to be leased to the Albuquerque Sign Language Academy for a 2 years as they complete construction of their building there this will be like the first time that they'll be able to have a service at three different locations so all their kids will be able to attend school in one facility so that will be good and then it'll give time a few more years to decide on what the next steps would be for the law loose facility show in some of the concerns that were heard is that from some of the members were that we needed to have more Community input that a lot of you know the neighborhoods didn't know anything till after the fact that there's concerns about Early Childhood centers private you know preschools

[02:20:00]
not scale up like you know Public Schools could and what kind of access there really is to the private preschools they were also some corrections or misunderstanding that maybe a lot of the members had and the public had about tafts becoming a Bilingual School that is really not on the table anymore so they as far as I've been told is the Taft enrollment will be absorbed by by Taylor and then figuring out what's going to happen with Taft something that will be up for further discussion so some of the things were going to as Dr Blakey Durant said we were just kind of overwhelmed so we're going to have a better focus on continuing discussions and not have it like so so broad so we will continue discussions on the north west and southwest attendee attendance boundaries and then the Garfield have Taylor attendance area cons

[02:21:00]
the Coronado K-8 campus have some fiscal impact reports talk about Early Childhood centers and the CTE expansion but as far as the next meeting that's not scheduled until June 12th we're going to be discussing and correct me if I'm wrong if I got it wrong that we'd be discussing at that meeting the Coronado magnet school and then the aps dual language Pathways and have a physical analysis of the boundary changes for paralysis Janet Khan and a loose I what did I miss tried to do that fast do you have some questions I do I just want to see how are we dressing obviously we've had a lot of public comment regarding to Early Childhood hubs so where we at with that is it still more planning thoughts pause what's happening it's not

[02:22:00]
set up for discussion next in June okay so bored member tapio Romero thank you we can celebrate because we just recently hired a new Early Childhood director so we're very excited about that and as of right now you know we did listen to the concerns and so our idea is that we're going to start small to see how it goes and build a model in collaboration with our our private school providers and I know it feels like we're not collaborating right now but we have that is not part of what the action is that is happening at this moment in the right sizing so we're going to get there now that we have a director on board we're going to start putting together some planning

[02:23:00]
but we very much are about collaborating and wanting to make sure that we're serving our entire Community especially now with this new funding for pre-k for our state there's going to be a lot of need and so we want to be well positioned to make sure that we're serving all of our kids but I think at this point and I don't know if you want to speak more to it I think that's I have something to say so just so we know I was up in Santa Fe that I was approached by this organization's leadership and we discussed you know when would we begin collaboration and really there was some discussion about waiting until the session was over and then who would they want to collaborate with us we wanted to wait till he had a doctor so now that we have a director and they wanted to wait I think they have a president of the association who seems to be the one that will probably be the point of contact and you know we'll meet with the

[02:24:00]
there are models for this in Las Cruces in Farmington and will probably look at those and probably model ourselves after those and final question do we have a timeline on that are we looking this cuz obviously the funding that just came out from Santa Fe is for this upcoming school year because the grant is there now it's due the end of this month so what are we looking like timeline wise so right now we're looking at building a model building up our current Pre-K programs within our current schools that have them and then at that point what is the word I'm looking for scaling thank you there so

[02:25:00]
there are plans in place we've in the right size and committee we've had lots of conversations about what this could look like we've heard from private providers their concerns as well and so we want to to try to just work together to provide service for all of our kids the best that we can thank you thank you all right so any other questions for board member of God okay we'll move on to our next item which is a consideration for approval of boundary changes for La Luce and MacArthur Elementary Schools this discussion action and Dr Blakey you have four thank you for president Montoya quarterback members of the board I think that board member Miller gone really updated everybody for what has gone on with the work group one of the things that has come out from the work group that needs school board approval is

[02:26:00]
can you change a boundaries and for all the School boundaries this evening we also have members of principles of several of the schools including the Albuquerque Sign Language Academy if you do have questions that that come up about these changes so the first boundary change that we're taking to you for approval and we did review these at the last of the copt meetings before we moved into the work group and so these are the same those are the same boundaries nothing has changed within those Maps so this first one is McArthur this is consolidating loss in McArthur Elementary School that would change the boundaries for MacArthur Elementary School to incorporate the boundaries of elementary school so you'll see in front of you the map of the proposed attendance area change McArthur is a primarily walkables school and

[02:27:00]
who's currently has one school bus so I believe that that will still be the same type of transportation that will be needed for MacArthur because those two schools are within a mile of each other and so what we're looking at is approval of this boundary change and with that we stand for any questions can you just tell like really just quickly a little bit about what the community is thinking about the boundary changes cuz I know that was a concern for sure so we sent out communication to the families after last week's meeting we met with the staff the day after so that Tuesday and you know to be very honest I don't think that people are very shocked or surprised that's me putting in I have only heard from one family asking us to reconsider

[02:28:00]
they thought they had one more year with their school so they've seen that it was coming and so then the intention for the rest of the communication plan is that we are planning to meetings tomorrow and each of the families will be assigned of Apes liaison to help you any other questions know I like to make a motion to approve can I forgot I have a question and MacArthur Elementary Schools just there we go it's out there second now we have further discussion go ahead so you know I think you're right the family's had an inkling that this was coming I think what I found it's not the decision but how it came down is what I took from the emails

[02:29:00]
I received there was they decided that in February as recently as February they had been under the impression or had a meeting whereby they thought they were going to bring in that would become a hub or preschool and and so they were shocked that this was happening so quickly and you know I don't know if you received that email or if you responded so I don't know if I were talking about the same email what I can tell you when I met with the staff at La Luz Elementary there was some media after

[02:30:00]
the first right-sizing task force meaning that people began to form their own assumptions we never said anything the task force sent us back to maybe look at some different options because at the time I don't think we thought that it was the right time to jump into the preschool Hub conversation so I think it was an evolution of the conversation between the right sizing task force which we have been working on and then the board task force and the work that was tasked to us to come back to the task force so I think it's about how and sure the timing is never going to be right for us to talk about consolidation of a school because it's always going to be a sensitive it's always going to be sensitive in nature and

[02:31:00]
I guess the serves as a call right or wrong if we have small schools is what you're facing potentially I would I would agree with that because I know even you know being a member of the task force that conversation and I know I post that question is like when is too small too small because it definitely does I'm thinking back on our student outcomes focused governance and you know our desire to want to make sure that our students have full access and they have you know the full complimentary of services and it's hard when we have schools that are so small that they don't have the full complementary and so I know for the community this is it's very hard and I can imagine that their heart broken and that they're disappointed

[02:32:00]
what I'm also hopeful for and I'm hoping that in our communication is that the visits to MacArthur that they go over and that they find a renewed aspiration of all the things that their students are going to be able to have access to and how that's really going to be so beneficial to their kiddos in terms of just their whole academic experience with APS so I but I hear that too I mean there is there's always a sense of loss from a community who's you know this is their neighborhood school and that that doesn't fall on deaf ears for us it was a difficult decision it's a difficult hard thing to do but you know our job is to make sure that our students have the best opportunity to reach those outcomes that we want them so much to have and so I think I was impressed with how quickly you all were able to

[02:33:00]
who you know Flex based on some feedback that we had and but you know and I do want to say to is that the conversation has been conversational where we could bounce ideas off of each other and really sort of think that through so I really appreciate just a quick thinking and the pieces that went back and agree with you Mr Bell to around how when the media gets out and they announce something so quickly like that there was a lot of assumptions that were being made and I think that makes it really hard for the for the community so anyway board member Peterson did you want to add something yeah I I think again hats off to the committee I think you're trying to deal with difficult reality to the community and to the district and I really do appreciate that

[02:34:00]
feel like a board member we are in a hard spot because we're being asked sometimes to support charter schools that are less than half the size in closing down and at the same time being asked to close down schools that are embedded in the community that have history and ties and relationships and we are not in a business we are an educational organization and that's always got to be what leads and I mean I'm going to end up supporting this because I feel like we need time to make sure that the preschool Hub concept really studied so that when we implemented it it's implemented in absolutely the best way to in terms of curriculum and instruction

[02:35:00]
looks like for young children at the same time doing it in a positive relationship with the private providers that are real concerned and I don't think we're ready to do that without studying and sorry I think this is a short-term solution that gives us time but when we get those emails it's people who have historical relationships with the school and that's real and that's what keeps them connected to APS so my my one real question is I appreciate the work being done with students and families to make sure they have a soft hand off to whatever comes next for them what about for staff what's happening with staff so yes thank you very much for that question last week when we met with the entire

[02:36:00]
we did talk to them about having some choice in voice and what happens to them next many of them were hopeful if they could just go to MacArthur the reality of this particular situation is that even if we move all of the students from La Luz to MacArthur we would not have a need for every teacher to just move over so we will work through human resources the teacher will they have priority when it comes to placements for next year and I just want to add also the the quick thinking to on this you know with the two-year placeholder in adding The Sign Language Academy you know working with them to as they're going to

[02:37:00]
get ready to build their spot so the Charter Academy being able to utilize that spot I thought was really brilliant and it's a good use of you know just us developing that partnership because I know with that particular Charter feels a really important Niche you know it's it's it's it's a different type of group so I really appreciate the work that was being done with that as well so we have a we have a motion and we have a second is there any other discussion not I'll go ahead and call for the the vote please give me another one yes I need to do a point of order I have to go back to item on our special issues item a for the calendar just really quickly because one of the things that was pointed out is that we made a motion to approve the calendar

[02:38:00]
the changes but we didn't say anything about the college and career high school calendar in there and so we also needed to approve that one as well so may I have a motion on that place comma this is Barbara a second this is Josefina we have a roll call please baby yes Barbara Peterson yes they're still tap your Romero yes that's enough yes I'm sorry for that but thank God for our secretary pointed out and reminded me that we didn't do that and so did superintendent and Elders like oh so okay so I'm moving right along we're going to go out to item D which is consideration for approval of boundary changes for Corrales Elementary School and this goes along with the discussion on the changes that board member mulatto and was talking about thank you board member or president this evening we have

[02:39:00]
in front of you request for approval of the attendance boundary change for Corrales we also have the principal of Corrales Elementary in attendance if you have any questions this is to expand Corrales to a small K-8 school which would change the boundary particularly for the 6th through 8th to go to Taylor so there's nothing in the boundary that changes the current K5 boundary for Corrales what this does is change the current K5 boundary for Corrales into the K-8 for Corrales with the high school continuing to feed to Cielo high school as it does now and we asked for your approval of this boundary change I move for approval of the boundary changes for Corrales Elementary this is Crystal all second any discussion so

[02:40:00]
families that live in Corrales but actually wanted traditional middle school for their students do they have priority but no transportation to continue that Taft what's Taylor they wouldn't at this time until we change the policy for transfer they could and Taylor right now has room so they could transfer but it would be a transfer so Transportation would not be provided and they'll phase in so right now the we have current sixth graders so they would have transportation for the next two years but that Transportation will phase out this year 6 graders next year who currently get the bus from Taylor Swift 2425 school year you know this is a logical

[02:41:00]
sing the community wants it I still think it's a district we need to be cognizant that this Alters what schools look like and while we're looking at closing certain schools in the schools tend to be in neighborhoods with higher minorities higher socio-economic issues and this is a school that will make the needs very nicely of a community that doesn't really look like the rest of our demographics and so well I think that there are lots of logical reasons for doing this I also think that we need to address some hard issues that impact all of our schools and students

[02:42:00]
yes Robert Peterson yes you're still Tapia Romeo yes I need a Dominguez yes Brittany Jackson yes yes our next item is consideration for approval of boundary changes for Janet Kahn School of integrated Arts Magnet Belle Haven and Apache Elementary Schools also discussion action board president Montoya Cordova this request is to remove the boundaries that are currently for Janet Kahn elementary school as we face it in similar to Corrales in the next three years so this is to remove the boundaries of Janet Khan and make it into a cake mix School the students that currently go to Janet Khan would have priority for the next few years to be able to stay in that school students who do not want to go to genetic on would be redistricted in the new boundary areas that have the majority of

[02:43:00]
the students that live closest to Jenna comma as you'll see in the maps attending Belle Haven Elementary School and then because of the current boundary of Janet Kahn there is an area that backs up to the current boundary for Apache in the Four Hills Community and singing arrow those students would be rebounded to go to Apache Elementary School similar to their the rest of the neighborhood there and with that we stand for any questions or any discussion I mean the only question that I have that I know the people are asking is I know we're going to have those super stops in that there's the process is going to be looking at the clusters of families before their placed who is ultimately then going to make the decision the final decision on the

[02:44:00]
so that will be similar to how we provide super stops for the charter schools so it will be in combination with Mr Garcia and the school principal as far as where they're seeing the greatest need for families to have we already have committed that one of the stops would be in the singing arrow neighborhood because that is one of the current stops for the community and those families have asked to stay going to come but for the remainder it would be in the recruiting aspect of the school as they start to try to bring up the numbers and recruit as they meet with those families they will be able to you know find where the best stops for the families will be in conjunction with the school principal so it'll be the principal and then Mr Garcia that will kind of final decision will be made okay I'm sorry we're having a sidebar here okay any other discuss

[02:45:00]
do I have a motion I'll move for approval of the boundary changes for Janet Kahn Bellhaven and Apache hey Google which is going to be taking us to some of our charter school activities here so our first item for consideration of approval of the contract of performance framework for the Albuquerque Talent Development Academy we've got Mr Garcia and Dr Joseph Escobedo from Office of innovation choice and Lucinda Molina who is

[02:46:00]
what's the Albuquerque Talent Development Academy director right that's right okay so you have the floor Madam chairwoman members of the board superintendent Elder we're bringing forward a few Charter School items for your consideration want to let you know that we are working on Charter School Workshop tentatively scheduled for May 14th we will be designing and agenda that will help you to understand and support accountability processes that are our office uses with Charter Schools we hope to give you a national state and local perspective of our work we will be asking you to review policy procedural directive changes which will include a monitoring schedule and improve timelines to ensure we are in compliance in all situations with State Statute deadlines and I turn it to do for more specifics so

[02:47:00]
can I just do a quick clarification cuz you said May June 14th that's what I thought he said May 14th I was like that's a Sunday okay all right thank you for your consideration the contractor performance framework for Albuquerque Talent Development we did receive a couple of questions that I'd like to review with you if that's okay so one of the questions was about the requirement of the performance framework indicators that they'd be quality and rigorous and in the question was if they are it if the measures are quality in rigorous and I would say from our really trying to have that balance of quality qualitative assessment versus qualitative assessment as well so one of the questions was how is poverty status calculated and so what we do for our data indicators you know use the measurement of that comes from the public education departments

[02:48:00]
so then what's going to happen now when all the children receive lunches how is that going to be calculated then so actually I'll be close and I may need to get you more information but the way I don't know what I'm details but the way I understand it it's still the same they're still calling it the same but it's actually not using the forms it's using the snap counts and the measures of students enrolled in state services so but when we pull the day that we still on for the academic performance one of the questions was what is considered satisfactory performance so in the performance framework you'll notice the academic measurements that are proposed for each school we have taken into account I wanted to make sure you knew you were your goals as a board which are very helpful for us to have the conversations as we are embedding these academic

[02:49:00]
performance projections into the performance framework so for example for Albuquerque Talent if they did not reach satisfactory performance that would be for anything that is either working to meet or so 51 percent of prediction for example so there would satisfactory performance would equal and growth rate of more than 51% of prediction which for this year if you look at the data would be 7% for reading 6% for Math and 5% growth for science did you say more than 51% of prediction so for example in reading for this year there their they're expecting to have a rate of at least 7% so another question was what specific indicators would

[02:50:00]
current revocation is there any performance indicator item from our site visit protocol or are performance framework could result in revocation so if there's something that needs to be improved so our financials are audit was released each School developed a financial corrective action plan around their audit findings or meeting with them now when we go and test them and a month if they haven't started making those improvements we could signal to you hey we have a notice about satisfactory performance they're not moving forward we got it we got to do something and then finally one of the questions was what does aggregate growth rate so what we would be looking at is an average rate of growth over that one year period so that's the specific terminology in the in the performance framework so I'll turn it over to the cinema and to answer your questions

[02:51:00]
little nerve wracking here first I would you know I would like to say I do appreciate the time that we spent so we can kind of get to know one another and you guys get to know a little bit more about our school and the challenges that that we face that was also very informative also for us and also you had mentioned Capstone so we I scheduled for a presenter to come out and talk to us about Capstone so it looks like we need my stuff and I are all on board with that and we will be moving forward with that so I do thank you for mentioning that very informative and we're actually very excited to to work with them on Capstone that's great thank you I think with the population that you're serving a Capstone option is definitely

[02:52:00]
appropriate so I really appreciate you taking a look at that yeah thank you for mentioning that any other questions go ahead I just have a couple of them so on the academic performance indicators at the at the bottom it has probably the second sentence starts with although Target growth percentages for each level are provided as long as a total growth total growth across all ranges meats or succeeds the aggregate growth rate so is that just a typo and it should have said exits instead of succeeds OK Google I just assumed so and then when it comes to Dr Escobedo you were talking about quality and rigor and you felt that these proposed IND

[02:53:00]
there is war of quality and rigor I mean that is that what you are saying the whole performance framework together yes so there's I think the whole document together to hold the school economy that measure okay and then so when it comes to the growth rate I saw on the academic performance indicators and like you said 7% for this coming school year and math 6% 5% and then it you know goes up the following year and basically stays the same in 2526 and then it kind of goes down because we get to a point where it's difficult to obviously get that kind of growth so is that something that you feel is appropriate and that it would be considered good growth like if you're growing reading by 7% this next school year in your opinion that growth rate so I don't

[02:54:00]
growth over five five years in each of these areas so if you if you take kind of that Assumption of they're saying their level 3 Performance students and rating would be 10% in year one that 25% you know and so they kind of well and then they they're also moving other students to level four which is exceed so

[02:55:00]
I think it matches your goals and I think it matches what the school believes that they can do with their strategic plan and what's important is what you know is achievable I think that's what's important we can have big numbers but if they're not achievable we'd rather have something that's achievable and so if you could specifically kind of tell me doctor if because we obviously had some some concerns about the academic performance right so if you just picky picky I don't care what year it is 2425 27/28 and tell me what what you think when you're looking at those scores and looking at the growth rate what could really Merit revocation like and I don't care what you pick you could pick science you could pick

[02:56:00]
it doesn't matter to me I just want something like specific that we would look at and go this is not good would it be that they didn't you know get that growth rate of you know in science at 10% like what would be considered like you probably should have your Charter remote first of all so if they didn't if they had their growth rate is below 50% to look at is so in year 2 24/205 they have 95% of their students and they haven't grown additionally through our site visits they're not implementing their their strategic plan they're not making games and making changes that

[02:57:00]
I said they were all of that combined I think is a notice of unsatisfactory performance with the data so you helping us and pushing us to ensure that this data is in there is a quantitative indicator there's qualitative things that I think we take into account with the twice semester visits that we do to understand whether the school's moving forward or we have I'll give you an example we have one school and turn around today and they're in the third year new principal and the culture change is it's significantly different there's no chaos the school students are engaged the teachers are walking around and they're showing some growth in their short cycle assessments if they if they only got 71% and in level one

[02:58:00]
then I don't think we bring to you a notice of unsatisfactory performance so I think it's a balance of how we approach it as well so the soonest that we're really going to be able to see anything is going to be at the end of next school year right that we will be like yeah this is maybe not quite working so that would be obviously the soonest that absolutely the sentence but if we go in semester one Lucinda leaves there's a new principal moving and that they have it moved forward everything's and Shortcake you know we could come to you and say earlier than that but with all systems as normal we visited the school you know why system like what's the story behind the data of what we're looking at through our compliance indicators but also the conversations that they have which is which is important it's not just

[02:59:00]
you're all about those numbers it's about everything about the school okay thank you any other questions discussion do I have a motion I will make I'm trying to find it I will make a motion for discussion is consideration of the approval of the contract and performance framework framework for Corrales International School this is all so discussion action so

[03:00:00]
superintendent Elder we do have for your consideration the contractor performance framework for Corrales international school so their mission specific goals are really around standards-based assessment improvements for reading and math and writing they're also measuring writing and speaking in a language proficiency assessment which really parallels their specific Mission and Mr Mark Tolley is here to answer your questions thank you welcome Mr Tully any questions from the board well I think I have a question just this this framework is less dense than the one we just looked down and so I guess my question is more to doctor Escobedo is I mean first of all you have some pretty good assessment results here and so I'll get to that in a second but why the difference in density

[03:01:00]
governance changes we were we are kind of embracing in the administration we're looking at liquidity and measuring it through our site visit processes and rolling it up like for example under financial performance where in the past we've had a specific indicator for liquidity that you would have approved so we're using the same information it's just kind of how we're reporting it out and the other school and their attorney I don't like they wanted those details to be very clear in the approval for the way we work and our processes it really doesn't matter but I understand the legal position that they have okay yeah so it's

[03:02:00]
almost like this is the same information just visually it's different okay so I guess kind of a similar question to you sir and I apologize I missed your name and are these are these goals that you feel you can meet while still having rigger for the students and be able to meet the satisfactory and above that will be required Madam president members of the board member tax and I believe we can do them in fact they may be a little conservative but with the new test and the results we saw after taking the new standardized test from the state we still got to work on some things to see that why we didn't maybe do as high as I thought we should do and comparatively with some other schools that we always kind of compare ourselves with the international language I think we can outperform it but I am conservative until I see

[03:03:00]
more about to what's affecting our testing a little more any other questions I just always want to congratulate you just do a phenomenal job with all of these children and as an educational leader which I believe you truly are I just want to let you know that I'm just always I'm just always so proud of what you and your staff does and just proud of all those kids so just want to let you know that I'm thank you my fan of yours too and I would love any of you all of you to come out and see what we do and I'll move for approval of the contract and performance framework for Corrales International School this is Crystal second any other discussion go ahead this is actually a general charter school question that maybe you can answer when

[03:04:00]
are you obligated by Statute to pay teachers at the same rate as its set by the legislature for licensure levels and matching members of the board member Peterson absolutely where public school just like any others we will pay 1% if she signs it if the governor signs it tomorrow we will pay 5 not an average of 5 but everybody gets 5 which I guess is an average but yes ma'am thank you absolutely yes yes yes congratulations thank you thank you all right our next item is consideration of

[03:05:00]
the approval of the contract and performance framework for Montessori of the Rio Grande yes and so again their mission specific goals by the president members of the board are around habits of mind and a final writing project and we did get one question about how the rubric for the final project was developed and it was developed by the staff as they looked at the indicators of that they wanted to each the kindergarten third graders and 5th graders to made for their exhibition their final project performance and there was one question about is the school using standards based assessment for measuring reading and Math and Science and they are and you may notice that their growth in their academic performance does not meet the same measure as the whole District part of that is looking at the data and their levels of performance of students

[03:06:00]
79 to 89 * it seems to be a little more difficult so tell him what is here and she can answer any questions that you might have thank you would you like to make a statement at all or just like to thank you very much thank you any questions do I have emotions so it's a different type of approach so it's not for everyone either

[03:07:00]
do all standardized testing iStation reading and math for all five of our grades we do it take 5 so we can track our cohorts of children and obviously we do you know sure yes I'm very familiar with Montessori even though it's been a long time both my kids attended and my daughter had two very different Montessori experiences one was close to student housing so it was easy but it wasn't very diverse and eventually moved over to something that was closer to this was an awesome Texas and it was more diverse and while I support your mission I would love to see I would love to see your demographics improve especially

[03:08:00]
among Hispanics because your situated in Uranus and not far from the elementary school correct and and I made that clear to one of your illustrious clients who has his child there and he assured me that that was something that the school was would be working on we have a plan period

[03:09:00]
the way that a family would like to bring it to us we've had open houses and so we are really working at looking at our population and how we can increase that but we are you know governed by Lottery and so we have to honor that process so I guess I'm not familiar with that so you have to have a lottery

[03:10:00]
unless they have a sibling preference and then we have a wait list so every family that enters our Lottery knows where they stand so either they know yes we have a kindergarten position or we're on our wait list so they can see what we're first on the wait list and most of the times I will call and kind of ask a lot of questions we do tours so that is a lot of process so we draw from 25 zip codes around the city and you know surrounding areas and we do have families that live in our neighborhood that have our Lottery but every every time I have a lottery so how does Lottery then allow you to improve demographics

[03:11:00]
what about since the board meeting was so how do you be intentional and language how do you be intentional and Partnerships and you know the Asian Family Center to make sure that they know that the monitor to Rio Grande is there so different different outreaches and just pushing themselves to get the lottery applications to be more diverse the family is also know like it is Spanish right so they can understand and so so that family and remind me how many students do you say we have 2165

[03:12:00]
incoming kindergarteners with older siblings okay to first grade openings wow it's really hard because family because we don't have no family is moving unless they're even moving on state or and sometimes family moved because like you said long story is not necessarily for everybody period I just want to hide you like fantastic job I love hearing these type of success stories and how you're doing everything right so thank you thank you thank you feedback from last time to incorporate into the lottery process so I think the responsiveness of what you heard is appreciated

[03:13:00]
but yeah well done like maybe think about expanding do we have a motion on this one I will make a motion without a doubt to approve thank you the contract and performance framework for Montessori of the Rio Grande I will second all right baby thank you so much okay our next item for consideration for approval of the charter renewal for the term of 5 years for El Camino Real Academy we bring to you your consideration for the renewal application for El Camino as you recall the schools renew

[03:14:00]
disabled because of your concerns about performance we could have gone through the process and that's what we will be improving in procedural directive and policy moving forward is if you were to have a concern and sharing that there's time to honor the contract that allows the school to respond and provide a plan for improvement I think that's the important stuff that we need to take and moving forward so this time compared to last time that you know we had to Renewal concern it was about missing the deadline so the the hearing officer didn't rule that the board should approve the renewal and again we will be working with them to do the same process that we've done with the other schools of looking at their academic performance to hold them accountable to the same processes and so you know one of the questions that we've received was

[03:15:00]
and why did our office recommend approval so when we look at the standards and law about why you cannot renew a school we felt that the school was moving forward in that contract and that performance framework but allowing and what we're moving towards together and having those academic goals being really specific in the performance framework as that level of rigor and accountability because state law currently says we could raise concerns about performance if the school fail to meet or make substantial progress toward achievement of Department standards of excellence which was written in regarding the school grading system so that no longer exists so we need to adjust our systems we've adjusted now to what we've done with the academic goals and so I think that helps us moving forward with the time line so we're trying to adjust and improve and we will continue to do that

[03:16:00]
okay any discussion I do go ahead so what you said Dr Escobedo is that the hearing officer didn't say that we had to approve the renewal only said that we missed the deadline and as a result of missing the deadline where were we were at is that kind of the the wording on page 1344 so what exactly approving it without conditions what does a without conditions mean to help me but I think by inter

[03:17:00]
definition of that would be if you said we will approve the charter for 5 years if they bring us a plan by next week of XYZ okay cuz I mean I don't like that without conditions but that's that's me is that correct though I mean we like we're being told that we have to do something and then we don't just get to do the job period

[03:18:00]
have had multiple conversations about how to improve the process and specifically I hope El Camino hears this that the performance framework they are working on with Joseph excuse me it's going to be substantially more specific and give this individual and this department the opportunity to bring back short answer is yes and it's just a hard one had in December we didn't have enough time so those are some of the processes that will obviously change so I get that but that's had that night we not tabled

[03:19:00]
have we not tabled and just voted right instead what we did is tabled which we probably shouldn't have because if we had voted we would have met that deadline and then we wouldn't be in this position or not so good I know they would have appealed it but yeah but we would have been they couldn't have said we didn't do something in a timely manner right or could they have still correct we would not have missed the deadline period

[03:20:00]
play Thunder nose but they did not agree to an extension which put us in a very difficult position now the second part of your question is if we had voted obviously if the vote had been yes the school would have moved forward without any further Ado if you will if the vote had been no knowing this charter school they would have appealed and what I have to say is that that night and I take in large responsibility for this we did not previously say if you intend to reject or not guidelines and certain benchmarks that you must explain in your decision when you vote so

[03:21:00]
I know that there was dissatisfaction with the charter school and it was explained and yet as we go forward in this process we hope to give you more specific benchmarks so that if there is an appeal they can't just say well they just said they didn't like that school I'm overstating that but they didn't like that school or they didn't think there was enough of this we need very specific data to support your decision and that's on us and on me so it's a good Learning lesson I guess both as I recall we were pretty specific about what we thought about the academic outcomes about the financial viability I mean I remember many of us being very specific about what we were thinking if I could be incorrect but that's what

[03:22:00]
remember you are a Madam president and Peggy Muller Aragon your conversation was generalized in that direction but you did specifically say you didn't like their academic performance what I have to say is that looking at like this now and the listing and tagged to specific indicators

[03:23:00]
and so while I understand and perhaps we know the charter schools better than some of them do but I understand your frustration and I understand where you were in terms of saying we don't like what we see I have to say that if you had voted no I don't think we had enough in terms of specificity and that's a very good word to support an appeal and say we were correct and I'm hoping that after we go through this next iteration there will be no no opportunities for charter schools to win on appeal which would mean they would overcome your decision who should have been because we're obviously not lawyers and don't understand contract

[03:24:00]
but who's responsible for for telling us will you probably need to be more specific you know text us and tell us you know you should be more specific or had we tabled like we did I mean who's responsibilities to tell us it's mine OK Google and I did not anticipate that the level of of discussion and frustration that you all you had would come forward this process so that

[03:25:00]
neither side is caught caught shorthanded and you know I if I had been here I'm not sure I would have reacted much more quickly than Joseph I think in good faith I think he thought if we delay or table we can work this out it didn't happen so I just don't ever want that to happen again but I take responsibility okay because they didn't give us the extension which they could have they could have at least done that they could have but we also could have had we tabled it we could have also had an emergency meeting where you could have told us okay you need this this and this and we would have just we would have been able to do that before before the break correct so it's a lesson learned respectfully that was long like I think December 30th December 8th when the

[03:26:00]
record and there were no there could be an emergency meeting not an emergency a special meeting but there were no more meetings in December because I talked about oh wow they're not they're not cooperating how do we get back in front of the board and honestly we could have though somehow right I would like to thank you so you know lesson learned that's all I can say and and I apologize because I didn't do a good enough job I just want it I mean I just know that what we have to realize on a consent calendar anything can get any of us want to pull something off we can so that means anybody who's on consent needs to come prepared as I mean I know all the stuff I mean they

[03:27:00]
is come prepared not knowing if something's going to get pulled off concerned or not so that's something that everybody should know that's those are the rules so and I mean I agree right so I mean I wish we would have at least done at least on that but if and I understand even if we could appeal this to District Court right I mean we could I know we could the chances of us getting anywhere are probably like almost zero that's what I've been told anyway so it's been money right it's almost going to be 0 so do you want to spend the money to do that but a question that I have and it's probably too late obviously for this but Camino Real realizing they're not doing what's right by kids and in the end it's a children that are getting getting harmed with these you know very very very very very poor outcomes which is what I care about I care about

[03:28:00]
bottom line is what's going to be best for kids and the school is not what's best for kids can they themselves voluntarily rescind their application if they wanted to of course yes I know that's not going to happen cuz the right thing is not going to be done by the children but just just wanted to put it out there but I mean thank you for I just hope in the future if it means and I don't know and who would be able to answer this question is if we're in the middle of something like you know this comma Camino Real renewal and you are listening and you're just kind of going they may not be going kind of the right way is that possible for us to to stop and go into a closed session so that you can give us good legal advice I don't know if that's possible if it's not on the agenda though it's very difficult that would be

[03:29:00]
cuz we're not perfect solution that the administration is proposing is to First have a training session where we work together to start a new calendar of events moving everything earlier in the process and not getting caught up against a deadline period

[03:30:00]
so do you still think that when it comes to I mean I'm sure it's not just Charter renewals that we should still just have something on there that says that we could go into closed session if needed like is that something that we could put on there I just seen that on other boards where they just they don't necessarily do it but they sometimes think they may have to talk to their lawyer and they just have it on their kind of like a placeholder stay within the confines of the open meetings act which is threatened or pending litigation which we didn't anticipate the purpose of the workshop is for us to be able to work out some of these details and we'll talk about all of the what ifs and what could be potentially do I mean so I think we're going to have an opportunity to to go to that I've been working with Dr Jessica and art on this so that we can get the workshop

[03:31:00]
told him we could pull a better process together and I appreciate that they want to do it with us with all of the questions that we might have so that they can help to build that process with the things that were concerned about we just have to address some of the I mean emissions that you were kind of talking about and making sure that those are taken care of the damages in the end or just to the children okay so here we are on this one do I have any other discussion yes I have three questions so so first is you said that we first in the thing it says shall approve that's what you're talking about like we're going to have to swallow this and take it okay so this is being approved without a performance framework is that correct so Madam president of the board so that's where the next step so like we did tonight with all

[03:32:00]
we will begin our process of negotiating with them those academic indicators and bring the contract to you okay and when will we will when will we see the performance framework you will see it for the board meeting the first board meeting for May so it's coming to my final question that you were talking about that I mean these deadlines all this stuff these I just want to hear it again these will be incorporated into a procedure so that as we are moving forward we are not going to miss deadlines we are we are going to have tags that we we can think of yes this will be incorporated I think if I could just be honest

[03:33:00]
I'm in my seventh year in this position having this Workshop has been a 7-year drink because dreams come true because it is the role of the board to be an authorizer so you know we've been doing our work the best we can work this so that we can understand your concerns and have a conversation with the school we missed the deadline but if we know through those mistakes now that we can line up the monitoring schedule the process to engage you as a board to invite you possibly to come to our site visits to say hey see what we're saying I think that's a fantastic idea and it it brings to my

[03:34:00]
and then I'll stop but my very first day and this is what Mr Merlin was talking about like you want to be able to put us in a position that if there is something that we don't that should not be reauthorized we're in that position to be able to do that and it brings to mind my first day of tax law my first class and tax law okay the the attorney or the professor walked in and said the goal is to pay as you taxes as possible and I almost feel like the goal of this is to make sure that they have to prove to us that they are they have married right and so I love that you're doing that thank you so much dreams come true and and thank you and I just want to add to that my dream on this song is that

[03:35:00]
what will happen for us is because we have so many charter schools and it is almost like a Zone unto itself that a lot of our work around Charters will be like a very specific board meetings that would be just dedicated to that so it wouldn't be like caught up in these other things if we do bring him to like they'll be in specials but then when we do come to the board meeting we're ready for consenting at that point if we have to if we have to do it that way but my my ID on this was that one we get to the workshop so that we can figure out what the calendar looks like what's really in front of us what what are what's the playing field of charter schools that we have within the district but then sort of laying out the process for the governance of this on how that's going to work for us as a board because it's very unique and it's very specific board member Peterson and then I bought a move us along so

[03:36:00]
June 14th for our Workshop they announced it at the beginning so and then my last question that I just forgot that I have here and I know that's member Jackson had said you know it's a shell approved so they're telling us how we have to vote they're saying we shall approve that saying we have to vote Yes is that I mean that's what shall means and if we are just get some rest area and so can I just get a motion please

[03:37:00]
one thing that really bothers me along with many things about the way Charters are structured is that we have little control over them the demands I look at the people sitting at this table and think about the number of other responsibilities besides overseeing Charters that they have that the amount of administrative demand that is put on us to be responsible for Charters well we are not compensated I mean I can't tell you how much I appreciate the other work that you do like lobbying like overseeing hopefully Innovation that carries on Beyond into every school that it is

[03:38:00]
Academy Academy

[03:39:00]
Barbara Peterson with handcuffs on yes Crystal tap your room now Sophia Dominguez only cuz we're forced to yes Brittany Jackson with great concerns yes all right okay so our next item for discussion the approval of the amendment to the contract for East Mountain High School this is a discussion action so finally we have Eastmont high school with a request to change their mission to increase their enrollment cap and to expand to Middle School the school's mission is does have a typo from myself it is problem solving that problem solving or within us additionally as the school develops a plan

[03:40:00]
to expand to Middle School are they will be required to meet with us so that we understand their plans not only facility wise but their curriculum design in expansion and making sure that there's proper transition in their school and it's been a great pleasure to work with Trey and see their continued success and I'll turn it over to Trey if he wants to say something that you thank you madam president members of the board he's not in high school as a long history of success we first opened in the year 2000 we're entering our 2330 year and we're out of her accomplishments and looking forward to what's next for our school and the future of our school we're proud that we offer high quality educational experience you know about our national Blue Ribbon award that sort of thing but our demand for the school continues to increase a lot especially recently and so this Charter Amendment passed unanimously by

[03:41:00]
does two things first it rewards are mission statements post covid are stakeholders really wanted us to have a mission statement that was more informative and aspirational and that's what we did with our mission statement and second the second part as Dr Escobedo mentioned is to expand our enrollment we just recently admitted 110 freshmen for the upcoming school year and we have 40 more families who are calling us every day to ask how can we get into the school and we just have to expand our enrollment cap to be able to do that and so to do that we need this so we can do that by next year but also we're looking to the Future where we want to make sure we are serving the needs of our families and the area and we have a Monumental task before us as a 9312 school where we are upcoming freshman class is representative of 29 different middle school programs 29 and that's

[03:42:00]
students and families back into the districts and to the public school Arena so we take that obligation seriously and we think we do have an obligation to serve more families because families are demanding it and we need to expand so that we can do that and this amendment is the first step in that process that's going to allow us to explore our options to expand so thank you for your time and to any questions I haven't had a chance to speak tonight so I think I'm going to go first I want to take my time I want to take it so Dr Jessica did I hear you correct in saying that they're coming with the amendment but the work still has to be done in terms of like the plan to get there so I'm wondering why we don't have a plan first before we approve in Amendment so I'm bored president board members I'm so

[03:43:00]
the school brought that forward and that was our discussion was you know that this question might might come up we would require it either way and so the school felt that that was the request and I think we honor whatever decision you make it bring back that Middle School option of expansion in the future of I think for the school's view I'm trying to speak for himself but it allows them to start the planning process so we're proving an amendment though that includes a 6 through 12 but we're really not there because it's really about expanding the cap for high school on part of its once expanding the cap for the entirety so 6 through 12:00 and they'll be a cap the new cap of 550 and the real issue is like we don't currently have the facilities to to support that and what we're learning in the construction process and talking to folks who can help us explain the facility is they need to see the approval first before they will even entertain the idea

[03:44:00]
I would admit that but we need the approval before we can actually start the planning especially in regards to facilities and you said that your middle schoolers are coming from our district obviously so we're going to lose enrollment so that you can increase your enrollment I wouldn't because we have that number of 29 different middle schools and so we have students who are coming from private schools from home schools from other districts because of the nature of where we're located so it's not that we're going to be I don't see us like losing significant District students to come to our school we're just meeting the needs of the families in the area I have other questions but I'll stop there cuz I I have some concerns about that board member happy Romo I actually I don't have any questions regarding this program

[03:45:00]
hello hello hi I went to visit and I'm very impressed with with what you doing I don't doubt that you know East Mountain High School is a viable and admirable option for those families that choose it as a high school and when we met and you mentioned this plan to expand I mentioned immediately where does Roosevelt Field and so you know I I support your efforts to expand because I think it's important for the East Mountain Community to have the option of a high school in that

[03:46:00]
and it's about the same amount of distance to Manzano as it is to your school from chili Lee which is the outermost southern boundary so I love kids have choice that way but I cannot I don't I don't feel good about supporting the application to expand to a middle school and here's why when I look at your demographics what's going to happen is that this move will essentially segregate the East Mountain and to the economically advantage and the economically disadvantaged and it would change the rich diversity

[03:47:00]
what is historically the East Mountain what we know traditionally is the East Mountain Area Roosevelt Middle School has strong leadership very collaborative forward thinking he's a team Builder he honors a varied communities needs he's enriching the curriculum for all students I think he recently the school applied for stem officially stem status though he's been doing stem and on the social end he's scheduling after school dances from 3 to 5:00 so as to include those small communities

[03:48:00]
he's got an incredibly committed staff most of them live in the East Mountain area and so they're highly invested in the schools they voted to give up prep periods in order to offer 1 to 3 electives to every child they've been building the stem classes on they've won two years in a row the electric car challenge they received the aps Education Foundation Grant to build a vertical farming project to align with what is happening next door at 8:20 and he's also working with us and they're working on creating a stem track to Manzano again to give High School options to those kids and if you visit Roosevelt Middle School you're going to see all the

[03:49:00]
heuristics that Mr Lorenz pointed out about East Mountain High School hands on group projects engage students passionate committed teachers and so you're proposing your proposal to expand in my view threatens that that very solid program by members of the chamber for recognizing your own certainly there are good things going on

[03:50:00]
there is no doubt they're a great things going on and I would urge the chamber folks who seem to have tunnel vision for schools like East Mountain to go visit virtually any one of our other schools and see amazing things going on when I look at your demographics what's what's what's the percentage of Hispanic population community hospital

[03:51:00]
ethics and I'm thinking because we we hear a lot from the chamber community in the business Community about everything that we do wrong but I look at this when I look at the percentage of economically disadvantaged kids it is not a moral statement I look at this and go these kids have medical care I look at this and I go these kids probably have pretty good nutrition these kids probably are not worrying about where they're going to sleep when I get home or if they're going to be evicted with all of their possessions out on the sidewalk I look at this and think you know the they have transportation when they're when they're sick their parents have jobs where they stay home to take care of those kids rather than pulling a child out of school to stay home with his sibling because Mom or Dad cannot

[03:52:00]
afford to miss work they can't afford to stay home and have to leave that they need to take care of other people so I look at this and go yeah let's let's look at what you're doing curricular and let's really look at how do we scale it and you know what I look at Dr Segura and think we're doing a whole bunch of that already where I think about the the stem the agricultural stem pathway that we're looking at for the South Valley it's extraordinary and it's not exclusionary when I look at the stem pathway at Garfield Avenue it's phenomenal and it's not exclusionary and I look at this and think you know this is great you have Geographic diversity enrollment

[03:53:00]
play zip code it means every single one of those kids has a vehicle that can get them there every day and so I mean I don't mean to just pile this on you because I think you're working hard to to take care of the kids that are in your school and you do a good job but it is not reflective of who we are as a community and I don't think it's doing a favor to this group of students to feel like they are somehow extraordinary and separate from the Roseville Community from the Montoya community and from the community and this troubles me a whole lot a lot because it's not representative we can we can give you all of the kudos for being the Blue Ribbon school and I don't doubt that you have an amazing

[03:54:00]
but so do numbers and numbers and numbers of our other schools and so I do feel a sense of outrage when I look at how dedicated and hard-working my high school teachers at Highland High School are with a group with a community that is fundamentally different from the community that goes to East Mountain and then gets compared to and held up as being something disgraceful instead of who they are and who they serve 44% Roosevelt Avenue first of all I think what's exclusionary is keeping our enrollment cap small because what's actually going to help is going to expand our enrollment that's

[03:55:00]
any issue about the enrollment keeping us at a small number is isn't going to fix it allowing us to accept more students from the families for demanding it that is actually what's going to help with those issues so I think keeping an enrollment cap small is what's exclusionary second of all if you look at the numbers and the outcomes we have a 60% proficiency rate of students who are on free and reduced lunch so we have those students charter schools have to take students from every different and we're doing good work with those students and that's important to note and third of all the demographics of East Mountain High School are actually way more diverse than the East Mountain area that we serve so our school is more diverse than the local community that even reflects and finally it's just the law that Charters are inherently based on that makes them like it is actually more inclusive I think than the traditional Public School model because in a traditional Public School model you have your Bound by those boundaries we have to be open to

[03:56:00]
written that way and so we don't get to pick and choose our students it's not exclusionary and the fact that it is exclusionary is because of our enrollment cap and we need to increase that so we can serve more students can I mean go ahead go ahead there is a whole lot of research about what it looks like when you have truly and economically diverse school and what happens in this is you reflect what statue is I mean without your following the law this is what the statute

[03:57:00]
capacity to get to East Mountain it means that what Roosevelt looks like becomes more and more segregated that the that the concentration of socioeconomic impact for school becomes greater and that means that when when you look at East Mountain High it looks exactly like what what nationality looks like which is when you have when you have a much more diverse economic group everyone does better that having that richness improves outcomes for everyone the problem is when you have that impact on Roosevelt in

[03:58:00]
Manzano otherwise the impact on those schools means that those communities become less and less diverse that the concentration of all of all of the things that I laid out become more concentrated it reduces the choice it reduces the success of students in those schools in the schools that we are still responsible for deal with because it is taking away the diversity and this is not on you as an individual or Eastern as an individual school but it's what is happening across the district because of the way Charter's interact and impact the

[03:59:00]
so it becomes harder for Manzano to to offer that rich array of offering to give school that gives students Choice when they are there it impacts with other Charters the same thing with Highland I mean they struggle to be able to offer the diversity of curriculum that those students deserve because there is this narrative that somehow they are inferior that they are not going to make kids needs that you are putting your child in danger by sending them to Highland and so it's my frustration is like it's nice by East Mountain but it's not it's not in your lap as being the one and only it's what that whole structure looks like

[04:00:00]
that's just a narrative that I don't accept or communicate with our families as a Manzano high school graduate myself I grew up in the on the in the East mountains and it's not high school is not an option for me I had to go either 30 or 4 minutes 30 to 40 minutes away either to Moriarty or to Manzano and chose Manzano and the reason I am an educator the reason I am as a school principal because of the teachers I had at Manzano high school and I never speak ill of Manzano I love Manzano I still believe a little purple and I think it's important that we share with our families as a state how do we find the best fit for your students and there are plenty of families who choose Manzano because it is a better fit there are plenty of families who chose homeschooling because it's a better fit and that's all that's the message that we talked about was just finding the right fit for your student and for a lot of our local families in the East Mountain Area having a school that's five minutes away is a good fit and our

[04:01:00]
academic outcomes kind of speak for itself and is an attractive option so you kind of said a little bit what I was about to you know to mention there and I think that's what it comes down to like I don't think at any point was this stupid one school against the other I say one's better than another for me personally I'm saying this like if parents are requesting it and they're wanting an expansion for their Community for their family and in my opinion as a Mom myself apparently will find a way like if this is what they want and they want something different than what's currently there with the schools in the district they will find a way to have other options and personally I believe you're outcomes and your proficiency score support it we just approved a school that none of us wanted to approve like we just like I shouldn't say we I did not you know and none of us wanted to even include that yet we

[04:02:00]
have a school here that is shown to be effective shown to make an incredible anchor in the East Mountain Community parents are requesting it and to me I'm just like we're attacking you for wanting to do something right for the community of that area and it makes me sad because I think ultimately parents do know what's best for their children I love what you support here I love that you gave us all the data for showing how diverse you are what areas you're pulling from and I get sometimes it does it doesn't quite make sense that we have to approve this first before the plan is and that ultimately that was completely out of your control you know but I think it's important to have this as an option to the East Mountain Community even in terms of what we deal with snow days and all the craziness that happens up there which is

[04:03:00]
just knowing that you are all looking on how you can serve better I refuse to hold that against you like I think what you're doing has been remarkable and again the first thing I look at is I look at your scores and your proficiency rates and how you're serving and obviously the lottery is in effect that's in effect for all charter schools so you're doing what's right by families there and dang I just don't know how it got to that level and I'm just however this turns out tonight I want you to personally know like I support your program your school many of us said we visited your school and you were doing a great job so why would we want to continue I totally Mr Smith totally agree I mean we did just approve a school that is absolutely horrible so I guess

[04:04:00]
if you were doing horrible you would have our support what can I say what happens when you do when you do well and I never see that a great school like yours is a threat to any of the traditional schools I don't see it as a threat at all I see it as a choice that parents should have have a right to make and we just said there should be you know Montessori that school that just got you know approved as well has a lot of the similar demographics that that you have very similar yet they got approved and we said that schools like that should be replicated so I think what you're doing is absolutely amazing and you're giving the community What It Wants much like what Corrales did by you know they're going to be a K-8 school and so you just want to be on a Midtown you know six to 12th grade so very similar and

[04:05:00]
I'm looking also as what is best for for children and I'm looking at your proficiency levels and going wow I mean our American you know native students 80% in ela 80% in math that's phenomenal I mean that's what the native population knows that their children can do and you're making sure that those kids are getting what they need and that's what the native population has asked for because they believe in their children as well are black I mean it's 100% which I believe it has nothing to do with the color of your skin it's it's how your talk cuz every child can achieve at the highest levels Hispanic 62 I mean it's like how in the world and then like you just said are free and reduced price meals I mean they're in ela is almost 54% in English and 46 in math much better than what we're doing and why we wouldn't want to have

[04:06:00]
are middle school children choose to go there and I saw all the zip codes that you know do attend your school and that's pretty pretty phenomenal so I just think just like I have about you know Montessori and about you know Corrales that you're doing a great job and you deserve to I mean you deserve to have this the when do you think you would be able to have the facility to yeah it's only a couple of your project out because we have to hear from construction and Architects is we need the approval once we have the approval then we can start to pursue that probably a two year to build any sort of facility that can support this and this is like really very Community Driven much like what Corrales was absolutely you giving the community what their what they're asking for you getting to keep the kids there that

[04:07:00]
does high schoolers most of them would have probably want to go there for Middle School you're giving them what they want and I just want to just tell you I think you're doing an absolutely fantastic fantastic job I am very sure your dad is up there and is extraordinarily proud of everything that you're doing I just want to add that you said something that was really important and that was just to make sure that we had a lot of choice and availability for the families in the east side and we do I mean I think there's like two wonderful elementary schools we got Santa Anita which is you know beautiful and wonderful doing great stuff we've got aim and Toya we've got Roosevelt Middle School and we've got East Mountain and I agree that there are families on that side that don't want to have to come over the mountain but we've also made it possible with the choices that we've made available as a as a district in terms of what's available for our

[04:08:00]
I agree with my you know if I lived over on that side of the mountain just you know knowing snow days and everything that happens I would want to know what the landscape is that's available for families and I so so where I'm trying to figure out how to get to how do we also let our communities know we do have choices for you in that that really fit that desire to want to not have to travel so far and I mean but I think for the families that choose to go over the mountain to go over to that's a different story but I hear first and foremost your your first thought is is to support those East you know those East Mountain families right that are living in that area so that they have that is a choice and that makes absolute sense to me it absolutely makes sense to me think the other side for me just as I know one of the things that we're grappling with as a district

[04:09:00]
is loss of enrollment and I know that a big piece for us has been talking about how do we maintain enrollment or grow enrollment also in Albuquerque Public Schools and not lose enrollment so that's another concern that we certainly have and because it impacts us also in in a huge way and I I certainly could support an application that would be to increase your cap for high school I really could support that I would feel that that would make a lot of sense I just don't feel comfortable going through the six through 12 space only because you guys have done a stellar job as a high school and I want you to continue to do that Stellar job as a high school and I would love for you to be a great collaborator with us with our Roosevelt Middle School there so that they could be a great school because they're doing some wonderful things there too and it is a wonderful choice

[04:10:00]
it has nothing to do with the quality of your school I think the school is is doing phenomenal pieces and it's doing great work but I'm also you know I as a public school official one of the things that I am worried about is our enrollment and and I'm that you know it's important to me that the district also look for ways so that we're all so supporting our enrollment and we're also trying to find ways to to sustain what we have and also grow what we have to so I just wanted to clarify that Madam president a members of the word may I give you some options so we make sure we don't make mistakes again so on your Action Memo and there's a section statutory compliance so 2289 does kind of dictate the process so if you were to vote and

[04:11:00]
play not approved the amendment in its entirety the school could appeal to the secretary now there's no standards as to why are they process is to which you can deny an amendment that's not an statute so but one option to hear your conversation could be to approve the mission changes in the enrollment cap increase and to allow us to continue to work with the school on the Middle School space and as they develop a plan bring that back to you for your consideration of the school just as an option just want to make sure you understood the the point that they could appeal to the secretary If you deny the turn so first of all let me I you're doing a phenomenal job hey thank you thank you for providing that opportunity for the East Mountain families

[04:12:00]
and I think that's the word I want to use this opportunity I don't know why we would deny an opportunity for our kids to to choose something else and that's the other word choose it's their choice if you're doing well and buy statistics buy Lottery people are trying to get into your school because you were doing so well I almost feel like it is our Our obligation to give those families more choice and you mentioned well let me get to that it's not for us to say if the desire is there the choices there then I don't know why we wouldn't give that opportunity to our kids when we're looking at goals one and goals 2 that we need to get our proficiency rates up and you're offering a school

[04:13:00]
that has proven that it can do that why wouldn't we take this opportunity and say hell yeah let's give our kids that same opportunity and get those proficiency rates up I don't I don't understand can you tell us more specifically to this point what was your community feedback like do you have data like conversation what how many how many people do you have on your weightless how many families do you have seen Jesus would really be great if you had a middle school yeah we asked our families once they get to the school if this was an option would you send your students there and it's like close to 100% so that's where they would send their students for for middle school and we do think we're bringing students back into the aps umbrella whenever we do that like when I look at those schools

[04:14:00]
the middle schools next year's freshman come from you know Acton Academy Albuquerque Institute of math and science Alice King Community School Edgewood Middle School Estancia Valley like it's just this huge array and it's not just like a bunch of like public school it's not just Roosevelt and so I think we're actually going to be able to expand and in just bring more students into this umbrella and I thank you for pointing out our scores because our proficiency is amongst the top and the state and I think we can provide that to more students by expanding as well and every single family who comes through our doors says we this is we wish there was a middle school because families are shopping around the state does I don't think the state does a great job of communicating like I have a two year old something about daycare and then I'm thinking about preschool then I'm thinking about elementary then I'm thinking about Middle School it's like a constant shopping around process that we force families to go through and high school was like the final one that are we put our students through and our families through and we think

[04:15:00]
high expectations same curriculum under an Innovative Mission like this was really going to do a service to the community because what we hear Too is we and we've seen the data we have our kids go K through five they leave APS for Middle School I mean my God my my kids friends they went to the academy they went to San Diego prep they went to all these private schools they went to Charters that you they leave the aps umbrella and then they pop back in and high school because they want that High School experience so for talking about enrollment it almost seems like it would be important to increase our enrollment by adding a middle school option that is very obviously asked for the East Mountain I would 100% supports this motion

[04:16:00]
I would support this application to increase the enrollment so that we can you can expand to to middle school because I don't we seem to be making a lot of assumptions as to your enrollment and your demographics but you're not going out and picking and choosing correct I mean again this is a lottery these are people coming to you saying we really want to go to your school and you're not cherry picking the best you're creating an opportunity for our kids so that maybe maybe our goals can be met so this is and this may be would go to Art if this would be horrible if it didn't get approved and then it was appealed I mean

[04:17:00]
here's his great school I mean what do we think that Peds going to do and we just I just made us approval school so if it went to appeal I mean they're going to look at this everything's you know all the keys are crossed and dots are you know and you look at their scores and you look at the the choices that people are making to come from all over the place just a question for you the tough part of answering your question is the statute says that charter schools are I don't want to use the word but in competition with regular schools and competition is good because it should improve all participants and so

[04:18:00]
in in thinking about where we're going to be tonight I am I this is a better conversation than the one we had about El Camino but in terms of specificity I'm not sure that the best answer is you're going to take kids away from Roosevelt and therefore we are not going to approve your request for a cap in the middle school so I think I can't speak for Trey I know him the opportunity one of the one of the things that I hope you consider is that they could change their mission and

[04:19:00]
raise the cap and increased Capital High School and we come back at another day with more specificity and we're planning and more information about a lot of things I I I I I I can't predict what ped will do or say but appreciate that plan period

[04:20:00]
they are working on they did they put together applications information in Spanish they found a way to try to get their demographics to mirror their community so I mean I love your school I know and I do have Testament from Auggie Montoya who was a graduate and has nothing but great things to say about it and one question I post to him was Auggie how do we get more kids from chilee to go there and he spoke very honestly about it I mean he said you know I'm very unique kid from that area do you think it could happen could you be

[04:21:00]
so I want it very clear that it's not that I don't support East Mountain High School I see why it's viable and I have spoken to a graduate who represents Yazi Martinez to find ways to recruit to the school but I think that's got to be I'd like to see that be your mission and and and and and and and grow your high school that way I think the best way to do that is to expand our enrollment so we can actually accept more students because if we continue to have a small enrollment cap and we do that sort of level of recruitment we're just going to have more and more upset families I have families calling me every single day in tears they moved to the East mountains to have a high quality educational experience and they

[04:22:00]
cannot get in the only way we can do that any of this is by expanding our enrollment Gap and you do have in your mission statement engage as a diverse community of Learners it's your mission so I believe you do so I'm sorry could you repeat what you just said what you offered up I just wanted to remind the board out I just wanted to remind you of the school if you were to vote and not approve the amendment the school could appeal the decision of the board to the secretary what is different is there's no measurement of why you can deny a minute or why you can't which is converse to Renewal so I just wanted to point out so for example if you want to make a motion that

[04:23:00]
the enrollment cap with the mission statement and asked us to come back with the plan regarding middle schools that could be an option or for us to work on something okay so so to be so yes we could approve a change of the admission statement yes we could approve a change of the enrollment cap and just based on the tone that I'm getting come back maybe later for middle school so if we did that type of motion would that give you the ability to start moving forward in your plans for building and working with your contractors and that number that higher enrollment numbers should help without the specificity of the grade level I think that at least would allow us to get started in those conversations with Architects and finance but knowing that we have the possibility of coming back and discussing the Middle School option for you so that that

[04:24:00]
helmet cap of that you wanted to raise to 550 was that in your mind going to be inclusive of those 6th 7th and 8th graders not 550 for high school though correct that's correct I mean our plan is because we have the space right we're on 3 0 8

[04:25:00]
what do you think Mr Smith would be the best time to bring that back I mean in your calculations of what might work for you or Dr Escovedo whoever can answer that I don't know members of the board for remember that explains their middle school expansion so I don't know what time is it to them all right and then to Art if we you know everything gets brought back I mean we obviously I don't know if we can if we get a shall we shall vote for something but

[04:26:00]
how could we not vote for not vote for this I just don't I mean I like to know how can we just go know when they're so fantastic but we don't want to say no I want to say yeah I'm all yes for it tonight so just so you know be supportive of the high school the immediate need is for the high school so I think I like Joe Joseph's that was what he was talking about his middle school 100 yes yes we're not going to have any sort of 63844

[04:27:00]
percent of them said they would have had there been a middle school they would have attended and they that's what they would have wanted so you could have your middle school ready would be in a couple of years because we don't want to just squeeze the men with the high schoolers like we need a new facility in the 4224 440 range and that's just physical capacity that's not really taking to account Staffing but I don't know I mean what are you doing today

[04:28:00]
I just want to make sure we're just making sure that you're aware of the statutory awareness that they could appeal either I mean I know what you want cuz you came with what you wanted but what will be okay with with you maybe not optimal but I mean if we did put the middle we have movements is the conversation going to be the same in a couple of months right now or not right so it is important to us that our mission rewarding get approved that we have an expanded enrollment cap we are great collaborative collaborators we have a fantastic relationship with Dr Escobedo in the entire Charter Community we work with our local schools we meet with all of the time

[04:29:00]
collaborating and we have conversations about what's which school is the best fit for whatever reason I don't we don't have a marching band so there's plenty of students who are going to Manzano we don't have football students are going to Moriarty because we don't offer those things so we have those conversations and if we do bring that conversation up later I just hope that we see some fruitful movement and discussion on that topic and I just see Charter School their APS Charter Schools they are our kids they're not separate and I don't think that that's how we should look at them there they are are students whether they go to a charter school or just a traditional school there are kids so I'm sorry I'm even if it's like this whole conversation is like pains me and I'm just and if you don't get it I would encourage you to feel like

[04:30:00]
that couldn't have been placed at a better placement on the agenda for us to have that receipt you know going into your conversation and one more thing like you're sorry like you just said like how much they're collaborating with APS and everything that they do when in turn we heard in public comment how APS is not collaborated with on the opposite end you know for other programs and that has been a big Challenge and you're making the efforts to do that with the schools and guys we got to get it right so are you also collaborating with a Montoya so because San Antonio Texas our fourth period robotics students can like walk across the street and go to San Francisco and work with their stem students send it

[04:31:00]
proximity that's why we have a better relationship with San Antonio I think a Montoya I haven't had as much Outreach just cuz it's a little further away but totally willing to and that's my only request you know when when when when Montessori on the Rio Grande came before us I was complimentary the only thing I requested was and they took it to heart because they're working on it see what you can do work on your demographics and I don't think that's an unreasonable request because we are public school we need to serve our kiddos the East all of them and I think you have your best friend

[04:32:00]
put him to work for you and I would say anything that you could do to support the stem piece at Roosevelt would be great too like you do with San Antonio you know as if you could get out to Roosevelt and really encourage our middle school students there because we're in a space where we definitely need to transform or look at ways to make our Middle School much more meaningful and I know that part of what we've always asked for with our Charters is to be more collaborative with our regular Public Schools I'm grateful to hear that you do go across the street to San Antonio but I would really want to see that all so because I worry about the Middle School space and our job is also to figure out how we could create that opportunity for middle schoolers so that they could also see a place when that and that might it could work I mean it could also be an opportunity where you know

[04:33:00]
Roosevelt is given a fair Shake too and some of the things that they need to do it's a great school I remember visiting Roosevelt many many times they have a really sweet little school there too so and it's all East Mountain kids as well so I mean I and when I was saying is just having options for our families on the east side it's I include all of our options you know it's not not just a charter school but all of our public schools because you are a public school and I understand that and I get that and so the choice and the options for families is great but I don't know love to be able to see some of our families Roosevelt too right that it's all going to continue to be a viable option for them to because not all of them are going to be able to get in I mean the reality is also the lottery doesn't work for everybody because it's the same with our magnet schools internally for us as well we have weight loss our own magnets

[04:34:00]
so so I get that and I understand that so could I have emotion on this please I have a quick question then to to you are is it statutory to mandate that there have to be Democratic changes to get approval I don't think so okay thank you okay so I mean I'm happy to make a motion to make a motion I don't think it's going to pass because I don't want us to be in a situation that we've just come out of so and I don't think it's fair to you Mr Smith to ask you what you want to do like we're here to make these decisions right you came very obvious we know what you want so much so it would be approval of

[04:35:00]
the Amendments of the contract for East Mountain High School approving their mission statement changes and their enrollment cap increase and they would have the opportunity to appeal

[04:36:00]
field decision if I just to be candid if you accept Mr escobedo's wording it puts them in half an apple or not the whole lot more enchilada and with the hope that they could come back I can't speak for Trey but it makes it much more difficult to to appeal I want to work with you and I hope that that's the tone and the intention of that's one so they appeal

[04:37:00]
and it's been the only thing that they can do is appeal like we can't have another vote when you know all of obviously we're missing one person here tonight so I mean I just want to know what is going to be like best because the school so phenomenal and so good for the kids I just want to make sure that like we're doing the right thing by the kids so we've asked for more chances are when it comes back there will be seven members on this board sitting here for vote I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for more development plan we have expressed some concerns we've expressed great support a whole lot of cheering cheering for all the wonderful

[04:38:00]
are happening and we've asked for more developed plan for a middle school expansion what would that look like how will it impact other schools and how can there be a collaborative relationship in the cap will let you address your concern for next year the immediate concern and we will come back for further discussion for the one fundamental change that we've asked for more information

[04:39:00]
so our next back quickly our next item is an update on school safety and secretary Jackson you've got the floor so there have been a lot of events that have occurred over the past couple of months that have kind of brought to the Forefront school safety and a couple weeks ago the executive committee did meet with the superintendent and Dr Blakey to kind of discuss some of these issues and so we decided that it would be a very good idea to speak to an empty room so I'm going to talk to you stuff on so keep eye contact

[04:40:00]
give me to give an update about school safety so I did I did send out a memo but we did think it was important that the public knew that there was some of the updates were that were occurring so the first one is that APS is now going to be partnering with the office of the district attorney and I'm sure several of you saw the press conference that you attended the press conference and it was a very strong messaging that gun violence is not going to be tolerated also in conjunction with that which I think is is more important is the collaboration that will be between the de APS and APD to create a pilot program within our schools and I just want to highlight that this idea came from an APS

[04:41:00]
who happens to work in the the DA's office and she she spearheaded this and really wanted to make a difference and so with us meeting in in that room kind of creating this pilot program that is going to begin in the fall it's just a great show of how collaboration and advocacy can really work to the benefit of our kids so this pilot program is going to highlight first of all the consequences of bringing a gun to school and second to that discussion on how we can get students out of situations before they make a mistake because obviously the if you bring a gun to school is very cut and dry like the the district attorney highlighted that several times but a lot of times our kids are in situations where they may be don't want to do it but they just don't

[04:42:00]
know what the resources are to get out of the certain situations so that will be starting in the fall it will be a pilot program what we're discussing it will be a pilot program with five schools will start in three middle schools and two high schools the this is going to be presented to the super stack in April where we're going to present an outline in conjunction with Dr Blakey so that we can kind of get feedback from the students from from from from from those who are most directly affected by school violence and restorative coordinators will be included in all of these discussions so the the other entity that we've had discussions with is the Albuquerque Police Department the reason that we have these conversations were that several APD officers and had kind of reached out to say

[04:43:00]
we want to help like how how can we help how can we be involved there were there's I think there's definitely some communication issues that are going to be addressed and I think by again with the meeting that occurred between the district attorney the superintendent APS APD bcso I understand even I think the FBI the doj they were all in this room just the fact that they all got into this room and started to have communication was so key and so I think we will be looking at how APD can work with us how they can potentially have card access to our schools so that they can help but this is all discussions that we will be be talking about as we really start to develop a safety strategy as we move forward then other other thing that we

[04:44:00]
safety technology we do potentially have an RFP coming for us in which they are going to be introducing a panic button badge that will be paid for Via Sr funds so so we'll be discussing that and we also wanted to kind of highlight that the Albuquerque office of emergency management is providing training to our staff Dr Blakey is meeting with the city every other week to discuss safety issues we had we did discuss the need to develop a safety strategy like I mentioned and there was even a possibility that maybe the board could look at bringing a resolution like a school safety resolution to kind of really highlight that this is important but I have to say this became very personal today when my child's called me

[04:45:00]
from school because there was a threat or she thought there was a gun on campus and so I got to stand in line today with a bunch of Eisenhower parents terrified that something had happened it turns out it was a threat it turns out it was a prank nevertheless I was terrified you see these kids walking out they're terrified my daughter's terrified and this hits home and if I can just take a moment I really do want to thank you Scott for taking my call and I want to Highlights Jonathan's ice Melanie Tapia Melissa Poole

[04:46:00]
an excellent job today of of assuring parents that everything was going to be okay and Mr G if you're listening I do want to thank you for taking care of my kids today but we this is this is becoming what I heard was this is becoming more of an issue pranks like this are becoming more of an issue and so we really need to start addressing that we need to look at maybe handbook changes I I I I don't know but what are the consequences if there are pranks there was a lot of trauma that occurred today on campus Because of a prank so we need to look at lean to look at things like that so I guess the whole point of this is people come to public forum and they talk at us and we can't respond back but we do want

[04:47:00]
I want you to know that we are looking at this we are creating strategies we are working with the entities within APS the Administration has responded we are going to make changes and we do know that the safety of our kids is first and foremost and should be the one thing that we are concerned about so I think I I will leave it at that are there any questions I just want to say thank you for one sharing you know the event that happened today and I agree with you I mean I the whole safety discussion and the fear that our students are feeling these days is really palpable I mean it definitely is is really important that because they so are so afraid to we need to make sure that on the back end of this all so that we've got some really strong

[04:48:00]
go back to the school we want them to also feel confident to in in some of the one is understanding the measures are are there for their safety but you know and more importantly not just that we're going to also you're going to get in trouble I want I want kids to know that for sure but I also want the kids to know that that are traumatized by this to that there's ways that we could also support them to live through that or do you get past that too so I mean that's another important part that we have to do and you know on the public comments tonight the whole issue around the restorative practices so that we can start to create communities that are all so you know sort of are restorative practices sort of looking for that lens of all so how can they create a culture of

[04:49:00]
kindness and a culture of Civility and just this whole piece of that they're part of a community so that we can stop and end the pranks right I mean I think they need to understand that I mean sometimes we have kids that are thinking they're goofing off and that they're doing things that are not hurtful or they think it's funny and it's not it's just really similar to that I mean we have a lot of kids that I think are not always firing with the right with the right brain cells sometimes I get really concerned about that but I am concerned about just the amount of trauma that our communities are going through right now and the sense of insecurity and just just the heightened awareness that our kids have and our mom's house I mean I hear it in your voice yeah I hear it in your you know your moms and dads are all equally as concerned about that so I really appreciate you sharing you know how it hit home for you today because that had to have been really difficult and so I'm sorry that that happened to you

[04:50:00]
sorry that it happened to your daughter you know to our kiddos cuz it's something she's going to remember is really palpable for our kids so any other thoughts and I had just something to this because I want to I guess really recognize principal Michelle Torres over at West Mesa based on all of her efforts of what she's what she has done and what she's currently doing to improve student safety at the school because like Courtney said many times like we're talking to but we're not able to respond and I hear you know and I and I'm grateful for everybody who from West Mesa that came in advocated and the students that spoke up and even tonight still hearing from staff but many times were not able to respond at what she is doing to improve this so I want to just touch briefly on a couple of them I won't say the whole list cuz I have a pretty extensive list here of what

[04:51:00]
she has put in place and it's everything is you know from major things of getting cameras repaired gate card readers repaired to even working with City officials to make sure that we have permanent cameras in the Parks across the street and that they're covering tunnels and because we've said it time and time again that it's not just a West Mesa issue it's not just a district issue like it's something throughout our entire community and I appreciate her taking the steps and making the efforts to involve APD and other city leaders on how we can be proactive with this and you know she's serving on different task forces and working with the lieutenant governor's office and his team to be able to help with this because right now we all know that they were like they had the target you know in terms of student safety and we know it was District wide but it was like the emphasis was on West Mesa and she has been a trooper through all this

[04:52:00]
and even being able to communicate the best you can with her staff and realize and allowing them to still Advocate and have their voice be heard but she's made the changes needed and and obviously we know we still have a ways to go and I appreciate the district for starting to take those steps and working with all of these other agencies but man I wish I could just like shout from the rooftops how awesome is Torres has been over at West Mesa and cuz she's taking a lot of heat for everything that has happened and really trying to be responsive to the families of students in her staff and we all know we're not going to make everybody happy but I love what she's continuing to do and what she's trying to create over there and you know I have pages and pages of everything she shared with me of what we're doing and I met with her and Dr Gonzalez and it was just I was impressed and even felt just even a greater sense of pride of being a fellow Mustang of what they're doing there

[04:53:00]
and tomorrow I'll be over at the community school council meeting with them because we want to make sure that we just we still keep this on the Forefront of everything that we need to do but I specifically want to highlight what we have done and talk to the solutions not just the problems because we do that too often but Mrs I don't know if you're listening but thank you for what you're doing thank you for what you're creating with your team there and I appreciate you thank you so but thanks for sharing that I know that there's been a lot of of good work that's going on there and I appreciate us sharing that the actions that we are taking so that we can support that and you're right not everybody's going to hear it and everybody is still going to be concerned about safety that's why it's really important for us to have that restored of Peace in there too so that we can start to build that confidence that our schools do still continue to be really safe space

[04:54:00]
it's just a report on a goals guardrails and strategic plan I don't think we have a whole lot superintendent Elder was just going to give us an update on where we are with strap plan I know you're still working on it quite a bit oh you do OK Google the organizational diagnostic findings and emerging priorities for strategic plan we as a leadership team have been focusing on identifying essential work to be done under each priority that we believe ultimately help us achieve our board goals so specifically we confirm the four priorities to Anchor our strategic plan over the next five years we shared an initial draft with the

[04:55:00]
Asian group made small adjustments and landed on the final priorities from there we drafted a set of initiatives these are the key projects can take anywhere between 1 to 3 years to implement with Fidelity we gathered two rounds of feedback on this draft set of work from The Advisory Group and conducted 18 more focus groups with students teachers School leaders and families along with the Ozzie Martinez canceled the tribal council which included two engagements each feedback through these conversations with our community have been positive the priorities and initiatives are resonating strongly with stakeholders especially our students and we believe many are optimistic about the work we have identified to prioritize yet we also have heard they have questions on how this work will be done to what extent stakeholders will be consistently engaged at the table and to what extent and suing Equitable resources and outcomes will be Central to the conversation so thankfully these concerns align directly with our guard rails and

[04:56:00]
purple and we are hopeful as we start to move forward towards implementation that are stakeholders will recognize our commitment as an Administration to doing this work in a meaningful and connected manner with all members of our school Community we have created the initial sequence sequence sequencing how these initiatives are roll out over the next five years in order to ensure we Implement work at the right time not taking on too much or moving too fast which can be overwhelming for teachers and principals in particular We are continuing to evaluate the sequence at this time and now cabinet members and other senior leaders are finalizing details work plans for each initiative we aim to initiate either the spring or this coming school year these work plans include responsible parties and timelines for start and completion attached to each specific deliverable so just clear who is responsible for moving this important work forward the level of detail will be critical and holding ourselves accountable to plan

[04:57:00]
cabinet members have also begun identifying which specific resources are needed to implement this work in a high-quality way this is an essential step as well so we can assess what is and is not available so we can make executive decisions on how to move forward knowing clearly where there may be challenges due to the availability of resources lastly we've done an initial crosswalk between the key measurements of our impact the interim goals and interim guardrails and the current initiatives to determine what additional measures may be needed to help us holistically track how well implementation of the Strategic plan is going and are the incentives are initiatives having the desired impact there is significant overlap which is good news that's what we want and shows how focused and building plan helped by the end of April to have the Strategic plan completed and supporting implementation in progress monitoring tools complete with

[04:58:00]
continue to that's our timeline but I'm about to say something in addition we've been meeting with the Council of great City Schools to discuss both the interim goals and guardrails and adaptations to them and the progress monitoring and these meetings have been productive and we are working on some of the interim goals as we speak one of the biggest steps and it's the thing that slows us down is the need to calibrate those interim goals to the final goals you guys have a lot of good ideas but when we looked at some of them they didn't necessarily have any correlation to with the final goal was or if they did we couldn't find enough of it so they were trying to find a correlation of 0.5 or higher and so that's something stuck it out right now he's going to say I did it well enough right it's not

[04:59:00]
Gracie schools were working on the interim goals again working on that correlation so the final goals that day that we report will serve its intended purpose this takes time we're aiming to present these revisions in May after graduation but I do need to remind you right now we are in the middle of the end of the school year we are completing the Strategic plan and we are in the hardest part of it right now this is the most difficult work we've done we are finalizing the budget and trying to put it in a format that assist you all and understanding or answering the questions you have asked we are been developing and completing a calendar reconfiguring our transportation routes to see if we can do the start times

[05:00:00]
praying for graduation and there's a lot of other things that are happening none of this is held by any single department but all of it is very time-consuming it's incredibly complex we are aware of the need to present a progress monitoring calendar I am saying that the earliest we can begin our initial round of reporting will be in mid-june and we are just we're stressed and and we're we're running hard doctor said was a rock star tonight she was very brave and very appreciative for being here but she has been worried there's been a lot of stress period with all the additional responsibilities

[05:01:00]
it's getting a little snippy on the 6th floor so we're trying real hard to maintain cheerful and happy attitudes there are days you can send me Sunshine out there that it's harder than others but so that's what we're aiming for that is our update and I think next time we report will show you some of the work around with somebody's initials look like and what the time frames look at how it's laid out it's just I don't want to do that

[05:02:00]
you think you should look at but we're the ones that have to do it and figure out how it's going to work and then sequence that out over the next three years I think remembering It's A Five-Year Plan and I just want to add to a board member Dominguez that when superintendent and I met with Ashley for our coaching at the beginning of this week we also talked about everything that was on our plate because she had given me that timeline and just based on everything it was hearing I said because I know that one of the things that was brought up was like well when are we going to get this monitoring calendar and it was through that process that I learned that it's really interesting because they had to go back and look at the interim goals figure out how they could pull that together and time it with each of those goals and nothing was coming around very easily so Dr Bowman thank you so much for you know for saying and sticking with that and saying oh we're going to we got to push back we got to be able to do this right because everything that I
