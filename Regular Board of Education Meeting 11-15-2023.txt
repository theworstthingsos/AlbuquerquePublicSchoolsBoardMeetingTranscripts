[00:01:00]
I just came off the hills of Veterans Day and so a moment of silence for all of our staff and students and community members that have served in the military thank you for your service and so let's just have a moment of silence Danielle Gonzales Peterson is approval of the November 15th 2023 Board of Education meeting agenda do I have a motion

[00:02:00]
remove November 15th 2023 regular board meeting agenda and I'll second I'll have a roll call please Danielle Gonzalez yes Robert Peterson is approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on November 1st 2023 and the special Board of Education meeting held on October 25th 2023 to have a motion place I moved to approve the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on November 1st 2023 and the special Board of Education meeting on October 25th 2023

[00:03:00]
Welcome to our public forum guests when you signed up to speak you were asked to review the rules and expectations which our presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agenda specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone in the center aisle at the back of the room when your name is called online gas will stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak when did is your time you will be escorted into the main meeting space and we ask that you please turn on your audio and video once you're speaking time is up you will be

[00:04:00]
Usher back into the waiting room when you're finished speaking you may choose to leave the meeting and watch it on live stream we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum tonight there are fewer than 22 speakers which means you will each have two minutes to speak to address the board please be concise and try not to repeat what others have said tonight there are two speakers one time is up you'll be directed to complete your sentence quickly so that others may speak you may not yield your unused time to another speaker we will get to all the speakers tonight but if you would still like to convey your message you may email board Ed at aps.com edu and if for those of you who are here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you right back there mister Gonzalez will you please introduce our speakers or speaker tonight is Ronald Jones he is on Zoom

[00:05:00]
Mr Jones are you there I am here sir so you have two minutes once you begin speaking hello my name is Ronald Jones I am an essential related services to retain School social workers I stand before you to try not to take to see that this is an attempt to help you qualify for social workers in our district by fairly creating a salary Matrix that accounts for different and employees education entertainment national board certification as well as a relationship is maintained as a former teacher I am going to struggles and difficulties that

[00:06:00]
but having gotten to this point in my career as a social worker as a school social worker that is I am well groomed to the strict requirements to be qualified and licensed professional that clinically serve students in our district especially on in regards to their mental health concerns as well as providing clinical support of consultation and or direct interventions to address social emotional and behavioral bearers to students and families in and out of the school setting coming back to APS district with my license and credentials as a social worker as a school social worker has give me a sense of appreciation that I was able to serve my community in a profound way since I've been back I've been feeling like here with this experience as a school teacher in the Masters Inn in the license and social work my mother has been kind of affected as a social worker we are attached with serving our population continuing our is our continuing our education and the board to keep our license be clinical be clinically

[00:07:00]
all the while being paid the same as a bachelor level one teacher I and many of my other colleagues my social work colleagues believe that this pace go relating to social workers and to help professionals need to be changed or amended the amount of money to make our district more qualified versus the value you are getting with qualified professionals is on demanding the district and board require all necessary components but it appears we are not seeing our value through compensation the current pay scale should be corrected so that our District employees that service the underrepresented underrepresented population can be more certified competent and skilled when working with Albany students and families respectfully thank you thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Cynthia Bernal heron

[00:08:00]
thank you for this opportunity to speak with you again I am here because 2 years ago we asked for help and discontinuing the career pathway system well that is no longer a requirement for advancement our current negotiated agreement continues to penalize APS essential and related service employees with an arbitrary 3 year requirement to move up between each level we have advocated through the union for all the essential and related service Personnel to be paid on their professional licensure today I'm at advocating for all LCSW social workers to be at the 8th 3833 pay Matrix we have a motion through the union requesting that this be done through a memorandum of understanding as this was something we hope to have in place this year are rolled specifically addresses the focus areas of social emotional learning priority 3

[00:09:00]
watch focuses on student engagement is directly related to the students inability to access education due to any number of just regulating factors the yasi Martinez students are one of the main groups we serve through special education as licensed clinical social workers we are independently licensed and do not require supervision LCSW are able to spend their full day assisting students and lmsw social worker requires supervision which typically cost the district about 15,000 dollars per year and takes away time from both the supervisor and supervisee Duty day encouraging and incentivizing all social workers to complete their hours and take their exam to be lcsws hopes the district by ensuring we have highly qualified social workers saves US money by not having to pay a supervisor and increases the amount of time that can be spent providing Direct Services to students lmsw social workers have any other districts start at a minimum level to pay of the 1600

[00:10:00]
there should be no different for school social workers here at Albuquerque Public Schools based on the data I have received as a Federate these changes would impact less than 10 employees each receiving a $10,000 raise and I know that that still adds up to a lot of money but the Boost and morale and being able to feel appreciated and valued by our district would be Priceless and would create a lot more return for our value because we know that many of our students are still having a lot of difficulties still from the pandemic so thank you for your time and listening and we actually had one more speaker sign up right under the wire okay good afternoon everybody

[00:11:00]
my name is Kevin naranjo I work I am a father of a student who attends an APS school I work for the Indian Ed department and I'm trying to understand action items 62 considering adopting Albuquerque Public School Board education resolution to collaboration with Partners I've been into the department for almost a year and I believe we are working really well with the outside community and I'm just trying to understand how this outside or this resolution would have been beneficial to myself and our department to collaborate with this outside organization and I found it a little

[00:12:00]
concerning how it was presented to to the board first and our department was not communicated to about the ideas and plans of this outside organization I believe it's very important to have outside entities to provide services to Native American Youth but my concern is you know why was this not presented to our department because an overall you know our department was developed in 1973 to provide services to our Native American students and if it's data that this organization wants they could have asked our department for anything they wanted and we would have been more than happy to collaborate with this organization and this resolution but I guess my concern is how we were involved and I just wanted to voice that so thank you thank you sir and board members Zack

[00:13:00]
concludes public forum thank you I really appreciate the speakers the social work issue is definitely one that is is important obtaining that LCSW is no easy feat that is a difficult licensure and certainly one that requires a lot of Maintenance to maintain so thank you to our speakers for that and also thank you to the gentleman for speaking out about the resolution and shedding some some of your concerns about that so we will take that up when we talk about that later in the in the agenda so our next item we're going to move right through our gender and then we're going to come back to the to the to the whole gender but our first item is student comes Focus governance and this is where we're going to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring reports for gold to and the interim goals to 0.1 to 0.2 and 2.3 that are focusing on math proficiency we have doctor and Antonio

[00:14:00]
they're going to present the information to us before we do that it's customary for us to ask under s o f g the first questions are do any of the board members have any any concerns with the with the data is it is it do you have any concerns at all with what's been presented is it complete and do we have enough of a report here so that we could keep moving forward is there any evidence that it's not meeting the requirements period it's the first way that we start so welcome and thank you for being here tonight we're looking forward to having this conversation on this important goal so we'll turn the floor over to you and why don't we just go ahead and go through all of it and then we'll save our questions for the end so thank you

[00:15:00]
thank you madam chair and members of the board thank you for having us this evening we are happy to report on interim goal 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 I want to preface this by stating that each of these and trim goals is separated by grade level and so a lot of what's going well what's not going well and next steps are going to be applicable to each of the levels and we are open also to be back from you all in this process so the first our goal to for the district the percentage of 8th grade students identified in the Yazzie Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above on the state mathematics summative assessment will increase from 11.1% in May of 2023 to 21.1% in May of 2028 for interim

[00:16:00]
2.1 we're looking at the percentage of 6th grade students identified in the Yazi Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency are above and Mathematics as predicted by i-Ready will increase from 16.6% in May of 2023 to 22.6 per cent in May of 2026 and then 22.6 for the interim home I'm going to ask my colleague to read this book of the board moving on to what is going well for interim goal 2.1

[00:17:00]
do you recognize that all schools are working to ensure alignment of this interim goal to their 90-day plan at the middle school level district-wide adoption of Core Mathematics for all sixth grade classrooms has been completed the last spring and we are in the midst of implementation this fall district-wide adoption of IXL personalized mathematic intervention for 6th grade teachers to use throughout our school district a middle school walk through process has been established at the middle school level to monitoring support the use of District of high quality instructional materials in grade level standards in 6th grade classrooms middle school middle schools are beginning to post scoreboards which is which are tracking the progress of their work around their school white wig or wildly in Portland around this gold

[00:18:00]
leadership development for all principles based on a whole group and individual coaching model with focus on relational capacity and instructional capacity towards goal to his underway and continues to be assessed monitored and deployed all middle school principals participated in a two-day illustrative math implementation Workshop in anticipation of this hqm on rollout District wide illustrative math professional development administered for teachers with a plan for continued rollout continues and the IXL math intervention utilization of licenses has increased from last year where we had 5,000 licenses within the district to 14000 licenses at this time moving on to what is not going well

[00:19:00]
an inconsistent utilization of District approved high-quality instructional materials and Associated interventions are not evident in all 6th grade mathematics classrooms at this time currently a district-wide walkthrough tool has not been developed critical actions in 90 Day plans focused on increasing math outcomes with Yazzie Martinez plus African-American students are inconsistent an inconsistent district-wide approach to scheduling mathematics intervention time within Master schedule's continues to be a challenge and not all middle schools have posted a scoreboard detailing their progress of schoolwide which aligned alignment to go to and in the back of the sheet we see based on what is it going well what are we going to do and what are our next steps what is our pathway forward first the district will provide

[00:20:00]
how to put professional development for implementation of new and established core instructional materials and Associated intervention programs a district-wide walkthrough tool is in progress of being developed to be able to collect data to inform progress to guardrail 3 which involves high quality instructional materials grade level standards and innovation in teaching the coaching of principles will continue to ensure that critical actions in 90 Day plans are focused on increase with martinez plus African-American students develop a common districts to schedule mathematics intervention classes and finally all middle schools will have posted a scoreboard based on their Wig by the end of the school year which is aligned to go to the information shared in what is going well what

[00:21:00]
isn't going well in the next steps is consistent in interim goal 2.2 and 2.3 simply differentiated by the grade level and therefore at this time we stand for any questions that you might have in regards to this progress monitoring report thank you so I think we'll do first is we'll start I'm going to just punch back does anyone still have any lingering technical questions just based on some of this that it spark anything for anybody terms of a technical or a technical question on the date or what was presented go ahead board member Peterson this is probably a technical question have you got any feedback I'm just curious how well I really aligns with the curriculum that teachers are using and if they see if they see really clearly a link between

[00:22:00]
in comparison to their unit tests and the curriculum based assessments and it might also help get it any other technical questions what does that mean is that just the individual who are those users of the board is so your referencing the 14,000 licenses for math intervention in the IXL

[00:23:00]
Intervention Program for mathematics the district purchased those licenses and anticipation of the Core Curriculum roll out this school year so basically the intent is to really have those licenses deployed throughout the all of our middle schools to support especially the 15% of each School struggling math students so I'm really striking the equity involved in accessibility toward the intervention I am happy to report and I learned this afternoon that would be reported 14,000 schools through their own budgets have also invested some of their school funds so we're looking more at about 20,000 licenses system wide the 14000 number that's listed on the document is what the district purchased through operational

[00:24:00]
intervention department so just for clarification who's the user the student okay that's what I was like what what does that mean so the students have a license and they can utilize this on their Chromebook and they have access to and it what is it just like additional math instruction yes okay all right take place within the classroom it can also take place outside of the classroom thank you all right go ahead OK Google that's what I was using when I was a teacher while we were home for covid in my two weeks of being a teacher so my my question is and I think this is a doctor Bowman question so the the increase is from 11:21 percent to 21.1% that's the 10 point increase that we asked but I noticed that all of the interim goals only

[00:25:00]
increase by 6% so I am sure that there is a statistical reason for it I'm just curious as to what that is why why the insurance don't also increase by 10% thank you for the question I think I heard it from someone which is that the interim goal is only over 3 years whereas the overall goal is over 5:00 go to yeah so if I extrapolate it it'll get to 10 okay thank you so much board member Gonzalez I see your hand is up right thank you yes I also had a technical question just about the status of the district by walk through tool you're saying that it's in the process of being developed what's the time frame for that but I'm president remember Gonzalez members of the board actually it's a timely question because tomorrow we are testing the instrument January we are calibrating the instrument

[00:26:00]
and we have a target of March which will be the actual district-wide walkthrough to get the second measure or data point for the guardrail 3 any other questions are we just doing technical questions right now if you have anything technical that's pending for you thank you anybody else have any technical questions go ahead I think this is a technical

[00:27:00]
and the posting of the scoreboard how will this public scoreboard impact Martinez yassi and African-American students Madam chair board member Dominguez we have done a book study and it's almost done with our with our principals regarding the four disciplines of execution and achievement of our goals and so part of the four disciplines is to have a scoreboard with your school determined wig while the important goal and being able to visually see what are goal is and progress toward that goal so that it is visible to staff students parents who come in

[00:28:00]
and within that what we're asking principles is in their own data analysis identify sorry identifying those Yazzie Martinez student groups so that they know and the teachers know where the the focus work needs to happen so how do you how will how do you anticipate this impacting looking at this from an SEL perspective social emotional learning

[00:29:00]
for the wig for this specific goal it's not focusing on SEL per se it's focusing on specific math skills that we're trying to build up right I guess just curious how it impacts Google so and I think from that perspective of that question it's kind of hard to like yeah it's not a I mean it's sort of conjecture is it going to happen for students obviously what I what I think I see is that it's overarching goal for the school itself and so the intention is

[00:30:00]
to build momentum built excitement build that kind of thing so exactly what it is okay so it's not it's not like targeting it's not showing subgroups it's not just the showing where the school stands as a whole okay overall grade levels whatever that looks like depending on what the school determines and it is it's building that excitement around mathematics in the school all right okay so any other technical questions before we jump into some strategy so I see none so I'll go on to board member melodica because I know you were ready with the Strategic question so we'll have you go first thank you so my question I am I'm looking at you know the growth for the you know all other students and then the Aussie Martinez African-American students so

[00:31:00]
I'm I'm seeing like incredible growth from beginning of the year to the end of the year with the all other students were in 2018-19 it was a 19 percent increase in 2122 and 2223 it was like a 20% increase and then when we look at Yazi Martinez we just see and 1819 or 13% growth which was great and then we see in 8.8 and 2122 and 8.5 in 2223 so what I would like to know is when you're looking at all all other students what what can you tell me about those other students and the difference in growth between them and the Yazi Martinez and African-American students

[00:32:00]
board member Mueller at a gun can you please repeat the question so what can you tell me when you're looking at all other students and then you're looking at our you know targeted population and you're seeing the growth so such a big growth with the other students but then you're not seeing that with the Yazi Martinez so what are you learning what have you learned from all the other students maybe when it comes to root causes I'm not sure I just want to know what you what you've learned from all other students that maybe could help with Martinez and African-American students board member Miller station with respect to what we have learned are you talking more of like a date of perspective or you

[00:33:00]
more of a have we done a study inside of the schools on the different subgroups to try to observe any differences amongst them right like what what's going what's going well with the all other students that maybe is not going well and of course that would be that would be at a school level and maybe you haven't dug into that yet and and that's fine on my something that would be important to do because we always want to know why is this group doing so well and why is there growth just keep I mean it's very steady that it's been around 20% but we're not seeing that with the other students so I just want to know what you what you might think Madam chair and

[00:34:00]
board member Mueller Aragon I think what we see from the data is that we do have when I think of our yassi Martinez subgroups It's a larger sample than all other students and so we can definitely dig into that a little bit more but what we're seeing is the difference in outcomes between the two groups and so what we're learning is that we just have we have to do better and we're working toward getting better to get these outcomes where they need to be and but we can definitely look into what all other students what that composition entails and and see what some of those root causes may be right and it is a smaller I mean it is a smaller group so it wouldn't be as difficult just looking at maybe such a large group and then when

[00:35:00]
looking at the all other the proficiency rates and you're expecting in the next 3 years that for the Aussie and African-American students that it will grow by 6% points so are you expecting that the same thing is going to happen with the all other students that they're going to also grow by 6% points are you expecting because of what's going on in the past that that grows will be greater and also that would go back to the why according to thank you for the question so I would say that this particular goal does not there's not a specific goal for the Nunez Martinez plus African Americans however it might not be

[00:36:00]
reasonable to I mean it's just conjecture that whatever improvements and instruction or other whatever improvements instruction that help certain students would also help the other students what you're seeing here I'm with what I mentioned with the wildly important goals and and the disciplines of execution is to generate that energy inside the school campus about improved academic achievement for everyone so there's not a particular number I would anticipate that it would also increase right because we're not we're obviously not going to stop teaching those all other students so we're expecting that we're going to keep doing whatever has been going right for them is going to continue so we're assuming that we're going to continue they'll continue the same positive direction and so with that does if that

[00:37:00]
keep on going on and we want to see that that gap between those all other students in the Aussie students we want that to shrink I mean we wanted to ultimately disappear and that would be a hope so we really do need to find out I'm assuming that that's something that you all are going to be looking at what is working for that group that may be able to work for this other group thank you thank you bored member board member Gonzalez thank you and thank you for the presentation and the date I know that we're still pretty early on in both our tracking and our strategies so I'm looking forward to hearing more as these strategies begin to be implemented I do have a question that sort of global related to the goals guardrails in progress monitoring

[00:38:00]
can it starts by reading briefly from the September 2023 issue of the Albuquerque teachers Federation Union news it begins with an explanation of the goals and guardrails and then reads I have heard from many that they're feeling ever increasing pressure to show measurable outcomes for these new goals and guardrails after a month of school this is already causing stress which is cascading downhill from the board through APS Administration to principles and which soaks Educators and pools in our classrooms the goals and the guardrails are infiltrating the 90-day plans and staff meetings and their impacting individual pdp's or professional development plans so once again Educators in our students are trading stagnant water in a deep pool of test-based accountability so I think the claim here is that the board setting the measurable goals and the district developing the Strategic plan with the

[00:39:00]
three of the poor strategic priorities being around clear expectations rigorous rigorous instruction and engage students is leading to a culture of high-stakes accountability leading to an environment where there's extreme pressure to produce results and essentially a harmful culture versus actually creating Clarity and providing support and creating conditions for the improved teaching and learning and so sort of the first question is is there any truth to this claim that we and the district have created the dangerous culture of testing because if so that would be highly problematic in general but it's for the kids who were for this from opportunity here for most trying to serve and so my question is what strategies do you have in place to stem this challenge of high stakes accountability or if that's not the case that's not happening if you could just respond to that Madam chair and

[00:40:00]
remember Gonzales we are working really hard to align and that is something that will be working from the goals to the Strategic priorities 290 Day plans and to teach your pdps so that the work becomes clearer I like to quote brene Brown clear as kind and when things are clear people have Direction it's not chaotic it's not misaligned so we are working really hard to create that alignment so that it's clear for people one thing about you know high stakes testing there's certain assessments that we just have to we have to give Federal and State Testing is what it is beyond that teachers are utilizing formative assessments within their classrooms every day as as their choice to determine where their kids are what next steps need to happen

[00:41:00]
how to differentiate within their classrooms what materials and resources they need to be able to access grade level standards and so I would disagree that it's a negative culture of accountability I look at it as reciprocal accountability of what do our students need and what do our teachers need in order to teach and learn at optimal levels and how do we as a district get away from the world wind of trying to do everything to focusing in on what's important and getting the outcomes that we need you have a follow-up board member well yes just briefly I mean what can be done around this claim that is there an opportunity through maybe the sqt or otherwise just the process of opening scope and sequence just how can we help stem this concern

[00:42:00]
whether it's I'll just stop there how can we help them to make sure that it's not spreading not a president of the members of the board thank you for the question we are meeting with the sqt team every other week and we have been doing that for the past several years we are working at instructional Frameworks scope and sequence as well as units of study we have a pretty Dynamic exchange every other week I feel like it's a healthy environment in which we collectively created to have honest conversations about this and other aspects of the work so I am optimistic that that will continue moving forward and that we will continue to have that as a mutually agreed upon mechanism to work together to move the work forward great thank you that's reassuring

[00:43:00]
my last question is just about the Middle School task force which seems relevant to this particular goal and so I just wanted to understand how are the findings or the recommendations the outcome of that task force being implemented in concert with the school Madam chair members of the board and board member Gonzalez thank you for the question we are as we said in our next steps looking at how to implement some of the mathematical intervention that needs to happen at our middle schools by building that into strategically the master schedules and I think one thing that we have to think about as a district we have to do we have to do something differently at middle school because it's not working the way that you know we need it to work and I think I want you know teachers and principals to know like what what can we do differently within a master schedule we

[00:44:00]
at 6 in the school day how do we shift some of that how do we say you know what Thursday afternoons we're going to focus on math mathematical practice we're going to you know Focus all our energy on that so when we look at one of the recommendations which was flexible scheduling that is part of the next steps that we're going to take to look at middle school schedules to say how do we build in that time for our kids to have access to the acceleration needed to get them closer to grade level standards also you know looking at the culture and some of the fear that families and the community have around Middle School we see a strong decline in enrollment in the transfer to Middle School from Elementary in our district and so looking at the why behind that when I asked people about that they just you know they say we're nervous it's a scary it's scary

[00:45:00]
play it's different and so you know we have worked to to say when you come into the schools I mean they're they're wonderful there's wonderful adults helping kids guiding them to where they need to be so we have looked potentially as we're working on our calendar which you all will be able to see you soon as options how do we build in like a sixth grade jump start day to get our sixth graders into the middle schools for a day to walk their schedules to alleviate some of that anxiety and to get families onto campus as well so that they can see the facility they can meet the teachers and not have it be so intimidating on that first week of school so those are some of the things that were that we're looking at thank you and I don't have any other questions right now okay we'll come back to you board member top you have a question

[00:46:00]
the first is just a follow-up to on the what is not going well and I circled three inconsistent throughout the the document it says this is inconsistent that is inconsistent so my question is what what is what is what is the strategy and following up on the sqt I think maybe we could go a little bit more in depth as to what is the strategy to lessen the inconsistency and to are there any consequences to their being inconsistency throughout the the usage of the high quality instructional material as an example but I'm president Jackson members of the board thank you for the question a couple of things that I like to

[00:47:00]
mention that will help minimize the inconsistencies on I'm very hopeful and kind of excited about these things actually the first one is as has been mentioned we are taking seriously the work of guardrail 3 to really monitor keep the thing the thing and have common language around HQ I am and standard grade level standards tomorrow we are testing the instrument that we have worked very hard to perfect I'm really excited about tomorrow I'm even more excited about taking that instrument to calibration in January and using it in March so that we are able to collect the second point of data to bring back to you in the second progress monitoring for guardrail 3 so that is going to breed I hope throughout our system common language in this is

[00:48:00]
we're looking for this is what we're doing and I think that will go a long way the other thing that I like to mention is you may have seen and heard we are I have a dry throat you may have seen you may have seen and heard that we have District directed professional development days and these days have been targeted around supporting our teachers around the use of high-quality instructional materials not just randomly at one school or another school but collectively as a district unit working together with English teachers language arts teachers Math teachers and really doing that not just one hitting it but

[00:49:00]
overtime professional development overtimes were people are able to learn try adjust come back here from others perfect the work of the professional development and what is aiming to get to them finally to your point about what is the work of sqt we recognize and we celebrate that no material will ever take the place of Highly qualified teacher with that said we feel a very strong responsibility as a district to provide as many tools as possible for our teachers to really engage in their art form and that is why we wish to be consistent throughout YouTube with the units of study that will connect

[00:50:00]
to the HQ I am but also give a suggested pathway scope and sequence of how they can use the materials to teach the given class so we are working on that intentionally and deliberately it's exciting work we are listening to each other I believe we're hearing each other and I think that's important for us to work together and partnership to really make this I'm not a false start but exciting work that will energize the organization through our goals and girls thank you for that it if it's okay it actually brought it to two questions as clarification and the instrument that you said you're hoping to bring back the next time we discuss school to the right now go to and the instrument is not

[00:51:00]
what particular to go to that there is an instrument being developed for all the goals correct yes correct under guardrail 3 okay so so we will have an instrument so basically you're giving us more data you're collecting more more touch points so that we can accurately understand what's going on we're trying hard to keep up with our progress monitoring Journeys question of our how are you looking at all of this you know between the different groups and from that day will you be able to extrapolate some root causes okay so thank you for that and as far as the particulars of the pool so that I can be specific of the appendix j29 the standards base teacher teaching within the negotiated agreement

[00:52:00]
is there anything that you like potentially looking well never mind forget that forget that question so that will bring me to my other question which was I'm looking at the what is going well and again they're consistent I see a lot of leadership development for our principles and professional development and can you just again I think so that we can kind of come to Center remind us how those are aligned to the Strategic plan with all of this professional development and it seems like it's a lot for the principals and so how how is that being filtered down to the main thing being the main thing that impressive thank you for the question it's a good question and it is a lot but we're trying

[00:53:00]
go to chunk it and we're trying to align it in a way that the principles are able to get the information to engage in their role support example we're working to get the PD to the principal first so that they're able to see how the curriculum Works how they can observe support coach monitor the use of and before we give it to our teachers so that there's common language and there's a through line between the different groups within the schools and within the organization that is something to be very honest that our principles of ask for they've asked for intentionality behind the way we proceed there is I think I hope connecting

[00:54:00]
light up the dots with every passing day we are having to work on the great and sometimes that means letting go of the good and really focusing in on what we've been charged with here with the work aligning it to the school 90 Day plans and that's where you really see the Synergy and the light bulbs on top of people's heads come on because they're able to make this specific to their school and that's when we talked about scoreboards or when we talk about these different initiatives it's really nothing more than an illustration a reminder that this is what we're doing and I'll stop there ya know I I am encouraged to hear that there is their strategy and Alignment behind

[00:55:00]
the all everything right because you read read this and you think oh that's that's a lot of stuff that's going on so I'm encouraged to know that there is a and just one more thing as we learn this semester we also anticipate the calendar for next year so we're taking notes and we're saying okay some things are working some things maybe didn't work and how can we adjust to produce a better recommendation for a calendar or a schedule that makes sense because I think we want to be transparent honest that we are also learning as we engage in the world in one of your responses

[00:56:00]
how are we how are you Bridging the sqt effort and the PD to principles because the way I was explained that I immediately thought what was their separation so I want to get clarity about that but I'm president member Dominguez you raise a good point I think that is the next level of work right now as the work is established in the current mou in which we are functioning under with the current negotiate agreement is a call to action for the district to work with ATF on units of study so the principal link is something that before we get to deep into the revision of the work cuz I would like to

[00:57:00]
find the board that we do have units of study that have been used and have been worked on and a lot of standard standards aligned units of study we're working to revise those using the new HQ I am keeping the Fidelity to understanding that these are tools based on the standards so your point about working with principals and making the principal connection is one that we will take back and continue to Desert OK Google

[00:58:00]
Gonzales simulator Aragon because those were the two questions that I had submitted and sorry I appreciate the answers about what's being have the task force work is moving forward and I will come hearing anything more in depth on that one if there's because it really addressed things like family groups cross curricular instruction that's more engaging and so I know you started answering do you want to add anything to that yes thank you madam chair members of the board a board member Peterson part of the Middle School task force recommendations was to shift to that smaller Learning Community Family model something that's challenging with that is that you have

[00:59:00]
there's kind of a floor of what you need as far as enrollment to be able to do that well what we're seeing is the decline in enrollment in middle school which means that we have schools many schools with lower enrollment which creates challenges in trying to make those smaller learning communities work just due to lack of resources teachers so that is something that we absolutely know is the best practice but we have to look I think a little bit stronger at how do we build you know how do we get our elementary school families and students to opt into our middle schools so that are enrollment can be higher so that we can start building these best practices within the middle schools because right now it's a struggle so yes it's a recommendation because we know what's what's good for kids and for teachers

[01:00:00]
it's a struggle and then you add layers of students who need to take you know ELD special education that all is a challenge to create what is the word I'm looking for cohorts of students are families of students that are here that's the word pure families there's some cross mixing happening because of that so yes we know that's the best practice we know that that's where we want to go but it's going to take a big culture shift at the middle school level for us to build up on that so this sort of my questions

[01:01:00]
play in this goes back to root cause that there are definitely and I and I see appropriately real focus on the instruction specifically around math specifically within classrooms but clearly when we start looking at root causes it's not just a simple as well follow this textbooks down to really looking at those three causes and we do have one model I mean just thinking that the community school bring more work and that means resources period and what that really means

[01:02:00]
for what we need to prioritize when it comes to budget how we need to look at focusing resources and what it means is we delve deeper into what are those conditions that make some groups of students struggle is that a question all of these questions around strategy it's the beginning of the discussion it's not a finite single simple I think the work is ongoing and I think as a board you all have established some really strong goals and guardrails and so it's a shifting culture for the district as well and having

[01:03:00]
look at where we now have a road map we now have you know goals in place and how do we as unique individual School communities contribute and build upon those those goals so it is an ongoing we look at different schools and their challenges I know that are associated superintendents they know their school's very well and they're working really hard with principles and staff to you know learn to let something go we can't do it all and to really hone in on what is the focus for our Elementary's what is the focus for our little schools and our high schools so I think you all have given us a great Target and so we're trying to backwards plan and how to achieve those goals but yeah the root causes were each school is looking at their own root causes based on their 90 Day plans of what does that look like what's getting in the way of the

[01:04:00]
end of progress and they're working hard and I think what we've seen a shift in that could be misinterpreted as a different type of accountability is that there's we have looked at 90 Day plans pdp's as compliance documents versus tools to increase you know tools for improvement on every level and I think that that has been a shift because we are now pushing with those plans we're connecting the dots with staff and support and resources for those plans so there is a greater accountability for principals and their 90-day plan teams to really come together to determine what are those next steps and what is impeding the work and how do we overcome that so I think that has been the culture shift of here's documents we have

[01:05:00]
to complete to comply versus here's tools that we can use in our daily work to guide to guide the work thank you for that and I just keep thinking about the Martinez decision and some of it had to do with resources and sufficient funding some of it really addressed deeper curricular ideas of what's really culturally appropriate what really addresses who are students are looking at that more deeply and I think it's really critical that we keep that in mind as well as we look at the specific content area instructions to and I am delighted to hear the thinking that's going on around collaboration NPD because I'm sorry about elementary

[01:06:00]
I have last week's meeting much on my mind not and I don't want to make it strictly about Roosevelt Middle School but Roosevelt Middle School in terms of a system that we're thinking about this to remove barriers to schools like Roosevelt they applied

[01:07:00]
a magnet steam status and for whatever reason they they thought it was a done deal and it's not so those sorts of barriers make it really hard to compete what is the plan for next steps to schools who are seeking to be in Madam chair members of the board board member Dominguez unfortunately I was unable to attend last meeting but I think in general

[01:08:00]
we have to do a better job at promoting the greatness that is happening at our middle schools so that it's evident within the community I'm not quite sure about the steam is that a state was the state do they apply to state or it's within its within 8 p.m. okay so I need to learn more about that I'm not quite sure what that I mean they applied for I think it's through the office of innovation magnet but what I'm getting at is yes removing these internal obstacles especially where there's motivation and and my understanding is you know we want to link this particular school to its Elementary they're going to apply but don't hold up the whole train

[01:09:00]
because of One Piece right or our mid schools need to be supported and if it's happening typically it's happening one place more than likely it's happening just system-wide do you have any other questions I'm just wondering if you know we're talking about a strategy to to definitely make our middle schools I mean it seems from a systems perspective we need to do something with middle school I hear this a lot we've already had a task force we've got some recommendations and I hear what you're saying is that part of its

[01:10:00]
so you've got to have a floor I mean I heard a lot of barriers about why we can't get there so I'm wondering is there an opportunity to like start with a demonstration somewhere is there a place that we can at least look at this so that we can push something that's different and and it feels like we're at least studying and we're making some steps rather than just waiting on having like all the perfect conditions Madam president members of the board I think we can look at some of our higher enrollment middle schools to see what can really happen there because when we have greater enrollment we have we can create more robust programming we can do the best practices the part of the task force as well recommendation was to have sufficient support staff you know a full-time counselor a full-time nurse a full-time social worker

[01:11:00]
we're spread so thin over many campuses you get a 0.5 you get a 0.5 it's really challenging so I think you know looking at that and I don't want to say APS is the only district with a middle school you know issue it's Nationwide Middle School is challenging and there's many unfortunate negative perceptions about Middle School from families but we do have great middle schools and it is you know I don't think we look at it as these are we're telling you all these are challenges that we are working on but we are working really hard to look at the great things that are happening in our middle school then we need to do a better job at that we really do and I suppose my question is just really from the perspective of like time is of the essence because if you're that parent who has a child in 5th grade this year and you're looking down the road of where am I going to go

[01:12:00]
what I what I fear is the conversation that we're having tonight really just tell them we're not ready you know we're still working on it it's not it's not there so we do need to highlight where there is greatness because I agree there's probably pockets of greatness and how do we do that and how do we do more of that that's absolutely important I'm not I'm not saying it's broken everywhere but but we we do have a problem right we I mean and and I hear what board member to me is the saying is because we have a very engaged community and the East mountains absolutely and we have students that are in a wonderful APS magnet that need to have a middle school home whether it's East Mountain Middle School or it's us they're going to need that middle school and so it seems like we're in a prime spot to figure out just to figure out that problem because it's not easy to get from the East mountains to anywhere else but I

[01:13:00]
so so my other question is have we had any schools come forward with a request for a realignment or have an example of a realignment that is kind of like sparked your interest just from the first semester at the middle school level Madam president of the board yes along several different lines a couple that come to mind is how can we schedule Middle School differently what does that look like from a intervention point of view from a curriculum point of view even from an enrichment point of view so we've had middle schools excited about that conversation we've had middle schools very excited about the whole notion of how do we do SEL well within the curriculum and outside the curriculum at the middle school level and we've also had middle schools approached us in regards to

[01:14:00]
I don't want to politicals because I think that's a thing but how do we connect to Career connected learning at the middle school level in anticipation of high school so there's a lot of outside the box thinking today we had curriculum board with our elementary middle and high school assistant principals and that's always a think tank for the work and always leave energized from those types of and I guess is the the question around the sqt work you know in terms of lining with you know that that is that happening so when you do an sqt is it like middle school sqt and we're thinking or is it just just in general okay because that that part kind of threw me off a little bit

[01:15:00]
how can I lost my train of thought there because I had a question on it and I just can't I can't I can't gather it so I'm going to stop for a minute and it'll come back to me but cuz it's thinking about the strategy around sort of bringing that stuff together cuz I was really curious about that is anyone else have another strategic question or just a question in general and so when you're disgusting you mentioned something about the task force and like cohorts families within Middle School can you can you just expand on that a little bit cuz this is the first I'm hearing of it is something like what they do at the Academy where you go in and you're in your family's I'm not quite sure about the academy but I can say that in a family model at the middle

[01:16:00]
school is you have your core teachers your English math science and social studies with the same group of students that rotate throughout the day and so you might have two families or three families or four families at each grade level but you're connected you're kind of within the same group of kids not identical but you're shifting within a greater group of kids with those for teachers and the the expected outcomes from working within a family is so when your teachers are all working with the same kids it's easier to collaborate it's easier to problem solve you know if students are struggling in this classroom oh well Courtney is fantastic in my classroom what do you mean she's you know being disruptive in yours and so then it's the teachers that get to talk and pull Courtney

[01:17:00]
you never behave like that in mind and it's kind of this team of working together with those like students so that it's common and it creates instead of just you know all students going to all different Math teachers English teachers it's a smaller learning community so there's greater cohesion and if I may just add one more thing because we're talking about this this is the subject of my dissertation totally go and take a look at it but it's a way of creating a small school feel inside of a large Urban school so so that instead of a student seeing you know a different batch of kids every hour they see the same group of kids over the course of the day and it helps them build those Pro school it helps them build school-based social relationships it also simplifies the

[01:18:00]
on the teachers because for the teachers to understand the kid they will they will be able to see other teachers who have that same kid and you can talk about two or three kids at the same time because you share them and you're not as a teacher you're not having to go and hunt the other five teachers in their schedule you know that you're all together so it's a really cool thing if you can I I can't resist adding just you know I do this sometimes even even even even in elementary school when you have less than 32 kids that you're seeing when you have two adults that are working with those same 30 kids the insights that you get one adult find out about family crisis about what's going on at home about did you notice this disruption with this having having

[01:19:00]
more adults looking at the same child gives you incredible Insight even when you have less than 30 kids so I can't imagine what it's like if you have a 160 on your caseload there's just no way and so if we talk about social emotional will be having the small groups small groups of kids with more adult eyes on them is I mean what you say is entirely different from when it's just one adult and isolation trying to solve all the problems and I can understand why that difficulty of the floor and how many you know that you need to have because it's always a little predicated on how many teachers you need to have those groups to be able to do that my I believe my daughter had the opportunity to experience that kind of Middle School in Austin cuz she was

[01:20:00]
and I remember specifically remember and recall it for the 6th grade class for sure because with that 6th grade and that that transition from elementary into the sixth grade having that small group it was it was very beneficial I don't remember going threaded all the way through through Middle School I think it was tiered but definitely I do recall that sixth grade year I am a proud graduate of the Trailblazer family at Capshaw middle school I know I am sure if I asked my daughter she'd tell me what family she was with and I can't you talk about families and you're looking at it from the instructional point of view the opportunity for sports

[01:21:00]
all of a sudden the student is working toward the same thing in four or five different classes I would recommend that that something come forward to the board recommending for us to at least start that and demonstrate that so that we can figure out what the cost is and how we're going to do that because it does seem like it's it's irrelevant model we know that it works but we can't get there if we don't know how we're going to have to align align our resources to do it and so and instead of just sort of wishing or thinking this would be great I think in order for the board to be to be a partner in that we'd have to know what we're looking at and what's the cost and what would it take to do that because otherwise we're just talking about something that we're wishing for I I really would love to see the opportunity to demonstrate that let's get it started at least demonstrate that we can do it and and show the benefit of that right so

[01:22:00]
I'm thinking even back to my John Adams days and I am pretty confident we have something very similar to that because I'm thinking of the group that I stayed with my certain teachers like it was like a little pod so where did we lose we did it you know cuz I'm like and I think Danielle might because Danielle was with me at John Adams you know like think about like where did we lose I guess the method or you know the process because we should be able to go back and duplicate what we did then cuz I'm like you're saying all the time like we did this you know it was long time ago but we did it and Madam chair board member of America but it requires certain foundational resources in components and when were faced with some you know the Esther Cliff is right ahead of us

[01:23:00]
seeing a decrease in enrollment as a district it's more difficult to create those those models when the resources are stretched in a cross so many schools the other because if we don't make the initial investment decisions that is going to and so yes I have an urgency and I'm trying

[01:24:00]
be patient had to make it a patient urgency but it is an urgency that we we do exactly what is being discussed up here and I will say I know this focuses on med school but extending it into population

[01:25:00]
play a bit from asking our smart questions and word suggesting Solutions so I wanted to move to consider acceptance of progress monitoring report for goal to interim goals 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 focusing on math proficiency we have a motion to have a second okay I just have one more time that I I caught my my memory on this because I know that if we want to change Middle School we're not going to Simply do it by just monitoring a math goal so I think we know it's bigger than that so thank you for that I do also want to thank the staff for the the report and the work that's going to it and reminding the community to that we we're just starting so this was a great Baseline for where we are hopefully next reports really build on that a whole lot more so one more closing comment go ahead I have a question well I just want to point out that

[01:26:00]
I did have a request for data that I will continue to bring up and it is about getting granular on the 6th through 8th grade I ready data I asked which students are the day to talk about protected groups and African-Americans under special education I want to know what those results are for African American student

[01:27:00]
same thing for title one and I know that this is possible because I spoke to the date of person after the last meeting and we were sappers a little bit difficult especially when you don't know it as well as a data the data department so I'm just going to mention that my questions are going to continue to come up and go ahead in this case I would say thank you for the question that you are asking for in the breakdown was not available however for the iStation which was your previous request I believe our board Services office received it right before this meeting and so I anticipate that I would go out to you

[01:28:00]
I'm for your current request with respect to i-Ready I'll take it to our data folks and hopefully you will be able to have that thank you thank you thank you so we have a motion and we have a second sorry so I just want to again just kind of go back to the demographic sets are you know they seem to be just continually doing well and I want to make sure that that causes and I really do want to know what what we've learned from them if you look keep looking at the you know keep looking at all the data that we have and we look at the all other students consistently consistently are doing well the Asian students white students those that are not you know part of

[01:29:00]
the taxpayer-funded lunches they are always doing well so it's like what are like the factors that that seem to predetermine proficiency I mean the scores are over you see him over and over again and it seems like they are predetermined on in those demographics so is you know family income and family parental educational attainment affecting the scores so I think these are all things that I would like to to have answers to because we keep seeing the same thing over and over again and I don't I don't like that we could say that proficiency levels are predetermined by these so I just wanted to point that out again thank you all right so it's not you don't want to respond back you just want them to

[01:30:00]
I mean I know I don't think that we've got through to what the root causes are I don't I mean I don't think that there was really any answers for that Madam president so and obviously that's concerning to me it's like when we're trying to accept this monitoring report you know does reality match the vision of course it doesn't because of our you know does is there a growth toward the vision I don't know that there is and how would you know superintendent Elder be able to create a strategy and a plan to cause that growth if we don't even know what the root causes are so I don't like feel confident accepting the monitoring report based on everything that we've learned through sosg thank you and so it's like understanding where they're how that

[01:31:00]
what day does driving some of the decision-making right because if we know that the students continue to struggle how are we using that data to drive decision-making at this point with the district and the work that you're doing and we're doing a lot of professional development we've got a tool out there we're using you know wigs and you know we've got lots of strategies but how are we using the status with the groups that are not performing well where there is the gap how are we using that to drive some of the decision-making that have less adverse childhood experiences you know

[01:32:00]
so our job is to mitigate that through things like Community Schools allocating resources appropriately so that those challenges and barriers can be overcome with our support so I don't think that there is a silver bullet I think we're very aware of you know certain groups that outperform other groups and our efforts as an entire District in community is how can we support that how can we you know embed Community Schools in our schools to be able to support all of the things how do we create you know Avid programs where students are getting access and awareness to College and Career Readiness I think there's so much that goes into this it's not just one thing that is going to fix it and if there is will take it I mean I think the entire nation would want you know Insight on that but

[01:33:00]
we're dealing with we're dealing with human human beings and they come from different backgrounds and as a district I think it's important that we acknowledge that but that we work date on a daily basis to address those needs and to create programming to create support systems to help kids be able to achieve and not rely on the reason why they can't but be able to have the supports and resources so that they can thank you and I know it's difficult because it's the majority of our students and so I appreciate your response doctor because it is all of those things I think it's going back to all of our goals in our yard sales around with you know Equitable funding and access to wrap around support services and so on and so forth so I was going to thank you for that and I think what we're going to do is we do have a motion and we do have a second on the floor can

[01:34:00]
no Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes Crystal thank you thank you very much for your work on that so are next item is considered adopting the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students and I know they have me listed adult is that not it no I'm sorry it's the legislative agenda consider approval of priorities for the proposed 2024 legislative agenda we have Dr Escobedo and Jessica Martinez government affairs

[01:35:00]
the government Affairs team has been hard at work we have been in actually Santa Fe today and the rest of the week with the legislative education study committee we are preparing for the 2024 regular session which is a 30-day budget session which begins on Tuesday January 16th the district's top legislative priorities and public policy positions have been based on the administration's review history with us what we see coming down the line through legislative committee meeting and getting feedback from you in a meeting President through the Q&A we received a suggestion from the board to include an abbreviated version of the agenda so we've provided an attic lamps version of The District's legislative priorities it is at your seats the legislative agenda has been reviewed by superintendent Elder and is presented tonight for the boards consider

[01:36:00]
HVAC systems definitely needed technology devices definitely needed it occurs to me and it is it does refer to school Construction in the shortages or priority I'm curious how far short are we from actual in bond issues for construction in what actual costs are now do you know how much

[01:37:00]
Madam president and board member Peterson I think Statewide were sings up to Triple the cost so for example mosquito was rebuilding their K through 12 school 30 million was the anticipated budget and I think it came in at over 90 million so we're seeing those on a little lower scale here and we can get more details it seems like this might be a good common ground for everyone so what's the possibility of either the government

[01:38:00]
I know the LFC discussed it at length those committees are urging legislators to prioritize those those projects that are kind of hanging in limbo because of the overages of cost so it's a priority I know that it's it's on everybody's mind as we head into the session we have a sense of what the likelihood is I'm going to optimistically say that I think that legislators are aware of the very very severe need and are thinking through the steps that it will take on their end to make sure that the projects that need funding can be funded but I would hate to speak for them thank you very much one other thing I mean I did put in my notes just really putting in the increase in discretionary dollars

[01:39:00]
collaboration time and how we use the 11:40 so that that increase I just hope that we can keep hammering that but I visited with a group of students at Highland today and one of their primary asks was class size class size class size if you want if you actually care about social emotional learning if you actually care about how we're doing emotionally you're going to reduce class size we have too many kids and classrooms teachers don't have time for us and that's straight from the student now I didn't do it

[01:40:00]
legislative session these will be the ones that you as a team will be following along with any particular bills that are being introduced that would be in support of these right and working with our legislators and I know we've got a meeting plan to coming up with our legislators so this would be our platform that we would present with them to discuss what we think is highly important just wondering if you're finishing up go ahead and

[01:41:00]
I want to put a plug for class size starting kindergarteners 30 and in a classroom is not conducive to retaining teachers or or retaining enrollment right but I'm wondering and I'm wondering out loud here with regard to Capital Is it wise for us to make it clear at least the level of need that APS has is 7 billion dollars to get it all done and if we're talking about cost having increased I mean we're just never going to get out of or circumstance and we need to because we need

[01:42:00]
as part of the engaged or increased learning opportunities and smaller class sizes are brought up as as a piece of that I'm just wondering we need more we don't need more so what is the school construction renovation and inflation stabilization part of the argument is well gas prices are coming down well maybe

[01:43:00]
at what point do you pull the lever so that's the Statewide you know facility construction you know conversation but we're actually going to also take an aggressive approach with our Capital outlay request so as you were involved with one of them last year are pretty in intensively we will be asking for two projects for every school so one will be a support of a capital master plan priority so if they have needing security fencing I could be their priority or could be the cost of planning a kindergarten Edition to a school so that is a priority and then working with the school also they were able to select another priority of Technology yeah they had a CMP provided us with the list of four options that could be requested this year that do not overlap with previous

[01:44:00]
that we know the legislators have funds for and we know that Capital Appropriations will increase for them individually this year as well I think it's worth mentioning to that the discussion about capital projects Statewide is is one that was very much highlighted today at LSC New Mexico seeing the lowest pay rate for construction workers the highest cost of project completion creating Havoc as you can imagine but the conversation that legislators are going to need to have about how to how to meet in the middle with our Capital funding is is one that they're very much engaged in a conversation

[01:45:00]
at a recent Review Committee or a review meeting for a construction project and what's evident is that although we have let's just say 10 projector we probably have funding for only five because we can't do the other five and so it's like how do we stabilize that and we had gone out and asked for to raise the funds to do that but because of the rising costs we can't get to those and and miss all you want to describe that further because I believe that's part of what the issue is on the stabilization side and asking for assistance on that so that we can finish and get to completion on those projects that we promised the community we would do yes so I'm not exactly sure of the numbers but I think that we promised in 2021 to the voters which they approved to complete 19 projects and will be

[01:46:00]
if we get through 7 of them and so what we're thinking on the capital side is that the ideal would be that we would ask for a one-time influx of cash not through single legislative Appropriations but through an off the top and we would like it to happen with other districts throughout the state because this is impacted the whole country the labor shortage is the inflation the manufacturing delays everything has led to at least in our district a little bit more than doubling the project costs for everything that we build so what we would like to see is a off the

[01:47:00]
stop straight across the board reduction of all the money that they have donated to this inflation issue and I noticed cuz you just popped on so if he has anything to add to this I'd appreciate it thank you the brunt of this because the taxpayers three years ago no just an APS but over the restaurant in the last three years that cost has tripled and so if those project

[01:48:00]
we are going to be done without any help it'll be back to the taxpayers to Bear the brunt of that issue and it's even worse with a smaller District so it's one of those things with non-recurring funds if it's possible to help out an inflation stabilization for all the districts for this Capital so we can continue looking after ourselves moving forwards going to have a copy of this before the meeting so they have time to prepare and give us a some good feedback okay fantastic thank you

[01:49:00]
I'll move that we accept the proposed legislative agenda Daniel Gonzalez Jackson I'm sorry about that thank you so much I'm like moving along here is considering adopting Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students you have me listed as the presenter on this and I wasn't I don't know why I wasn't quite prepared for that

[01:50:00]
the resolution was was drafted and I'm going to invite Ms McDonald to come up for some of your partners to come up please to help us a little bit to explain the what this what this resolution is and how you would like for us to be of assistance with you on this good evening Madam chair and honorable board members the executive director for one generation and also as a chair for a National Fund for excellence in American Indian education which is dedicated to improving outcomes for Native students across the country but also hyper locally in our city and also with our native community on my father's side and I'm an alumni of Highland High School Jefferson Middle School Zia Elementary School and Alvarado Elementary

[01:51:00]
go ahead and follow protocol to ask the other community members who are here today to introduce themselves if that's okay with you yes thank you next Saturday the senior policy director for one generation and thank you for having us Maroon 5 I'm a citizen of the Comanche Nation I'm executive director of Americans bringing opportunity of 50 years old more than 50 years old organization that advocates for indigenous brights I'm also the current chair of the Native leadership Collective of Albuquerque which is made up of 31 native lead organizations both National regional and local organization

[01:52:00]
and I'm also the president of the board of the National Urban Indian family Coalition so thank you very much for having us today Madam chair and board members thank you good evening Madam chair board members my name is Kyle Papa those are my plans and now I'm originally from Window Rock I am a Navy Navy veterans from homelessness but luckily through organization's non-profits area entities they helped me get back on my feet and I work for Americans for Indian opportunity as Urban indigenous organizer as well as a co-chair of the commission on American Ninja Warriors

[01:53:00]
resolution Justice solidify our partnership that's already in existence I mean there's already a lot of work that has gone on I know I have attended the Indian policy group that I see Mr first and out there and I should invite you up to the table as well but I mean so there's already collaboration and this is just really to just solidify that collaboration and partnership that goes on it is that correct yes Madam chair and honorable members that is correct is to formalize and solidifies the work that's been put into action with Mr Carson and his staff as well as the superintendent Elder and the community members who attended a variety of different elements and came up with some really good ideas about how we can collaborate and create even stronger attempts to support our Native American students I really go ahead board member sorry I

[01:54:00]
let me see if I was stepping on someone there who is going to speak it was just me Yolanda but it's all right go ahead yeah I just wanted to thank our guests for joining us tonight and add a little bit of context as well I think part of the issue that is trying to be solved here is the fact that we as a district have now are emerging stronger strategic plan we have the Indian Education Act within our state which requires us to essentially develop a plan for how we as a district are going to partner with tribal communities to serve the Indian students in our district and then we also have the recommendations that stemmed from both the first and the second annual indigenous education Summits which I know myself a couple of other board members as well as superintendent Elder had the opportunity to attend and so I think in light of those multiple different potential potentially parallel tracks of the plan the Indian Education Act and

[01:55:00]
the recommendations wanted to make sure that that work moves forward coherently and aligned and that the district is not working in isolation but working again with our tribes working with our internet education department but also working with Partners who are experts in the field but also expert in community engagement and so trying to bring all of that stuff together as I think is the purpose of the resolution and I think important to acknowledge too that we are in a moment of transition within our district and so as we're having transition in both four numbers and superintendent again I think equally important to communicate the importance of staying the course and really focusing on this important issue again coherently and with alignment absolutely and and I do want to apply the group that came together because I have seen you and have seen you being working really closely with our department and I agree with board member Gonzalez is this opportunity at a time of transition and US needing to pull this all together

[01:56:00]
what a fabulous opportunity with that Summit and getting all of that those pieces pull together and really coming together I think around with APS also on our emerging stronger plan that they have as well as our goals and guardrails so it is an opportunity for us to have this document that will also solidify for this next superintendent coming in for sure as we move forward and so I'm going to open it up for the board members does anyone else have any other questions or comments on this go ahead board member Peterson able to attend any part of the indigenous educational

[01:57:00]
have been truly impressed by the work that Mr person in that department have taken on I mean I just see I've been on the board now for it'll be two I keep saying 2 months minus 9 years when I step off at the end of December and the work that is going on right now is qualitatively different from what what was going on when I first came on and I and I truly that not just not just in terms of providing services and support to our students in a real commitment to to Growing especially the language component on the relationship with tribal governments that there has never been

[01:58:00]
level of acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the communities around us and what that means governmentally to governmentally between us and I just I really applaud that so I have I always have concerns when I look at the expertise and the work that's going on within the district right now what that means for partnership it's not not trying to supplant or work around or undermine the work that is being done right now but how does it support but still I mean I feel like it's important for the leadership of the Indiana Department of what that means for the district so I'm just curious how you see that interaction means in terms of

[01:59:00]
and how you do that in collaboration with the work that's going on well since I represent the the collaboration the native leadership Collective which includes the American Indian Graduate Center now called native scholar forward and a napper Native American parents professional resource until we have expert organizations as a part of our Coalition and we have just been so impressed and appreciative of the department including Urban leaders and Native lead organizations to be a part of the reporting to give us the opportunity to share the the Indian

[02:00:00]
vacation act needs assessment with our American constituencies 31 organizations tend to have a very large constituencies and then we're lucky to also have the collaboration of the Albuquerque city Commission on Indian Affairs as well so we're we're all about collaborating and being supportive we want to ensure that this collaboration results in improve student outcomes but it certainly is a testament to the fact of what what the cry is right I mean the call to action at the whole state level is really around improving our student outcomes and it sounds like there has been this tremendous collaboration and around and Coalition coming together really to support our district and I do I agree with or member Peterson in terms of calling out our Indiana Department in terms of the level of Engagement that I think has just is exponentially gotten so much

[02:01:00]
I'm just going to do a quick shout out for superintendent Elder for also supporting that right because I think we've had through his leadership he's also made that possible for us to to make sure that we're engaged at that level and supporting that level of Engagement with our tribal leaders and also with Community Partners such as yourself so thank you so much for doing that are there any other questions or comments go ahead board member I think that this resolution is it's very much in line with improving student outcomes which is the entire reason that we exist as a school board is to improve do not comes and we have you know definitely included those obviously in our goals and so I think that this resolution aligns with our work and and I'm very much in support of it and I appreciate the the level of detail that was put into it and I think it is a is that your work

[02:02:00]
I sent it off to the department first so that they could take a look at it and and actually respond to it and you know sort of look at that too so it wasn't something that was just done in a vacuum without the input from Mr Parsons review and approval and also with the superintendent so I think there was just a minor adjustment made some language that I think we all agreed to so I think we're in good shape there so any other questions I will move for approval to adopt the resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students all second

[02:03:00]
Danielle Gonzales I'm a yes I also want to disclose that I am paid staff for one generation fund but also want to acknowledge that there's no exchange of funding as part of this partnership so there's no conflict Barbara Peterson's to our community we appreciate you thank you thank you for being patient with us I know it took a while for us to get there right our next item is a discussion and also action and this is considered consideration for adding and acknowledgment of tribal land to our board Education meeting we have had oh man

[02:04:00]
I don't have it with me in front of me let me see let me get it to you real quick so what I was I'm proposing this I had told the board members that I would bring this forward I would like to add an acknowledgment to tribal lands we are in a really unique situation in Albuquerque we serve I can't even remember the total number I think it's 22 23 Sovereign Nations that are partners with us on this and also I'm working with the Indian policy group learned something really important to about the significant or the unique status that our tribal communities have they have a unique Federal status because they are sovereign Nations and we are a nation amongst many nations and for me even though it seems that it may be performative in nature I think it all so helps us

[02:05:00]
escape from what we believe at the board level down to the school level that we acknowledge that we're on tribal land and that we acknowledge that we're working in a very unique situation which makes our community rich and makes our state very rich and so I am proposing that we add the acknowledgment of tribal land to the board Education meeting it would be the one that I had read many weeks ago and I'm sorry that I don't have it pulled up right away this is what makes it hard for me can you send that to me really quickly do you have it or is it right there at the bottom okay there it was you're right and I got really nervous about this all right so what it would read if I can see this gratefully acknowledge the native people's on Whose homelands We Gather as well as the

[02:06:00]
who make their home here today and that's what I am proposing I'll open it up for discussion or motion is something that we have been working on for a long time so I would like to move that we approve the land acknowledgment period I'm just trying to I guess go back to disinformation we've heard through our training through all this and I guess my main question because I know we were trying to even change the way our original opening was from like the moment of silence the video that we were showing before to really talk about like what is the intent and how we're going to tie everything together

[02:07:00]
but I think that's what I feel like we're now going back to what we were the purpose of what we were trying to do like I see the intent behind it and I recognize that but I just don't know if it necessarily belongs to be stated at every board meeting at the beginning so I just I guess I have some reservations there and we're asking it to be added to just our regular board meeting so it wouldn't be at policy meetings or committee meetings just the regular board meetings on the first and the third Wednesday or or whenever that the regular board meetings and for me I think personally I believe it is a statement about our students because we're acknowledging that amongst us we have a unique status of students in our in our district that are part of sovereign Nations that are part of that make up our district and I think it sends a very powerful message to them I

[02:08:00]
go from our Native American students what we've often have heard that they feel that they're not seen or that they feel that they're invisible or that they're not part of us in a in a certain way or that we haven't acknowledged them and their unique Federal status with us with within our within our district I wrote down what I wanted to say because I wanted to be very clear and intentional with my discussion but so I'm just going to start so the to me the road away from student outcomes Focus governance is paved with good intentions a year ago we all agreed that our school board would become intensely focused on improving student outcomes and to do so that we would change our own be

[02:09:00]
to honor that work one of the first things we did was to reformat our agenda we removed items that were deemed performative or even partisan and replace them with a more effective and efficient agenda that focuses on student outcomes and legally required topics it was hard to give up the agenda items that each of us valued individually but we did it in order to place significance on the skills of effective governing over the skills of effective campaigning and we all agreed that when we were on the diets are rule would be to govern we also agreed that our work with sosg is to be the voice of the community what I have heard from the community is a plea to improve student outcomes for our Native American students and that was also highlighted by the essential collaborative Partnerships steps that were

[02:10:00]
I'm in the first and second annual Urban indigenous education Summit I know that we are answering those calls with specific intentional focus in our goals as well as through the resolution to which we all just agreed we absolutely should be partnering with Community organizations to improve the student outcomes of our indigenous students and we should use our governing skills to ensure that that happens through direct and focused action but what we should not be doing is deciding which special recognitions deserve time on the agenda and which do not our work towards improving student outcomes is much more valuable than routine recognition or acknowledgement events that ultimately lose their meaning when they become commonplace and ordinary it is more discourse and performance

[02:11:00]
when what we should be doing is monitoring and improving I want to be very clear about this my concern is not about this particular acknowledgment however well-intentioned and accurate I believe it to be it is about all of the other requests that will come after it it is about honoring the work that we all agreed to do and to spend our time intentionally which means education and improving outcomes has to be our singular focus when we removed the tribute to our fallen APS military Heroes and replace it with a moment of silence it was heartbroken but I understood if we have a statement let it be that we are here to honor the children families teachers and staff of APs by providing them with

[02:12:00]
is successful educational outcome I am asking that we respect our sosg principles from the dice and continue to use the moment of silence to respect and pay tribute to the issues we personally give value to and to use the rest of the agenda to focus on student outcomes thank you board member Jackson any other comments go ahead board member to me in English and Spanish and those are honorable rituals is a very significant tribute

[02:13:00]
we do a lot of business on their land and I'd like to ask that I don't want to make this performative I support the land acknowledgment and I certainly do not want to make it a performative act and so I am going to stress to to staff that I've already talked to that we begin by acknowledge to register their children in our district back in August and I was a

[02:14:00]
is there a compromise of even saying what if we salute the flag for the state of New Mexico

[02:15:00]
where we talked about where everyone's included and we're not having just to identify one set group of individuals but we're recognizing who we are as a whole recognizing what the Zia symbol stands for versus having some isolation that is a thought that came up I just want to make sure I understand everybody saying and I realize the importance of making sure that everyone feels that no one is forgotten like that is a terrible way but we don't want to isolate any students of any course but I hear also what board member Jackson saying is like how can we make sure that we're including everybody not just one group of individual

[02:16:00]
tribal community and so that's the part that I find a little bit difficult because all we're saying here is that we're acknowledging all the tribal lands it was greatly acknowledged the native people's homelands We Gather and it's not a tribute to any one particular tribal Community I mean I think the I think that was how it was selected so I think belongs to me if I'm not mistaken I think it's too soon as for me it's it's more inclusive in stating it this way any other comments I'm going to go ahead and call for the roll call cuz I think we'll just go in circles I don't know that we're all in agreement but can I have a real call

[02:17:00]
play Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson carries thank you for the discussion I really appreciate everyone's opportunity I just appreciate the opportunity for us to take that up period it's been a busy couple weeks for the board in the district first I want to congratulate the three newly elected board members that come on at the beginning of the new year will be representing district one just the district that I am currently serving Ronaldo Tomei to be representing District 2 which was the district that board member Mueller going was representing and Heather benavidez will be representing District 4 which was

[02:18:00]
the new board members will spend the next couple of months learning what it means to be a school board member they will be attending mandatory training by the New Mexico School Board Association and APS onboarding provided by our current board members and staff alike so I know some of us have been contacted for that they will be sworn into office on Wednesday January the 3rd here in our boardroom we look forward to transitioning these new board members it's guaranteed to be an eye-opening experience I'm sure we're going to have some changes and right now I just want to thank board members Peterson and Muller ottagon for their years of service to the students and the staff of Albuquerque Public Schools they've done an admirable job I came on with these two women when I was appointed and both have been extremely helpful to me and my knowledge and the things that I learned as a result of working with you and I think just over the last

[02:19:00]
board members that we've had that joined us after that they and I will be wrapping up our time on the board in just a few weeks our last meeting will be on Wednesday December 20th and it will be preceded by a reception at 3:30 p.m. here at 8:00 p.m. the administration building there will be some more information to come so hopefully some of our friends from staff and the community will come to join us with that but we're all going to take a moment to reflect on our you know the members that are coming off but we've also invited the new board members to that reception so that we could also have that as a transitional piece I also want to take a moment to provide an update on the superintendent search we had about 100 people took part in the community conversations with board members on Monday at West Mesa and thanks to all who participated and share their thoughts on the characteristics of the next superintendent and I'd like to thank board members Peterson and Gonzalez who did a fantastic job
