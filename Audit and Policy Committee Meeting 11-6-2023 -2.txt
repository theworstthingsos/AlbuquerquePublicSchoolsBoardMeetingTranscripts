[00:02:00]
what's the committee meeting agenda may I please have emotion I'll move for approval of the November 6th 2023 policy committee meeting agenda may I have a roll call vote please Yolanda Montana's yes all right next on the agenda is approval of the minutes may I please have the minutes from the policy committee meeting on October 16th 2023 emotion to approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on October 16th 2023 the second may I have a roll call please Peterson Danielle Gonzales yes all right moving on

[00:03:00]
the first item on our agenda for discussion and action is to consider approval of the board budget policy I don't have my specifics but I do know that we have Miss Martinez and Lynette Apodaca here tonight as presenters thank you madam chair good evening members of the board superintendent Elder we do have three action items on tonight's agenda we are starting with an agenda item four point one which is consideration of approval of the boards budget policy at the request of the policy committee the Chief Financial Officer worked with staff to develop a budget policy that establishes a framework for developing approving and managing the aps budget the policy committee had first read of this policy during October 16th meeting and since then the policy has been posted to the aps website for public comment and include

[00:04:00]
updates recommended by the board as there was no public comment on the policy it is now ready for a second read by the committee and if approved the budget policy will be included on an upcoming consent agenda for final approval with that she Financial Officer Burnett appalaccia is available to respond to your questions okay so we will move right in this is a discussion action item so is there any further discussion on the aps budget policy as presented I think I think it reflects our last discussion I think it reflects that accurately I don't see anything you need so I will move for proof of the proposed budget policy and I'll second it okay well we'll still open it up for discussion any further discussion any board member Gonzalez any further discussion

[00:05:00]
so with that the only thing that I wanted to point out is that there were some suggestions for additions that came in through the Q&A don't know if you guys had a chance to see those but there was a suggestion under the consider approval of the board budget policy to separate the two sentences out so for us it would be on page two so the the suggestion came in so under the third paragraph where it says it would it would the

[00:06:00]
adjust the board will approve all proposed District purchases would be one and then the board may only vote on Sunday would be a separate one right vendor selection right sorry I was getting there at the board will approve all propose District purchases and expenditures that exceed or are expected to exceed 500,000 the suggestion is the board may only vote on funding for proposed purchases or expenditures that grow go through the procurement process as stipulated by the New Mexico procurement code and federal regulations then a new sentence would be added to say board members may not engage in Vendor selection North should board members appear to influence vendor selection in any way so that's just a suggestion that came in I don't know if we can discuss we can we have a motion on the floor for

[00:07:00]
the original statement but we can have that discussion I might be inclined board member to stick with the original original motion and second and the language is originally written primarily because this policy is not about the board and the policies that govern the board are in the governance manual it's separate this is about our finance policy and we'd come to agreement around that 500,000 amount for approval so I think it would be helpful to keep make sure that remains in there all right all right guys well then it sounds like we are ready to call for a vote on Peterson Daniels

[00:08:00]
yes all right next on our agenda is to consider approval of the appendix on laws and regulations for APS Board of Education governance manual we have Jessica Martinez our policy analyst as our presenter thank you madam chair moving on to item 4.2 on your agendas you'll find approval of the appendix on laws and regulations for the board of education's governance manual because the boards governance policies are required by law it is recommended that the government's manual include an appendix of the laws and regulations associated with the board's governance policies the appendix includes a list of the policies as they appear in the manual a brief description of the legal reference along with links to the statutes and regulations with that the appendix is presented for the boards consideration all right is there any discussion or a motion the appendix as proposed

[00:09:00]
is there any further discussion on the motion board member Gonzalez I'll just look for a hand to go up okay all right okay then may I call for a vote because yes Barbara Peterson yes yes yes Courtney Jackson yes yes our next item on the agenda is to consider archiving non-required board policies in section J students and transferring responsibility to Administration Miss Martinez 4.3 as part of the boards ongoing policy review 14 more policies have been identified by the committee as the responsibility of the superintendent these policies are not required by law or regulation and have been reviewed by the superintendent's cabinet to confer

[00:10:00]
that they have a corresponding procedural directive should the board vote to Archive these policies being considered tonight we will Begin work with the administration to ensure that the language in the related procedural directive fully aligns with the archived policies the policies being considered for archive are jh2 release time for religious instruction G student responsibilities g 2 hazelnut on or off campus crimes acceptable student use of personal electronic devices G 7 students and arrests 9816 activity eligibility jl1 student drug and alcohol use and overdose intervention JL two students Emergency Medical Services and do not resuscitate orders jl5 competitive food sales Junior release

[00:12:00]
do you have a policy review and diet as part of our shift to student outcomes focused governance on board member Peterson and I served on an ad hoc committee that reviewed and rated every single policy under APS and works to identify which of those were part of our legal obligations in which should be assigned to the administration the adopt policy committee was also asked to Archive board policies that were clearly administrative in nature so far the committee recommended archiving 24 policies the board approved the first batch of those on November 1st and we just approved the second batch so yeah we're done the policy committee recommended that that second match be archived tonight so appreciate the committee voting in favor of that they'll be on the consent agenda for final approval at the December 6th board meeting and in addition to the policy review and diet the board also as part of sfg

[00:13:00]
reviewed our governance policies which were our B policies these policies that govern the board and this was led by board members Jackson and Dominguez they served on that ad hoc committee that did that work and that resulted in our first Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education governance manual which was just approved by the full board last week so yeah the governance manual appendix of laws and regulations was just to tonight by the committee and will also be on the consented agenda for December 6th so we're making progress we're going to get some points on the sofa evaluation the bee policies will now appear in the governor's manual that are in the government will also be archived as you heard from a Martinez staff is in the process of moving ahead with this work so they're going to post the new governance manual to the aps website and they'll also make hard copies available to all board members including the newly elected board members the

[00:14:00]
committee members along with our board services staff also consulted with our sosg coach for her assessment on our work how we did in these ad hoc committees and so with all this work that I just described and all of these votes that we've taken and our coaches agreement both out of hot committees have completed their charge and so we would recommend ending them sort of to follow with the whole vision of having an ad hoc committee so hopefully we can do that and then re-establish ad hoc committees as needed as we move forward and before I close I'll just mention we do have a third at hot committee which is the finance at hoc committee and so we're still working on some of that work but the passage of the budget policy for tonight is related to that obviously that will be on the December 6th consent agenda and that's going to help that out finance committee move forward with his work as well so I know I'm excited I can see all the excitement in your eyes too we call it a lot and we know there's also

[00:15:00]
more work for the committee to do and will continue with that next year so we are also going to cancel the December 4th policy committee meeting so as of now our next policy committee meeting is scheduled for January 8th 2024 and that is the chair report thank you chair Gonzalez hope you're having a nice trip and so I will go ahead and announce the the next policy committee meeting is on January 8th 2024 at 5:00 p.m. the meeting will be held at the Allison Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast it will also be live streamed at aps.com edu and with that the meeting is adjourned thank you
