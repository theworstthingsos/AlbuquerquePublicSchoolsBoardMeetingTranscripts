who want you to know that you are welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum and a pond signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outlined those rules for expected Behavior presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting

[00:22:00]
tonight there are four speakers and therefore to accommodate the greatest number of speakers each speaker has two minutes for comments within the 45-minute public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you're always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you're unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak within the 45-minute public forum the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn only at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so the first speaker is Alan our McKinney up at the podium

[00:23:00]
I'm going to refer to my notes on my phone if you don't mind and hope you all have a wonderful day today first of all ladies and gentlemen allow me to say thank you for allowing me to speak to you this evening my name is Alan McKinney I'm an educational

[00:24:00]
in our class so we have to protect these children and they have attacked and will attack all vulnerable children as well as the staff for that matter and this has been very demoralizing for all EA's teachers for us not to be able to carry through with the teaching plans the teacher sets out for the day because of the violent disruptive nature of these two students and they're not receiving coming

[00:25:00]
one of these students throwing feces at an EA and a teacher and plus he consistently threatens to do this again I mean every day now the consistent swearing and threats in the physical assaults is something that's not unusual for IGS to students however when these are other students are right now

[00:26:00]
turn this down to 2 minutes and 44 seconds my daughter is a second grader at Bandelier Elementary School I am a former APS High School teacher and a current PTA volunteer tonight my concerns are twofold first our school and others have been experiencing a decline in enrollment the past few years which is affecting school's ability to offer services as well as appropriate class sizes and stability for our children a week ago Bandelier lost a second grade teacher

[00:27:00]
each time something like this happens it causes turmoil in our communities and produces an overall negative perception of public education parents lose faith in the system and believe pulling their children and placing them in charter schools will solve their problem though there must be though there are other reasons for this drop my focus is the continued support of charter schools by APS many parents have a misconception that Charter Schools about Charter Schools charter schools have ways to selectively build an achievement driven student body many do not provide services that meet the needs of lower socioeconomic or special needs students they have the ability to weed out students that do not meet their expectations or have tuition base programs as an end to enrollment additionally it destroys community cohesiveness and creates a myopic view of Education that benefits the individual at the expense of the community

[00:28:00]
does I have to do what is best for my child without regard to the impact it will have on all children furthermore it stretches already heavily stretched dollars as we divvy up money to more and more schools school choice is an illusion that fundamentally undermines our neighborhood schools and Roads the community second there is a lack of parent voice in policy and procedure and an overly bureaucratic system that further inhibits parent input every year more and more policies are implemented that restrict parents access to their child's school this compounds the issue stated previously further contributing to a growing negative perception of our neighborhood schools okay thank you thank you next speaker is Karen Keifer

[00:29:00]
I'll be finishing sharmila's comments for you this evening she left off with this compounds the issue stated previously further contributing to a growing negative perception of our neighborhood schools this district will educate my child in other children over the course of 14 Imperial years I have yet to have a say be on my vote and how this system educates my child last year I volunteered in a peed initiative the family cabinet a forum for parents to participate in educational policies and procedures regardless of the cabinets inadequacies it brought parents voices in at the state level and enabled me to talk directly to ped department heads and the Secretary of Education at a very personal level on many opportunities occasions when do I get to sit with APS department heads or speak with our superintendent the aps

[00:30:00]
website has a few pages about family engagement what family engagement is this I have never received an email or note about a family engagement meeting and most instructional councils at our schools do very little to encourage or engage the community there needs to be consistent ongoing interactive decision-making Community forums that engage and connect parents directly to APS on our schools APS and ped are making educational policies and procedures without input from a very core and invested group parents thank you for your time thank you and our final speaker tonight is Janet Sears good evening to thank board members

[00:31:00]
Garcia Mueller Aragon and President Pierce for coming to our 60th anniversary of hodgin elementary school it was a good morning a lot of interaction former students former teachers former principals so I thank you all for being part of that on and also Mr Hughes Troy Hughes for coming we are keeping up for the this year a website put together by an APS graduate and Del Norte graduate Dan Jones celebrates 60 where people with a connection to Hodgkins in a memory on the website and and will post it and so hopefully that will result with some very interesting comments the day before

[00:32:00]
we had an event there was this fabulous thing that I didn't know about till just a couple days prior and that was the every child at Hodgen got a new pair of shoes on Friday and then our event was Saturday and this was through the Assistance League and kirkey cares the channel 13 and I mean it was just wonderful being with the children and and you know they were so proud of their new shoes and and all the different colors and sparkles and everything so I'm going to make a contribution to that I learned about how that works and lastly Coronado was here tonight and I learned that there was an architect Louisville who designed Hodges of APs buildings in the 1930s through the 60s and that was one of them and I'm hoping to

[00:33:00]
turn more about Mr haselden so thank you thank you thank you for your input tonight that concludes the public forum thank you Google thank you period has 427 open vacancy postings and 14,728 employees in that context APS have 2.09% vacancy rate and it is oh so painful so far this year we have hired 612 new classroom employees aps.com

[00:34:00]
High School vacancies have to take my breath for this one and 130 special education vacancies just for your information UNM graduated about 30 special education teachers this year APS was able to hire less than 10 of them as most went to other districts and many back to their hometowns by comparison at this time last year we had 42 Elementary School vacancies 8 Middle School vacancies 15 High School vacancies in 122 special education vacancies meaning that we have 10 more open positions than last year at the same time and many many less candidates APS currently employs 6,433 schedule

[00:35:00]
play employees these are employees their teachers Librarians counselors nurses and other classroom employees that work directly with students we also employ $1,863 educational assistance APS currently has 98 open EA positions that is 5.26% vacancy rate for EA's APS and other districts in New Mexico have a supply and demand problems remedy which is one of many suggestions that we have heard of recommends a consideration to increase teacher salaries if we were to do this

[00:36:00]
this would go a long way in helping to address the acute and pervasive teacher shortage problem that we are facing today the remedy proposes and again what's one of many and it's just people Everyone is thinking but that remedy proposes to increase the current three-tier levels salaries from 36,044,054,002 beginning salary of 45,055,422 and 65,000 for tier 3 this proposed remedy will help both ends of the employment pipeline as well as looking at our efforts in helping our efforts is Recruitment and Retention for the 1718 school year 86 have 7899 schedule employees separate from the district

[00:37:00]
so that was for that entire year and this was retirement leaving termination all of that now let me explain this for the current 1819 school year and that's between July and September the 7th so what we're talking 2 months from the district we had APS had 423 a schedule employees separate from 8 p.m. that I think tells you a very gives you a very very very Vivid picture as you can see from these numbers in a time where we do not have teachers in the front end of the pipeline we are really need to focus on our retention efforts the school school climate teacher workload and the PED evaluation

[00:38:00]
mission systems all play apart in what we are seeing today principal Joe Sloan of Del Norte High School just lost what she called an absolutely great teacher and when that teacher was asked why are you leaving she said she said that she loves the school she loves the kids and she really works well with the administration but she cannot take the Peds evaluation system and so she left this is what we're seeing on a daily basis so what are we doing in addition to in-state and out-of-state recruiting we are actively recruiting in Puerto Rico Mexico and the Philippines APS is aggressively advertising with radio spots and Bill

[00:39:00]
as well as recruiting websites such as Ed join you and NM reap and indeed and we will be doing an advertising Blitz during the week of Balloon Fiesta I've woken up several times at midnight and I have come up with a lot of creative ideas and we're moving forward with some of them we also have several Partnerships that are helping us recruit and keep teachers we have a partnership with CNM for a Special Education certification and teacher licensure preparation the Albuquerque teachers residency partnership is a partnership with APS ATF and UNM that provides a pathway to the teaching profession for aspiring teachers with a bachelor's degree now have a new pathway

[00:40:00]
play to the profession through this unique partnership teacher residents in the program receive intensive mentoring and Masters teachers in APS classrooms while completing their New Mexico teaching license and if they choose a master's degree we offer career Pathways for our educational assistance to become teachers and that's something that we need to publicize more and more because we have some great educational assistance that just need that extra emphasis and that's the kind of support to move into the teaching ranks we have a partnership with UNM and CNM and the Highlands University on teacher preparation programs for regular education and special education license collaborating with ATF to offer a comprehensive new teacher mentoring program and appear assistance to help support experience

[00:41:00]
teachers in the profession for having a lot of new people and we need to be able to help the new people but we also have to support the people that have been on board with us for years APS and I can't say this enough APS is a great place to work and I have hopes that are extensive efforts will help others discover that too if you know anybody that is interested in pursuing any of these please be sure and let me know last week at the legislative education study committee Hawthorne Elementary School to conduct its monthly meeting the school staff and students were really gracious hosts presentations were given by APS staff as well as other districts from around the state lunch each day was provided by the culinary program at El Dorado Sandia and Atrisco Heritage High School I'm very thankful for all the hard work that went into hosting

[00:42:00]
this 3-day program and I think everybody left feeling really good about the work that has been done at Hawthorne on Monday several members of the public education department celebrated 17 APS schools and 5 apsley singing and other show off kinds of activities I'm very proud of the work these schools and that the schools have done and all that actually all of APS and what the schools are doing to meet the unique

[00:43:00]
and very needs of their particular students and communities this concludes the superintendent's report thank you thank you we're going to special issues the first one is the presentation of families connected initiative and how video learning stations support family engagement it's a discussion item and Dr Madeline mobile assistant superintendent Equity instructions and shalana Carter manager so I'm very pleased this evening to introduce yourself and how video learning sessions support family engagement good evening for having me here tonight my name is Carter and I'm the manager of

[00:44:00]
play engagement for the district I originally brought this project before the board in March and tonight I would like to give an update on our progress and show one video access to information about how to be engaged in their child's learning and how to navigate the district videos are short information sessions that aim to answer common questions in an easy to understand format are objectives are to provide families with critical information being actively engaged in their students learning and the goals of their school and to provide families with a tool to support family engagement and Leadership opportunities at the school level

[00:45:00]
so access is very important to our families we wanted to create something that was Modern and accessible to families at any time or videos can be accessed online via YouTube and can be viewed at home on a smartphone a tablet or at school events and family centers all of our content is available in Spanish and English with videos in more languages being developed so it takes quite a while to develop everything so we're working on more languages everyone is encouraged to subscribe to the YouTube channel for notifications about new contacts so every time we post a new video it's going to go onto YouTube

[00:46:00]
so anybody was there smartphone out and you go to YouTube you search for a channel you hit subscribe right there that means that you'll get all of our content as soon as it comes out at this time we have a total of 29 videos up on our YouTube channel and we're working on a continued list of topics so we have probably 3 years worth of content to develop and so we're working on getting that out as soon as possible we try to produce at least two new videos per month although sometimes that takes a little longer sometimes we have four so all of our new content is also announced on Twitter and Facebook so those are sample posts that we have showing the videos that go up on to social media are big ask is that you show your support by following us on social media and sharing with your constituents so we're going to watch one video tonight the video that we're going to watch is called finding

[00:47:00]
is there school this video was made to show Families how to use the find your school tool on the aps website it has step by step instructions of how to use the tool and we're trying to encourage people really to go to the aps website to find information that they're looking for this is an example of how to videos that were working to produce and that make practical information available to families so we can go ahead and watch the video now

[00:48:00]
show

[00:49:00]
directions to the school's website where you can get more information how to get directions to the school and how to check your child's School website for more information if you would like your child to attend a school outside of your area you can apply for a transfer

[00:50:00]
we recently made a video about the over 80 School Garden City PS has we have videos about how to find Services here in this building so when families come into this building sometimes they don't know exactly where to go so we made a little video about how to find things period we have videos about attendance we have videos about different things that are happening in our schools were about to release one on our out of school time programs that talks about how families can access out of school time before or after school for their children and so we're working on many topics and in your packet you should have a fact sheet and a page about our social media

[00:51:00]
that'll give you more information about this project and how to find us on social media it would mean so much to my unit and our work if you would show your support for this project by following us on social media and sharing our posts with your own followers so that people will see that you've shared different videos that we produce I stand for questions I love the video I love the idea I love the social media approach and I'm just wondering if you talk to the public forum folks who are interested so I made a note on my notebook to talk to Bandelier about their family engagement so we'll be reaching out to them next week to talk about the other stuff together so it's too bad that they didn't stay to hear the additional comments we actually had a presentation on family engagement and again I look forward to hearing you know I I was Facebooking earlier

[00:52:00]
reference to Kennedy Middle School so it'd be my pleasure to share this information on social media as well so thank you so much thanks and thanks for the work apartment Peterson thank you so much for this information can be used at the school level and do events there so if people don't have a devices or if they don't have internet access we want to bring them to the school or even community centers to make that information available to them and then at the same time make sure that we're providing information about resources that are available to support them in other areas so you're talking about community centers you're talking about the community centers in the local areas in the neighborhood

[00:53:00]
APS we're working on specific tool kits that support School staff like family Liaisons who are able to reach out to those populations and they would be the ones that would contact some of these families and all right thank you thank you what I'm going to say now I actually was going to do in Publix to get information out and I think this is really an excellent one and a crossed my mind that

[00:54:00]
things like just posting the aps website at the libraries where people go to use computers and other Public Access places it might be a good place to to have a page of information of how to access APS and because this is this is definitely friendly format I think the other thing that we keep struggling with and social media might be part of the solution but I think the concern that brought up and she and I have talked about in the last week because if they're concerned and her concern is how does communication go the other way and I think that's the thing that we keep struggling with is I mean we need to keep getting better and better at getting her information

[00:55:00]
what's for the community to have access to us to give us their input and that's that's the hardest thing I know I mean I know board member Patterson keeps really struggling with that or or working to support that in the equity and inclusion committee I know that we've had different formats over the years for an advisory committee and I think and I think that was really the the ask is how do we have the two-way communication

[00:56:00]
at least the feeling that there is an opportunity to sit down and have that conversation and so let's maybe that can be the next presentation how how do we start addressing that part of it yeah I look forward to utilizing some of your suggestions and I think in our other work we do some training around two-way communication for schools and so we want to make sure that we can wrap that up at the same time but thank you thank you for this is coming from so we've been putting out videos every month starting in February so we started with the first six in February and we did some of you were able to attend our events and we thank you so much for that but we've continued to put out videos since then so we're up to 29 now we've been putting out videos almost every month like I said sometimes it's

[00:57:00]
put on sometimes it's 4 a month we have a range of what we're putting out each month okay and then I know you said that you had 1400 views right so that was since February or is that that is since February so we we reached 1400 views at the beginning of September so it's actually a bit higher now okay so what are you doing to try to really increase those views I mean my concern as well as the same as member Patterson is a lot of families that they don't have transportation that aren't comfortable being at schools there are those populations that won't get to the school or they won't get to a library so I mean it would be nice to have like a mobile van I don't know I mean we need to figure out what we can do for for that population and also I don't know I know the school messenger is kind of a hard

[00:58:00]
that's a hard one to do but I don't know if that's a way to try to maybe get that information out there using our Billboards a little bit you know a little bit more I mean I just would like to know what your thoughts are about trying to increase that and help those populations so that is actually one of the reasons that we're trying to do this big push on social media is that we found that that's really the way that a lot of families are communicating and we put a lot of effort into Facebook this summer trying to build that page up and communicate and we saw a huge increase in the number of views that we have on our videos and so we know that that was reaching the public and that they were responsive to it so it's one of the reasons that we're focusing on this big social media campaign but all of those other ideas are lovely things that I would I want to explore figuring out how do we make the information accessible to people in as many different ways as possible because I think there is not one size fits all

[00:59:00]
ocean we have to reach out to our families where they are and get this information to them exactly at that point and then I know that I think you said right now you have 29 videos and where like a dozen of them translated to Spanish so far so we have 12 completed in Spanish will be translated the 29 includes the versions that are in Spanish so it's about 14 different topics right now and then some of those are in English and so we have two videos that we are waiting for the Spanish version to be finalized when we work with our translations Department here through APS to make sure that that is ready to go and then other languages which other how many other languages are you looking at and what's the time frame for those coming on so we've looked at other languages and we're trying to focus on the languages that are most commonly brought up within APS so we have a total of seven different languages that we are

[01:00:00]
time to work on I don't have a timeline for when we would have every single piece of content developed because one of the more challenging aspects of this is getting someone to be in the video that speaks that language and is willing to be in a video so we're working with different families we actually have a welcome video that we recently produced it's not totally finished so it should be up on our YouTube page within the next few weeks but we were able to work with family and we had nine different languages represented in the welcome video so we're trying to say welcome to APS in the language that most of our family speak and looking at the newcomer program because they are trying to really get to those communities I think that's a way to get people that speak that language I mean they can speak the language so they I'm sure I would hope anyway they would want to be part of the video so that's absolutely I mean we made some Headway working on our welcome video for this year so we'll keep in touch with those contacts and start working on it so we had a small blip

[01:01:00]
does Siri just had a new videographer join us so we'll be getting back up to speed right and then we need to know that there are all kinds of other ways to engage parents that this isn't something that everybody really wants to be engaged that way so we need to make sure that we're all looking at different ways cuz like you said one size doesn't fit all so some parents are not comfortable this way but there's other ways to engage them so I think that's something that we need to make sure that we are looking at as well absolutely we continue to support the schools with a variety of strategies to do family engagement in many ways this is one tool that we focused on that we wanted to present to you thank you thank you thank you because I appreciate the information you know sort of keeping up with like how we're evaluating the impact right now who's actually able to see it what are some of our challenges

[01:02:00]
and getting out the information I think the part that struck me is like you know because we had the public forum first and the conversation and it's important to have activities that we do for families you know that we actually do for them but I think what the question now is and I think the stretch for us is what do we do with families you know how do we how do we incorporate their voice with us so that decision making that we're doing or like this project for example how was it done with families so that we can assure that the way that we're delivering it really was taking into account what their voices and it as well in terms of how would it work for them with them I often think of the disability Community because when I you know when I worked in the disability Community is like nothing about us without us a so that would be something that I would be interested in terms of like looping it in to in places where

[01:03:00]
Public Health offices WIC offices doctor's offices where families generally gather and they're looking at you know the slope of information that's going on like what's our partnership with perhaps those kinds of entities so that we could Loop that information into places where families are so that was just my brainstorm on what I thought could be there but thank you I mean I think the information is important and it's important to have information for families my pushes just how do we do something with families at schools last semester we had a 3304 focus groups with families like six videos and then asked for

[01:04:00]
feedback and then also asked for them to help influence the videos that we make in the future so giving them the option to give feedback about the topics that we have what we've already produced and then open to suggestion of anything else that they would like to see so we're working in family feedback into each piece of this process as we're moving forward we're trying to get to the point where we have families that are with us on those strips and so for some of the programs that we work with we've been very lucky to have families come and participate in that process and so now it's about making that ingrained into the process so that every video gets the opportunity to be vetted by our families so and that's great cuz I really appreciate the shared decision-making around that and now you know sort of as we move and we grow because I think it's going to develop as you guys develop but how do we get into a place of shared leadership too right so that they get to own and maybe direct what's going to be our next steps in

[01:05:00]
next strategies moving forward so that we have families that are engaged with us in a really meaningful way where it's not just about we need your input but they're actually leading the project so thank you this is a lovely presentation you've done a great job well done and I just have some questions and mine are observations one I think we have to really think about how we can be strategic and my suggestion would be who would and who could you begin to impact and in some cases it may make strategic sense to prioritize such as the presentation that we heard the other day and I can't remember the young man's name about Outreach to the Swahili speaking community that you have someone who speaks language five languages with that program now

[01:06:00]
there may be an opportunity to just quickly put something together as an introduction to APS and I really appreciate I wanted to say something about this the idea that you know we as bored as staff get into a place where we can say so what do you what do you like about what you see happening at the school and what could we do better you know just always having that as part of the leverage conversation to be able to find our antenna I thought the Native American Summit yesterday was quite inspiring and that there may be opportunities for some of the staff to actually translate some of your videos that way you know my my concern is just that you know how can we begin to just make this

[01:07:00]
small groups that you described what we're looking for feedback trying to come up with ways to do better part of our day-to-day just operation and and one thought just sort of been thinking reflecting on the superintendent's comments about the the need for staff I mean I know there's people out there that are really looking for a good place to work and certainly APS can be that good place could we do some kind of video about would you like to work at APS or we'd like you to work at APS that's put out in different languages that allows for people to come in because they may not think that they have skills but what we have to communicate is that their skills in just being able to relate to parents or being able to relate to the first population that we can't relate to I think would be important

[01:08:00]
to just at least kind of stoke up the recruiting opportunity because a lot of times we wait and think that people will come to us but you have to you have to figure out which other you're going to milk you know to get something and we have a number of sister organizations you know whether it's within the various immigrant communities that I think there are people that would definitely want to know a little bit how to how to be part of the UPS family and I always say this I haven't done it in a while but visiting some of the communities where they're I think of the the black community where there are so many churches and sort of reaching to those ministers and people who helped those institutions function but where they get a sense that we're concerned about them

[01:09:00]
are the Asian Community for example the Japanese or Chinese communities I think we could we could always sort of be very intentional that way and I'm hoping that you can help us do that and they can in turn help you have an even better sort of array of things we want to talk about those are all really useful for trying to help with recruitment thank you thank you thank you very much how do I know this exists that is that is exactly what we're working on right now is getting this

[01:10:00]
to as many people as possible so that they know that it exists one of the strategies that's been suggested and we hope to really put into place making sure that this information goes home at the school level and that it appears on school websites so I can go to the aps website right now and I don't see it as an example on the family engagement on the homepage to go I mean I can always tell you yes I can go this way and that way and you know by that time I've lost most of the people so the point is if you really want somebody to know something you put a big butt in there you put it something that's how it's something that enables you to see what in the world is going on with that button and you go there otherwise you can lose people so we're hoping to get our

[01:11:00]
listen to APS video on the main webpage on the the main page when people get there at first and then that would hopefully key them in and then they would go right to it so yes I agree with you I want us right there on the front page if I'm looking for how do I get connected with somebody I want answers to I would not go to a welcome APS video so there's got to be something there that tells me this is what's going to help me understand what things are now you're a small part of this so you know that's one of the problems that's what all the board members are really been saying is that this is great but it's kind of a small part of it really bigger picture but if you really want to get family connected you got to have something right there same thing I mean I wouldn't know I tried to stop Facebook I don't do Twitter I try not to get involved in that because I would probably who knows what I would get in trouble with but

[01:12:00]
I think sometimes we think

[01:13:00]
that's not the case and I and I'm impressed with the fact that in most of these initiatives we do you have in fact involved Community you in fact gone out and you have asked questions that maybe not every single person out there but you have involved community in terms of some of the decisions and what you're trying to do so I think that is ingrained in what we're doing in these these initiatives I don't say that we're certainly perfect in doing that means you're a person would you want to know how we do family engagement well there are lots of things that are going on family engagement family meetings

[01:14:00]
Indian tribal leaders I was very impressed with that the stuff we did with the l e s c and we had kids were bust up from Washington Middle School and thank you Scott thank you Scott you made that happen I think that was a big deal for the laces to see a bunch of students there you know in other words we're trying to say yeah this is important and so I appreciate that so I think we're doing some things I'm not perfect but appreciate what you've done and so thank you very much that you let us know and we can meet up content that helps us share our voice and being responsive to family not everybody knows how to get on YouTube not everybody knows

[01:15:00]
exactly what to do so this little step by step thing that says go here do this put these things exactly in for example if I look at your APS colon families connected there's a little space in there is a space happen do I need a space in there or do I not do this space there I'm very detailed in fact the spaces count and so I would put a space in there and if I didn't get what I wanted I would wonder why I'm doing well I would actually try other things but you know not everybody would so it's very important to be very precise about how to get where you want to be and so that's another part of that whole thing you know that I think is important to communicate thank you very much

[01:16:00]
thank you so much to go on to Adam B which is the briefing on the 2018 Toyota school choice and many other things that you do Mr President members of the committee I didn't want to hear of the board superintendent radio in our office supporting the charter schools she did start in June her name is Amy Chase and so she is overseeing the renewable applications and this is part of our cyclical process by October 1st state statute

[01:17:00]
show submit a renewal application either to the public education commission or the local school district we have received four applications one from the Albuquerque Charter Academy which we currently authorized and three from schools that are currently authorized by the public education commission Coral Community School Gilbert alcena Charter High School and the new America School in your package you will see the timeline for our work we will come back to you on December 12th at the aps Board of Education policy instructions committee to give you our recommendations through that you will see that we will have a seven-member team that's made up of three departments staff to APS administrators and to Charter School administrators who will review each application we will perform a site visit we will also perform a public hearing that we will take notes from and provide that information

[01:18:00]
listen to you so you've seen this process this will be the third time that you've seen the process in the way that our team has has worked it and we've also included State Statute and procedural directive and how we will follow that process so we stand for any questions for the Leadership Academy school contracts were not correct including we found that Sandra leadership High School had never had a contract executed and has been opened for the past two years so we have taken care of that problem with the past

[01:19:00]
work that had happened or didn't happen and this is bringing them up to speed getting their contract executed and also including their two performance framework goals which you have seen similar goal statements before for example with technology leadership High School using the same the same goals and so we do have the leaders from the school here in case you have any questions is the interim principal of the school at this time and less the Kelly is their governing board president and governing council president and you'll remember she used to be the director of the district to reconnect with her so I stand for questions any questions from the boardroom so when

[01:20:00]
he started working with the leadership academy it's one of the goals was to really try to forge in you concept of how of how we work together and how we utilize each other's strengths and I'm curious where that stands Mr President and Miss Peterson we did it with leadership High School I believe that was this week and we did have that conversation about partnership school and how we can continue to learn from them and some Mrs Elder and I have met with them twice and we'll bring you back a report of what are the areas that we see that are possibilities and how that's progressing and we're also really trying to learn from them how their strategic Partnerships in that case providing them FAQ

[01:21:00]
please and ongoing work to College and Career Readiness sure just overall communication and work with us it's interesting that during that process nobody brought up that we didn't have a contractual language I can't tell you just a brief update on that I will be sending you a letter or copying you on a letter we did receive an update on the corrective action plan I didn't want to

[01:22:00]
reduce to you their director of operations Miss Jackie Baldwin who really stepped up as they transitioned from their previous executive director and now they are on a search for a permanent executive director as Tony stepped in and Miss Baldwin provided us a update I believe that was last Thursday or days or weeks run together but last Thursday we received an update on that they have made tremendous progress in each of those areas and so we'll be documenting that however we will not remove them from a correct the corrective action plan until we see a full year cycle of the work they have a new executive director in place and we make sure that everything is in compliance but I can tell you that right now during our fall

[01:23:00]
I'm once in the fall now we got an update on that and then my intention is we will perform a full site visit in the spring and then we will have a corrective action plan site visit as well so twice in the spring so we'll give you updates each time thank you yes this one's a little different because of just the contents of it so you'll notice that our other corrective action plans we are doing monthly monitoring because of the contents of this and I will lay that out in the letter it doesn't require monthly monitoring I just want to point out that difference I'm sorry I'm trying to wrap my head around the board approved in 2015 and the approval of a new Charter School application that was the approval but

[01:24:00]
the charter school office at the time never did the administrative work that they needed to do which was to have you approve a contract that you've seen that process time and time again so you'll approve and renewal or a new application then you allow me to negotiate the contract we negotiate the contract and bring that back to you along with the performance framework that second part did not happen for whatever reason by the past director so we're just I'm trying to I'm trying to look at the dates we're going to 2021 from like from July 2015 to 2021 for planning and then five years for actually opening the school and running and so we can only approve renewals for 5 years but in the

[01:25:00]
in the initial application you can approve it for 6:00 and that's what happened to me too thank you thank you and we weren't really the well anyway Tony you're in room when are you going to get out of the room I mean what's your time frame I know you got a lot going on so you know I mean prayer the goal is for us to have the next or the permanent executive director in place by the end of November

[01:26:00]
how many special ed students with the IEPs because there was a lot of information about IEPs and and control that you know we had some issues with some other charters in terms of not doing all that so I just kind of wonder if you've got some numbers or if you don't have it right handy in your mind just maybe give it to the board members so we have some of that information and the letter I think that's a good idea just to kind of feel because I know I know that that these categories

[01:27:00]
I think it's really good because you're trying to work towards you know what are they doing how do you really provide the educational background that they need to have and and how do you get them into the workforce and internships and writing things really good and I want to emphasize a little bit also on what Barbara said because I'm really interested in how we can use the things that Tony is doing with some of these schools has kind of a leverage in a kind of a leverage for us in terms of the CTE stuff that we're working on you know and and how do we do with those internships and how do we actually look at some of the kinds of things and and get some of our kids you know all of our kids kind of into some of the experiential learning areas because I think that's really good for them so you know learning from each other some of those things I think is a really good thing we had a discussion at for example

[01:28:00]
how do we give them the students as they leave a document from the school that shows all the certifications that they have and what they mean because just putting it on a resume by a student sometimes doesn't make those connections so we're sharing a lot of that information but I know you want it to be more formalized and we're working on that yes and I think a lot of things that you know about member is doing with the Workforce Solutions things were doing that kind of partner with CNN and Selena Gomez in terms of a lot of things that she brought over from the workplace Solutions together is really important and so I think the more we can do all these collaborations the more we can learn from each other more we can really support each other terms of how we do that it's going to be a really really good relationship so those are the right things so thanks I know you've been invited to our stakeholder meetings but we're working on our Channel

[01:29:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:30:00]
all of the support they gave to the lasc meeting that was a massive thing all of our tech people were over there and it was it was fun for legislators to actually see the human beings that come to school every day and I think they were really impressed Kim thing knocked their socks off in her presentation on the MRI schools Rachel's and Mary Chapel did a really nice job on libraries and why we need library library need to be library library

[01:31:00]
play I need to go back and listen again so that I can write down numbers or if you have it in written form I'd welcome it just so that I can get that and thank you and Dr Blakey for for being patient with me as I whine in bed and cry and I understand all I can say is when we become board members they need to furnish us with the magic wand because this has been incredibly hard week it has been a hard week where there has been no good solution at least know good immediate solution and I am sorry I really appreciate the long-term planning the exciting thing is that I think that we can play a really instrumental role in pulling together all these different entities that have visions of

[01:32:00]
what do we need to do for for students to have teachers and so between the no time to lose that the iliac is working on the the Yazzie and Martinez decisions and and the vision of the community for for Recruitment and training the work that the teachers Federation is doing looking at we need to not just Inspire high school students to get in the door but we need to do this long-term planning of how do we continue to enrich the lives that the intellectual and professional lives of teachers throughout their career and it's really exciting and I think that maybe we can provide a platform for pulling together some of these conversations because there's no good way to say that it's okay to have 24 students

[01:33:00]
second grade classroom there's just no good way to say that and and the frustration of families and in the problem the problem that we face is that a lot of our neighborhoods just like bandolier are sort of transition neighborhoods and it's what's made them really rich Dynamic wonderful educational weekly basis recruitment letters for most people that they're getting back the students that are not his needs are not easily said in their back in our classrooms and we welcome them but I think the other

[01:34:00]
sing that came to mind with the gentleman who's the EA we have got to figure out how to more rapidly meet the needs of students that are struggling because it impacts not just them and the adults but all of the children in the classroom so so just really figuring out how do we make special ed work and in a more immediate fashion there are lots of reasons I understand it's complex but we've got to figure that out one thought that I had when we lose teachers lots of times I think in the board member Garcia said a lot of community members don't think of themselves as they don't think of themselves as going to work in our schools and so they would never go

[01:35:00]
go to the aps website and look at the job openings but if the posting was made at Bandelier for Bandelier or at La Mesa for La Mesa then it starts being more immediate then it's then there's already a relationship there and I know that over the years the best that I ever worked with are the easiest that were straight out of the communication sometimes they were the people who came in popped popcorn for fundraisers in the door they would never have come up here to apply just in general but when someone from the school in a different world and it really strengthens the ties to the community so I'm not sure what that would involve in terms of

[01:36:00]
what's the HR but if we can make allocations because parents are concerned about classes parents are concerned about class sizes and if we can at least figure out how to how to give some support to students I think it would be really helpful but thank you overall for the report and the vision and the work that's going on cuz it's there is no magic wand and it's sometimes it's really miserable thank you Google I think I'll be brief I just want to thank the superintendent for your report the same thing that was very helpful period I just I just don't know what to do

[01:37:00]
I feel like we can't win in a one-sided conversation and I don't know how we get in the conversation in the first place and I'm trying to figure out how to be diplomatic but at the same time I think sometimes you just have to stand up to a bully and I think there is a lot of bullying that's been going on and I'm not sure I'm not sure what it means the best thing is to let it go and hope that this kind of thinking will will go away I don't think it's going to go away I think that seemed to get some satisfaction over attacking APS or always going to be out there and others will fall into that trap I don't think we're afraid of criticism I think what we would like is a dialogue about okay how do we move forward and

[01:38:00]
we have good teachers we have good EA's we have good Amino folks that was the one question I wanted to just kind of check out with you superintendent I didn't get a sense of what's happening within an amino I know we have an aging Workforce and I'm a little nervous about that because you have a lot of experience that will be eventually having to leave for various reasons it would be helpful to just get a sense of what your idea is and you know how many plumbers electricians Etc

[01:39:00]
and so I'm the primary caregiver Chief cook and bottle washer is my dad used to and and It's Tricky and there are times when I will sign up for a meeting and then I can't go because something's happening so my apologies in advance and and I hope you will give me your understanding at least if I'm not able to come on on some occasions but thank you so much thank you baby just in terms of the report on our vacancies obviously that's not lost on someone like me he's working at work for Solutions where we you know we recognize that APS is the number one in player in the city which I think you know people don't understand what that is the number one employer with 14,000 employees and so we recognize that I know that you know as a sector strategy you know when

[01:40:00]
you're looking at just education as a whole and the work that needs to be done in order to really make sure that that pathway can be developed and we can fill it so that we know that the pipeline is actually coming down the down the pike is important and so I think it's important for us to figure out how that conversation is really also happening with Workforce Solutions so that we're that we're part of the communication or part of the strategies that are going to go on there are several folks that come through the Workforce Connection Center office on a daily basis and how is that also being communicated through our office so that we can make sure those individuals who are in the pipeline for employment are also aware that that's you know that that's a process for them to do and and I know that there's been some effort made on that and maybe we just need to come back Circle again and see how do we

[01:41:00]
maintenance so that we can make sure that we're addressing it so I was struck by just the number of folks that have separated which is something that we're looking at also at just you know state government level two because there's number of people that are just retiring or separating from government as well and and so it's you know it's it's playing Havoc for all of us but as an economic indicator for our state to and for our city that's really key and it's important because it certainly has its an economic driver as well in terms of the health of the overall community so I would commit myself to maybe being in a conversation with you and all so with our local Workforce Development board so that we can just see how that conversation can be strengthened their the other thing I want to say is just in terms of all the conversation with just our celebrations it struck me that you know what what was really important there was just just how much Community involvement we have out of school

[01:42:00]
level just to make it all happen right whether it's backpacks to clothing drives to you know to just just that commitment that I think that we have in our community to be a partner with APS and that that to me just just warms my heart and it warmed me even more when I went to Coronado Elementary and you know got to see our students in terms of this bilingual by literacy peace and the power of the Dual language and what it can do for not just for students but also for our community I left feeling extremely prideful of the fact that it was in Bareilles where you know my grandparents lived and I saw that or no you know in their Garden I had just these flood of memories of my grandmother and I showed my little video to like my entire family and everybody at work and you know what

[01:43:00]
everybody found so special about that was just the enthusiasm from the students and how how much pride they had in their ability to be able to sing these songs and so I left you know it's almost I was very proud of that so just you know good job on that I really I'm really proud of us as a just as an agency because it people want to give and people want to be part of something but I also want to remind us that won't it be nice when there's you know when there's no longer in equity right so that students can come to school or parents can send their kids to school and not have to be worried about supplies or clothing or these kinds of things but you know that we really just have there's no longer in equity and people can just come to school and be comfortable and and where it's all ready to go so thank you for to everybody for that just their Community involvement

[01:44:00]
thank you but remember Patterson well superintendent radio thank you for the report but I want to tell you that over the summer I didn't know this but I mean the call was put out there to the Westside Coalition the president actually had mentioned to him to the community in the neighborhood our neighborhood said you know APS need is in need of teachers and staff and so low and behold this summer I had actually resumes on my doorstep and I was actually able to get some of those some of those pictures and I was able to get most of them there and stuff so just to let you know that our community is behind us here our neighborhoods really are also helping us and

[01:45:00]
that's a big thing and then I wanted to share you know I attended the national the the conference in Las Vegas Nevada and it's the Council of urban Boards of Educators it's part of the National Organization of School Board Association and one of the things that you know I will share I will have a report next at our next board meeting and what one district is doing in particular and I know that you know they were over 1000 participants administrators and I want to tell you and listening and attending some of the some of these workshops and that APS says many of these districts from Rochester to Baltimore Rockville Maryland where you have

[01:46:00]
what is affluent neighborhoods with board members to Oklahoma I was very proud to be there representing IPS that we are heading shoulders above many of these boards these districts in across the country and Janet I just want to thank you for always making us feel good about I think we just need to give you a great big hand for what you doing community

[01:47:00]

[01:49:00]
APS employees and their families can get their flu shot during the health and wellness Fair on Friday October 12th so again I'd like to encourage folks to get out and get your flu shots and I'll be there as well so thank you again for everything tonight thanks great thank you very much so Lorenzo had a birthday on September 26th September 25th September 19th their last board meeting here's here's all the things okay September 20th September 22nd September 25th 2017 October 2nd October 3rd

[01:50:00]
on October 5th and October 10th those are all things that some of us are maybe all of us have participated in it has been one heck of a busy couple of weeks guys so comments on all those those are the dates of all those dates one thing I think is really really really really really critical to us is the Lac meeting the LSU meeting was wonderful I think we made a very very positive impression on the Alicia members I think the staff for being very well prepared our principal very well prepared both the one both the I couldn't be there for all of it because I was out of town but I understood that presentation

[01:51:00]
my Pedro by the bridge last name was I don't get it remember you said yes it was very good in the sense of directions and things that maybe we can use for talking points for how we address what we're doing and the collaboration and those kinds of things particularly with a garage MRI schools and one other thing that I know has been going on that I I know it was a follow up on our special education survey and then the other part of it was come to us and look at this place education department this is great this is very proactive in terms of what are Administration is doing to try to say how to do better what are the kind of things we can do and I'm looking forward to hearing the near future having a

[01:52:00]
and and kind of from the superintendent's report on the retention of teachers you know that the real issue is is that teaching is a profession guys teaching is a profession it is not something just anybody can walk into and do and so it takes time this is panic approach I mean it's nice that we're going and trying to get EA's I'm trying to get people involved and so forth but that's not going to solve our problem guys we have to have a lot bigger inflow of teachers coming out of our universities and and so the question is what's the root cause of why they're not there why why are we have 6% in our education instead of 2025 % that was in the 90s why is that okay cuz otherwise we're not going to get that photo you are New Mexico this is a problem Across the Nation

[01:53:00]
we're not going to get to kind of quality in the teaching and the profession that we need to have and it is a profession guys you know I mean I like to think I can teach but you know I don't know that I would do really well in a fourth grade class you know there's classroom management there's there's the things that my person here from San Diego was talking about in terms of special education you know there are all kinds of things that were asking our teachers to do from a counselor to a police officer to educator to whatever and and these are really tough things you don't just walk in and and and and assume that you can do that I don't care what you've got a professional degree or not and so that's why we go to school that's why we have an education process that's why we look at the kind of things that we are doing with you and him and turns out having a kind of an apprenticeship kind of a process here like you know I'm trying to get early people actually into what

[01:54:00]
call the profession now there was actually doing experience of learning on the job you may find out you don't really like it and you better get out of there or you might find you really do like it and you've learned something so these are things that are really really important and if if we don't start solving that problem from a national point of view and from our own State point of view we're going to be in the same problem all the time you know I mean it's great that we're working on it was great that we're getting people involved and certainly the more we can build capacity in that way but the way you really get capacity is it go through the real profession and how they get educated and whether that's being done right or not maybe we need to improve that a lot yes you know because there's all kinds of things now being asked of educators

[01:55:00]
my wife part of the birthday celebration and we suck up with musicals there one was dear Evan Hansen and one was Hamilton just fantastic but here's a message you probably don't know necessarily what dear Evan Hansen's about but they're having Hansen is about who is feeling very well in the meantime a student who is a and nobody likes killing

[01:56:00]
wake me up in the school and so Evan Hansen decides that he's going to write these letters kind of in a response to that that suicide and what happens is that people start interpreting the fact that it was the guy who wrote the these letters when he didn't have any friends at all and so I started evolving and started evolving actually want to go see the music is you're not alone

[01:57:00]
but you're not alone you know and it's not just for the kids that are lonely or aren't connected it's for all of our kids you don't have to get to El Dorado the baseball player who was well-liked who who was a good academically it's very important Airport

[01:58:00]
tell your kids you're not alone you're not alone not alone okay so that's my comments thank you very much so we have an upcoming board meetings of course the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday October 17th 5:00 here and the next special Board of Education meeting will be Monday October 22nd and then Martin Road thank you very much
