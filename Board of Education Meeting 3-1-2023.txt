[00:06:00]
Yazi Gonzalez Tracy you'll have two minutes once again thank you good evening violence and everything that's been happening this whole school year I guess my question would be you know like leadership or leadership there's no transparency the inclusion people sitting at the table are students teachers Educators staff on

[00:07:00]
putting our input or getting her getting you know people to listen on behalf of not just our students but also our teachers and our Educators with these concerns with weapons and gun violence and violence in itself and are still in our school campuses so I think the concern is where is the inclusion at we haven't seen it I haven't seen it and I haven't heard anything no follow-ups so there's no accountability so I don't know I just wanted to bring that up to you we need a lot more transparency and accountability so we see something is in the works with her APS so I think that's about it thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Dan Gillespie

[00:08:00]
sure you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking into the mic thank you for your work and willingness to show up as much as you all do I am a parent to one high school graduate in two current students I wanted to be a scientist and as a parent my goal is for every student to be scientifically literate to better understanding I started writing a draft paper draft copy is about 90% but I ran out of time to be able to present here today I brought copies for you all so let's talk about

[00:09:00]
Elementary science education standards what arrangement the arrangement variations are implemented by school districts in educational institutions that are typically divided into two primary themes topics or DCI Arrangement New Mexico has adopted the topics Arrangement on page 1 of 102 of the topics Arrangement PDF says and quote due to the fact that the ngss progress towards end of high school core ideas the standards may be rearranged in any order within a grade level so my question is why does a specific grade level matter if the educational standards permit any sequence of topics within that grade level this could potentially restrict a student

[00:10:00]
ability to explore their interests such as wanting to become a scientist if everyone is aiming to achieve the same learning goals does it matter which specific topics are taught in a particular grade level thank you all for your time thank you sir I appreciate you are next public forum speaker is Marcy May God you have two minutes thank you so much for your time I am my name is

[00:11:00]
turn on APS teacher homeschooling teacher I have taught across our city and many different Arenas I am very concerned because of and the thing that I want to bring to your attention is the video that was brought out by project Veritas exposing APS and Miss Louise and saying that giving the CDC guidelines which have been just put upon the parents of Albuquerque and the students I'm going to play just a few seconds of this and hopefully we can get this all done sorry I'm really nervous because this is a very hot topic and when we are saying the Pledge of Allegiance were talking about liberty and justice for all period there's only a liberty for just a few and it's not people

[00:12:00]
The Narrative that other people that do not agree with transgenderism doesn't mean that we hate them can we please get over that

[00:13:00]
it means we disagree Miss may you have gone over here 2 minutes I need you to quickly wrap up in one sentence protect the children they need to be protected and having a teacher tell another teacher that they cannot say anything even if they think it might help that's open for child abuse period

[00:14:00]
hello my name is Ruth Ann Peterson I'm a grandparent I want to lead with a statement or a statement about gender confirming Care by the Association of American Physicians and surgeons item 6 on their statement is there has been an explosive increase in person to identify with the contract of gender different from sex at an age when identity is easily malleable and brain develop is not fully concluded wow what could have led to an explosion of gender confused kids get a clue Sherlock gets secret LGBT curricula and people like APS and doctorate Ruiz the first thing I thought when I saw the project Veritas undercover video of her secret LGBT curriculum and training of Educators you have a teacher question mark

[00:15:00]
I wondered to myself gee is Angela Ruiz also signed on to the Marxist critical race Theory Zen pledge like many other APS teachers you know the one where School teachers promised to teach critical race Theory no matter what school boards or parents say the second thought I had was after after viewing the the video was how dare you go behind the backs of parents by the way bored what exactly are Angela Ruiz is Bonafide as a resource teacher and student health and life skills example is she a credential psychiatrist is she practicing medicine without a license of children and pushing gender apses web page does not say really what the heck does APS think they are eights is not a big blow up bureaucracy with the proud distinction of being the largest school district in the state with education rank 51 bottom of the barrel deadliest instead of making sure children are reading and math proficient with some good critical thinking skills throwing in 86 is going to the backs of

[00:16:00]
America haters and is teaching the radical LGBT agenda crap sure to Warped some young malleable Minds it is disgraceful and you should be ashamed to sit on the board when you allow this to continue thank you ma'am and I'll take care of those our next speaker is Robert Sanchez Mr Sanchez and Elder board members I'm Robert Washington Middle School I'm here to speak against the implementation of a dual language program at middle school for one year and returned because the principal could not find anyone to teach the US History 8th grade in New Mexico history 7th grade

[00:17:00]
Spanish fortunately the principal did find someone so I was able to get back to retirement I'm a very strong advocate of bilingual dual language education I believe that there are three strong dual language programs at the middle school these are at Washington Truman and Hayes middle schools I would like to see the Dual language programs expanded however it is extremely difficult to find dual language certified teachers in math science and social studies I spoke to many principles and they tell me to still really difficult and almost impossible to find teachers who are dual language certified in Spanish for US History Museum

[00:18:00]
and the other one is when I told me to

[00:19:00]
so you know my name is Susie so I have two children who are currently attending APS school and I shared a video with all your man and all your board members and the superintendent and I actually heard a previous two two other speakers already spoken about that video released by project Veritas and I mean after I said that I'm just outrageous I'm really concerned about I was really going on at 8 p.m. behind the scenes you know people are doing that like closing door or the training teachers Walter say what to do regarding affirming general for me process so actually you know I didn't get time to prepare much my stuff I actually just want to play this video part of it to see what you know it's not what I'm making up is is one of this lady is worse this lady is what was her name it's a

[00:20:00]
her name is Angela Ruiz right so representing for student health and life skills those are pushing gender forming those are not life skills in my opinion and I came from I want to play this part of where to enter lgbtq Plus

[00:21:00]
this is how you going over here 2 minutes can you please wrap up very quickly if you don't have any more please thank you thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Ruth Porta Ruth you have two minutes once you begin

[00:22:00]
convert 10 193 or 4 elementary schools into early childhood education I've been bringing different topics and my topics right now is that we haven't had any collaboration from from APS even though a superintendent Elder says that they are collaborating I am a member of the New Mexico Association for the Education Association and what we have seen is that we have asked to Elementary to share their waiting list and all of them and they reject and they said that they can share it we are depriving for our 344 education and that is I think that is not fair for the

[00:23:00]
wake me up for the families and I want to read you an article a part of the article that was an issue in the journal Center January 15th and it is approved that APS is not collaborating and like what part of the long-term plan behind the center is to scale of the district capacity to handle the lovely 14,300 and 4 year olds in Albuquerque Capital master plan executive director casito 2,500 education which is wrong we are about the community providers we are 82% of 2345 and we are providing careful for 4,080 children so what are you going to YouTube minutes

[00:24:00]
yes and I will wrap out that better use your coronavirus money that you have to improve to keep your Middle School enrollment and also to improve the security of the middle school that is so beautiful hi good afternoon thank you for this opportunity to present and members of the board of APs I my name is

[00:25:00]
play Rankin and I've been an early childhood professional for 50 years and I wanted to talk about the qualifications of teachers who work in public school settings and those who work in a private Community Early Childhood programs a lot there is a new degree now a birth of a 3 year old through third grade and some teachers are getting that however a lot of public school teachers have a k through 12 license and that is a big challenge to provide the care and education that 3 and 4 year olds 4 year olds and in pre-k really need to succeed and I have studied as I say early childhood education of worked in public school settings I've worked in private settings I was the executive

[00:26:00]
director of the New Mexico Association for the education of young children for 17 years and I've seen all kinds of educational situations and 4-year-olds Thrive when their teachers understand where they are in their developmental Continuum and how to support children in learning through play and learning through exploration and investigation and that has much more success taking into account children's social emotional needs as well as intellectual and physical needs the whole comprehensive needs of the child for children to investigate together Explorer together and and that is the way for Early Childhood young children to succeed in the school educational

[00:27:00]
so thank you very much I support the private community-based programs as well as public schools and I think that continuing the strength of the community-based programs is extremely important the diversity of the staff there in the community-based programs is an essential it's a strength of the program so thank you again for this opportunity and that's it for now thank you ma'am thank you very much our next two speakers are on Zoom the first one is Casey Peterson Casey are you there okay thank you for this opportunity and

[00:28:00]
I would like to I'm glad that Mary Patriots like Mary and Susie went before me and talked about the project Veritas video because we're getting ready to drop another undercover investigation night my wife and I went undercover this time inside of Albuquerque Public Schools and just read a couple quotes here to give you guys I guess the teaser trailer it's a they say and we've had students here whose parents would absolutely flip out if they were aware what's going on with their kids and they go on to talk about the idea that they don't have to have a 12 or 13 year old or you know their kids are talking about a little bit of depression they don't have to report that to parents and there's much more on that obviously this is concerning for many reasons first of all if you look at a review study published in Jama Pediatrics compiled data from 35 different peer-reviewed studies they found that the minute a child identifies as lgbtq their suicide rate goes up by 350% or 3.5 times

[00:29:00]
and if they identify as transgendered or have gender dysphoria then their rate goes up 600% or 6 times from their normal peers now I ask you does that sound like critical information that parents might need to know about their children does that sound like something we should Loop the parents in on considering their child could end up being dead in the next year this seems like critical information but will be emailing this out to all of you and anyone else wants to find it they can go find Casey and Mike m y k e Peterson with Ian that's Casey and Mike Peterson on YouTube and that video is going to be dropping tonight that full undercover investigation and there's a lot more to come this is just the beginning and we have people throughout the schools in Albuquerque so I guess I'll put all the teachers counselors and everyone else that's trying to groom the children to this ideology on notice right now we will expose you we will find you thank you thank you sir

[00:30:00]
cyborg 1 second our next speaker is Michaela Peterson I believe she's coming in now sorry thank you period

[00:31:00]
parents need to be a big part of this conversation the affirmation gender care model isn't scientifically backed and the treatments aren't FDA approved this is a major concern for us as parents with hb7 and your current APS gender discrimination policies the lgbtq youth are much more vulnerable to being funneled into care that will possibly damage them possibly leave them chemically changed sterilized mutilated or at worst you know suicidal or dead this is these sweet vulnerable lgbtq identifying kiddos are being taken advantage of by the medical and pharmaceutical Industries we do not yet know what the consequences of this child experimentation will be but with the already increasing number of regretful children detransitioning and regarding their chemical and surgical interventions it looks pretty Grim Europe is ahead of us on this research and I urge you to look into their findings I also urge you to seek out the detransition

[00:32:00]
documentaries that are giving these victims of the medical and pharmaceutical Industries voices this is a very serious issue a deeply personal issue that should be taken much more seriously these vulnerable lgbtq youth should have hundreds of hours of mental services and more before we push them down a path that we that we know will be a lifelong struggle schools are not and should not be responsible for a child to overall well-being or health that is too much to put on any teacher or counselor parents need to make those decisions it should be criminal to hide these very very important aspects of a child's life from parents or caregivers we have to work together to protect these vulnerable kids hiding things is not protecting them absolutely affirming them it's not protecting them I would urge you to please reconsider the aps policies that make it where teachers and staff are hiding these very very important and deeply personal things from families caregivers and parents

[00:33:00]
thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Gabrielle wheeler you have two minutes once you begin speaking members of the aps board I'm a director of an early Child Care Center in Albuquerque New Mexico and I've been an advocate for the 0 to 5:00 for the last decade I'm passionate about how helping New Mexico break 50 for ranking in education it is something I can consider my life's work but laying the foundation at that early age in Early Child Care is critical for a child's success Studies have shown that if you can watch the documentary called Waiting for Superman you will see that it begins in early childhood with play baseball programs that are Community Based APS should not compete with early

[00:34:00]
child care but should compliment and work with Early Child Care for better outcomes some of my personal experience when I was driving bands is and picking up kids at APS locations was knowing that a sixth grade teacher was being used for a pre-k program the education that is a elementary teacher compared to the training of an early childhood education educator is like comparing apples to oranges there's no comparison like somebody said Advanced countries are showing that play bass learning is best for kids even Mister Rogers do that and said that so we need to let her children have their childhood putting them in an APS bureaucratic and institutionalized setting is going to be detrimental for them it's not foundational it'll be detrimental there's a big difference Early Child Care

[00:35:00]
provide year-round care some of us open at 6:30 and close at 6:00 and some even more than that some of us provide overnight care we work year-round we work during the holidays we can honor different languages and we can be helped different communities I want to cite that Oklahoma move their 3 year olds to public school systems and 40% of their infant infant toddler care centers close to look at alternative uses for their buildings thank you very much thank you our next speaker is Teresa Elgin Minnesota

[00:36:00]
because I get to hear everyone's comments and of course like I always support early childhood education I think that needs to be done properly as far as the secret LGBT curriculum and that is being taught in schools I'm personally not aware of where that is in my standards and benchmarks and how that's being implemented in my personal classroom all I know is that you know kids are part of this learning and growing and Discovery process within themselves and I think that you know like schools even though they're they should not be responsible for all of these things they are responsible for at least creating safe zones first students to be able to explore themselves and feel safe in their learning environment now speaking about safety that's kind of what I'm here for it was really interesting to see this evolved system out here I was wondering what that was going to look like and how it's right there right and so you know I got to walk through this and I got to experience it for myself and it just it just has me thinking

[00:37:00]
I'm asking a lot of questions about you know like where is the money going to come from where is the money going to come from in order to put these into our school systems is this even something that our schools want is the community being engaged in this process and you know being asked if like this is the route that they want to take who is going to be monitoring these I know they're not metal detectors they're like technology detectors for whatever weapons detectors and you know we already don't have enough security guards to you know just kind of be like you know our kids and having these conversations with their kids and then they're going to be all around you know like three entry points at West Mesa and I just have a lot of questions right and every time I'm asking a question I'm never getting a clear and concise answer on on on on on what's Happening and I think it's I absolutely love the idea of like

[00:38:00]
streamlining right because I'm a swim coach and you know kids that go through the water like this like it's not it's not a very smooth process for them and I think the more streamlined APS is and getting information out to everyone in a clear and concise manner that's going to help us like move along our decisions are very quickly wrap up right and it helps you feel like so much better thank you thank you remember Jackson board members at the end of public forum thank you I just want to say thank you to everyone in the audience for coming tonight and presenting your concerns and generally go through public forum and then we just jump into our agenda so I just want to say thank you again for everyone for coming in we will we heard you in we're listening all right so our next item

[00:39:00]
is approval of the consent calendar but we're going to do is we're going to go through each of the items first so we'll go first with item 5181 which is the consideration for approval of revision to board policy A1 academic goals and this is a discussion action I will just open it up for questions hey the only thing that that I wanted I know it's really a very like one sentence but I was just reading a whole lot about you know opportunity gaps and came across something by you know Linda darling Hammond and she was saying that a lot of what we are calling achievements achievement gaps are being reframed as academic opportunity gaps and then I read a whole lot of Articles and I'm not going to go go through them all so I was just hoping that what we could do is just

[00:40:00]
front of the word opportunity that we could say Albuquerque Public Schools shall Implement a strategic plan instructional and instructional framework aimed at improving outcomes for all students with an intense focus on closing academic opportunity gaps and it seems to kind of go along with a lot of the research that is just going on right now so that was the only change that I thought would be a good one to make opportunity academic gaps it would they call it she called it academic opportunity gaps so academic would be in front of opportunity go ahead yes so I disagree with that because I think it unnecessarily limits what we're talking about in terms of opportunity gaps so opportunity gaps is what kids have an opportunity to that conclude AP classes it could include dual credit

[00:41:00]
it can include a lot of things that schools do have authority and responsibility over I think increasingly in the education field we're looking at opportunity to learn or conditions for Learning and expanding that and so I would just be very reluctant to and not in supportive and an effort to limit that to the opportunity to academic opportunity I think we need to be much broader than that okay and something that I mean what I was looking at is when they were describing what opportunities were and this is just in a whole bunch of different studies and there was a seminar that was done at the Kennedy School at Harvard and what they were talking about when it was talked about closing the opportunity Gap at schools that what they found is that a lot of when you're talking about opportunity rather than academics the opportunity is what is going on at home so helping families

[00:42:00]
prepare the children at school getting families to send their kids to school so attendance having access to books in the home helping to decrease the summer slide and we all know the largest effects for when it comes to having books is for economically disadvantaged students they talked about parent engagement eating family dinners together participating extracurricular activities parents more affluent and middle class parents and I think in this article they call it good night Moon time where parents who who read to their children 45 minutes a day as compared to a lot of the economically disadvantaged peers and this a lot was from the Saguaro seminar on Civic engagement in America and so what they were saying is that the kids that are living in poverty are just not going to have those those opportunities when it comes to closing the opportunity gap which is also

[00:43:00]
So Many Factors outside of school at poor health lack of Medical Care food and housing lead poisoning iron deficiency all those kinds of things that we can't control at school and so that's what you know that's just what I would like to do is focus on the academics which includes much of what you know member Gonzalez said those are all academics that we do at school but a lot of the opportunities no matter what we do there's going to be a lot of opportunities that are not going to be provided at home that we're not going to be able to provide at school any other comments but go ahead because I do have some comments on this as well but I I certainly understand our need to focus on academic but I think I mean I just think about for instance why we are supporting community that we can have some

[00:44:00]
and still impact student outcomes I would prefer to keep it broad because a lot of the opportunities are things like for instance field trips and all sorts of things that could be limited without a broader view although good teachers can manage to write almost anything into the standards we know how to do that but I but I think it does reflect on our commitment for the district to looking at what are the conditions that we can impact and how can we partner and make me meaningful ties with the community so I would prefer keeping it more General I'm also going to come out and support of the way that it's also stated I think that the way that it's written gives

[00:45:00]
a lot of rise to the Community Schools framework and you know the commitment that we have to that Community Schools I just think by just even genius our work and the activities that we put in play there and then I think of activities or opportunities that we make available through our family Outreach programs where it is about parenting courses and opportunities for our parents also to and enhance enhance their their literacy and enhance their financial literacy to I know we do that that's some of our places as well as their employability and that's that's an opportunity Gap I mean I think that's about looking at the conditions in a community of what's missing in and providing that kind of context so that we can have other kinds of things for me it says improving outcomes for me that's the academic side that the whole goal of

[00:46:00]
the school board is to improve student outcomes and that's really where where the achievement lies so is in terms of their academics Dr Segura did you want to add anything to this conversation with our team on framing some of this education on the piece of you know our focus is on academics but it has evolved past the walls of the classroom and the schoolhouse through our community schools effort and appreciate what brought up regarding the opportunity and I don't want it to be confusing because there is perspective that we can't we can't mitigate what happens when students leave our

[00:47:00]
mushrooms in our schools but where we felt the opportunity needed to be coupled with the achievements is that we feel like we are putting things in place to create Equitable opportunities for all kids as well as breaking down barriers that maybe exist in the home that they can access through the school so that was where we were thinking is you know our work with Community Schools and all of those efforts they really reach out into the homes and the community and so it's not just the achievement keys but we're trying to break down those barriers for the kids in those households that don't have those opportunities so that they can at least have access to them when they get to school so do you think then putting because it is you know academic goal

[00:48:00]
that we should add academic in front of outcomes then is that seems to be what you're alluding to but it's not it's not there so I don't know if that's something you think might help can I can I just go ahead and pop in here the overarching policy is academic goals so the whole sentence whole paragraph is related to academic goals so I mean I feel comfortable that it's all focusing on academics so I I feel comfortable with your discussion or your analysis doctoral I don't know that we have to add academic outcomes or academic opportunity because the entire policy is about academic goals that was going to be my statement I'm like it's titled academic goal

[00:49:00]
I was comfortable with the wording as is do I have a go ahead I was just going to say in that case we have a second I'll second this is Barbara clarification I think you have to approve with changes if you're going to do the changes that are so the motion is to go ahead you want to I don't think this one has just know I apologize it's okay but with the changes that are intact changes but not with the additional change period

[00:50:00]
Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes sir next item is consideration for approval of revisions to board policy IG curriculum development adoption and review also discussion action what is the discussion on this one this was item two who pulled that one off I pulled that one off but I think it was because board member Gonzalez had something so this one was what was added which was one thing that was discussed in the policy committee meeting was to add develop a process for the review to include staff input and during that policy committee meeting we also discussed Community input so I think the change is to include staff and Community input I think that's I think we're on that's right

[00:51:00]
item two is there no changes to this one's reading the superintendent doesn't need will provide District curriculum that is consistent and aligned with state requirements New Mexico content standards New Mexico instructional Scopes and District goals schools and teachers will organize and deliver instruction that implements all district adopted standards aligned and scoped and sequenced high-quality instructional materials that are culturally linguistically responsive that's where the most changes came in as and that paragraph and the second paragraph the superintendent artistic the way that the staff edited it following the policy committee meeting should have read will develop to include opportunity for staff input for the review and Adoption of District curriculum and what got left off from there was opportunity for staff and Community input

[00:52:00]
thank you I'm trying to get there yes I what I wanted to thank you so much board member Gonzalez for keeping me on track what I wanted to add was Community input because we have staff input we're already doing it I mean especially right now you've got the community input with the high school adoption I just thought it was important to add Community input into the so is are we amending that sentence then the superintendent or design with a process for the review and Adoption of District curriculum because all I see is the soup because maybe I have a wrong copy or something that's in the Q&A oh okay okay okay okay okay all right I get that I need to look at another document on top of this one answers too many documents okay I would like to change

[00:53:00]
input to engagement because I think one of the things that we learned from for instance the math adoption is that there needs to be more Dynamic way of interacting with with adoptions that some of it is based on not all staff having a real solid base for how to analyze curriculum and I think engagement says not only is their input but there's really the curriculum is eventually adopted so I would I would really want that

[00:54:00]
is more active in developing understanding of of what's going to be in that curricula what we need and how is this curriculum going to meet the needs of our students so what are the thoughts on replacing input with engagement are you okay with that yes okay all right I also have a real practical question about this because I was out of school today we're based on their budget they are looking at having to have three combination classrooms and to 45 combination classroom and when we start talking about standards it becomes absolutely impossible to implement that in a meaningful way so what does

[00:55:00]
this policy mean in a practical sense for both classes where there's a high number of English language Learners or Spanish language Learners where there's a much deeper need for Sheltering and taking the time to make sure that students can access understanding and the content along with what do we do with a combination class and I think I understand the intention of the policy but I think thinking about what it really means I just appreciate some clarity and at greater alignment

[00:56:00]
felt like this would provide us with a strong Foundation to ensure Equitable access of of the standards and materials in any classroom at any moment as far as combo classes those are extremely difficult and I get that English Learners special education I mean you name it we have them in our classrooms my thing is I don't as we're moving toward what collaboration time looks like in meeting the goals that we have put forth we need to be aligned in some sort of way so that teachers as they're doing their instructional planning or talking about common common standards for that you know unit or that in time and I think it's

[00:57:00]
obligation when teachers do have to teach a combo class for us to push in with our resource teachers to help support them in out what that looks like so it's not a you're not having to do double the work but how do you infuse this to not negate the importance of the grade level of each within that classroom so I think looking specifically at how are we going to be supporting those teachers and we have great people ready and willing and are in the classrooms helping with that so this is as we look from this bird's eye view when we are aligned around you know that consistency and making sure that we're not negating the needs of our Yahoo Martinez subgroups that we are Equitable and how we're providing instructions to our kids so then I think it's really important for us to

[00:58:00]
forward to understand that if we pass this it is a commitment to a whole different kind of commitment of resources and that really and truly to make it truly Equitable there have to be resources in and simply saying that doesn't create them correct and I think also how we're using our resources and making sure that we're maximizing the humans and the resources that we have within our district any other comments so I will move to approve board policy IG curriculum development adoption and review with the changes to include staff and Community engagement

[00:59:00]
so my question was why was for all students removed and and I think I know

[01:00:00]
student learning for all students and that was redundant but what I'm wondering is if we can either amend it to because I think it's important that we stay for all students or that all of the students are included so either as it's written now it says instruction in Albuquerque Public Schools will provide Equitable opportunity for student learning so Amendment a would be that I'm offering is instruction in Albuquerque Public Schools will provide Equitable opportunity for all student learning or instruction in Albuquerque Public Schools will provide Equitable opportunity for learning for all students I just think as we move forward we need to include we're trying to be Equitable for all of our students and so it's important to me that all is in there

[01:01:00]
Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Elder that was our intention it felt duplicative and so it wasn't us wanting to take out all it was just when it said for student learning who are like okay or else like student learning but now I'm perfectly fine with either one of those amendments would it be good to put provide Equitable learning opportunity for all students learning opportunity for all students that's what you're yes proposing how does the rest of the board feel that's fine okay so we have a motion then are we have some more okay I don't know what are you finished with member Jackson okay and so this is just just to kind of tighten it up a little bit on the second paragraph the first sentence learning activities will be appropriate to individual student needs and developmental

[01:02:00]
is that where it doesn't change anything it just takes off of the just takes off a couple of words and then the other question I know it was answered here and and this is something I think we need to talk through is one of the questions that I had is it says that the last paragraph that all instruction including elective courses not specifically authorized by law to be taught at APS have academic value adequate instructional time alignment with adopted standards and instructional Scoops Scopes Scopes Scopes and regularly assessed through District interim assessments but I was told that elective courses are not regularly assessed through District assessments so if they're not do we have to somehow make sure that we don't include elective courses that it's all

[01:03:00]
but we I think we're going to have to if they aren't regularly assessed through District interim assessments correct Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Elder we do not have District lead in term assessments for elective courses and ours are focused specifically on English language arts and Mathematics I know that individual elective courses do have their own they build their own assessments for formative and it's not an expectation as far as how it's done and so with those elective classes so all we are assessing internally for the data is the ELA and math a lot of the elective courses it's highly recommended that they utilize the literacy standards as well

[01:04:00]
that's something that they align to but as far as the interim assessment of them you don't so that's my concern is just because it says including elective courses and regularly assess through District in room assessments would it work to just put the period after regularly assess because you're saying they are because they are assessed do you think that would work and then just drop off regularly assess and don't put through District interim assessments is that important to have their no real quickly of course or sort of using or regular or and are regularly assessed using District something in our regularly that's

[01:05:00]
regularly assess that works thank you I wasn't sure if you were trying to emphasize some sort of like District instrumental or District requirement piece okay

[01:06:00]
I'll move for approval with the changes I will second and sorry I would have seconded but I didn't want to make a comment that I and this goes back to the previous policy motion as well just to point out that this really truly means looking at budgeting and resources in a different way and I think it's really important that we just always keep that in mind as soon as we start talking about all students and Equity it's just like we differentiate instruction we've got a differentiate resources so we have we have a motion in a second I believe so let's have a roll call please take me to Oregon

[01:07:00]
Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson yes definitely Dominguez yes yes yes Yolanda Montoya Cordova yes sorry item number for consideration for approval of revisions to board policy ih4 establishment of magnet schools was discussion on this one okay I mean the question that I had is I just don't know how difficult this may be to do but in the last sentence when it's talking about magnet schools reflect the demographics of the district wide population so my question probably to Mr Garcia is how well do the magnet schools already do this I mean how closely do they already reflect the demographics of APs board president members of the board I agree with the statement that APS will strive to ensure the demographics

[01:08:00]
demographics of the district the reason we have magnet schools is to reduce minority group in low socioeconomic group isolation our schools are at various ranges of this but we do work to strive on demographics that that reflect the demographics of the district and I saw that strive and striving is you know it's a good thing and I know you put those words in there because you want you do want to get there I just I mean I would just like to know and you don't have to do it now is just how they really do which ones represent the demographic demographics of the district and which of them don't and what can you really do to you know to change to change that to bring more students in and I know that's not a question for tonight but for president members of the board I'm just going to briefly explain what we can do and I believe we can do something that is how we need school take a look at

[01:09:00]
current demographics compare those to the district demographics and then created Recruitment and Retention plan where they see gaps in addition I believe the office of innovation should have family and community events where we teach Families how to navigate Choice options so I do think that we can improve where we see gaps I mean sometimes what I see Mr Garcia is I see certain you know some your magnet program so many of them are just so wonderful and they're serving that Community really well and so if we try to make it look like the demographics of APs then what are we going to do to some of those communities you know if we want to bring in you know 20% Caucasian children or whatever whatever it is 10 percent you know native and to make it really look like the demographics what kind of effect that really could have on

[01:10:00]
are there so we can grow it anyway so what you're saying is basically there's enough room for all of them to be able to grow we strive to okay okay thank you keep striving any other comments I just hope that we can find the resources that for instance having the science and steam strand going through Garfield and the North Valley Schools is really wonderful but every student needs to have access so I hope that we can also always have that I towards how

[01:11:00]
do we take what we really learned from the magnet schools because I think they are doing some wonderful things but and I make this argument especially with the charters as well of making sure that it's not isolated to only those students because we need every student in APS to have access to Quality stem programs and the agricultural strand all art and music every student needs to have art and music and so and I know it becomes a real resource issue but just always really important I'm not sure that needs to be in any way in the policy without it becoming more than it needs to be

[01:12:00]
what would be really interesting maybe at some point you know where we say APS will strive but it would be interesting to set a goal in terms of you know insurance at least like a 50% I mean I'm just making something up but to actually set a goal so that there's a benchmark and we actually measure ourselves against that I know for me on the magnet school issue is also sort of looking at the families that don't make it in and that wait list and where they end up getting referred or how they get supported because and I'm just thinking of Coronado as an example lots of families want to get into that school dual language and we have some great dual language schools but I wonder how many of those parents are even told they have another choice or there's another school or hey have you thought about Longfellow have you thought about this because I think traditionally what happens is just a family is just turned away at the door saying you just didn't make it you know the lottery number wasn't picked but I wonder

[01:13:00]
what we do to encourage them around the quality schools that we have that could also be a secondary choice so when we start to do this and especially in our magnet schools giving parents an option of saying here's option one here's option two here's option 3 so that they are starting to also understand the depth of the resources that we have for them if they want to pursue that kind of a pathway and I think that might be another way for us to ensure access for our families you know and I think I think the issue of tax and what's being proposed for travel and we had the speaker tonight referring to Washington Washington Middle School do you like language programming and why wouldn't we raise that up is as something of quality

[01:14:00]
and I mean I've spoken spoken before about making sure that neighborhood surrounding schools that are being transferred transformed into the magnet schools have access to that school that's part of the equity and we're digressing because we're going into like what we'd like for the procedures to be but I think you kind of understand some of the concerns around this so do I have a motion on this one with the changes I don't think there are any or there were no changes so we just have the questions to approve board policy IH 4 establishment of magnet schools as presented thank you are part of libertarianism called Boston

[01:15:00]
what is number six on this consent consideration for approval of revisions to board policy ik academic accountability so I recommended that we remove this one from consent for two reasons so the first is in the second sentence which reads the superintendent or designee will establish a district-wide assessment strategy to be followed by all schools I feel like it would help to have a purpose to what end so I would propose to ensure student learning in equity so we can talk about to ensure student learning and Equity Equity okay so it would read the superintendent or designee will establish a district wide assessment strategy to be followed by all schools to ensure student learning inequity what you could we might also add this is just popping in my head right now to inform instruction but there are acknowledging that a balanced assessment system serves a variety of purposes my best be it might make sense to State all of those purposes I think to

[01:16:00]
and acknowledging that often an education we lose track of which assessment should be used for which purpose it's important I think to acknowledge all of those purposes so that was the first thing so I'll stop there before I go to the second thing just to see if there's any reaction from our Administration Madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder it would be helpful if you can repeat that so we can get it slowly and ensure student learning inequity I'm sorry and the one after was for monitoring and accountability

[01:17:00]
so it's to be followed by all schools to inform instruction for monitoring and accountability and to ensure student learning and Equity to inform instruction for monetary and accountability and to ensure student learning and equity and there may be some agreement so the second thing is this called academic accountability and there's currently there have been nothing in here about accountability

[01:18:00]
so we can add that one of the purposes of accountability is for I mean sorry one of the purposes of assessment is for monitoring and accountability which we just did but I would also propose that and this was in the Q&A that we add a paragraph that essentially reads the superintendent or designee will establish a district-wide school back to school accountability system or performance framework to be followed by all schools to ensure transparency of outcomes and effective allocation of District resources so there's currently nothing about here in this policy on accountability so I thought we should just add that to say that the district will establish an accountability program but I can't say it again too if that was sent out in an email on February 28th 4:43 p.m. and it's under additional comments on this policy

[01:19:00]
it's basically the top of the very last page so it's the superintendent or designated School accountability system or performance framework to be followed by all schools to ensure transparency about comes and effective allocation of District resources and I think this is acknowledging that currently we do have a strategic performance framework that has the word tears so this is essentially just putting that into policy and acknowledging that that may shift but the important thing is that there is an accountability system of some sort and if I can just tagged onto that we are naturally going to have an accountability system through the progress monitoring so I think that I think it would it it's not adding additional time to the administration it's just we have this

[01:20:00]
let's make sure that we're ensuring transparency for the the community and so that we're working together since we will have this progress monitoring system that is naturally an accountability system go for a doctor appointment I do wonder about the wording of saying it's like to be followed by old schools perhaps it's more like schools or including old schools or something like that because the the framework that we have it's not exactly that the schools follow it it's more something that I'm fine with that I was just mirroring the language of the previous paragraph that said to be followed so that could come out cuz it's called a school accountability system so it could just read School accountability system or performance framework

[01:21:00]
to ensure transparency of outcomes an effective allocation of District resources all right I do have a concern that we turn classrooms into testing meals and having been having lived through the age of progress monitoring you know I think it's continued with iStation to Great extent the amount of instructional time that's lost in children feeling like they go to school to be tested it is not an issue of assessment I mean I did assessments every day all day long with every student in one form or another but I think

[01:22:00]
we need to put into the context of what does this really look like in a classroom yes we need to know where our kids are we need to know that they're learning that is something that teachers spend all of their time every day paying attention to but what kind of system we impose so that we have the data we want can quickly transform what a child's life in a classroom is and so how we walk that tight throat is really critical and I don't want anything in policy that is going to tip us over the edge and just this is totally anecdotal but I will tell you when we could do real learning engagement in K3 plus we had kids come to K

[01:23:00]
play Pleasant stay and when we were doing weekly progress monitoring so that someone could use that data for who knows what we started losing students because it was no longer the kind of engaging environment that they needed and so I mean that that is the task of the administration to figure that out but I don't want to have it in policy where there is no flexibility and we go back to the worst of No Child Left Behind and we figure it out No Child Left Behind did not change the dial on student student achievement I mean I would because I agree with Barbara so this is what I would say on this policy they should be like short and sweet we have to do these mandated state and federal tests and District tests so if we just had the first sentence like that would be good enough in

[01:24:00]
that would be what I think Barbara was trying to say is there so much I think I'm not speaking for her there's so much already on teachers and on kids and just stressing assessments assessments we Albuquerque Public Schools will comply with all state I would I would add District in there and federally mandated student assessments that is what we are accountable to do right I mean that's we have to do it and that's what I'm assuming that's what the academic accountability means cuz we're talking about the assessments that's just what I would say as a former teacher that feels for the kids and the teachers if I may respond to that just as I think kind of what we've discussed the accountability mean a lot of different things a lot of different people and it can be applied at all sorts of different levels for me I'd say account

[01:25:00]
quality starts with disability and that you cannot have any level of accountability if you can't see what's going on but it seems clear from well at least from the proposed language that board member Gonzalez is mentioning that this is not a mandate to the superintendent to create an accountability system for teachers it's more to look kind of a crossover schools as my understanding we're not trying to repeat the Peds teacher evaluation system situation that we had is that correct and I would just say in response to board member in the first paragraph is essentially what was already here but giving the district the authority to establish their own assessment strategy which they're already doing anyway so I think I wouldn't add District to the previous sentence and saying we're following and complying with all state and federal

[01:26:00]
mandated assessments we are creating our own assessment strategy and the superintendent will report on that to the board the second piece is the district will also report on this to families that's another important piece of accountability is that each family knows how their individual student is performing the third piece of accountability that's moving is that families and the public understand overall how the district is performing and how schools are and so I don't think that it leads to any No Child Left Behind test Factory cuz we're giving the district the authority to just establish a system we're not saying established a system in which kids spend 80% of their time taking tests or in which there's high stakes consequences or in which etcetera etcetera is just saying will establish a system which again we already have the performance framework in place so it's just adding the accountability sentence to the policy on accountability go ahead and I agree this is ultimately

[01:27:00]
stating that you know as a district we we have these required state and federal tests that we have to do but what test like for an interim assessment for ELA and math that's up to the district to determine and so this gives us it just makes it very clear that state statute requires that an interim be done at districts but it gives us the ability to establish a district-wide system so we don't have you know the schools doing this and these schools doing that so that we can have aligned data to really inform our decision-making as well as our resource allocation okay board member Dominguez I think you wanted to have a comment but I'm going to wait till the end yeah I understand I can appreciate the language for accountability

[01:28:00]
but this this is feeling a little bit like we're trying to Wrangle in and get more focused so I'll continue to see if I can work Smith so I was just going to add I think and board member Gonzalez maybe you could help me but I think the the last sentence around that school accountability system or performance framework is a lot of what we already do through like supper right so we make it available we're just transparent around performance overall and so it's really about having this school accountability system or there's performance framework that can be I understand the transparency of outcomes but it's really about it's a communication tool so that we can just holistically share with the community and the state of like where APS is

[01:29:00]
is the other part so we can report publicly that our kids are drowning and then we're just looking at them drown the second part is the allocating resources which is throwing them the Bowie life preserver thank you thank you so it's actually calling the accountability we do something and so allocation of resources that could be again for the district to decide but we're saying you can't just report that schools are underperforming you have to do something about it so showing what kind of like life preservers were thrown at a school that is drowning it's just saying they have to give them a life preserver and they get to decide and the development of the framework which they are again already have with the tears of the performance framework that exists

[01:30:00]
but this is about making it transparent and so that it's it's it's it's it's visible to everyone is what I'm looking at as well so so can that be done I guess this is the question yes thank you for the question I'm bored president the the framework as it exists now it's kind of a has existed in this kind of you know it would be good to have the board saying hey this is something that we think is a good idea to have out there and also to designate the reason for it the performance as it exists now might need to be redesigned to meet the needs of the board and where we're going kind of moving forward and so in my head this is kind of blessing the district's efforts

[01:31:00]
in this area because before we came up with that because we needed something and we just needed something but here it would be here would be that the board is saying yes we think that this should actually exist and then we can and then we have to resources which is important because then it's yeah okay I'm just yeah I mean it's like the structure is there but honestly have you ever gone I know you have any of you ever gone on and looked at the performance framework it doesn't give any relevant information to our families it just says that there are tears it was not designed for that the purpose necessarily so the structures there and I think it's just this gives you permission to build on that or gives you

[01:32:00]
but it also says that we're going to commit to Resource it so that we can build it because it's not going to come with no resources so that's another it's another administrative cost to do that I mean it's nice to have but I know that it is it's not easy right now OK Google in the first paragraph all the shells got changed address thank you for catching I think doctor make sure we're all on the same page I think I'm struggling a little bit with what

[01:33:00]
some of the discussion was about like I feel like it's our District's responsibility to create a transparent like data dashboard for our all our constituents which zapper has done a tremendous job in doing that I feel like the performance framework is meant to inform schools and so I wonder if that's more like the procedural directive of how we work with schools directly and if the data dashboard is kind of the the policy where we make it transparent to everyone what are data School data is our district data is so again for me the key is the superintendent will establish an accountability system and I was using accountability system or performance framework almost as soon as school performance

[01:34:00]
so we could call it accountability system but I don't want it to be interpreted as being all about the high stakes accountability it is about how we ensure performance so the superintendent or does me will establish a district-wide school accountability system or performance framework to ensure transparency which again as we have the public reporting we have this after we can see how schools are doing and effective allocation of District resources is for the board to say to the district that in addition to reporting how schools are doing you also have to do something about it and I think this is very aligned to our guardrails as well to which we're saying we need to equitably allocate resources and so some schools and I are the tier one or two or four the lower performing right now before so some schools in the current scenario to your for might get more stuff they might get the tops model they might get a community school coordinator they might get

[01:35:00]
that's the allocation of District resources so I think that's just the key is to have those two things in tandem transparency and allocation of resources and resources broadly people time money which sort of is back to the tops model so it provides the district the flexibility to come up with what is this performance framework maybe it is the same tier 4S tears maybe it's something different but the main point being in this policy around accountability we should be talking about school accountability not just assessment and not just student level performance yes so I will say that the thing that stands out to me about comes and effective allocation of District resources they kind of mentioned before accountability systems can be designed to do a whole bunch of different things and

[01:36:00]
this one States the intention of the board that it's for transparency about comes into ensure effective allocation of resources and so what we would do is look at what we've produced which is you know we have a lot of data and information out there but what we would we would do is take what we have and then look at these purposes for transparency and allocation and make sure that whatever new format we come up with is a lying to meet those particular reasons okay do you want us to read it yes please so the superintendent or does it need will establish a district wide School accountability system or performance framework to ensure transparency of outcomes and effective allocation of District resources and just to ask you

[01:37:00]
so I mean I'm just sorry I bothered you so I'm looking at this and going I mean I kind of want to know what you think if some of this if it's all fine and policy or do you think any of this should just be in procedural directive well you know this is pretty significant we had initially brought these forward I think we had asked for a second read and and then bring it forward for approval but it's it's moved to 1 I think there may be some things in there that do concern us but whether they're popping immediately to the head and to my mouth I don't know none of it it's all in theory it makes perfect

[01:38:00]
I agree with the theory I'm thinking about the practicality of what it looks like and and how we're going to do some of that creating an assessment system I had this conversation with Dr Bowman more than once and there are things that are needed Beyond just the test or the assessment that's not say test the people to look at the people to make sure it's it's been given properly just a lot of things and elements to go into what you're asking here I think it makes sense I think we should have it I wonder what elements would probably have to consider consider that that's where I I just thought it was everything keeps adding I mean every time we write these policies we add something like I was like when we do the production

[01:39:00]
I think once it's there then it's there I think it's going to be the creation and getting people to the point where they use it and then use it effectively that that's going to be the the stress point I'm sorry fundamental job is to improve student outcomes so if we don't know how students are performing how schools are performing and if we don't allocate resources to that end then what are we doing and I don't think that this is adding the language that was taken out of here was that funky language around APS have the flexibility to put in place their own accountability system because whatever whatever whatever so that didn't make sense because the state situation was no longer how it used to be so this is actually streamlining it significantly from what you used to be in there so it's just saying APS will have an accountability

[01:40:00]
and and at the core of that is the word tracking how schools are doing and we're allocating resources to those schools and it's transparent and I if it's hard I think that's okay because that's our job yeah I don't think I disagreed with you at all what I simply said was actually do have an accountability system does it meet some of the goals you laid out tonight in some ways it does in some ways it does not and so they will need to be changed I don't think we shy from my hard work I don't think that's all it's just a question I was asking when I was trying to answer that question so I don't see we're fine so I want to get clarification cuz I feel like we're getting we're contradicting ourselves in several ways

[01:41:00]
do you feel like what was presented by board member Gonzalez is something that we can follow through and be able to support or using significant challenges like where are we at the cuz I hear no and then I heard we're fine so I am so confused where we're at we're fine we're good we're good with what was recommended you feel comfortable with it yes it will require a review of what we have to ensure that we are biting with the words wishes okay but I feel confident that it will be possible to do because I just feel like I feel like we're starting to rabbit hole and get really deep again into the weeds versus just doing what it says we're going to do and I think your statement just added additional clarification around accountability and it's just going to support overall with the district does it or it might not see I'm like why how did it get so complicated throughout that or did I miss something I think

[01:42:00]
remember Gonzales clarified precisely what she was looking for okay and I think for me the only thing that was a question mark in my head is timeliness in terms of how quickly we can do it and then I worry about that I mean that was the only thing that I'm worried about well there's no timeline in any of the policies okay so that comes in well but I but I also know this board and we put it out there we say I think the expectation is going to happen now and I just worry about that so that's the part I'm concerned about yeah I mean so I think putting in the context of everything else that's going on right we're about to review the goals and guardrails and that's District level accountability we have language in here around student level accountability which is the assessment so it's missing is that middle piece which is the school level accountability and attuned is working with the district to align strategies initiatives to the Strategic goals and to establish 18 months implementation

[01:43:00]
timeline for Windows strategies initiatives will take place part of that includes the dashboard and how the dashboard helps track so I think it is just seeing all of that come together and it's going to take some time to switch regardless but again there's nothing in here that says by X date it's helpful to hear that because for my in my mind I'm just thinking the timelessness because I just know the sport and we set an expectation and then we kind of flip out if it's not mad and so I just want to be really clear about that so there is no time in here it is something that we're going to work towards it's kind of like we're striving to use her magnets conversation but is definitely something that we can we can get to and you feel confident we can get there but is something it's going to require some work absolutely okay yes I I will say that

[01:44:00]
while I'm confident that we can get there I am not putting a time frame on it because for all the reasons that we mentioned here the work with the tuned is is kind of moving along and I can just you know I know that there's going to be a lot of work coming from there there's going to be a lot of work coming from the schools in the guard rails and this policy just kind of indicates we should have an accountability system for schools which is aligned with a lot of the other work that we are having to do it's a line and it's something we can do and should do and we will try to get it done so I would like to make a motion policy with the changes stated with your verbiage that you the state that you added with board member Gonzalez's there's one more thing I just read through it and it kind of

[01:45:00]
sticking out really strangely to me the last sentence of the first paragraph We end with Albuquerque Public Schools will provide rigorous academic programs for all students that's a weird sentence to end with that first sentence to say Albuquerque Public Schools will provide rigorous academic programs for all students and will comply with Allstate and federally mandated student assessments yes all second the motion has amended with the change from Dr Segura did we agree that that last paragraph was more in the morning period

[01:46:00]
okay just drive for implementation and our board is going to chill but there is no dead timeline on that yeah okay all right so we have a motion and we have a second are there is there additional discussion Dr Bowman you look like yes sorry I it just came to me because we're doing really great job with this and we had a discussion a little earlier about policy instructional program and inline with the policies line up with the titles I was just wondering if that sentence is duplicates

[01:47:00]
instructional program which is Wichitas all about the academic motion to amend based on your recommendation this document is really pretty the third paragraph related to the superintendent establishing accountability system up we had a motion and a second then we had a friendly amendment that was then second in so we are now at the point where we can but I think we can call them as a timely yes Danielle Gonzales yes

[01:48:00]
Barbara Peterson I look forward to seeing the procedural directive and I'll vote Yes is the top of your mouth is Brittany Jackson yes Yolanda Montrose yes okay so our next item is just approval for all of the remaining consent calendar items I moved to approve the remaining consent items number 5857 and 8 all right I have a roll call please take me to go yes yes yes yes yes yes okay this is really interesting because my

[01:49:00]
my diet is copy doesn't have but the next item is which I think is cool yeah it's not showing up on my copy here on the diet so that's what it was throwing me off so I'm going to go to that store is the magnet school is the resolution okay nevermind okay sorry next item is consideration

[01:50:00]
I just want to have a just give the board a little bit of a summary of what of where we are so we actually the executive committee met with both of the charter schools that are in question with the talent and development Academy and also with El Camino Real Academy we met with some of their leadership to them the concerns in the questions that the board had regarding the renewal applications when they first came to us so we we discussed the concerns around performance a lot of the things around the chart that was given to us in terms of like the red green yellow places where either funding was a miss or they're just they're spending wasn't appropriate and then we talked about their their plans moving forward as they go

[01:51:00]
into the next piece we did we did also present to both schools the option of or we discussed about a 3-year versus a 5-year renewal there wasn't agreement on that but there was a lot of agreement I will say from the from both charter schools in in a really candid conversation I believe around the importance in the significance of student performance I think that understanding that academic outcomes are definitely understood as a value and as as the vision of where where we want to see our students also expressed a lot of concern about you know just how are we going to get to to some better outcomes noting that our students in all of our Public Schools including our Charter Schools as public schools are need to have quality access to Quality schools

[01:52:00]
also noted that our role is an authorizer because we are public officials that were elected for to support public schools that we see Charter Schools as part of that public schools are things that we support and we promote and our goal is to ensure that our public schools are are actually meeting the vision and values of the community that we serve so we just pretty much left the meeting I think with a better understanding of of each of the schools themselves and I'm going to open it up to board member ottagon and to board member Jackson if you want to add anything else that you came away with during that conversation because I think what we're just going to do essentially is just the consideration for approval of the of the renewal we did have there was an appeal that was submitted because we didn't go through the through that process initially

[01:53:00]
and so ped is kind of waiting in the wings if we don't do this they're still an appeal on the table and there's a possibility that the ruling will be made for us if we do that so I don't know if you want to add anything else I think the only thing the only thing that I would add or highlight is you know student outcomes and proficiency are very important to this board and that was definitely I was in one of the discussions and I certain to say that that was fast and brought up I think it was we had good conversations and the administration and the board also left with some process issues that we need to to work on

[01:54:00]
yeah so it's we will we left with with our own to-do list is what I will say but we have to educate our kids and we we are we are authorizers we are we represent the taxpayers we represent we have to make sure that funding is being being used appropriately and we have to back to what doctor doctor board member Gonzalez said our job the sole purpose of the reason that we're here is a student outcomes and if we are not intently focused on that then we're not doing the job that we were hired to do so I think those are my only additional comments and I would just pay I would just

[01:55:00]
play Echo what member Jackson said we're supposed to be doing what's best for kids always they should be having the best education possible we have to answer to our taxpayers we have to be fiscally responsible and we have to look at student outcomes and that is in my opinion the most important reason that we're here and that we're elected that's what we're supposed to be doing we're supposed to make sure kids are in a school where they're getting a great education and they are not suffering in any way academically and I am not a very happy person that things did not go the way they should have and we didn't have somebody let us know that we were not doing we don't have a good process I'm assuming and that we didn't give us enough time to get all the answers that that we needed and I hope that

[01:56:00]
we will be able to fix that and this won't happen again because in the end it's the kids that are suffering and the kids that are not getting the education that they so rightly deserve and that they are so capable of and then I just want to add that one of the other things that we discussed also was one started out really that our goal with the the charters that we offer rise is to make sure that we can provide quality choices for the families that were serving is that we want to have that partnership and we want to ensure a group of a list of charter schools that really provide quality options for the families that that we serve in throughout the district that was one of the first key things and then lastly we also made a commitment that the board of education is going to look at the way that we review our Charter applications in the charter process review process

[01:57:00]
more distinctly we will have our own special sessions just around chartering I know we want to have a workshop with the office so that we can just get to a better understanding of our role as an authorizer and the rules of the game or the engagement of all that so Dr Escobedo and I have talked about that and the strategies that we're going to use their I'm really confident with the way that we can look at that but essentially it's important for everybody to know that the number of Charters that we have in this district and we were just board member music on and Jackson and I were talking about this is like it's almost another Zone because it's that many schools so we call it so far but we do have we do have quite a few so so those are some of the items are up there so what we'll do now is go on to the first one which is consideration for approval of the charter renewal with the term of 5 years for the Albuquerque town and development Academy I don't know Dr Esco

[01:58:00]
no and Mr Garcia if you want to add anything else to the conversation I think we stand for questions and and I do want to mention also that the next step after this is if there's if there is a positive renewal then it goes into the next step which is actually negotiating the performance framework and and the accountability piece on that correct yes correct and we will bring you specific performance indicators as you were talking very much relates to your previous conversation as well period performance and then also monitor progress is we're going along okay are there any questions all right yeah I have a question go ahead so just for you so regarding that performance framework could you just kind of give us just a general idea because I realize that we're going to have a work session that's going to go really

[01:59:00]
but I think it would be important for us to hear and for every everyone in the audience to hear what is potentially going to be in these performance Frameworks how are we going to maintain how are we going to determine that the will of the board and the goals that we have set for APS are going to be mirrored within this performance framework so what president's Frameworks making sure that they're in and compliance with state law finances are some of their state are some of our financial measures of ensuring that they have a proper viability so we can go into that but specifically if you look at page 37 we've had the schools in their renewal

[02:00:00]
location propose an academic measures of performance measures so we'll negotiate those and those are typically monitored as we visit the schools virtually and in person each semester so looking at where you at with your internal assessments when your standards based assessments come out where are you where are you guys in Martinez subgroups and are you implementing presented in this renewal so that kind of all goes together now they're making progress and they're close to making their goals I think that's one conversation but if they're not making progress and implementing their strategic plan and that's what we come with what we want to do it on page 366 oversight process for issuing a notice of unsatisfactory performance and so is this this inclusion of academic goals is that something new that is the new process it's been developed or what

[02:01:00]
following the school grading system we're working on a new academic framework pandemic came so we're back to a baseline with a standard of last year's assessment and then we can move forward so I think this is perfect timing to where we're going to have a motion for items 6A have a question of expectations the 1234 the 4th I guess the 4th bullet and the first sub Bullet From the contract the authorizer shall notify the school in a timely

[02:02:00]
unsatisfactory performance on the organizational academic or financial Frameworks when I read that it just struck me that this requires the office of innovation and school Choice Personnel to work even harder to notify Board of Education as soon as possible we have the results right and I did share this concerned I know you all work hard and they're only two of you two and a half so I guess I'm I'm putting my faith in I think some good things have come out of these conversations one that a process that we need to improve the

[02:03:00]
process but within that yeah I'm concerned about not having enough staff and how we in the process how we take that into account for holding schools accountable I don't know that that's not a question just an observation and a concern but thank you to all for the conversations that you have started I think there's a lot of work still ahead and I don't know how you're going to do it to people I just want to point out you'll be receiving actual copies of unsatisfactory performance

[02:04:00]
such as part of our process and our system so we have we issue that notice to make sure that the schools are develop a corrective action plan we meet with them so as long as they're implementing it developing it there before so I think a couple of you have experienced when we had a school that have the same issues around Special Olympics we're not improving and so we did give them time and then after a point we can come and say the school does need to be revoked I think it's adding us a level of accountability of academics which would be appreciated and how long did it take to get to the revocation it's a month

[02:05:00]
it took a while but I mean there is a there is a process that I've had an opportunity to experience and it's not it's not fun it's hard and I just I just want to say I came away with a better understanding of each school as a result of the meeting I think that was that was really helpful I definitely came away with a deeper appreciation I think for each of the the type of work that each of them are engaged in and the process is that they have in place and I would just say that there's a difference between them doing a good job filling out an application and doting all their eyes and Crossing all their teeth and then you compare that to student outcomes you can fill out an application really well that doesn't mean that you're going to be the best

[02:06:00]
what kind of you should get the job period okay so let's just so we're on item a go ahead Barbara when we do our workshop on Charter School governance can we invite inappropriate person from the PED absolutely talked about that definitely want ped there with us for sure this conversation because I see how rigid we tend to be with the charter schools and really trying to hold them accountable as they should but my request would be that we have this exact same accountability and guideline for our own schools because it's unfortunate that we're trying to hold them to a higher standard than what we hold ourselves and when we talk about accountability it has to go across the board not just Charter Schools I don't believe that we are holding them to a higher standard

[02:07:00]
Jasper Charter on the basis of accumulating more resources to do something that they say they can do better and our whole process what have we done in the last year except do everything we can to focus on outcomes for our students and if we break again if we break down by demographics the schools that do well are serving a group of students that we do equally well with or better and when you look at the schools that are not doing well there are many issues and the demographics are not anything that we should be surprised by so that's I mean what if we done in the last year except for free

[02:08:00]
I'm taking on but these are these are schools that are saying we can do it better and we deserve to be able to step outside of the same process that our schools have and so it is absolutely critical that we examine where they are and how they're doing I do have a question I wasn't finished with my questions for Pages 422 and 433 and I may have just missed getting the correction but the the chart with the green and red and yellow and I apologize the

[02:09:00]
Peterson on page 43 I counted six out of the eight this this is I mean they are in the red on 658

[02:10:00]
it would appear that we're being petty if all were looking at is all those greens and one red that's being really unfair but the reality is is that they did not color code well it's because it may refer to well no I don't think so it doesn't refer to the Montessori of the Rio Grande details details about the five year what happens if if there is no improvement within are we saying no matter what is 5 years period

[02:11:00]
we have are their goals within that for continuing and honoring the five years or revoking sooner than that member Peterson members of the board so the next step if you were to approve just the renewal saying that you know we do agree that the renewal should go forward we wouldn't negotiate with the school of the performance and that's where if you look for Albuquerque talent for example on page 37 of your packet they are proposing some academic goals sat and their internal so we would sit down with them and say this is what you propose to opportunities for us to bring you some goals and around the financial department but I understand it's like the the renewal is just the contacts for 5 years

[02:12:00]
within that 5 year context board member Peterson were also looking and we're monitoring and if if performance is going great which is what we all want that will be fabulous but if things are not going well then that's where our opportunity comes in for the discussions around next steps either corrective action first I think is first steps and then if nothing is done there then we start to look at our other options similar to what we did with that the last time as a board we we actually went through that process with the school that didn't turn around so the answer remember Peterson when it comes to in some of the in one of the questions that will be reviewing their performances so the soonest for a new contract would be the spring after this could happen in May 2024 the soonest if there were no progress or there were still concerns so it would be a year a little over a year from now that'd be the soonest

[02:13:00]
okay go ahead board member Gonzales so I will move for consideration of approval for the charter renewal with the term of 5 years for Albuquerque talent and development Academy to honor the effort of our executive committee Jackson yes all right so our next item is consideration for app

[02:14:00]
the charter renewal with the term of 5 years for the El Camino Real Academy do I have a motion wait what is for El Camino Real

[02:15:00]
Crystal Tapia Romero no Pasadena Dominguez again yes only to honor the work of the executive committee did Courtney Jackson know Yolanda Monterey Cordova yes okay so I think that won all right so our next item for consideration and action is a government Affairs update this is just a discussion hey Madam president which has 17 days to go so the House of Representatives did finally passed their budget we're going to go over some highlights at the end of our report here but I'll turn over to see

[02:16:00]
my president members of the board superintendent Elder House Bill 126 the changes to school graduation requirements past the House of Representatives 64 to 3:00 at past Senate education this week and Senate Finance today it will be heard on the senate floor and have passed will go to the governor Senate education passed HB 120 House Bill 127 which makes the minimum salary for educational assistance 25,000 a year and it is now in Senate Finance House Bill 130 which would increase the minimum number of instructional hours passed House Appropriations today and along with House Bill 1999 that increases the school at Risk Index mobile

[02:17:00]
tomorrow morning and Senate Bill 131 which is the capital offset bill that did pass the Senate and House Education and is now in House Appropriations one thing I didn't want to point out with that Billy not only helps our Capital offset needs but it does add 100 million dollars for CTE in security that's going to be distributed through the scg so we're going to get our proportion which should be about 23 point 7 million wow so here's some notes I want to highlight from house bill to which is the budget if the address changes go through which there was some it was a nice afternoon 7.7 million dollars in funding I didn't want to point out that the language to increase the instructional hours

[02:18:00]
same language that's in the bill that barely passed House Appropriations this afternoon again on a very interesting there's some interesting movement that happened with it or didn't happen with it but as that bill moves forward whether it moves forward or not the instructional our minimums are carved out in the budget so expressly says as we shared with you the language that the public education department wouldn't be able to approve a budget that had less than 1,140 hours so very interesting how some of those directions are put into budget even if the legislation isn't going through there's a 13039 million dollars currently in the budget for an average of 5% salary increase we would receive about 32 million of that and then we would get about 34 million to ensure that we bring all EA's to that 25,000 minimum Factor there's some

[02:19:00]
language currently in the budget that ties the principal responsibility factor to the family income index and we kind of heard that was the discussion and family in House Appropriations today to understand kind of what the push from LFC around isn't that and they're really wanting to push incentivizing principles to be in high poverty schools so it's going to be an interesting discussion going forward to although that didn't pass and then finally looks like we'll receive about 11:33 or there's about 4 6 6

[02:20:00]
what's up our EA's that are being paid out of federal funds so what we've been told by Alicia and will triple check this way and the salary increases this year do include those federal employees all the employees that are on the books which was a change from last year okay cuz that was the issue last year thank you so that could potentially free up some resources for us then well know but what it will do is it will not require us to cut resources to make sure those ears are paid by the state rate because what we were afraid of was that we were going to have to close programs down to get to the $25 for the EA's because last year they forgot period

[02:21:00]
I mean we are we have a shortfall and a gap and it seems like we always have a gap of anywhere between 10 to 15 million I just salaries that has been consistent yes okay I just want to make sure that we just don't miss anything I know how we've done that in the past where it was like oh yeah they're getting a raise right number Peterson but then somehow not on purpose I'm sure but we forget about some of those people right I am sure it's not but we don't they do and so I I mean I know it's their fault and it's not wanting that to happen

[02:22:00]
so we just need to point out to them that we need to make sure that doesn't happen as a board member Miller had to go to members of the board so the 5% sell increase I will point out that's a good example so if you I don't know what page it is in your pocket but the wording there currently from the house is that it's an average of 5% that usually gets changed in the Senate because employee gets groups get nervous that one employee is expected to come out but right now it's in there so it would be an average of 5% to all employers yeah I don't like that do you like that I mean I don't like it but I just think it should be it seems unfair I'm sorry I'm super super directions

[02:23:00]
this year there's some superintendents have really been pushing for the averaging language to help with compaction it's hard I think it won't get changed in the Senate thank you any other comments go ahead 126 the graduation requirements bill that passed the house is moving to the Senate what changes were made from the original version has to be offered and financial literacy is now underground horses have to be offered but they're not required for graduation a financial literacy has to be part of your economics course so it does have to be part of that but in the social studies just standards

[02:24:00]
personal financial literacy has been embedded in the social studies standards K through 12 thank you any other go ahead so do you have any sense of what's going to happen when things go to Senate finance and actually go through that process as far as the budget as far as the budget I don't think we are too I don't think we're too far off to 50 million dollars have room for which is interesting because that was the disagreement with the healthy Universal Mills which hasn't been moving but now it's moving so I will tell you I think we're still saying record Revenue

[02:25:00]
and they're not going to do another Revenue estimate knowing that there's more Revenue coming in so I think we're I think we're in good shape to see everything kind of come together it's just really making sure that everything the eyes are dotted the t's are crossed and the fine print is going to be able to help us that were costing out all employees but I think you can kind of see graduation requirements is movement the new changes of the instructional hours is moving I think you know the funding for increases and salaries are there so it's interesting how things are kind of focus but there's still some movement as we saw it Appropriations this may be more question for super schools are getting their budget projection

[02:26:00]
this week do you if if things go as optimistically as perhaps they could from the legislature do you see anything see any changes in what will happen at the school level with the budgets that they've received at this point I'm not sure I totally understand what you're asking yeah there's changes we've already added some changes what we were able to tell them when we began the initial was a very dark time I mean it was a very dark time for all those budgets out it was not fun to be superintendent stand for those people I can say we're not there it worked we're not there yet we're still dealing with declining enrollment yes we're still dealing with you know some of those issues and that doesn't go away

[02:27:00]
but the impact is not as dire as as we walked in so we've been walking into we're even going to finish this year in much better Financial shape than we thought we might even a month ago so we're really had some good things that we've done and we're in a good or space but I'm much better space and apologized for a much better I think my message on Friday revolves around that there's going to be individuals there's always a schools of dropped and there's going to get off and got through it and it's much better space I think that's true it's not a couple of conversations

[02:28:00]
so hopefully there's just going to be some flexibility for how you and the schools and the associates work out this particular needs the reality is that they'll be the loss of some positions in the sunset Schools Enrollment of declined they're also maybe some shifting of responsibilities again this is what we talked about if we're going to have goals then I'm going to have to have the flexibility to say I need to focus on literacy getting kids ready by 3rd grade and we're going to have to shift resources to get that to happen and that means that some people who are doing something that they're very passionate about and love may have to be repurposed in is still extremely important and that's that's just the goals are there and if we're really going to turn things around and this is going to be the focus that has to be the focus it doesn't mean that I don't want to get rid of clubs I don't want to get rid of you know anything

[02:29:00]
music I don't really want to get rid of Fine Arts but there's some other positions that are probably going to have to be rethought when will we have a better idea about when they're going to be rethought we just on Monday handed out the schools their initial budget and they have the next two weeks to begin to work again we've asked them to be thoughtful in the way they lay out those budgets and explain to us how do you utilize them to make an impact around your goals and specific to Yazzie Martinez and when they're losing a position before whatever reason retirement or you know just enrollment they're going to have to explain what that means period

[02:30:00]
compliance for that it would be in a year things are always rather fluid in those that fluidity last until what October and we had schools coming for it saying first day at the seams and initially in that first 20 day period we'll move people will say you know what the school just didn't make its numbers we can combine some classes I know it's not ideal but we do we're going to ship this personal over here and that's going to be supported but eventually get to point we don't want to ship teachers anymore the kids are settled it becomes too disruptive so the compliance money allowed us to hire other people in many people out there looking for work but we spent that down literally it worked it was a very tight system we were very much managing it carefully and it was

[02:31:00]
got a little scary at the end but it all worked out you know we had still enough money right there that second semester and you have some weird things happen teachers come and go and programs up and going we were able to spend it and so that worked very well we'll do something similar next year so I think we'll have you know a better idea sometime in April exactly what is has what the impacts are and and and and and we'll begin collecting what the schools are turning in we do have to make sure that the meet all the legal requirements first and nobody did something you know in error or didn't think something through all the way and there's going to be a lot of horse trading as we get into the end of the budget site

[02:32:00]
having you know math and math teachers or teachers that can teach other languages are like bilingual teachers Etc and so if we have to offer the courses you know the algebra 2 and we have to offer the world languages but they're not mandated to take them and we could lose teachers there right or may have to switch to teach something like my gut is we will always have a need for Math teachers I don't think you'll be serious Math teachers whether they stay at the school will have to see the ideas they may have cut down they may not and Joseph algebra two may not be flooded with students but they still have to take for credit some math right yeah so they'll be teaching math class whether it's whether they've gotten excited and I get nervous as they start talking about math for CTE

[02:33:00]
spell specific my question is who teaches that and when we don't have that course but two is it a CTE teacher and they get CTE credit even though it says math or is it a math teacher so they get math credit and that's where the issues with licensing come in so there's some elements in this bill that if not quite worked out I'm also fascinated with the reduction of electives credits at a time that everybody says they want to see more CTE so reminder to the board you do not have to reduce the number of credits you can hold the line and I do believe many districts because of conversations I've had are going to do that so hey I hope so I hope that's something APS will do if we don't I think we need to make sure that we are really watching all of our schools you know mostly our high schools when it comes to what's

[02:34:00]
Bulls might not have that many students that choose to take Algebra 2 how many what schools are not going to be having a lot of students that decide to take a language and I think that's just something to make sure that that's not inequitable and that's not just happening at certain schools I think we need to keep a real eye on that I know that Madame President will often say when you're looking at CTE and they kind of move toward certain trades that only go toward certain people that may be look like I do and so I think it's something that we need to just watch out for but I think it's a really important to note though that under the CTE conversation is even moving towards a trades the complexity is around the math is is there because it's not

[02:35:00]
I mean Algebra 2 sometimes is definitely required especially if you're going to go into Plumbing I mean I'm just I was going to say like I'm trying to my brain is like not on Workforce anymore obviously I retire but and also like the sciences and the stem side of it if you're going to go even with like our agricultural environmental Sciences the need to have more rigor in that I think what it does is it gives an opportunity for our students to sort of explore the pathway in terms of how they want that math to look like or what they want that science to look like and sort of pushing you know pushing the way through but I agree with you superintendent Elder in terms of like you know who's going to teach some of the CTE or what is that mean and what does that look like what or is it all so that we're going to have an opportunity to push more of our students into like that dual credit side to be able to have that confidence to go

[02:36:00]
into you know the electrical horses over at at C&M with the math requirement that's their but they can step into it without having to take you know this other maybe another Math course because they're going to go into that one it's really rigorous anyway and they're already learning that math there because it's it's intense I mean it's very intense math so I don't board member Dominguez I see your hands and I'm sorry I jumped in there right after board member Mueller going um yeah yeah well I'm going to I'm going to change the the topic if you guys are finished with that yes go ahead so this question is for our for our legislative is there has there been any Avenue for

[02:37:00]
recovering any of the money the races that we gave to employees last year that were not included in the teachers raises so the question she's asking I believe is we had to take operational money to cover where raises were not provided I doubt that that will happen board member Dominguez okay so some of those raises included what social workers yes and counselors Studios anything buddy who was really not a teacher Personnel is

[02:38:00]
so we're sort of sort of dealt with last year it's it's baked into the current budget there will not be an increase to make up that but they will get the five the 5% 5% changeover a lot of salary negotiations until we know exactly where that stands

[02:39:00]
it would be premature to to make any promises and I'm certainly not just saying publicly but we really have to wait for 11:40 okay thank you all right any other comments question mark thank you so much for taking time with us I need to take I need 5 minutes so I'm going to take a quick break and then we're going to jump into our student outcomes focused governance conversation

how many fights did everyone have to walk or remember Mike still alive and we're back streaming going up and down

[02:48:00]
power of the power went out today for a couple hours so elevators are they only had one person trapped in the elevator if you got them at 6:30 yeah the all power the area but it was a number of us were on a fairly important Zoom call and we just went black and so you called in I thought that was funny okay we're ready all right so I think we are welcome and our first presentation is presentation of interim goals so excited about this so superintendent Elder and Dr Segundo and Dr Bowman welcome I'm sure we're glad to be here

[02:49:00]
find you that I know the goal tonight is to present these to you and you may go so far as to adopt them and and that would be wonderful we do understand that this could also be seen as a draft that you may want changes and we may have to bring them back up in some cases we there was some very interesting restrictions on how these had to be written they had to be written as smart goals or sport cards I guess in a gold format and there had to be three so you'll see some of these get a little tight sometimes but so when you look at goal number one which is of course percentage of the third grade students demonstrating grade level on the state English language is the percentage of first grade students identified in the Aussie Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level

[02:50:00]
the state level summative assessment is measured by iStation will increase from X in May 2023 to why in May 2026 courses that every year and we can get reports of some of the beginning middle number two will it change to second grade students the same idea second grade students over that period of time and then I'm going through is kindergarten students again using Ice Station between iStation scores and the reality of success there is a level of difficulty when we only have the one year of Masa but they are making that correlation

[02:51:00]
do believe that what you may see in successive years as we get more data and more points to deal with that those percentage we may come back and say we need to put these percentages hear the correlations may change as we get more information hope that makes sense I hope I said it right I always get high from Dr Bowman when I go it's dangerous I was trying really hard to keep my eyes about and so what I do want to remind the board is that we don't adopt these into rooms these are the terms are what our stated by the by The District staff in terms of what they're going to be using as a way to sort of gauge the inputs if you will around just where we going to the to meeting our overarching goal so we can you know we can provide some feedback for sure but

[02:52:00]
but we don't adopt them these are things that the District staff gets to to determine so is there any comments on these first three is already freaking out because we put kindergarten last song and you know sometimes not everything works even though it's a very useful rhetorical place

[02:53:00]
it's not always the case so these will be and I'm getting some coaching here thank you Ashley she's on the she's in the background here but so these will be what we will be monitoring so when we have the progress monitoring it's like looking at these interims the activities that are going through here is what we'll be looking at as a board any comments concerns well I would just ask when because I didn't look at and it's been a little while since I looked at some of the interim goals for other districts so is this kind of what they did because obviously third grade reading was a big one across the country so when you looked at you know chose these three in her own goals is this similar to what some other districts did as well do they look like yes it is similar to

[02:54:00]
some districts that is not similar to others I'm going to say it Ashley some districts didn't write three some districts didn't write it in this format so but we followed the rules cuz we're always in order

[02:55:00]
so your comment sort of beg the question then how might you have preferred to write these goals and I guess cuz there's a variety of different ways to do it and so I'm just sort of reflecting for example on you said each of these as the students identified demonstrating proficiency it could be the scenario that in second grade for these students the vast majority of them are below basic and so you can set the goal we will decrease the amount of these students at below basic or we will exactly and so I guess I'm just curious what it is that the scenario or what are other configurations that you think might make sense or might make more sense cuz I don't want to question mark So I think with this particular

[02:56:00]
find that the the we kind of thought collectively that kindergarten students like maybe it's a little too far out to start kind of connecting them with third grade from a date of perspective you know in communication in this case having all of the goals be based on a proficiency level standard it's useful for internal communication of the goal so it's it's not a bad thing or data team is working on the levels of proficiency that would need to be attained in the previous grade levels in order for us to hit whatever Target that we're looking for in the third grade namassa so we're working on analysis of that second grade and first grade so this particular goal is we would not adjusting

[02:57:00]
play kindergarten because of the the distance away from the goal and so is a follow-up then what are other ways of measuring likelihood that kindergarteners are going to progress towards third grade proficiency is it question mark I feel like I'm about to you like going to a canvas of explaining that and I would I would love to have my permission

[02:58:00]
may not be the most developmentally appropriate or correlated with third grade success and so we do know there are other things for early childhood and kindergarten that are perhaps more correlated with long-term success so I'm just curious for that geeky answer so I do want to preface by saying like I'm not this is hypothesis and speculation I'm very hesitant kind of do this without also checking back with my data folks but looking at things like the Early Childhood observation type tool you know measuring the precursors on a more on a less like I don't know not on the computer per se but kind of doing observations of the students try to see where they're coming from I do think that

[02:59:00]
apps you know it it may not be an alignment too much with we have to be careful you know whether late is it an outcome or is it an input or is it an output but in theory there are some more observational measures in kindergarten and even Pre-K that we could use to to understand where where kids are so that might be something that's a little different than than iStation and then there's an entire range of instead of using a proficiency bar that we could use scale score scale particular skill scores at different level we also the Ice Station does has the ability to look at skills within reading and perhaps if we were to be old and data about it like perhaps there are some of those skills that are more informative than others are more correlated than others the risk with doing

[03:00:00]
those other things is the is communicating how precisely how it's connected and trying to explain that to our kindergarten teachers and our early childhood teachers to say how connected is this to the thing that we want to do 3 years later so we can get more precise but then we might lose the understandability of the measure though it's always a trade-off so acknowledging that this is just our feedback for your decision I would be reluctant to put in place and interim goal that measures proficiency with an ice with a computer test for kindergarteners and so I think my preference would be to have it more based on student experience or observations of student experience or something else that we also know is aligned to later

[03:01:00]
what's appropriate for young children and really work with with our early childhood folks to really think about what what would be most appropriate assessment tool I will start it and I would also say that I heard the right questions

[03:02:00]
resources to get to the right measurement or interim goal in this case regarding you know the number of Staff being trained and principles being trained literacy and letters that letters training as an input that we could measure as well and then some specific literacy standards that could be those foundational pieces for that could be predictive of third grade proficiency

[03:03:00]
so that is the great feedback that we I mean our heads were just kind of spinning in all of this and trying to we're trying to get all this right but I didn't even think about looking at or inputs regarding structured literacy so that's something I appreciate that I think just talking to kindergarten teachers I mean they they will know what works they know if a child is going is going to be ready to read and how they're going to do I mean you can pretty much predict it pretty well that they're going to be struggling when they get to you know second or third grade so I think just really having a deep conversation with them and what they think would work best to to measure that but what I'm gathering from this too is like big district and so like how do you do that you know with with the large number

[03:04:00]
places to to assess write thank you and thank you for the feedback here you're exactly putting your finger on the issue which is how do you get the super rich detailed feedback from every single kindergarten teacher and every single kindergarten student and then compiled it all together into a format that we can present to you all and kind of and then just like understand this you know synthesis of everything so that is going to that is the challenge and we'll take the feedback and think about what people rely on random sampling there you go you know I love that question because it's part of a debate on whether we should be looking for 100

[03:05:00]
event of people being assessed and maybe we can do sampling to determine the population means of these of these populations so you know as always when you have sampling you have to ensure that your sampling selection is really random and you're not you know sampling certain folks versus other folks and I think that might have been well why the federal accountability and some of the state ones like they shy away from that but that is a that's a great idea well look at it so what I'm hearing is you want us to go back and play with three people I'm sorry I didn't get to say okay so I read ahead too so that's kind of goes to go to and I'm trying to think of an eloquent way to say this so if this is blunt I apologize but these

[03:06:00]
they they seem like they're just a restatement of the goal and I don't I mean I don't want to see again just offering feedback I want there to be some creativity maybe and how our kids are assassin I think that's already been discussed as far as the kindergarten level but I have to wonder I mean these are these are just restatements going upgrades and this has to last for five years so and I know Dr Bowman you're thinking about this because I I can't figure out how to articulate this but it seems like we just have this block and the block is just moving forward every five years of the same students if you've got a kindergartener that same kindergarten or first grade second grade third grade

[03:07:00]
I just think that there can be more assessing the exact same thing every single time and so these seem sterile to me also reading forward I know we're not there yet but interim gold 2.3 is literally a restatement of the goal it's measured with Ice Station what you're saying there so we did actually think about that and we we did debate whether whether the intent of these interim goals was to look at a cohort type of situation like you were describing where you know just the first year you check the kindergarteners and then you checked first grade and then you see how they do and second and so on but ultimately we decided this this is not following a cohort it's every year we're looking at the kindergarten of that

[03:08:00]
every year we looking at the first grade every year we're looking at the second grade and while you know comparing the grade levels to each other over time might be useful for our internal purposes and trying to see how did this cohort do for the purposes of this goal it's we want the first grade this year and next year and the following year to improve we want the second grade this year next year the following year to improve the other bit is that these interim goals are explicitly not supposed to be 5 years old either so and I don't know if this in this draft that all of the dates kind of yes some of the dates apparently got goofy but I'm looking about no more than three years on each of these and rationale is if we're going to report out on the progress for making towards meeting the goals we sort of have to assess where they are in terms of meeting the goal

[03:09:00]
the other issue and it was brought up here earlier is it's like the kindergarteners so the tool the observation was fantastic but that means somebody has to take that tool and enter it somewhere into a format that that we can be disseminated disaggregated across a huge database cuz it's not just a couple of kids were testing here it's not a couple of kids were assessing and looking at it it's a lot of bodies we could potentially I guess ultimately if we modified in her goals in the future look at smaller cohorts and do what you suggested as far as sampling

[03:10:00]
do we think we'll be useful and doable are important so to that point how useful and durable do you think these goals are that you have right now are girls so terrible we can execute them at least like this and go for we there's some chicken and three we can do it and then there will be some conversation I'm sure when we get to the guardhouse remember I think has so I want to go back to

[03:11:00]
it to the kind of the way we measure Pre-K because Pre-K has very similar like the ergs and they have the rubrics that they have to go through and we enter it throughout the year to show growth in progress what did we use something very similar to that because we already have that tool that was created absolutely correct yes yes so there is a bit I'm aware that we we do have a tool it is supposed to be used kind of District white we have not looked into you know Insurance whether you know 100% of kids are being assessed in it and then it also means we haven't looked at the data for this purpose yet but it would be something that we would have we would go look at okay cuz I again I'm just I know for sure in pre-K

[03:12:00]
I hesitate to speculate but I do believe you're right but I just I don't want to to kind of I think the bigger issue for me is I don't know where that data is entered and how its utilized so is it done on a case-by-case basis child is it something we collect is a district and again are we able to do the disaggregation since we're focused on specific subgroups I don't think we're able to do that at this moment

[03:13:00]
with that assessment there's also a timing question so when does the assessment get done if it's being taken over multiple points in time is there when do we get a snapshot that we could do something with that there's just a number of those I just don't have that information right now but it's a possibility I know we do I know it's a possibility but how appropriate it would be is something we have to wait because it would all have to align as well with my car monitoring schedule right so that to making sure that the data is available and it's which is something we need to get to so you're as proposed with what you're proposing on iStation let's just say is that it's it's more it's just readily available okay because it's required at this time and so it'll be end of the year

[03:14:00]
will that be what since it says may 2023 at the end of the year so that the interim goal as stated here and that's a very good point the interval as stated here is the end of year iStation however internally and depending on you know where the calendar works out we may also be presenting beginning of your middle of year to try to help provide contacts to where we're going to end up being at the end of the year so I think the idea with these goals is and and in some of the policies that we saw earlier is to be able to have these rich conversations with the board over you know maybe conversation focusing on Google one and having our awesome academic team talking about here's what we're doing with respect to improving literacy efforts and also have the data on literacy

[03:15:00]
the beginning of your data on a literacy perhaps and then talking about like how are you using that even though the official the interim goal goal is the thing at the end yes okay so then my other question because as a teacher I like to see growth so when I would give him my kindergarteners or first graders or second graders whatever a test at the beginning of the year just to see where they where they are then I would do it again I mean throughout the year but then again in the middle of the year and then at the end of the year and so wouldn't we when we want to see that growth by having to see that growth from the beginning of the year to the end of the year or you just because when you're taking it the end of the year Istation you did say you would be presenting beginning

[03:16:00]
so you're looking at the end of the year for that year in first grade and then it'll be a different group that next year so maybe it goes to what what number Jackson was saying as well right so I'm like what would work better for us to really see that growth that is why it can get really really complicated and quite confusing that's why you know like when we're looking at the Gold that might be the technically best goal might not be the best goal for making change in terms of humans because the human still understand the reason why it works the way it does so that's just like that's always Wayne in my head like

[03:17:00]
this might be technically better but no one's going to understand it and so it's better to have something that's technically less because it's going to motivate people to to move in the right direction with respect to your particular question the different tests have different ways that they report out their scores and you're pointing to another highly technical area iStation particularly is a test that actually predicts end of year it reports out on predicted end of your proficiency each time so if you kind of look at the scores for it or the proficiency levels the bar to be proficient just keeps going up because you are the kids learn more right other tests like the i-Ready which is the measurement for the gold too is designed so that the standard reporting that you get starts off with a low level of proficiency

[03:18:00]
in the beginning of the year and then the next interim it's going to be higher in the next interim it's going to be even higher if you're if the instruction is proceeding as planned so there's these two different philosophy there's multiple velocities but that's a core philosophy and it's something that we need to make sure that we communicate and have professional development with their teachers on so that they understand you know just because 20% of your class was proficient in the beginning of year and then the next time it's 25% you actually grew like you exceeded the kind of the expectation because the 20% was the prediction at the end and so now you moved your prediction from 20% up to 25% whereas if we were talking to them about the I ready we would need to look at another metric to say well you should have moved from 20% up to 40% and you actually got

[03:19:00]
38% so you're like a little bit below anyway we need to make sure that we have professional development and training our teachers and our staff to make sure that we are interpreting the interpreting the metrics appropriately and there's a lot of a very there's a lot of very very smart people who put who are working on those assessments and then trying to you know we need to make sure we train people on what they actually mean so we can use them to make change and improve outcomes for kids got to include training and professional development exactly and I think I mean it's one of the frustrations that I think everyone feels parents Community kids teachers

[03:20:00]
all together because depending on where students starts when competency this random number of what they're supposed to know keeps moving then you can have students that grow well over a year in a year but they are still showing as being below competency and so I mean that's I think that ties into her discussion about grade level standards and why we have to find a way of making sure we're teaching the standards but it doesn't mean we pretend that they get it you know our instruction has to match where they are but that's an acceleration that's Way Beyond I mean we're asking students that start out with some struggles and some obstacles to grow even more than

[03:21:00]
I think it's something that we need to not say it we're good with that because I don't think we're good with that but it's something that we need to understand and communicate one question and this is especially true I think with the math part although bringing up our focus on literacy in the instructions what role I mean the curriculum based assessments I mean that's what guides their instructions

[03:22:00]
Ford number for school the random sample is all we need because that's not telling that's not telling teachers what they need to know about each individual student but I am curious about what kinds of studies like now that we've we have these new math we've done our math adoption what research there is that shows the alignment between the assessments to the curriculum and the are so much of Assessments at the end of the year and what that alignment looks like and if there is a good alignment would it make sense instead of doing one more mandated District Court anyway what role could the curriculum base assessments play

[03:23:00]
it is the curriculum based assessment is the assessment that we are using and so there's not an additional one there I can also just say in my experience looking at many different interims you know date when you look at their skill scores and you look at the status of generally highly correlated with the with the with the end I could get some more cuz I've been encouraged to do so but just I want to you so so they're I'll say

[03:24:00]
assessments at their core they actually use an underlying scale that is the same they kind of map all of the standards on to one thing and then they report them all differently and so when we look at the correlations they're highly correlated I will also say we've looked at those for for the i-Ready and the Istation for our current kids and our assessments and it was the same with SBA and it was the same with Park and I have every confidence is going to be the same with the Masa the kids who do well on the one do well on the other and there's your correlation so it I'm not worried too much about that part of the train and I really do need a shot we do know that the state is about to go into an RFP for ak22 assessment to relocate iStation many other states are not

[03:25:00]
using Ice Station anymore and I know that there has been a lack of correlation between iStation and i-Ready and so we're looking at what does that then look like for our kids and even if you know if that is the case that we may be moving away from my station maybe we can speak with someone at PEB to see if we can maybe get some sort of a waiver to be able to do that already hey Google what's going to happen but we do know that these things are happening so it's important for us to be aware of them I think just for the sake of alignment because it is frustrating for a teacher and for a school when you have one assessment and another and they don't they don't go inside you know I just want to sit go ahead go

[03:26:00]
I'm just sitting here listening and and your your listing for consideration Dr Bowman and Dr Segunda what I've heard from principles and that is to quote one I deal with the human being first and and anybody who comes into this professional and I think back to maybe my second grade teacher and I'm going to speak period

[03:27:00]
one of those I think I got stuck at Olive and it was frustrating for me to not understand why I could I not get past the olive color the olive cards and she the teacher had no alternative I mean go back and do the color before it but what I was missing was background information I didn't grow up in in a household word people were talking about oh I don't know what Engineers were exposed to at the dinner table it's and I encountered this as an English teacher in high school there is a ton of background information I'm going to invoke one of our legislators

[03:28:00]
do not have that background information as a 9th grader and could not Advance right though we though I knew that this person would over time I don't know how you measure I mean that's the frustration and listening to this conversation on the other hand I am heartened to hear about this look at the lack of correlation between i-Ready and iStation or did I hear you correctly many assessments are highly correlated so

[03:29:00]
we just have to be careful yeah so that there is a challenge with respect to the training and professional development that's necessary to use any assessment to its fullest and we need training and PD and that takes investment of resources and if and in time yeah we need training but it seems to me that anything that we we do at least is going to give us sort of a snapshot of I mean I'm not afraid of the assessment and that's not the goal of it was not as a gotcha but so it's really to understand where we might still have some problem areas but where we also have you know great achievement I mean where there's where there's things that you know are going well and sort of looking back and say well what why is it going so well too but you know who still struggling and why are they still struggling

[03:30:00]
I think I mean I think it's important for us to use data that way to help just inform are the inputs working so I think that's really you know I don't have me personally I don't have any this is not my area especially around kindergarteners I don't have any any any area of expertise like if these are things that as an interim that the districts wanted to test out I think it's I think it's fine I mean and I think for us the question is a board is like as we're looking at this and they're showing us what the growth is looking like or what's happening there is it and we're monitoring is it really telling us something about achievement towards the goals of the Guardians that we've set out is it is it going to be able to form that I think

[03:31:00]
I'm a proponent April and and yes get as many kids to test a p but then don't complain because we don't have more than 50% of the kids passing the AP exam you know who cares I took apiology in high school and scored horribly but what I learned from that made me the only student at Colorado College that was an English major and had so many biology but again I think we got to be careful about looking too harshly at assessments and rather than

[03:32:00]
you just kind of offhandedly made that you were going to shut up right that you said I'm going to stop talking we are relying on you you and you and you and whenever anybody presents in front of us this says we are relying on you so if this is going to work we need you to tell us and now I'm looking at you like you need to tell us and you have to be forthright with us don't tell us what you think we want to hear please tell us what we need to hear and it's not it's for everybody who's listening to executive directors and you know when you're presenting in front of us please don't be afraid to tell us what

[03:33:00]
we need to hear that that concerns me geek out all you want with us like the whole premise of this is that we are not the experts and so if this is going to work then tell us it's going to work if it's not then tell us why and then and then do what you guys need to do but please don't feel like you have to be quiet or stunt what you're telling us or hold back or only speak within a 3-minute time frame I I I I I I I can't overstate how and it's not just what you said I mean this is this happens right we hear gosh I wish I had been able to say something please tell us what we need to hear Jackson yeah I have always been forthright and

[03:34:00]
I've always been forthright with you all I appreciate the encouragement to continue and speaking longer and I will try to I will not go back but I will try to be respectful of your time and everyone else's time all right so I think we were just on the first one and so I feel like if you're comfortable so go three the we did want to bring up one concern for you is your goal with the new graduation bill this requirement goes away so you selected a goal and

[03:35:00]
these elements are no longer supported by graduation requirement so I'm just throwing that out there if you want to reconsider the goal I don't expect you to do it tonight I don't I don't and you may say no we're fine with this but do know there's going to be a new movement on that one because it's coming out of graduation requirements a large variety of people on that particular topic because this one was a hot button in the past I like it I'm like I mean when I was at Highland I was the principal we really pushed kids that were borderline of them exposed to college curriculum we wanted them to see what it took

[03:36:00]
successful to pass a class like that and then they did it was highly satisfied for the students because they felt it was really you know challenging the done something you know International Baccalaureate those are kids who are self-selecting dual credit courses I think the more we can get there the better the industry certification is something we're trying to build because that's something we really struggle with and we're all very proud of the bilingual seal so there's a lot of elements there but I do worry about you know some kids just saying well you can't make me so as far as the first one was the percentage of high school students you dropped out of school will decrease we follow that one fairly carefully in that we really hoping that was we create the school environment where people want to be here and engage that will allow us to have more body and to get into these programs and by getting kids in these programs they're more likely to stay interim gold

[03:37:00]
32 the percentage of high school students enrolled in advanced placement and so on will increase in the smaller period of time will be watching that annually but between the first three years we'll see what's happened if things have not moved there's probably have to be an adjustment to what we're doing and then finally the specific General 33 we look at the percentage of grade 11 students who earned a credit because of course the Google so we're trying to get these guys in as early as possible and get them engaged so we can maybe you're more likely to take one credit the kids are getting into dual credit scene to fight with that a little bit that's a good one and if they have success in

[03:38:00]
you know fantastic take another one I think it really opens doors for kids sometimes when they find they can meet that standard so those are three in room goals for this particular one with the caveat that the state's going to drop a change there any comments on this one I had board member Peterson's smart integrated and more

[03:39:00]
and I'm separate from that I'm thinking of Capstone projects and of portfolios thinking of the kind of portfolio that bilingual students do for the bilingual seal I mean I think I think the goal was written in a way to reflect what we're capable of doing right now possibly not what we're capable of doing in the future so with respect to Google 3.1 I hear you on if we don't have students and they can't take the advanced courses and so certainly tracking dropout

[03:40:00]
is one potential measure and we're doing that anyway I guess I'd be curious for your thoughts or whether you considered early warning indicators like 9th grade on track or 9th grade absenteeism or other key things that are highly correlated to students staying in school and ultimately graduating because this is the goal related to postsecondary Readiness and so I might be interested in the response to that but I'll just say I personally would be more inclined for us to be tracking in our interim basis some of those early warning indicators across the system level but I'm just curious for your feedback on that well I know that Bowman I know has some some things to say on it

[03:41:00]
in my head the way this is kind of going to be operationalized is we are looking at the dropouts of school as the actual goal that we're trying to optimize but throughout the course of the year we look at the early warning indicators to help tell us who's going to be who who who is likely to drop out if we don't intervene in some manner so those indicators would be there but they wouldn't but we wouldn't like have a goal to to Target one of the indicators yes Dr Bowman and I am superintendent Elder were all kind of on board with this graduation goal because that's something we are measured on as a district and I geek out when it comes to 9th grade success and early morning

[03:42:00]
early warning indicator systems and if you remember that was the original goal that we had was to track and ensure that 9th graders successfully moved to their sophomore year on track as that measurement to predict that graduation it was a specifically about graduation but that is something definitely that is is doable and yeah it kind of is difficult to relate we can conceptualize yes you know high school students who dropped out of school will decrease how that relates to the kids need to be there in order to achieve this it's kind of a stretch for me but it's something we can do and we can look into what maybe the 9th grade looks like one more of our schools are adopt early warning

[03:43:00]
various stages of implementation and I'd say efficiency I'm not sure what our initial Baseline would be or when we'd even have that so that was a little bit of the concern of with that particular there are models you know like you said looking at percentages of knowledgeable one Pass rates and that's a big Gateway class we know attendance and then things we can collect but we were a little uncertain as a consistent about the consistency that's all and then jumping off and honestly there's going to be a lot of changes here that we're pushing a lot of change really fast and I am concerned about a little bit of people with too much so this was just one that we we went with one that we dealt with was clean and manageable a whole lot more on the schools that they were always

[03:44:00]
early warning systems and the indicators and their correlation to high school completion I would push that we tie our interim measures to what we know matters and I mean that wasn't tongue in cheek if we know 9th grade success with algebra one is a key gatekeeping factor particularly for the kids but identified in the school the other day is what we're doing to make sure make sure that our English Learners students with disabilities Etc are completing their attendance rates are improving so again acknowledging that this is just our feedback for you I would push on that sort of to board member Jackson's point to be a little bit more

[03:45:00]
Peterson's point to not think about just sort of the limitations of where we are today but where we can be if we were to put in place a robust early warning system across our high schools which sort of then leads me into my other questions related to goals 3.2 and 3.3 sort of also related to targeting like I was reading these I was wondering why not place an interim goal related to the Aussie Martinez kids on these and or why not place an interim goal related to where these courses are not currently offered to force the districts for those kids and so I know board member Montoya Cortes sort of spoken to the lack of some of these Advanced opportunities in her District I don't know his own 1234 I can never get the

[03:46:00]
why not say the percentage of students in zone South Valley who earned one and two right so I don't know but why not Target them towards the schools that actually need this so that we're not don't have a purse incentive to increase access to these courses in the schools that already have them I think from my perspective the purpose of this goal is to push the district to offer more opportunities to the kids who don't currently have them so that's sort of a general question for 3.2 and 3.3 but why not Target these in some way by student or some other way so the first and I know you have something there is that when we were trying to write these goals and we were trying to pretty hard to the guidance that we received from our counselor and

[03:47:00]
and so that's kind of what came out of here but you know giving you know hearing this feedback like you know when you have a measure that just says the district will increase the percentage of high school graduates and you do care like correctly point out we could accomplish that goal by doing it in to schools or three schools or four schools and others wouldn't be there so I do think that there is you know there's a risk of that sort of thing in any metric and we can take back the idea of you know perhaps you know perhaps this this goal could be written you know in each zone or something like that we might be able to look at the language to try to accommodate the sense that you kind of what is your your trying to bring the equity thing into it and not leave particular areas out

[03:48:00]
having a goal for each area I don't know like for each school might be able to do nothing but I'm not saying that I mean I think to the refrain when we stop writing you start interpretation interpreting my intent shall speak for myself with this call was around increasing opportunity for the students in our district who are largely Ozzie Martinez and largely Limited in certain zones of our city to have these opportunities and so again this is just the feedback but I would encourage you to think of something like the percentage of grade 11 students in zone South Valley who earn credit and at least whatever whatever whatever whatever so that's my encouragement my comments my questions sort of how you approached it but thank you and I'd like to follow up on that because I think when I saw this school to it was also sort of stretching

[03:49:00]
the percentage of high school graduates who are earning these in some of our higher-performing schools is definitely there definitely there and when I look at the South Valley Schools you can see the percentage of students that maybe are in some of this but not all of it definitely builing will see you will show up but advanced placement industry certificates dual credit I be doesn't even exist so I think it's just like how do we how do we look at this as a district so that we're starting to see that bigger picture of where that Gap is and why the Gap exists and I and and I can catch this with the story because I had an opportunity to be part of Market till you rock it wonderful young woman

[03:50:00]
it was incredibly talented but it was really interesting to me that she could not go for her bilingual seal because there weren't any AP courses offered at the school in Spanish so she can only take her AP courses in English and she wanted to have the advanced placement so she had to make that decision so she's doing a p is a beautiful candidate for sale and really wanted she said to me I find it heartbreaking and it is heartbreaking but I mean she's still she's on a track that's really great but I think it's also sort of taking a look at that in terms of how how it plays out across the zones because I agree with that across the zones in terms of where we have gaps and how how do we how do we feel that so that those subgroups that are

[03:51:00]
benefiting from an opportunity that has traditionally been part of their community so thank you for that for president how you mentioned or someone mentioned some some some clear kind of feedback on these ideas of the different subgroups and also looking at the opportunity Gap there in terms of forsaking patterns and whether we can write a goal that or interim goes to kind of include that somewhere to accommodate the will of the park I think we have some good ideas there I have a question

[03:52:00]
and I'm sure you know Dr Bowman when do most kids in what grade do most kids drop out like more kids is it like 10th grade 11th grade I don't think it's by grade as much as is by age so what age is probably around 16 to 17 is when we start to see it but as someone mentioned if you by the end of 9th grade if you haven't hit certain metrics the chances that you are going to drop out three years later is pretty high that's what I mean there's no classification cuz I've been struggling to get out of that grade and they're just too far behind and that's when I started looking at GED or what are my other options they'll come to you and have that conversation so like when I'm looking at

[03:53:00]
interim goal you know 3.1 I would also say like looking at those early the early warning indicators that the early warning systems and I know that superintendent Elder Elder said that they are at different levels at different you know high schools but I mean I think that that is like really really important to affect I mean I just think that is key to keep kids from dropping out so I mean that you know keep them from dropping out but what is my I mean I I know like algebra one is a big one and then once the kids are a couple of you know there's so many credits behind they just give up because they're like there's just no way that I could possibly do it I mean I don't know if there's a way to like focus on you know how many credits are they behind at this time maybe that that might be something that we look at I don't know I think you asked a really

[03:54:00]
good question regarding you know when do kids drop out and there are kids who drop out officially and there are kids who drop out unofficially before they actually right now so and what we see is that happens in middle school and that's where we're seeing our job so in working with better better communication to our students and families in elementary and in middle school regarding you know what a credit means why you have to earn them what graduation requirements are and then building off of these goals to really give our kids a strong foundation in reading and math will help that because a lot of it is perpetuated failure lack of confidence bad attendance which makes them feel like they're not a part of that Community anymore when they try to reintegrate and so there's so much work going into all of those

[03:55:00]
things simultaneously and you know I think looking at you know that the number of credits that a student earns at the end of their ninth grade year is predictive I'm looking at how many students pass their 9th grade math class some kids are taking Algebra 2 and 9th grade summer taking geometry so what does that look like I'm not too concerned with those kids but passing that algebra one class increasing the number of courses offered in schools regarding the school see that will be something that would be a little that be a little bit harder for the adults to have to do and I can tell you that having taught at a school in the southwest part of town that didn't have a gifted education class at an elementary level that's wrong and so I think that you all have to look and go where do we where do we have AP classes

[03:56:00]
IB classes like where do we I think that would be something and that's why that Southwest you know I can tell you yeah I think that's something that you all would be a little bit more difficult for you to have to make sure that you're doing as well as you can so it's a little bit more you know equalized across the district cuz you can't take a class if it's not offered but how do you not know the kids wouldn't take it if you didn't offer them I don't think that's difficult I'm really actually I think you can do that very I think I think by establishing these goals it's giving us a lot to be able to work from and so by creating these interim goals and in collecting the feedback from you all I think it's really going to give us some very clear steps as to how to increase to achieve that goal but absolutely I mean like superintendent Elder said when he was

[03:57:00]
pushing kids to be confident to take the AP class and maybe they won't pass the test but pushing them and encouraging them to take that test and I know it's difficult for some teachers because they want to have high Pass rates which means not all the kids take the test but at the same breath we're giving our kids that opportunity and that challenge to see what they can do and to move into another class and try it because they succeeded at something at a high level so I think that we have some really good things here that we can work from thank you what is kind of also pointing out and this is where you know I think we're starting to like the conversation is really rich conversation and the purpose of this the training in the government is to get adult behaviors to change and I think that what you just heard with the superintendent and

[03:58:00]
just by stating this girl out there and having some of these interims in order for us to accomplish it we're going to have to do many if not all of the things that you're describing the the doctor's good is talking about and that superintendent in superintendent Elders talked about so it's it's kind of fun and I think we're like getting into the details of like oh here's the other thing we're going to have to do and here's the other thing we have to do and here's what else we're going to look at and I think we're getting into the implementation phases of things and so I'm not the track that's going in my head after we were going to go and look at like take this feedback is do we need to adjust the goal to accomplish those things or will having the goals that we have for the behavior that we need to have happen happen so that's kind of the the judgment and we're going to have

[03:59:00]
thank you any other comments on this one no no I was just Echo the looking at the zones I would dare to Guess that while Zone 4 has a high level of advanced placement I'd be and will credit you probably don't have a high level of Industry certification or bilingual seal so it's kind of the opposite right like look across all the zones what's lacking and push where it needs to be pushed probably same thing for mine we don't have any industry certifications to get up by Linkin seal so yeah I'm going to go for one

[04:00:00]
because there's a lot of struggle with what exactly this looks like and unfortunately some of the people who are involved in this for various reasons are currently out and so we're a little the people are relying most on to give us information or not available to us at the moment but what we really as we thought about this we've heard over and over and over again Middle School is the area that we're losing these kids and so in the interim we really want to focus on 67th and 8th grade so basically what you see is a repeat of what the tools measuring but we really want to take a peek at middle school because we know behaviorally it is the most extreme we know emotionally it is the most traumatic everybody so we've seen

[04:01:00]
and some of the schools were there really working on restorative practices and they're taking time to do circles would it take in time to do meditation they're seeing some interesting results and so we really felt for the first element of this will do it across the board but there's kind of a feeling that the elementary schools at some point the kids will grow into the language of the assessment as well and understand it better I mean I understand they'll be pointing to the Emojis and stuff but I think we can offer to Elementary to middle school this next couple of years so that's why 678 really following up and really really kind of wondered if we could take one element like South perseverance or

[04:02:00]
regulation and separate it and measure that as a specific growth of you like to do a cohort but I don't know that the tool allows us to do that and that's where we sort of struggled with not having the person there that we needed to ask the question of so these are the interim goals really focus in on middle school because we have had several discussions that we kind of Middle School gets lost right we focus on Elementary we focus on high school and its last in the middle so I saw what you did there any other comments go ahead so I also appreciate the focus on middle school and I agree with the rationale and I had sort of the same reaction as I did for the prior goal so why not focus

[04:03:00]
play Kanye Ozzie Martinez students or some subpopulation of those students or Zone and so this is our soft skills and arguably engagement goal so where where or which kids most need to develop these goals so because we know that these skills are inextricably linked to knowledge acquisition and learning these are absolutely essential to ensure that kids are making goals one and two so should we target some resources and Target our interim goals on some of those students fundamentally okay with this I do know of some work in other districts that have actually looked at or crosswalk some of their seal data with some of their achievement data and other data so if you look at kids who have some of the lowest seal ratings some of the highest discipline

[04:04:00]
highest absenteeism rates and lowest performance like there is where you see the kids that you need to focus so on so again I'm okay with this but I think as you begin to collect data it would be really helpful to look at some of those crosswalks and disaggregation to see like wow is it really Native American 7th grade girls that we need to focus on and let's track that but I'm okay with the middle school focus and just acknowledging that this is a start and I think that we have opportunity to tweak this the other thing I will say is I'm not sure what you were referring to with Emojis but I do believe that the Rhythm or tool is not validated for this type of measurement so I would encourage you some of the validated tool like Panorama which is validated for the early grades as well so you don't have to rely on emojis okay more of a daily use thing

[04:05:00]
it was a little awkward but I really appreciate how the team like everyone came together you know but we do care about middle school so whenever whenever we get this up and running we're going to start looking at middle school first the disaggregation just to be completely for free right now giving

[04:06:00]
but we don't have a tool and we don't know what the date is going to look like and we don't know what abilities we're going to have I figured it would be prudent to not kind of over-promise that we could divvy it up that way and I do know that the book of these tools they can all like handle grade levels that we can we can do this and then another couple years we look at look at it and can write another and from Google based on what we know at that point again thinking for the future that we want to Envision so lots of districts are collecting the state laws of districts are targeting it in a whole bunch of different ways so yes I totally fine with like let's get started but really want to push for us to focus our efforts on where they're most needed and not let current status be an obstacle

[04:07:00]
okay go ahead just real quickly the the cohort of students in Yazi Martinez that we kind of overlooked as we've talked or students with disabilities and just anecdotally as I talked to Middle School teachers that is a group of students I think who in middle school they hit middle school and they're huge barriers to them finding their way and so there's there are many things demonstrated behaviorally language was all sorts of ways that I think is we look at the interim goal for students with disabilities

[04:08:00]
are a group of students we need to really keep in mind in a way that that we probably don't need to as specifically it either Elementary or high school but especially in middle school and I know I understand you know we've had the discussion about the tracking Behavior suspension all of that stuff is an adult input outcome not a student one because it's so subjective and so inconsistent and all that but at the same time as we get more student-generated outcome part of what I think we need to be looking at in alignment is where how is that aligning with suspension rates and disciplinary action rights I just kind of

[04:09:00]
because that's something that we've talked about like often is I just when it comes to kids getting suspended or expelled or they get in trouble for whatever reason and get sent to the principal and all that I just don't think that that's something that we should be measuring here because I think almost all of that is about the adults for the most part of course there's some things that maybe are about the child but for the most part they really are about the are about the adult and I mean I would like to be able to look and go okay this teacher has suspended this many kids no matter what school they went to or there's principal has done this no matter where they are because then you could know that is really totally and completely about the about the adult and not about the student and so I think that's something that we

[04:10:00]
look at too much cuz I really do think that's an adult that could be part of our guardrail Pieces Just making sure that that's not occurring but I don't think we use that I don't think any more suggestions wraparound Sports at all schools will increase to why so we know that we want to look at things like our you know kids getting access to services are kids getting

[04:11:00]
access to needed supports the problem with Community wrap around and wrap around they look different in every school and again the community wraparound supports they select certain schools and sometimes they selected on demographics maybe not total student needs so it's going to look a little different so a little we're still trying to wrap her hands around how we put this in a student now comma but I would think things Richard grab some suggestions of things but I do want to start measuring you know how many supports we provide how many times we do provide interventions they just do so much and we don't always have an ability to quantify the community schools have gotten quite clever at what they do and collecting what they do and what I

[04:12:00]
play out to the legislature quite often and I say this in our board meetings and you've heard me say it is it's sometimes hard to quantify what the community school does but if we destabilize aren't we destabilize if we stabilize a family in middle in elementary school what's the long-term outcomes and you can't measure what he might have done or what she might have done but the kids successful later on is it because those Community Schools stabilize things at a certain point and that's the point so that's what we're trying to measure their guard rail to is just simply the percentage of students who have access to sale programming will increase and then interim among students so decreased 40% to pick up percentage by 6665

[04:13:00]
she had to have three so if you didn't have those restraints on you how would you have written these internals differently I don't know I don't know that we would have I'm not sure about what I think God real one might have looked a little different and I don't know how to say it would have looked a little different because there's a lot of conversation around that but because trying to measure student outcomes is going to be a little tricky

[04:14:00]
you know based on how we designed the guardrail or thinking of the guardrail do these are these measuring what we thought in our head that are they capturing what we what we thought we were after I was just so I think there's some examples of other things that are tracked like the percentage of students who access Mental Health Services are the percent of Staff who are trained and certain things so understanding the constraints placed upon you by the council I think it would be helpful for you to cross collectively to think about what is really

[04:15:00]
what are we really need to be looking at to make sure that we're meeting these goals and what are some other things that we can track sort of to board member Jackson's point with respect to interim government 1.1 I'm not sure I understand the based on student outcome data beginning of your middle of your end of year and how that's tied to community based in around supports but I will say for me the purpose of the school was to make sure that students who need supports have supports and that we're allocating them equitably meaning that not everybody gets the same thing and that's what Equity is is is is is students get what they need when they need it and I hear a lot about the push for equality and that everyone in the district gets the same thing and we try to spread our resources too thin by focusing on a quality so acknowledging that every school every student needs some baseline of support some kids and a lot more and so

[04:16:00]
this also sort of relates to the questions that I had about the budget last year in terms of programs and resources and electives and support how do we know how the Yazoo Martinez kids in particular were affected by those cuts so for me it's what do we know about what which wraparound supports are offered where and to whom so that may mean that we need to have some sort of different data collecting data collection process but to know you know this school they have I don't know after care and at the school they don't or whatever it may be but I think just that's what I would like to see with interim number one so I don't really understand the base on student data other than Ashley told you you had a basement on student outcome data it was a general term that we used as a catch-all for example you talk about Mental Health Services

[04:17:00]
do I look at the community schools in the model that they use they collect a lot of data around how many referrals they put out how many families did they feed How many pairs of shoes did they hand out how many backpacks school drives in our mind those are student outcome data we can collect wide variety when you talk about for example let's just focus down on counseling we track where we have Services provided by Community providers we track how often they meet I believe last year they were questions about how good are they what what's the outcomes but we're not we can't collect that we're not privy to it it's it's it's it's private but we know how we can tell you how many hours of service are being provided by each provider in what's happening at each school and there is an attempt made to push

[04:18:00]
those resources to schools that need at the problem that they're facing today is like you said everybody needs it so there are ways for us to collect already collect the data that that you're referencing that was more of a catch-all I think we can certainly tighten that up if that's what you're suggesting because what I'm hearing you describe so again like I'm fine with measuring inputs if our kids need more inputs need more social workers need more mentorship need more whatever and we want to make sure that that's getting to the kids that don't currently have it I'm trying to tracking that so I just feel like this one was for me wasn't quite getting at looking at the equitable distribution of resources those resources being wrap around supports so that's the I'm giving you there

[04:19:00]
and I just I kind of I want to follow up on that because on the guard rails itself it's really around I mean what I think two are the behaviors that we need to change so that we can protect that right I mean so I don't I don't think we have to have a student outcome either on that it could be an outcome on that particular school or that you know the number of schools that increase their you know their their their support from what I mean but just increase doesn't mean anything to me either because here's what I've seen to is that I think I love our community schools and I love all the work that they're doing sometimes the quality of those supports are not always on

[04:20:00]
Target I think some of them I think some of them may miss the Mark I do because I think a lot of it also has to do with it inequity that just exists in the city with regard to access to some quality wraparound services so we don't have you know there's definitely mental health deserts throughout the state but there's definitely mental health deserts within the city itself and so the quality of those services that we are providing to our students is also sometimes not not at the level that it needs to be and some and I'm I worry about how that in equity looks across the district you know again zoning how it looks for some areas you know I will say in the South Valley one of the things that we're really really

[04:21:00]
shut up is we have and we've been able to address the concern around access to you know Healthcare now cuz we've actually increased access to some really good Community clinics and such and so there's there's definitely more of that but the access to really strong and I think to culturally and linguistically relevant Mental Health Services is just non-existent I mean I just don't think it's it's even I don't I don't think it's there but anyway I mean I'm struggling with it a little bit too because I don't want I don't think we need to focus on just the student outcome I think we need to we need to focus on you know how we're not going to allow that to happen and so how does that happen at a school site level you know it's like I don't I don't really know either I wish I knew the answer to that one I'm getting tired my brain is like

[04:22:00]
1.1 how much can we really increase I mean what is reasonable like what can happen like how many more wraparound services or supports can you really even add realistically and and we absolutely struggled with creating and from guardrails because when we looked at other districts and from guardrails not all of them were written in like a smart goal format and so kind of are thinking was the guard rails that are put in place are basically like the Ten Commandments like the superintendent shell not do this and for us it's we're going to make sure that he doesn't do that by doing this as you know but that's it's not about increasing or decreasing its

[04:23:00]
putting something in place when sure that he doesn't you know break his commandment so if this was really challenging for us to just put it out there so when you're struggling we struggled as well so we are very open to feedback period I know that Ashley is in the ethers too if you want to weigh in on that Ashley you're welcome to but

[04:24:00]
let's move on to number two and we'll give her a chance to to tee up if she wants to tee up on that so guardrail to the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably a guardrail won the percentage of fully staffed period priority schools will increase from next to why over 3 years and I'm going to send it to operational school-based resources from 0% and may 2026 and this was an interesting one that I unfortunately but the percentage of unspent restricted and operations from May 2023 to why in May 2026 so every year we hit percentages and just don't spend the money or apartment

[04:25:00]
sometimes I think that's a little bit of being afraid that you know the great water leak of 2023 is going to be this money to do something with it and sometimes it's just really hard so we're really going to be working hard with the schools and in District apartments because we're doing is we're collecting that data how often do we not expend everything we get pretty damn close but there's oftentimes areas Pockets so we're going to try to decrease that so that we can maximize the ability to provide the services that you need to do this I was pretty clever cuz this is the one that I wanted to so I'm going to ask all three questions that I have on these cards and you guys can answer and so the first one is the

[04:26:00]
percentage of fully staffed priority can you just kind of explain what that means like examples of the construction on those priority schools which will have the highest concentration is students and then the next 2.25

[04:27:00]
how does the percentage of unspent funds what is it what are you meant what are you trying to address there so as though she'll be okay with me so what this is trying to address kind of like the finance bid is we do a lot of energy and effort trying to put together a budget that reflects the resources that we think we need to serve the students that we need to serve and so when those

[04:28:00]
is budgeted resource resources that were intended to provide the services go unspent that means that those students did not receive what we had planned to offer and that's that's the general idea of course there's always things that happen of course there are you know like the water leak the supplies you didn't need to order but sometimes you know there might be stopping situations or maybe there was training that you could have offered but you didn't or maybe there were you know counseling hours or something that were budgeted but then just not provided and the idea here is that we would we would try to track that and try to like try to ensure that crossed the district those resources are being spent like we budgeted and so that leads me to my next question

[04:29:00]
I'm bringing up with board member Gonzalez said about Equity is that is the definition is that every student gets what they need and so across the district right so how do philosophically or actually how do these three address the the guardrail that every student because I think you guys will remember originally with this card real to I wanted it to say something specifically for all student needs and so I guess my question is how how do these three equitably address the needs for all the students in my head the court will be is going to be the work that we do with the IRS

[04:30:00]
I am certain going to be coming back to going to be the subject of much discussion within our leadership and also with you as well so that's gargle 2.2 so we first have to figure out how to distribute the resources then you have the interim number one which is addressing the thing that we already know there's issues with Staffing and picking particular schools and trying to focus on making sure that their staffed is another is it's really important and it's also tied to the interim 2.3 which is once we have allocated the resources we need to ensure that they are being spent in the areas that they are needed and what that looks like specifically what we've noticed is we have many funds like the family income index the address funding all the title funds and some schools get a greater amount from the state of those funds and somet

[04:31:00]
they have so much money that they don't know what to do with it they don't have a strategy behind it and so this is going to force us to really work with them to come up with a plan to help support the use of those funds and to to spend them down in a meaningful way and also you know when this was something that we kind of struggled with or that all just speak for myself I struggled with was when it says the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably and when we say all students going towards your point board member Jackson regarding like what about kids schools that aren't title one but they have Title One kids in them you know like having principals identify their their kids and how are they how is each School

[04:32:00]
sourcing and supporting those kids differently how you put that in a smart goal I don't know but those were some of the things that we can do this to ensure that this can happen when we were wondering is we're going to look at this overtime and see if we find some Trends and if there's a way we could talk to the people involved and say look the trend is you're not getting it spent maybe you need to rethink how you're spending the money so that it does get towards ultimately need to be with the students go ahead I have a quick question about that are those a

[04:33:00]
are there kinds of resources I believe the answer that is yes but I think it depends on the situation so remember last year we made the great reduction lot of that was left to eat that was sitting waiting to be filled and we just took it and that's after how many months have those ft sat there how many years and that's the new reality of some of this I mean we talk about you know Staffing priority schools that's a great good I think it's very powerful it's going to be hard as hell and back to reality you know some of this comes down to honestly when we talked about money not being spent it's hard to move money out of line items and it's hard because it's bureaucratic right and their state law so for example you can't move money out of the teacher

[04:34:00]
instructional line item into an administrative line item without an act of God it has to be run through a very intense process that it has to go to the public education department and they review it for at least 9 weeks and they have to prove it and then the money has to be moved and it's just it's really hard so a lot of times what we're going to try to talk to people is look every up at the end of the year and you've got this money left over maybe instead of putting it in this line item maybe it needs to be over here in this line item so you can do more with it or you seem to be done and I think giving people the freedom to make that decision will be helpful it's a little scary sometimes too I really want it here because someone may come when you have to eat that's the most obvious someone makes a time maybe we have to think about that go ahead Jose

[04:35:00]
could you give a more specific example where you might ask a principal to give up the FTE and do what I'm not necessarily saying I'd ask him to give up and FTE I might move the money the line item by training you might buy something the way you do your budget Joan I know that it's a big joke among principles or at least it used to be that the end of the year we just buy rings and Rings easy to buy it doesn't go bad and teachers love it

[04:36:00]
Disney paper so but why were you buying so much paper because you had money left over I mean you used it but maybe there was a better use of that money right so I'm going to interject here for a second so for us it's like looking at our guard rail and you know what it is we're trying to protect and making sure that we have these interims that are that they're interpreting them well enough I guess it's like you know because these are the ones that are the hardest I think because for us it's really either they are value statements but it's really harder to to get to the point or or what we're going to look at when so we come together and we're monitoring these will this information give us

[04:37:00]
enough you know that we that we at least have been able to like address it's somewhat addressing what we hope that to get out of that particular guardrail and I get it I mean I don't think we're going to be absolutely perfect I mean I think we're trying to to fit ourselves into a structure to that's still kind of foreign to us so it's like it's not coming together as easily as we thought so do you have like for like interim 2.3 you already have an idea where this is happening where there's unspent or that happens more often right or the schools that sell them have spent but have more need than the money that they get so you already have that information right not at my fingertips to finance department

[04:38:00]
this was something we would want to consider as as a potential guardrail but that's something that's measured that you're going to be able to measure again it comes down to who has the time to do it but it's doable again I really this one I know is kind of complex and it's it's it's it's kind of hard to see it for one I think we'd like to try it again I feel better about you so let's jump to three

[04:39:00]
is what's causing me some heartburn because what is STL programming mean and SEL programming is something that is commonly misinterpreted and as I've said before sometimes teachers sometimes people think that if you give kids a high five as they walk into the building that's SEL but what SEL and I social emotional academic development intertwined needs to be integrated fully into the fabric of the school into the curriculum into the PD into everything I wrote a paper on it and so I guess I just struggle because you could a school can adopt some really crappy Seal program and implement it and when I see really crappy there's a lot of bad stuff out there particularly for our student population and if we're talking about things like improving self-efficacy yourself regulation there's frankly a lot of stuff that really pushes a really dominant culture orientation on kids

[04:40:00]
play force them to act a certain way and so I wouldn't want us to just sort of allow that to be adopted and forced upon our kids and I think in some instances there's also confusion where people misinterpret SEL as discipline and so it ends up being kids forced to stand in quiet lines in hallways like they're in prison and so I would just propose that maybe we either tighten the definition of seal programming in some way or shifted towards something that we know we are already committed to like restorative justice so something like the percentage of Staff in buildings who have been fully trained on restorative justice programs increases from XY or something like that because I do think it is more about staff capacity to really understand that they're creating for our kids than it is about just adopting

[04:41:00]
so I was just kind of stuck on that as we were moving and just wanted to come back to it so that's again it's just feedback for what it's worth you know and that might be one to that could be focused since you're going to be doing the focused piece at the middle school right so how does it how does that guardrail get protected just for the middle school or like restorative justice system I definitely agree with like even that culturally linguistically appropriate or students that were hoping to to work with

[04:42:00]
and I would also add the your comment about training appropriately training staff I think we need to have a high-quality trainer I think the black community has poured a ton of ya knows this knows this well and I would hope that we would rely on a quality trainer to train our staff and if I met we met today regarding restorative practices and implementation within our district and some of the disruption of the pandemic what we are working on is a reboot because I

[04:43:00]
feel like we have pulled from many different restorative practice people philosophies and there's a lot of confusion ultimately around restorative practices what they are principals and teachers want practical guidance on how to implement that I feel that we need to be able to do that for them so know that we're planning a complete reboot of restorative practices and what that looks like and looking at what has the work that's already been done and do we want to continue in that direction or braid it with something different but I agree I think the greatest challenge that I have realized is the size of our district and to get people trained in a meaningful

[04:44:00]
way takes a lot of time and so we're trying to come up with a plan as far as a a roll out of what that could look like starting with our principals and assistant principals Dean so that they have that clear understanding of what they need to do to set up their schools for Success come the fall what needs to be up on the walls what messaging needs to happen What behaviors need to ship adults and then as far as the classroom as well how to teach set up their classroom in that meaningful way what practical strategies what kind of responses do they give and have one organization or person will we believe their philosophy is aligned with what we believe is best for kids to leave that work right now we have had so much from so many different people

[04:45:00]
that I need a timeout and reboot so that we can be a little bit more clear so we literally met today to talk about that we were going to use we don't know yet cuz we're collaborating to get the the big picture but we're moving in that direction and as far as like I know our district has already purchased Rhythm so is it something that you know we're looking to implement everyday in classrooms to get that understanding of how kids are feeling that day so teachers know how to respond kids get those many lessons like I don't know and I think maybe that's where this was one of those areas where number one the culturally linguistically appropriate

[04:46:00]
that is absolutely essential to finding the people who understand the community and kids and what is appropriate is has to be a part of that and just the other the other pieces we are huge District so it takes time to implement but once it is done it will impact an enormous number of students in a really positive way so it's worth it's worth the task worth the effort okay so this is a this is actually the easiest probably in terms of understanding basically we talked about not allowing different diagnostic models they went in looked so using

[04:47:00]
that model going and look so we'll look at the use of highlight grade level high quality structure drills right now we know where 30% from the number will increase it to another number by 2026 materials that are cultured linguistic responsive will increase as well I need to get that Baseline number of what we currently provide and then we'll see what we can do to bump that up and then again guardrail 3 what is going to look who's differentiating Who's acting different different because that was another thing that you know it could be examples of indicate it doesn't necessarily have to be there at 10:20 a.m. I'm only getting somebody at that moment but it seems to me it's very easy to show I am differentiating

[04:48:00]
I'm thinking it has to be the materials that are offered because we could get into classroom libraries

[04:49:00]
you know these teachers go out and spend a lot of money on their own books and they build pretty neat classroom libraries I don't know how we measure in that but those kids are accessing that I think it needs to be looking at the the basic core materials the district is providing are we making an effort to provide materials that are linguistically responsive yeah so my question was more on the wording I understand that we can't measure everything that kids have access to we can control what we're offering are we wanting to track the percentage of students so that's the students changing what you have is in your denominator the percentage of students with access to instructional materials or we measuring percentage of instructional materials that are culturally responsive relative to overall instructional materials

[04:50:00]
I mean I'm just thinking out loud would that be hard to measure the students that have access and but easier to measure not the access it's the offered so if El Dorado adopts super awesome culturally responsive and Rio Grande doesn't that doesn't solve our issue so we can offer everything so my question is do we want to look at students who have access versus looking just a percentage of materials relative to materials overall let us think about that I think we're trying to wrap our head around how but it's an interesting concept yeah and I guess it's sort of what is the goal here is it just to offer more stuff overall or is it to make sure that kids actually like the kids okay so that's fine so then on one 3.3 I had the same I had a concern around differentiation techniques

[04:51:00]
that's differentiation for the good of kids and not differentiating content to people owe grade level and so I was thinking of the something like the percentage of teachers who have access to plcs focused on looking at student work protocols focused on differentiation or something like that so really much more focused on how we're preparing teachers to differentiate not just observing differentiation and we just acknowledge that I know that's very related to guardrail 5 which is sort of the resources and supports that we're giving teachers and so that's where PD shows up and so it's sort of two things when I'm worried about differentiation and to what end and then two is just as we think about PD that's offered can we push ourselves to think a little bit more about what types of PD and so we've talked a little bit and I think it was recently about

[04:52:00]
teachers don't use plcs with a protocol to look at student work and to deeply examine standards and so like should we push ourselves to make sure more of that is happening so that's just some concerned about differentiation here and really what else we could measure then just classroom observations but I'll have more to say on pdp's in a possible changes when we get to Carter 5 okay any other conversation on this we're losing our steam I know we're losing our steam we're definitely I think I even before I did have it underline so what are these what are the different different techniques I don't I don't understand what that is so maybe you didn't know

[04:53:00]
so you see a child and that what works with one child and you're teaching him the same thing I know a differentiation is I'm just saying what are the like how are you going to measure a different a technique that was my specific I know what differentiation is but it's question you have to remember that not everybody has plcs we're pushing for change yeah we're pushing for change but again it's going to come down to that 11:40 in terms of what we can afford they're still going to be some Financial limitations as much as Everyone likes to think that we've just got a golden building here that I could sell and pay it all it's just not

[04:54:00]
so I would love to see more collaboration for those Elementary people they deserve it they need it hopefully with the time that we're going to build the Bible be able to buy that and then then we'll be able to do it so that and middle school right now and I think guardrail 3.3 is just going to be hard to I think it's going to be very hard to do just to look at the guardrail would be a good message for not excluding apparent legal guardian student Community engagement

[04:55:00]
so guardrail why the number of times District leadership meets with an Advisory Group to provide information and get feedback on the implementation where contemplating keeping that advisory committee that we have with the tuned and trying to see how they could maybe they'll stick for a little while and if they're not all willing maybe we can find some other Replacements but we like the concept and guardrail or to the time they use a district leadership speaks with families to assure voice and District Operations and decision-making that impacts do not come to increase from 0.00 * 368 and family engagement yes

[04:56:00]
I know this is these are district level goals but I'm I'm just trying to think if there's a way of of integrating in things like participation in community school councils participation in pta's ptosis and then the other the other you know a couple of years ago before things to work with but we are trying to just a couple of tires

[04:57:00]
I think they're trying to go back but I think going back to you know how do we get it into the schools like I think that is Our intention but these aren't just different like these are going to be infused so when it says you know what does parent Guardian student Community voice engagement in school and District Operations so as we go in and meet with principals we're going to be focusing on asking them these questions how do we get them to start thinking about that so that they're not doing things that then him out and make sure that we're all moving in the same direction the only thing I was going to add is on guardrail 4.3 and I think it's like going back to some of our earlier conversations about also looking at it

[04:58:00]
phone wise or also subgroup because I think we need to take a look of like where it's absent in terms of that participation in that quality education and family engagement survey anything

[04:59:00]
what's the district to think differently about staff engagement and so what I see here are sort of the static already existing staff engagement opportunities largely PD you know plans for PD and instructional Council and so I think what I had more in mind was like really pushing us to think about teacher leadership opportunities and so as we're going to put in place as you are putting in place an entirely new instructional framework can you establish a teacher Leadership Council that actually contributes to the scope and sequence development of curriculum development and delivery of PD development of Assessments for untested subjects so I so I guess I would just push to think a little bit about that what are other teacher leadership opportunities because I think there's lots of really cool examples and other districts where they really have engaged teachers as professionals and some of these content development pieces

[05:00:00]
and since I made my prior comment about PLC participation and really digging into some of the work with standards and looking at student Works student work I just think that's another potential frame for thinking about PD so you have the percentage of teachers and staff who received professional development on newly launched or relaunch instructional materials and so I think just really pushing to think about what is that PD and how can it be job embedded like plc's and not just sit and get because we know the job and that is what works not the sit and gets so if I were to make a change it would be the percentage of teachers and staff who participated in job embedded professional development opportunities Etc increases so that was just sort of my initial feedback and just kind of speaking to the intent of what I was thinking that this girl five in addition is what I'm hearing is that

[05:01:00]
times programs are developed within the district and then principles or staff or just said now go do it but they aren't given any direction on how that is actually supposed to happen and and I don't I don't see but correct me if I'm wrong I don't see any of the interim guardrails actually addressing like how when implementation happens how do you then support the staff so that they have you know even just the Baseline direction from from the from the administration is to how this is supposed to be implemented in what way what goals are you why did you implement this program what goals are you hoping to get out of this program instead of here's a program you know go do it so if it's if that intense is in here please tell me where show me

[05:02:00]
cuz I too am getting tired but I think just to address what I thought the intent of guardrail 5 was and I agree I was looking at it from that perspective in that we want to get if we if we are going to implement a program or a procedure in our district that we need to make sure that we have a lot of stuff voice the professional development needs to be provided and scheduled and essential materials in human resources to implement that program or procedure with Fidelity so I know that with guardrail 5.1 at school sites the instructional council's make a lot of decisions for the schools and for their particular school and so we wanted to increase not just those who are on the instructional

[05:03:00]
cancel but more staff when they're wanting to implement something maybe at their particular School site when we as a district are planning to implement something that we're getting staff attending the instructional Council meetings to provide feedback to them to make sure that we're getting that staff voice that was where guardrail 5.1 came in 5.2 looking at what not if School comes to us and says we want to implement this program we need a sustainability plan to so that we can know that we have the appropriate funding high quality PD and materials and human resource in place so that we can do it well and then the third one teachers and staff who receive professional development on newly launched or relaunched

[05:04:00]
will increase so right now professional development in many cases is optional and teachers don't not all teachers take advantage of that and so we're trying to shift that so that you know we are providing multiple opportunities it comes back to that time which is really tough in a large district and when you have let's you know just say one I ready is coming to do training like how do you do training with so many teachers to go over so much information inequality way and so I think that was how we were thinking about this guardrail and we do like I'm still learning stuff but I know that we do have the teacher leader Network and the

[05:05:00]
TLS within our schools that you know we their meeting and and working as well so it's leveraging all of those resources and if we need to do it differently then we'll do it differently but again it's it was more focusing on we're not going to do something unless we can do it well and these are the things that we're going to focus on you know and again I think looking at this specially like on the last one the percentage of teachers and staff is also sort of breaking it down by Zone in terms of you know who's taking advantage of it and who's not because I think that's also something that we could address and just communicating it because I've heard a ton of teachers that have said they didn't get any professional development they're expected to teach this you know new way and they didn't get any so then maybe

[05:06:00]
the communication also is not getting out there if they're telling us you're saying they're getting the professional development it's not mandatory but then they're saying it's not even offered so maybe there's a miscommunication there too so and some Data Tracking one of the things that I've just kind of been in my head like how do you as a district with multiple thousands of people keep track of what everyone received over the course of time because one of the things that many like other organizations track is what is the cost of turnover so when your people leave they walk out the door with all of this PD that we paid a lot of money to get and how could we retain them and kind of make those decisions about taking good care of those resources that we put in so I'll say addressing this is going to require it will require some changes and and how we track some of these

[05:07:00]
thanks I'm in order to answer the questions and make sure that the cards are working out a lot of it will have to be up to the teachers to track that they're doing it but that's almost impossible for you all to track thousands and thousands and thousands of people so I mean they're going to have to but they have to have the information and know that they can take this PD then it's up to them to track it and I don't know hey Dr Bowman your awesome they put it into the computer somehow it's there I mean I don't mind that people are addressing this like the there's a couple cool ways that it might work out so they all require a bit more effort than what we're doing right now but yeah I mean like my husband has to take so many so many courses and the bar and if you didn't they know you didn't so same thing my my daughter has to take so many for I'm so it's like there's

[05:08:00]
so okay so let me just kind of wrap up where we are cuz it's already after 10:00 and I know everybody's tired so for the for the board we just have to feel really comfortable because what we're about to do is to adopt our guardrails and are we comfortable with these guard rails because you know once we stop writing they start interpreting and I mean I think we got a little bit of a taste in terms of what's happening with the interpretation of the guard rails as they were developing their interims mean I guess the first question is do we all feel really pretty comfortable with our guardrails as their stated no I see one

[05:09:00]
but you remember that one of the coaching pieces that we had was it's always helpful to to sort of get the interns before we adopt because then it helps us to make sure that there's Clarity so for us on the guardrails were they in do we feel like with based on the interims that we got was there some good interpretation are we on track it's maybe not perfect but we're getting there so because we have to make a decision if we're not ready to adopt our guardrails we'll have to come back but I'm hoping that we can adopt a roads so so that's kind of where we are right now I see it had not from Romero that you feel comfortable with our guard rails with dark so obviously I know we it's up to them to determine internal and obviously we're giving

[05:10:00]
feedback but with what we've developed I feel comfortable with and based on the internet the collaboration tonight because I think it's and it's also with you I mean feeling comfortable where we are with guardrails at this point board member Gonzalez you feel okay Peterson everybody's okay you're okay yes and I just want to say I was very uncomfortable with interim or with guard real number two but after seeing your interns I am much more comfortable so yes I'm fine how about board member Dominguez I'm fine so Ashley wants to come on camera now come on Ashley she's going to give us a quick grade before we go to our next piece hi everyone yes so I actually was coming on just to reiterate what you just shared presidential and I wanted to be really

[05:11:00]
clear that if you're not there if there is any discontent with the interims your job that you have to do as a board is to provide Clarity to your guard room so you add the clarity to your guard rails you can't say go back and change your interims or go back and fix your interims the superintendent has to own that so if there are changes that you want to see you have to make those changes through your guard rails if you have any questions about that if you if you adopt them now because the interpretation of the Guard the superintendent's interpretation of the guard rails is the interims so but with all of the feedback that we've had going back and forth and we don't have the insurance and reduce some

[05:12:00]
enough so it sounds like we cannot adopt these until they come back with the interns you can you can it's just a matter of what you feel comfortable with that the board the board has to make the decision it has to be your decision I can't tell you I can't tell you what to do I could just give you advice as you make the decisions well and I think what we did is we went down the day and we still feel pretty comfortable with the guard rails we have we're seeing some head nodding with the District staff that were closed with some good guidance so I think we're going to be able to to get their board member Gonzalez I think you want to make a motion yes so with respect to agenda item 7 second this is Barbara is there any other additional discussion hearing none um I think

[05:13:00]
go for a vote on this one maybe Aragon yes Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes that's enough all right so the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday March 15th 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or virtually at www.aps.edu and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday March 29th 2023 at 5 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee meeting in the same boardroom and also on the same URL for online and with that we are adjourned
