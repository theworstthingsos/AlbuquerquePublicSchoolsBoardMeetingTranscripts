[00:02:00]
this is Danielle thank you okay roll call please Dr Albright banana republics for the fiscal year ending June 30th 2023 Mr Turnbull are you are you going to do it myself I'm going to introduce the controller and

[00:03:00]
the executive director of accounting every agency and governmental entity has to be audited every year for state law APS is required to choose a new auditor at least every 8 years and through the RFP process and this is the sixth year for Moss Adams today's meeting is the entrance conference for the 2023 I mean I'm sorry New Mexico State Statute requires monthly updates to the audit committee during the audit field process and those aren't normally have monthly and then the exit conference is held in October

[00:04:00]
good morning go ahead and give it over to Sheila thank you very much good morning to everyone in your packet you have the presentation that we have put together for the entrance conference piece and so we will start here at the top with the service team of as an introduction my name is Sheila I am a partner with most atoms and I've been with them about 16 years and I'm in charge of the entire Albuquerque Public School audit including all of the component units which includes the foundation and all of the charter schools we also have another partner on the team Ashley Austin and she is responsible for the quality control review making sure that we are complaining the odd in accordance with the aicpa requirements and then that the financial statements ultimately

[00:05:00]
play meet the requirements of the Gatsby standards on our team for the district we have the same team that we have had the last 2 years both at the senior manager level the manager and then the senior that will be involved in the audit process we are required to are we have been hired to perform the audit for the June 30th 2023 year end is part of the audit process we do assist with preparing some of the schedules on statements that go into the financial statements those include some of the footnotes on the combined pieces for all the charter schools all the appendix amounts that go into the charter schools all over the schedules related to the Gatsby 68 and 75 which is the proportionate share the pension liability schedules

[00:06:00]
and then the corresponding notes on those schedules and then the the schedules related to the other post employment benefit liabilities and then we do assist with all the combining statements for all of the component units and that's on on page 5 is where I'm at in the presentation as part of the auditor responsibilities were responsible for making sure that the financial statements are merely correct and so we do calculate a materiality each year that materiality is based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors and based off the activity within the district we have multiple opinion units as the Auditors that we are calculating the materiality on the government-wide statements is the largest of the opinion units that has all the activity for the district

[00:07:00]
and then each of the major funds has its own materiality that we do calculate within the financial statements themselves and so even though we are auditing the financial statements management is ultimately responsible for those financial statements making sure that they are complete that they need the Gatsby requirements that there's no disclosures that are that are missing from the financial statements we are required to follow the aicpa standards in regards to complaining the audit we also have to follow the yellow book standards which is the biggest requirements because we do have a federal compliance audit that we are also performing as part of the financial statements that we are required to follow the rules under the New Mexico state auditor has several requirements that they require

[00:08:00]
us to be able to do as part of the audit process and so that includes looking at things like travel and per diem procurement some of the budget adjustments request all of the cash reconciliations for each of the quarters are a small number of the things that the state auditor requires of us as part of the audit process we start doing some planning which is taking place this week along with some interim work we're looking specifically at the controls of the district and looking to make sure that the district is following any policies and procedures that are in place we're looking for making sure that the documentation around those controls exist we can see that whether that's in electronic form or on paper and so then we're also starting the planning for the federal compliance

[00:09:00]
looking at the schedule of federal expenditures and seeing which major programs and we will be auditing for the current year so even though we are looking at internal controls we don't necessarily provide an opinion on internal controls is something does come to our attention during the audit process we are required to communicate those issues with management and then determine whether any of those issues rise to the level of a significant deficiency or material weakness and so the next step in the audit process is we would then look to our audit procedures to see how we're going to complete the rest of the audit and so some of that is through analytics and then the rest of it is true details which means that we're pulling a number of supporting documentation and documentation in order to support any of the balances that are presented into the financial statements

[00:10:00]
both on the balance sheet and then on the statement of revenues and expenditures and so again anything that we do find we are required to communicate that to management and then that subsequently gets communicated to the audit committee moving on to pay 7 and we do have some group audit requirements that we are required to communicate and so we do audit like I mentioned the component units which includes Albuquerque Public Schools foundation and then we also have the charter schools that are included in there each of the charter schools along with that turkey Public School Foundation has its own audit we have to go through and calculate materiality for each of the levels of what activity is in each one of these components and then within the charter schools we do also have 11 Foundation that each of those charter schools have

[00:11:00]
that we have to also audit as well so next page areas of audit emphasis is part of the audit work we spent a significant amount of time looking at Revenue looking at all the Gran Awards to make sure that they have been captured appropriately because the district is operating on a modified Cash basis all the cruel injuries usually just take place once a year and some management works to make sure that the financial statements are presented in accordance with gaap but part of that where typically looking at cut off and making sure all of those are cruel adjustments including all the revenue has been properly accounted for and we do quite a bit to make sure that all those adjustments make sense and that there's nothing missing from the financial statements the ibnr and the claims expense we look at

[00:12:00]
the claim samples at some of the claims expenses and Sample that to make sure that we could see all those claims being paid and then there's an Actuarial study that gets done at the end of the year to determine what that ibnr is and so we're looking at the lab reports subsequent to urine to determine that the valuation makes sense and there's nothing in there that looks like the liabilities should be higher than what's being calculated by that actual Actuarial that's being done next page the debt we do confirm all the debt balances we're looking at the bonds anytime there's a change in the bonds we're looking to make sure that those have been appropriately recorded anytime there's a refunding we're looking at those adjustments as those are very complex have been properly accounted for

[00:13:00]
Lowe's in the financial statements and then the compliance with the Federal grant program because you receive federal dollars we and the dollars are significant we are required to go in and determine which major funds are going to be audited in the current year and so there is a formula to that if they've been audited in the last 2 years they may or may not have to have an audit in the current year if the amounts are over and they have never been audited they will automatically require us to audit them out of that program in the current year and so sometimes we have two programs here that were auditing it does range based off the level of the amount of federal dollars that are being expended in the single fiscal year and based off what has been audited in the prior year

[00:14:00]
as part of the audit process we are required to do a risk assessment during the planning process and so as part of that risk assessment we do look to determine is there anything at the district where we feel there could be additional risks specifically related to fraud and so we do set up our audit procedures for any of those risks that we do think are fried rice and so that does change from year to year and we do also look to have some discussions with management we're looking to make sure that if there is something that you know we are asking specifically and we do have various conversations with the audit committee members of various times also just to have an idea if there's anything else that we need to look at during the audit process where we think there could be a

[00:15:00]
specifically related to fraud the audit itself is not necessarily designed to find fraud but if something does come to our attention we are required to communicate that both to management and to the state auditor and we are required to perform procedures to determine what the what the additional risk could be to the audit or to the financial statements next slide so here's the audit timeline that we go through so we start meeting with Management in the springtime coming up with a plan of what we want to change for the current your audit start getting all of our request list together for the audit as part of the audit process we pull thousands of documents so it does take management sometime to get all of those things accum

[00:16:00]
as we start to begin the audit field work and so this week we do have some planning going on and looking at internal controls next week we have some single audit planning time and control testing that we're starting to look at along with some of the compliance that has already happened through the the April May time frame obviously today is the entrance conference and then September is when we start looking at final field work for the district and then with the gold to obviously have met the state audit rule deadline we haven't missed it yet so that that's not the plan we plan to be on time like every year we look to try to get the financial statements to the state Auditors by the November 1st timeline just because the financial statements are very large and we like to get everything done ahead of that 11:15 time line

[00:17:00]
audit deliverables on the next page and so we do issue multiple reports within your financial statements the first is a report of the independent Auditors this is just a report over the financial statements themselves any required supplementary information that's included in the financial statements and then any supplementary information that's included in the financial statements there's also a paragraph included on that first report related to the statistical section in the financial statements that we do look over to make sure that it's complete and concise but we don't provide an opinion on the statistical section itself the second report is the report on internal control where financial reporting this is our yellow book report this is the report that basically says that we looked at the internal controls in the financial statements and over compliance

[00:18:00]
and we're providing some level of assurance that there's no there is either findings or there's not this is where those those statements would go and that that identifies what is considered a significant deficiency or a material weakness on the 3rd report we do issue the report on the compliance for each of the major programs that were auditing is part of the Federal grant compliance piece and so any programs are listed in the schedule of the schedule of and then those are the programs that we are providing the opinion on we do issues separate reports for the foundation and then some of the charter schools there's eight charter schools that do request standalones that we do issue their own opinions on the rest of the opinions are included within the district financial statements and then as part of the audit process

[00:19:00]
everything is completed and there is a data collection form that is submitted to the federal audit Clearinghouse for all of the federal dollars along with the finalized financial statement that goes to The Fez to show that the audit is complete and then the results of the audit next page and so as part of the process the expectation of course is that the district will be prepared and then all the PVCs and the cap schedule will be provided on time and we do have a new secure portal that we are using this year that hopefully will keep everything a little bit more organized and we do expect at some point once we get to final field work in the financial statements are balances are beginning to be audited that we have minimal adjustments we always expect some level of adjustments but we really try to minimize that as much as possible if there are adjustments that

[00:20:00]
identify those are communicated with management immediately anytime there is a fighting that we have that's communicated with management immediately to determine whether we miss something as the auditor is if it's truly a fighting that needs to be in the report and then any restatements we haven't had anything at the district level only at the charter school level in the past few years I don't foresee that being an issue in the current year and then next page we do have a new Gatsby requirement this year last year you're probably remember the leases was the new Gatsby requirement this year it is the subscription-based information technology arrangements and so similar to the Lisa County this does require management to take a look at this determine whether there's adjustments that need to be made into the financial statements I know management is currently

[00:21:00]
working on this and have a big task ahead of them for the next couple of months to kind of get through determine what determining how this impacts the financial statements there are a lot of agreements as you can imagine related to information technology and so going through those and determine what's falling under the standard and that is it as far as insurance conference communication are there any questions from the committee okay does anybody have any questions okay go ahead I just wanted to I don't know if anybody had noticed but she was title changed from the last time we saw and I just wanted to congratulate thank you very much

[00:22:00]
hey good for

[00:23:00]
acronyms are so that will pretty much be the same this year did you find any more difficulty because we had so much more money than we have in the past when it comes to Federal you know federal funds no I mean the great thing about the district is all of the federal dollars are accounted for exactly the same and processed exactly the same and so we don't have any issues of taking any of the records or doing any of the audits seems like everything is even though we have additional funding you know there's nothing unusual in there okay and then I know that you are you you know you always mention this when it comes to that you are not supposed to you're not designed to find fraud right so you're not designed to do that so

[00:24:00]
why do you why do you say that I mean because you're looking at something I think you said specific to fraud but you're not designed to find it so how is it found is it really internally then you know it depends I would say most fraud that we're aware of is found internally the audit itself we do perform risk assessment but again we are not specifically going out looking for fraud and that is not what we are hired to do you're not the forensic accountants we are hard to make sure that the financial statements are materially correct okay I think that's all I think that's all that I have if nobody else has anything I'd like to follow up on that okay go ahead and remember Dominguez so I was

[00:25:00]
that your purpose was to determine risk for fraud is that correct we do look at it as part of our risk assessment process and so we're looking sometimes at things like management override of controls is one high risk area that we look at where you know you could have controls in place and can management come in and in override those controls or change the controls for one transaction or certain types of transactions for example and so have we ever has have you your company has ever found at 8 p.m. in any particular area or do we come out how do we score on that it just depends and it changes from year to year based off your controls that you currently have in place

[00:26:00]
sister Nativity funds tend to be higher risk because you have cash involved there and there's multiple people that handle cash at various locations and so we do additional procedures there and in accordance with State audit rule we have to look at those making sure that we can see that there's proper documentation in place so we can see the deposits that all of that reconciles out from from what is the school says that is being collected back to what is actually being deposited into those bank accounts obviously things can be manipulated in certain ways and again we're looking at it from the documentation perspective and I think our staff does do I will I think they do a remarkable job of staying on top of things thank you

[00:27:00]
and I mean just to follow up to what misdemeanor said when it comes to the override of controls that can happen by management is that addressed superintendent in directives policies at all do you know you always want to know more about internal controls are in the system so

[00:28:00]
they tried to override something they wouldn't have the permission to do it okay so we take extra steps to be able to override there's a process and it's pretty well laid out I mean there's just as an approval there's two tiers of approval I have I don't have anybody to do anything other than to go in I can look at the documents that are attached to demonstrate there's invoices to demonstrate that there's any sort of documentation justification for the purchase and I can approve that but that's all I can do I couldn't I can't go into modify it I can't go in and shift the fund I can't go in and you know transfer who's the payee would be I can just see who's supposed to be paid in the justification for what it is and then the documentation showing me that it is it's actual number and these are steps that quite frankly I think we've had the part of the thing when was still our chief procurement officer she changed the procurement manual we get a fairly I think it was

[00:29:00]
it's a more comprehensive training than it was before I am now looking at documents in ways that I wasn't looking at them before and we're also looking at them differently for different things because the training changed the way we were supposed to consider approvals kind of following the superintendent said whatever

[00:30:00]
checks and balances to make sure okay great okay did you have a follow-up I just could you repeat when when were these changes instituted Mesopotamia when did you do a more comprehensive well they were updated they were already in process but they were updated I want to say 2 years ago and then we developed the approval training like the superintendent said to make sure that the approvers understood what they were looking at and kind of what their role is because then each step of the approval process each person is looking at it through a different set of lenses you know some people are looking to see if the purchases necessary if it's appropriate are we using the right cost account that can be used

[00:31:00]
is there a budget does it meet the procurement regulations so everyone's kind of looking at it differently but then holistically we have a well-rounded approval process thank you and I miss it out if there's anything that any of the board members has to pass on to you they're welcome to call you is that correct that is correct please feel free to reach out to me anymore okay thank you thank you audit committee so I think any other questions anything else then we will move on so the next audit committee meeting will be held on Wednesday July 26th 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Melanie Community boardroom of the Alison Bruce King educational complex

[00:32:00]
put on Uptown Boulevard or virtually at aps.edu and with that we are adjourned everybody have a wonderful Tuesday
