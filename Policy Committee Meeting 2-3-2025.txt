==================================================

[00:00:00]
Welcome to our audience and to our members and superintendent Blakey I would like to call this meeting to order Dr Albright may I have a roll call please see her

[00:01:00]
turn on the screen Heather Benavides here Courtney Jackson Josefina Dominguez here and I do believe she will join us she's she's traveling and so I know reception may be an issue tonight we have a very full agenda and so buy a necessity we will probably extend our meeting time Beyond an hour the last item on the agenda is the aps.com is an important document it should buy the very nature of its democratically elected school board members reflect the vision and values of constituents and it should also reflect the tone and tenor of the

[00:02:00]
and so I urge you to stay with us this evening or revisit this recorded session to hear the conversation on the governance manual edits to see if in fact we are reflecting what you the public expect from us but first we're going to begin with our first item for consideration in action and that is the adoption of the February 3rd 2025 policy committee meeting agenda may I have emotion please I moved to February 3rd 2025 thank you glad you could join us may we have a roll call vote please stop

[00:03:00]
yes Ronaldo yes Heather Benavides yes Courtney Jackson yes Josefina Dominguez yes our next item for consideration in action is to approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on January 13th 2025 may I ask for emotion please and a second I move we approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on January 13th 2025 this is board member Jackson and I will second this is board member benavidez may we have a roll call vote please Dr Albright and yes Ronaldo yes Heather benavidez actually I'm so sorry I just remembered something I am not present on the roll call for the meeting

[00:04:00]
January 13th thank you we will make that correction okay sorry I knew there was something I apologize with that correction and I think we probably need to have an amendment to the motion I am meant my motion to approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on January 13th 2025 with the addition of board member benavidez as present at the meeting dot where the discrepancy was yes okay and I was like yes Ronaldo yes another minute yes Courtney Jackson yes yes our next item for consideration

[00:05:00]
nothing is archiving administrative board policy I am teaching about controversial or sensitive issues and are presenters are board members Jackson and Benavides but I guess I need a I think we can go ahead and emotions for action and do a second period 7 in division if you'd like but and explain our process and explain the change or archival or whatever the case may be or if everybody's already reviewed them then we can just move on yeah

[00:06:00]
yes I agree with board member Benavides on that cause of of action the only one that I would like to pull out for a little bit more discussion is 4.5 which is approval of revisions to board policy the naming and renaming so if the committee is okay we can move to approve 4.1 4.2 4.344 and 4.66

[00:07:00]
so how about if we approve 4.1 and 4.2 with the understanding for the public that 4.1 and 4.2 have been pretty much incorrect me if I'm wrong policy diet committee members but they get addressed in 4.3 is that correct and so we'll have a discussion for 4.3 but I think we can move so how about if I step back and I say our next item for consideration is to Archive administrative board policy I am teaching about controversial or sensitive issues And 4.22 archiving administrative board policy k

[00:08:00]
the family community engagement and with the understanding that will clarify those two in Four Points period anybody want to try that motion I think what you're doing in the spirit of efficiency make sense but I don't think that we can cram them all together in one I don't know that individual ugly we can we cannot address them or address them in 4.3 because that's not how they're listed on the agenda but I could be wrong I mean that so so let's just go back to the original motion or request for emotion to consider archiving administrative board policy I am teaching

[00:09:00]
play that controversial or sensitive issues can I have a motion and a second on that okay so I moved to Archive administrative word policy I am teaching about controversial or sensitive issues and I will second that motion and we are ready for a roll call vote you need to call for discussion first question is to consider archiving administrative board policy KB family and community

[00:10:00]
the engagement I'd like emotion and a second please I move that we are kind of administrative board policy KB family and Community engagement this is board member going to meet us and I will second this is for member Jackson is there a discussion yes so board member I don't know if you heard it correctly but this is just the archiving of KB and it's not the discussion of kb1 okay okay sorry we understand it's a little bit of for you coming to see the one created by a community members

[00:11:00]
the KB family and Community engagement policy yes because I know families United for Education helped create a family engagement policy and I wouldn't feel comfortable archiving policy that was created by Community looking at the document this one was first created in 1990 so if that's when they participated it is it's been updated 2016 do you remember when did the family engagement policy I just want to make sure before I move on while she's getting on board members most of this language that is in

[00:12:00]
play KB has been Incorporated over into kb1 so the policy is just being archived but the language that's included in here has just been basically transported over to kb1 okay thank you for that are you comfortable moving forward yes I am okay so we got emotion did we get a second we did okay and so there's are there any other questions if not then let's go for a roll call vote please

[00:13:00]
yes Courtney Jackson yes Josefina Dominguez yes our next item for consideration in action is to consider approving the approval of revisions to board policy kb1 student and parent Guardian rights and responsibilities and I'm going to suggest that we go through a discussion first before asking for emotion and ending up with an amended motion is that is that okay with everyone here I mean I would prefer that we stick with the same process that we've been doing with the others so

[00:14:00]
okay so we'll end up with an amended motion so may I have a motion in a second please I move that we approve the revisions to board policy kp1 student and parent and guardian rights and responsibilities policy this is board member Jackson have a second this is board member going to meet us is there a discussion and I am going to prompt board member Tom Murray because I know she had something I'm here okay I'd like to search a statement or maybe one

[00:15:00]
Wright's outline in the individual Disability Act Ida the reason for saying so is when I read the parent rights piece I don't want to see where parents with disabilities to feel that that is their primary rights but they should follow the idea procedural safeguards it's confusing and and do you remember where you wanted to insert that language and I do believe I think I sent that in that language and on January 22nd to our our Board of Education Services staff just so that you would have it on hand be highlight somewhere

[00:16:00]
right underneath because I don't want parents to be confused once reading that that they could also go to if if they had children with disabilities they could go to the Ida procedural safeguards and we could provide a link for that hyperlink yes okay and so correct me if I'm wrong but I remember the discussion being inserting that sentence that language after the first sentence so it would read the Board of Education will determine the name of school Public Schools Board of Education believes the child successful education is the result of a collaborative effort among parents Guardians individuals with individuals with caregiver authorization students and School staff and then it was

[00:17:00]
we recognize each party in this partnership has rights and responsibilities to promote academic success but I think it would be if I recollect our conversation and it's been a while it would be the third Century we don't have that in front of us so can you slowly read it again kb1

[00:18:00]
see shall not conflict with or supersede the procedural safeguards and then in parentheses parents rights outlined in the individual with Disabilities Act and then in parentheses idea and we would hyperlink procedural safeguards which would take you to remind me so I think that we don't need to put baby that's how it should start right correct

[00:19:00]
I agree Ronaldo any other board members is there a sense that this policy is superseding it's confusing to parents and I only can say that if we're not instructing parents on their procedural safeguards and they see that particular area when it is reflected in their IEPs that they would take that out instead of realizing you can go to the New Mexico special education procedural safeguards and the only reason I'm stating that is when Casey presented on December 18th I asked about training period so we're going to have this issue

[00:20:00]
where do they go and how they perceive their rights or create confusion is there a like down at the bottom of the document is there a policy cross reference or a procedural directives cross-reference that needs to be inserted it's not I don't think so we have no discrimination goals family community engagement release of student information Student Records teaching about controversial sensitive issues to the attendance and then procedural directive handbook negotiated agreement attendance and Cory's regarding student information nondiscrimination for students gender identity and expression and then parental concerns about instructional materials and then

[00:21:00]
there needs to be a legal reference potentially to idea in this document yes and does that is that in addition to the legal reference that is listing and separate from Papa yes

[00:22:00]
okay and just just asking questions here has has that language did was that language like given to like legal has that been run through legal that particular language and the particular references I only can tell you that when I first went to my first New Mexico School Board Association conference I did reference and question that and they didn't know how to answer me sorry who's the the law firm presentations

[00:23:00]
Joe were were referring to internal but that's why we submitted this language back in on January 22nd no I just didn't want I didn't I didn't take it to know I know right now and I think that's just my question I like I'm not saying I'm not arguing against the insertion I'm just wanting to make sure that because you know the special education department is such a very specific set of rules I just wanted to make sure that anything that we're inserting into what would be a policy is an alignment

[00:24:00]
thank you so I mean I think I think I would be okay with that insertion with the caveat that maybe before it is brought to the board for a full vote that it would need a full legal review that's fine I just you know I'm fine with that I just want to make sure that when I first saw the OK Google

[00:25:00]
yeah I'm fine taking it to Legal review board chair Dominguez yes Linda says on the call with us if you want to talk with him or have him join the conversation period so do you agree that this can

[00:26:00]
nothing before this moves forward to to the consent calendar on Wednesday I can try to meet the open meeting

[00:27:00]
how big of you before that's completed perfect so we're not in we're not in conflict with the consent calendar on the 5th of February so I need to know where everyone stands I think we've got a majority who is an agreement with inserting this language this would be the third I believe it would be the third sentence and are we good starting with this policy correct and I'm sorry can you just read it to me read it one more time just yes it would

[00:28:00]
this policy shall not conflict with or supersede the procedural safeguards quotation marks parents rights outlined in the individual with Disabilities Act and parentheses idea period even though and I'm just playing devil's advocate here even though the whole policy says that we will follow all federal laws do we still feel like the overarching policy is that we will follow all federal laws to include Ida I just know

[00:29:00]
Don my review and seen it there was confusion and that's the only reason why I brought this up because I don't want parents to follow this proceed this parent rights policy and not thinking that they have their own because within the IEP it talks about their parent rights but there's not in any way anything deferring or bringing them to the actual Ida policy or idea individual Disability Act so it was creating confusion because this policy was being presented at IEPs no it's just that it's the contacts are the wording of parent rights that's being used one and then so many times period rights and then if you

[00:30:00]
hey Google

[00:31:00]
responsibilities to include the language as discussed as well as the legal references discussed thank you yes thank you

[00:32:00]
Courtney Jackson yes Josefina Dominguez yes our next item for consideration in action is to consider approval of revisions to board policy add tobacco-free schools and presenters do you want to present board members Courtney Jackson and Heather benavidez well I'll make sure I move that we approve the revisions to board policy add tobacco free schools this is important member Jackson is there a discussion or need for discussion if not then I'm going to

[00:33:00]
renaming and dedication of facilities may I have a motion and a second before we discuss I move that we approve revisions to board policy FeFe

[00:34:00]
is a policy and there were some concerns that were brought to me regarding this policy about the naming and renaming of schools most significantly that just a focus on the fact that our responsibility is board members is to focus on student outcomes and to not be you know spending our time on on other things that can distract us from from what our main goal is which is to Monitor and make sure that our our students are making progress towards goals there was a question as to why this policy came back and the originally the policy diet the original policy diet committee had actually sent this to the administration and deemed it as an Administration

[00:35:00]
responsibility but it has since came back with the second round of policy diet that board member Benavides and I participated in so there's a question is to why it came back to the board after it had been archived and then I think finally there's kind of a question as to whether or not the board really needs to be involved in this especially when there is a procedural directive that's attached to this policy that has pretty substantive Community engagement involved in the in the naming or the renaming of buildings so I think I just want to kind of bring this to the policy committee to have a discussion as to whether or not this this is

[00:36:00]
role as board members do we really need to be participating in this or is this something that falls within the administration especially given the pretty substantive Community engagement requirements that are in the procedural directive so those are kind of the main questions that I think need to just be discussed before we just move this along through consent so I have a quick question about when it was last reviewed because in the policy it looks like it was last reviewed on November 11th of 2014 and then revised November 18th of 2015 but you did state that it was considered in the last policy diet and so what happened and I assume

[00:37:00]
would be reflected here and unless maybe no changes were made and it was just kind of in limbo yeah I remember benavidez that's my understanding that that's what happened is that the first set of policy diet where they went through the huge stack occurred okay what year are we in 2023 so maybe 2023 is when the first big stack went through and when they you know ranked everything and I think because it fell into that huge stack it just was archived over to administration because it was sorry I guess I shouldn't say archived it was sent over to Administration but no action was taken on it which is why I think you don't see that there's like a reviewed in a revised it was just kind of in limbo over there then when Administration and Dr Blakey correct me if I am correct on this but

[00:38:00]
Administration was able to kind of get to the stack that had been delegated to them when they got to this one it was reversed back to back to us and that's how it ended up in front of you and I okay she's shaking her head I think it was under the previous administration Administration so I went back to the house to look at it because the administration felt like it should be still considered a board policy you walk us through those reasons please sure so some of the reasons that it was considered that the administration

[00:39:00]
school or naming a school from the beginning reflects the voice and the values of the community so the school names particularly are connected to in the procedural directive that it actually starts in the community as far as renaming a school or naming a school I think that there was a lot of discussion also around the board's responsibility of financing new buildings so the board in bond elections and in any other type of funding approved funding for new schools so it was connected to if a new school is being built the financial responsibility of the board was connected to the naming of the school and there's also money attached if a school is to be renamed the board then would have to authorize the amount of money to rename a school like new Marquis new logos it's a very expensive pro

[00:40:00]
so it wasn't seen that the administration making a decision on renaming with them put the board into position to have to fund it and I think the other part is the accountability of the procedural directive to listen to the voice of the communities so if a board if a or does receive a name of a school to either be renamed or to be named from the beginning of the school that there is a responsibility of the board to verify that the Administration has followed the procedural directive to involve the community because the procedural directive doesn't have a policy attached to it so there isn't ownership on making sure that the community was involved in the name of the school

[00:41:00]
does anyone have a questions anymore questions comments I have a question and you'll have to forgive me for putting you on the spot Dr Blakey but does the administration still share those same concerns for the renaming of a school and would like to see it be aboard responsibility or remain with the board I think that the yes I do think that the administration still does want it to be a board policy we do have a new school as you all know the international school that will be coming up for naming and it does feel disconnected to the board if the administration just decides names of schools without the board approval of it and the procedural directive does outline that the board doesn't ask for a school to be Ren

[00:42:00]
so I think that the you know I could see the other view of you don't want a board member just like renaming every school in their District to be named after them so I do think that the procedural directive is important to follow because it does have a lot of community engagement but I do think that there should be oversight of the board to verify that the Administration has followed the process of community involvement in naming a school I agree with that and I think it would be pretty incredible if a board member wanted to change the name of a school to their own name because they can't be named after anybody who still alive so that would involve some some romantic measures okay any other comments or

[00:43:00]
reservations because if not I'm going to ask for a roll call vote and Dr all right I think we're ready for that Jackson do you have any other any other input as how do you feel about this you know I I keep going I am like because I keep going back to when we started the whole student comes Focus governance process I remember reading in in our documents that very stringently that our job is to focus on student outcomes and then there's a there's like a paragraph of it's not to make parents happy it's not to have Happy Teachers it's not to name buildings it's not to do and let me State those are actually the words that come

[00:44:00]
out of this document it's not my personal I do want parents to be happy let me just say that if anybody's listening I do want Happy Teachers but I think the point that was being made in that document that we that we read when we were first being trained on this is we have to focus on what's most important and getting into you know naming of buildings and spending our time showering accolades at board meetings is which is what we used to do is not a good use of our time and so I'm I'm very much on the fence about it because there were and here's why because there was another issue that was brought up like a year ago that I made a public statement about that we are supposed to be focusing on student outcomes during meetings and so I voted against a particular

[00:45:00]
addition to our agenda because I felt so strongly about the fact that as soon as we start veering away from what our focus is I'm afraid that it's going to open a Pandora's box so I can completely understand the desire to keep the main thing the main thing and so I'm I'm I think in this instance I'm going to probably stick with my original feeling of you know what I read in that paragraph that really resonated with me so I think that that's that's my argument for that as I just want to make sure that we're not letting in extra things that can divert us from what our real mission is but I do want Happy parents and I do want Happy Teachers again for

[00:46:00]
well and theoretically this won't come up very often if it does remain with the board so I think that that's that's helpful in remaining focused on our goals so thank you for clarifying your position and thank you for encouraging that clarification board member benavidez anybody else if not then I think we're ready for a roll call vote in Dallas Oregon

[00:47:00]
our next item for consideration in action is to consider approval of revisions to board policy IH instructional program may I have a motion in a second before we discuss I move to approved Provisions to board policy IH constructional program this is board member Jackson and I will support hearing no desire for discussion I'm going to ask for a roll call vote please stop Navigation yes yes

[00:48:00]
next item for consideration and action we're on 4.7 and that is to consider approval of revisions to board policy ik academic accountability may I have a motion and a second please second board member Jackson is there a discussion I have a quick question I was just wondering if we explicitly say the outcomes of our goals like early literacy post-secondary knows and skills habits and mindsets with that hurt anything going into the future if our goals change since those are our goals now

[00:49:00]
I mean I think it could require revision going forward but I don't think that that's a bad thing that you would need to require revision going forward it's you know it's an academic accountability policy and personally I don't think it's a bad thing to hold yourself accountable every few years so yes I think it is very specific to the goals that we have now but if it would require a revision I think that's an easy an easy change I appreciate that thank you any other questions or observations comments could you please do a roll call vote for yes

[00:50:00]
play Benavides Courtney Jackson yes Josefina Dominguez yes item 4.8 next item for consideration in action is to consider approval of the addition of section 4r request for information policy and process to the aps Board of Education governance manual may I ask for a motion and a second however I suspect there are going to be amendments do we want to motion and second or go to discussion for I think to stay consistent I will move that we approve the addition of section for our requests for information policy and process of APs Board of Education governance manual this is board member benefits and I will second board member Jackson okay we are open for discussion

[00:51:00]
so I did submit some sorry I'm trying to find I did submit some revisions through the there they are to the policy committee q&as the first one being and again I realize that we already did discuss some of these changes but because there wasn't a official vote on them or Amendment the changes were not made from our last discussion so just going back through those to start the first thing is that we need to make sure that we're ever it says readily available in the first section

[00:52:00]
that we change wherever it says readily available to readily accessible and I'm going to I think we should check in with our policy analyst as we speak to make sure we're recording these are you doing on it okay

[00:53:00]
the two points that I had already included in the the Q&A but getting to that third section I believe in the Action Memo it said that we were going there was a discussion

[00:54:00]
listen to leave it to leave number 7 there which included the media under request from constituents for the media I don't know if this was discussed or not but I'm as I was reading through the document I just really want to make sure that first of all references to the media are actually elsewhere in the governance manual and it seems like this request for information policy is more about board member requests from us to the district and ask amongst each other and not necessarily requests with the media like it's more of an internal discussion and not necessarily an external discussion so I don't think that the number seven that includes the media actually needs to be in there because it's elsewhere in the governance manual

[00:55:00]
so does that mean we should take out request from constituents community members elected officials and the media it is struck out on the the example but unless it's I think it was original remind me of the conversation that led to that because when we were organizing the request for information requests for information seemed to divide themselves up in these three categories and so

[00:56:00]
we do get requests so they they were not only internal and among or between board members but request for information from an ex from constituents community members elected officials and media for that matter because some of us will do get requests from just thinking back to last year Community engagement and this usually went through Communications but request from the Spanish language stations for me to to

[00:57:00]
that information so the title board request for information process what does board requests Define bored does that mean board members are requesting the information or is this request for information from the board because if it's just internal then right and so again you know when we were doing the research for this section for request for information I'm just clarifying that the language that we found from a variety of sources seem to divide itself up into these three categories so not just the boards request for information but

[00:58:00]
request for information and then it would go into you know for our the first section their Communications between between board members and staff and request for information and then the second section was bored bored bored bored member and then finally the third section would be represented by request from Community entities to the board if I make clarify or request what is the intent of

[00:59:00]
what is policy is the intent of this policy to outline how the board SS individuals go to the district and request information or is it the intent to be how the board handles all requests for information because my understanding was that this policy was more how do individual board members go to the district to request information especially you know given the first statement where it says that you know we require accurate and timely information how do we go about getting that so my understanding what this was more our internal process as to how we receive information from the district if that's the case then I don't think that that last section needs to be in this

[01:00:00]
for our policy because it can either be placed over in 4 Ponder community community engagement section and as well with the media section in particular it's it's elsewhere in the board in in the governance manual so I think we need to determine what is the what what was the original intent of this policy being developed and are we maintaining what that intent was I will also jump into and say that I agree with you and that's why we decided to move that section to 4 p.m. and I also wanted to ask remember Jackson do you know where in the government

[01:01:00]
call Media I knew you were going to ask me that question and I can't I can't it's like I know I read it I I I actually think I think it's not in our current governance manual it's in one of the Amendments that we're going to be discussing on Wednesday I'm pretty sure that it's listed under like the officer roles that's right yeah so it's like I guess I shouldn't say it's in the government's manual it's in potential amendments that we have coming for the government's manual so again you know what's the intent is it how do we how do we act amongst ourselves when we need information thank you I think you're right we're we decided that the very last

[01:02:00]
Jackson was covered for in 4pi think for maybe 4H and that that left two sections then or two categories how bored members request information of the district and how we request information of each other and I think I think those are two are covered is that correct yes yes or one

[01:03:00]
go to YouTube

[01:04:00]
where it says in board rules or whatever believe it's age the president represents the board outside parties including the media by announcing board stated positions and communicating decisions within their delegated authority so I think this is where we're seeing that my only concern with that and not having something else for the media is by something that you brought up trailer to do interviews so I definitely would want us to start thinking about now cuz I know we're going to go to this in the next discussion but how we could include other board members or what the process is because I still get asked a lot of that I want to make sure that that process is included in these documents I agree yes thank you and so

[01:05:00]
are you suggesting board members started that we we flag that theme that topic for the next the next discussion item yes that there would be an exception for Spanish language through the board president to the Spanish language media Outlet I want to see something more in general just in case the president is not available for

[01:06:00]
talk to the board president and is approved by her that there is a another board member who will speak on behalf of the board or something like that but I don't I don't think it should just be for Spanish media as I know that we have to address all languages I think I was going to say there's a free speech I mean one of the questions that I submitted had to do with yeah this is an example of that I mean there are unintended consequences to some of the language so yes I agree we need it's not just a Spanish language media requests it's anyway language

[01:07:00]
correct the media yes okay so just to clarify I do believe that the president speaks for the board I think that there should be a process where but kind of like we have before because I know that communication would reach out to me and it would be approved for me through the district Communications to be speaking on behalf of the board and it was all like approved you know everything I would say would be approved from by the board and what we all believed in so it's not like just usually speak to the media would still be through the president but just to finding that process a little bit hopefully I explain myself what's going on tonight so what was the process to know exactly so what I would do was if I get a request to be on media I would send that to our Communications person who was Monica at the time and then she would

[01:08:00]
play me some pointers of what the district language was to so that I can make it my own but still stick to like a general thing and then the board would know beforehand that I would be speaking to the media and that would go out and then I would be able to do the interview or whatever it might be and did this ever happen yes yes so how was the board notified I believe it was just like an email address the one that I can that's off the top of my head was when we did the superintendent Town Halls so I think was kind of being flushed out of this is that there are in in the past it's you know it went to communic

[01:09:00]
I'm wondering I think absolutely any bored inquiries need to go through the board president which is what you said board member of the store go like it needs to go through the word president and then working with Dr Blakey or Dr blakey's does that mean they need to make the decision is to you know who to reach out to you know they're certainly not calling me to do Spanish language media but I think you know that media inquiry absolutely needs to be directed through the board president first and then dispersed yeah yeah which I think is exactly what you're saying board member historical it's but it seems like maybe prior to Dr Blakey being here things went to Communications and didn't necessarily go through the word president so we need to make sure that that is fixed well I would like

[01:10:00]
did it go through the board president because it seems like it would have had to regardless of administration in the past you mean yes yes no no no no no I mean no because Janelle is the example or Communications Danielle for president and then dispatch to Janelle in The Specific Instructions so I I'm not sure how it went from Communications to word president because I probably wasn't involved at that moment but I didn't want to clarify that one I said that it went out to the board it was only the board president I just double checked for you so I believe she was included in that way but I'm not sure if she was included beforehand

[01:11:00]
and Madam chair we typically don't we don't approve whether or not a board can or can't speak to the media we can refer them to this policy but it typically if media has to talk to the board we typically do refer to the board president and then the board president can kind of farm out if there is somebody that the board president wants to talk to you about that specific issue but typically if media goes to us to speak to the border to get a board statement on something we discuss it with the board president but we never approve or don't approve we kind of relay the message thank you for that clarification

[01:12:00]
I think it doesn't seem to be that there's consensus that this section doesn't necessarily need to be here for 4r that it can be elsewhere in governance magnet the Amendments that we have coming up so would that be in back to your original suggestion for peeled right now so I mean I would say we leave the whole thing out from 4r currently and then when we discuss the governance manual on

[01:13:00]
play if you know if one through six needs to go into 4 pin number seven is included under president's officer obligations then we can do that but I think for for right now with our discussion of for our are we in agreement that where it's at right now we are in agreement with that so we don't get my notes and it says keep number seven and discuss so I think that's what we just did right media inquiries should be directed to the board president

[01:14:00]
board members should clarify that they are not speaking for the entire board as individual members have no authority to commit the district to any Policy Act or expenditure for governance manual etcetera so where would we put that language I think that that's a discussion that I'd have to look at before Wednesday but I think I think that number seven in particular has Merit I think it needs to stay in the governance manual somewhere potentially under President you know rolls or I mean it has

[01:15:00]
it has a place I just don't know if if we're looking at the intent of this policy is board member discussion board member requests for information how do we gather information I don't I just don't know that this number 7 needs to stay in for our and and so on that point I just wanted to quickly check in with everybody I think we're all in agreement with that is that correct I don't want to speak for anyone yes I'm going to agreement with that remember benavidez I don't know why we would need to take it out because to me it's very clear that it really

[01:16:00]
go to the president and the president decides so well so clarifies that when speaking as an individual board member should make that clear this is kind of a legacy thing for future board members and so if you're new board member at where are you at and you're looking at this manual and you get a request from media would you go to the request for information portion

[01:17:00]
or whatever the potential issue for board members who are up for election because they're going to be contacted by the media often they fill out questionnaires they asked specific questions and so because they are board members not just candidates and they are beholden to the government's manual then are they supposed to not speak honestly about a question they're asked that maybe goes against something we voted on I mean that could be an issue the language here makes it clear that they can't they have a right to do that as individual rights okay so I guess what I'm saying is in that case then do the board members who are up for election want to remove this and remove that right I mean I think you have it anyway it's really you know it's a governance manual you know it's

[01:18:00]
there's that but I absolutely want to keep it in the governance manual I I I I think that whole section needs to be included but I think maybe that whole section just needs to be moved to community the community engagement with the Board of Education section so section for p which is because to me like engagement with the media is kind of de facto engagement with the community so I absolutely think that that language needs to stay I just don't know if it needs to stay in for our okay I'm so sorry I thought we were talking about that clarifies I'm questioning that only because Ford number

[01:19:00]
I have mixed feelings about this board member Jackson again if I'm a new member and the scenario that board member Benavides just you know four of us are going to face that this year media requests so it is that does that fall under request for information because Community engagement with the vision and the values and Outreach which can involve the media so I guess I'm suggesting that it doesn't

[01:20:00]
it doesn't have to be only in one spot where we get the same where we have this clarified anywhere else unless she's lost the signal

[01:21:00]
it looks like she's still there okay yeah I think it works fine in 4pi I think it works fine where it is but if if Lord remember Jackson feel strongly about moving it only because if we're sticking with the intent of what floor are was meant to be which was internal discussions amongst us in the district then to me in that sense outside inquiries are Community inquiries they're not internal inquiries that we're having amongst ourselves as board members or us to the district okay so I'm going to ask this again and I'm sorry I feel like we're spending at this point then that means we need to take out that entire section request from constituents community members elected officials and the media not just number seven the entire thing

[01:22:00]
okay I'm sorry I don't know what I'm missing here but everybody keeps focusing on number 7 okay so take that out and move number 7 to 4 P we're good right it's not so much the entire text message right now my suggestion is that the whole thing gets moved to 4 Pete okay so I'm so sorry I have to ask this why are we focusing on number seven then because it's the last meeting there was a discussion that everything except number 7 be removed from 4:00 I apologize so and the good news is we don't actually have to admit

[01:23:00]
currently amend that section cuz it's already X down anyway so it was already not going to be there anyway okay so I'm going to throw one more thing in and so we've settled that this last section is going to 4p community engagement I hear a majority in favour of that okay I want to take our eyesight back to the previous page request for information the section that begins Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education members will follow this process when we requesting information from the administration number seven below another number seven

[01:24:00]
phone number five has been crossed out it's now number seven for information not readily is accessible correct I don't want to say it out loud I think it's accessible is the correct word the district must provide the requested materials within 20 business days this is no that's not it is the district must provide the requested materials within 20 days business days if this is unreasonably difficult due to factors like volume or location the district May extend the time line to 30 business days but must notify the board member of the reason for the delay I'm sorry bear with me

[01:25:00]
is the one that deals with the agenda language about the agenda 8:00 p.m. for agenda items the language I'd like to see is request for agenda items will be announced and scheduled during the president's report on the Dias just because future on a future I think we need to hold ourselves to

[01:26:00]
a timeline it needs to be time bound and again there's a transparency concern and I think I brought this up at the last meeting we need to get more transparency about agenda items that are requested and so this language has implications for I forget what sections are disgusting maybe it's okay but what I'm suggesting or offering is requests for agenda items will be announced and scheduled during the president's report on the dice tonight

[01:27:00]
this is in regards to number 8 well this is in regards to requests for information so if the board member has gone through all of the requests and still wants it to be on the board agenda yes but it sounds like what your requesting is all requests need to be placed in the president's report well I'm suggesting that this will have implications for yes so but let's stay focused on this one I am thinking like the way you stated it it seems like that's more something that would need to go into thank you for Kay not necessarily here well I think it needs to be clarified here because to to request

[01:28:00]
just to add like a Time measurement of when that request will be on the agenda so you're still saying that if you're RFI was denied and you wanted to bring it to the the board for an agenda item when what would be that timeline so just adding on number eight instead of it will be placed on a future board agenda for consideration it will be placed on the next morning so Mike my concern is twofold right that's half of it that's exactly right so instead of a future board of agenda it's on the next board agenda for consideration but what's left hanging is how how does the rest of the board know

[01:29:00]
so if a request is denied the board member and the board member wishes to pursue it they may email the board president and superintendent to request to be on the next agenda for consideration and will be reported during the president's report if the majority of the board supports the request so your question is how are we going to know if the majority of the board is interested in that request what does that process so I'm suggesting at the end

[01:30:00]
it will be placed on on the next board agenda for consideration and included in the included in the board presidents report the issue depending on when the next board meeting is are you comfortable with that well it's it's more specific but it's on the next board agenda for consideration that creates it as its own agenda item which means that it doesn't actually need to be included in the president's report cuz if it's if it's

[01:31:00]
requested is placed on the next board agenda for consideration that makes it doesn't need to be included in the president's report because then your to see what I'm saying yes yes yes it would be in the president's report before it gets on the agenda because I think it's correct me if I'm wrong it's only going to be on the president's report to notify the rest of the board members that there was a request for information so that they might show their interest so that I can be placed on the next agenda I think any requests like the like that like a request for information needs to come to the attention of the entire board and then we just as a board we decide if it's a over the topic right or were they request not only if it's denied but any any request is what you're saying

[01:32:00]
correct but that's actually a 4K issue that's not a request for information issue well okay but but it impacts this so how do we rewrite number eight so that there's transparency and a time-bound criteria I think there's some I think there's confusion because the the transparency comes from the fact that it is placed on the agenda as a discussion item so with like a discussion on it just says for consideration for well okay can you have to

[01:33:00]
discuss it to consider it so so I'm sorry to interrupt you but what you're saying is you're afraid that a request might be denied and the board member wants to pursue it and so they emailed the president and asked that it be placed on the next board agenda and it's not and where's the accountability how are how is the rest of the board going to know that this request was made and that it needed to be placed on the next agenda like where is that accountability there's got to be a way to say that without correct so I believe it's already stated that all requests have to be shared with the full board that's already in our governance

[01:34:00]
so any requests that comes any requests for information as it stands right now that comes into Dr Blakey already has to be shared with us is some things are shared in at a glance some things are shared via email so I I think you're right but here's here's the difficulty with that our accountability to the public is also missing in that yeah so let's go back to to number 8 so we can wrap up the yard so I mean I think really where where your larger discussion

[01:35:00]
when did you have is the discussion that needs to be saved for 4K like how board agendas are set I think you need to my suggestion would be you kind of hold that for when we get to 4k on the government's manual because I think that's where your main concern is this procedure is very specific to if you request that you want all fences painted red and that that request or you want to know why all the fences are painted red and that request gets to denied like if doctor Blake is like I'm not going to tell you why they're all painted Red Sox and it's really important to you that you know that then what would happen is you would email the board president and the superintendent and say I really want this place on the agenda it would come

[01:36:00]
on the agenda to the full board then the full board all seven of us would have a discussion to to decide is this really important that we know this information or not that's where if if then if the full board decides yes it's super important that we know why all the fences are painted red that creates the cause of action for Dr Blakey so I think if as far as number eight is concerned if you want to change it to placed on the next board agenda for consideration I think that that addresses your concern and then the larger agenda concern needs to be held in check for 4K correct so again just to simplify this I'm proposing that we strike through a future board agenda

[01:37:00]
future and and make that I'll get rid of the indefinite article to a future and make it the next board agenda the simple fix so we can move out of RFI sorry not yet I had to to request the first one I sent in in the questions and answers and it was under one under request for information to the following if a formal request for information is deemed necessary after an honest analysis of the process listed above board members should submit it through the district let's talk platform so it changes the wording slightly but

[01:38:00]
I'm hoping to do with that language is to again place the onus upon the board members to make sure that they have used all available methods to find the information first before going to Dr Blakey and her staff for requests for information because we really need to be mindful of the fact that every single time we go to doctor Blakey she and I might be speaking for you Dr Blakey but she feels an obligation to drop what she's doing to answer our questions and every time we do that that is distracting her from the work of the district to answer our questions so I think I'm asking that there be maybe a little bit more forceful language

[01:39:00]
we really have to make sure that we have done our work first before taking the the focus away from the district onto our questions is there any discussion Dr Blakey the board members with whom my community

[01:40:00]
anytime a request comes in and actually we just had a conversation about this in our cabinet meeting today the administration does feel a sense of urgency to drop everything to respond to the board members so it does I mean if there are seven board members and they each ask one question a week then it does you know take time but I do think that there is a bonus on the administration that we prioritize questions from board members first so if board members were able to find that information on their own like certainly that would not have to find it but we do respond to we do drop everything to prioritize board members

[01:41:00]
is not the easiest thing to filter through for example I requested

[01:42:00]
the feeder schools like what are our website is pretty unwieldy and not very user-friendly but so I just needed to know what feeder schools go with what schools and I was able to get that I think from casino with Angie and I really appreciated that I think that got sent out to others but it would be helpful to have that easily accessible on the website or even on our board member page where it says you know what what schools were we are responsible for and I'm trying to think of I mean it's usually sapper and filtering information out of saber and I know I've sat down with Chris West

[01:43:00]
and he said this is what I wanted I've spent lots of hours trying to figure it out and when he tried to do the same thing the request it's like oh well you can't do that let's figure this out I can get this for you so you know I know that I try very hard personally to honor your your time I know you've got a lot going on so I'm just curious about you know where those requests are coming from and how often if the weekly or but my sons of it is that

[01:44:00]
we're actually going to get the answer to that question because we do have involved in the RFI a an agreement that that information will be shared quarterly I believe it's so I'm going to text my mom here in a second to go pick up we have that so I think you are going to get the the answer to that question of how the board is actually using the time yeah so but can we just like how does the board feel about the insertion of that language into number one about there being an honest analysis prior to embarking on the formal request for information

[01:45:00]
we need to Define what honest analysis is and who's doing that and so I'm taking it as I'm doing an honest analysis and looking for everything I can find on my own and then elevating it to Administration if I cannot do that and that's how I meant it so like how much to make that known then I'm happy for suggestions but that that was definitely intense the intent was I need to make sure that I'm doing what I can first before I take it to the superintendent so maybe something like a good faith effort on the part of the board member to find as much information as I can on their own not really I'm not a lot but maybe after a good faith effort

[01:46:00]
what is that you know is that 15 minutes is that 30 minutes is that an hour well I think it's it's it's I looked on the website I looked through the policies I looked in my governance manual I looked these places I didn't find the answer to my question I could be missing it you know future or guidance in this case would be helpful that's when I can't find something and I have to ask somebody a question that's usually what I do so they know I've made an effort first before going to them so suggested language if a formal request for information is deemed necessary after a good faith effort on the part of the board member after a good faith effort of the process listed above board members

[01:47:00]
May submit it through the district or should submit it through the district's let's talk platform so just take out honest analysis and insert good-faith effort and what's the process listed above that's that's the whole the whole policy right under the accordingly the one through one through nine period

[01:48:00]
under under the like the introductory phrase is that what you're saying but you're suggesting you list the actual process that you follow is that what you're talking about I'm just trying to figure out what process of the process listed above could you direct me to stop for information

[01:49:00]
that that request for information that is those are the step-by-step those are the steps that the board members have to go through to get their information right what I'm saying is the board members shouldn't embark on those steps those requests for information until on page one they have made a good faith effort to assess whether or not they understand that they're asking questions that are focused on their governance responsibilities that they have evaluated the necessity and urgency of the request for information whether or not they've made a good faith effort to if it's readily accessible on their own

[01:50:00]
whether they've done that analysis first before embarking on the steps under the request for information had a headline so maybe I'm looking at the wrong document here I don't think so I've got to pause for a

[01:51:00]
yes so that's what number Jackson is requesting be modified and modified based on the board member having run their request for information through number one through nine on the previous page to make sure it meets all of those requirements but I don't know that that necessarily make sense because number four says that the information from Administration you know does it meet is it something Administration does is it something they are you know

[01:52:00]
arthritis speak about you know it's not that cut and dry so I don't know that if I were doing this myself I would look at that initial list and say oh okay I can check off all of these and then now I can go and ask administration because it's not written that way unless I'm totally misunderstanding what you're saying more member Jackson no I think well so I think what you're saying is that maybe my intent of putting of adding that analysis is maybe already in there because because by the time you get to number four you've already done like you've already done steps one one two and three and and done that analysis to specifics right

[01:53:00]
is that board members are putting in a good faith effort to find information before we divert to Dr Blakey and her staff that's if it's already if it's already in there then then you know I'll remove my my request I just I don't know that it's in there as strongly as I think it needs to be I think it's a number three it says board members will evaluate the necessity urgency in alignment with border responsibilities before requesting information

[01:54:00]
encourage the first utilize existing reports dashboards or communication channels to locate the information independently OK Google responsibilities before requesting information

[01:55:00]
okay that seems easier than inserting another item so it would read for number three board members will make a good faith effort to evaluate the necessity urgency and alignment with border responsibilities before requesting information they are encouraged to First utilize existing reports dashboards communication channels to locate the information independently not exhaustive that's what I was just saying

[01:56:00]
thank you that encapsulates what I was hoping for I do have I'm sorry I have one more this is the one that woke me up in the middle of the night if you guys will indulge me unless somebody else has something it goes along this same the same theme so under so after number five in on page one okay so number after number five on page one to so make it would make number six request for information are intended solely to address board member inquiries and do not direct or imply action by the superintendent any action by the superintendent must must be authorized by full board directive

[01:57:00]
because again I this we we we we we we we we we we have the right to request information absolutely but that request for information should not be interpreted as a request for Action by the superintendent so if using the red fence if I request to know why all of the fences are painted red and not blue it shouldn't be an implication to Dr Blakey that she now has to go and paint all the things the fences blue I would find it more helpful if I could get a like a solid example of something that has been

[01:58:00]
requested that was an indirect directions which was essentially a directive if you're comfortable doing that I don't think I have one like off the top of my head period in the morning because they can't go because it's not open to Working Families to change the time of the meeting because this parent isn't able to go so that's like a directive that now all meetings have to be after 5:00 for example

[01:59:00]
like it could turn into a request becoming a directive instead of a request for information so that you know the the painting of something isn't that far-fetched necessarily because it could be you know we have I have as a board member have had concerns that all of the entrances to the schools are in this location they are painted blue and people find it very confusing it should be painted a different color so I think that it's in anything that a board member could take from one that says something to them and asking a question where they're directing myself or staff to change something for everyone on a constituent question okay but that's different than when I get concerns from constituents about

[02:00:00]
what what I considered administrative stuff I would call that administrative stuff I'm going to forward it thank you for bringing this to my attention this is an administrative issue I am forwarding this to is that different or is that yes that's different because it would be if you're saying I had a constituent that brought this to my attention and I'd like to know the answer to it and I want the answer to be and you don't you want the answer to be a specific thing to be able to tell if you're just passing information on without the intent of having a response back information from a constituent please respond to me and let me know that you took care of the issue and it's no longer problem and it could be something you want to change a bus stop

[02:01:00]
that's too far from their house so it is a directive because it's saying I'm asking you to respond to this constituent but also telling you what let me know when you change the bus stop so you're giving the directions in front of their house and its three houses down as it's an administrative concern please let me know when the bus stop is changed right right let us know how the problem gets resolved or is that can you do you all read that as a directive I think that we're talking about different things I'm just trying to get clarity request for information in my mind

[02:02:00]
is what is the bus stop route for all of the elementary schools in my district that's a request for information I'm not sure how that would turn into a directive unless I was very explicit about it and you know you are well within your rights to say here's all the information I'm not changing the bus stops either you know like I don't know how naturally it would turn into a directive I think it's very different when you are elevating a concern which can turn into a directive you know on the bus stop doesn't stop close enough to my house you know I want to report that okay then I understand it doesn't stop close enough to your house does not mean which somebody could take it as we're going to make sure it does you know that's very different then just requesting information about something so I know that this is probably there's been a specific incident that that's you know precip

[02:03:00]
I need for this but I don't know that just a plain request for information can turn into a directive just organically like that it just seems odd to me but if it's something that you would like us to consider them all for it no I think that's a good example because if it's a request of information that the board member just wants for information then that's like a good example of request for information if it's request for information that board members trying to get in order to give it to their constituents who has a further question then that's I think we're the request for information gets kind of Muddy because you're trying to be the intermediary person who is requesting the information as a board member to then give to somebody else so I think that that is a good purpose for the board member to think first am I requesting information because I need it to make an informed decision and policy or if it's connected to like the progress monitoring something like that versus I'm requesting information because I've heard

[02:04:00]
constituent complain about something and I'm like going into try to find more information about it rather than just directing the constituent to us to get the right information so I mean I think that's kind of again like I woke up in the middle of the night with this one was just just like that blanket statement that you know that the requests for information we're doing it because we generally like just need you know want to have this information but that we're we're not then turning it into a blanket directive or an implication that that's a superintendent must act must act so I think that's already in section

[02:05:00]
the superintendent is our only employee and and we do not give directives to employees and staff members right and if we provide information about something I'm not just sitting around wondering what are the all the bus stops for all the elementary schools in my district you know so if we provide that information because a constituent asked us and then it's their natural inclination is as long as it doesn't come from us then I think we're okay because they would probably make the request anyway we just provided them with factual information to you know I mean I'm not sure

[02:06:00]
where it stops We Can't Stop constituents from making requests or asking for things I mean we can not make directives ourselves but if we provide information which then leads to them doing it I don't see it an issue with that I mean we shouldn't encourage it of course you know we're not going to say here's all the information you need anything and ask for this and you know but we are beholden to our constituents and providing them information and being their voice when they don't have the opportunity to do it on their own so I'd like to hear from other board members where where do we stand on this and for some reason I don't have I don't have the language that you are proposing board

[02:07:00]
you do not cuz it came to my head at 2:00 this morning so does I'd like to hear from board member Astoria and board member Tom moreto I need to hear the language again because that was a lot of discussion period action by the superintendent yeah I'm fine with that language and it kind of follows the theme that other suggested and other parts of the government's Manual of understanding that the board does board stuff and not administrative stuff so it's

[02:08:00]
it's similar language that's fine with me and so are you saying that where do we stick this language and if you wouldn't mind repeating restart our intended solely for so first my suggestion is to include it on page one after number five so it would be the new number six and it would be rfi's are intended solely to address board member inquiries and do not direct or imply action by the superintendent and do not apply or do not direct or imply

[02:09:00]
action by the superintendent OK Google where do we send those because when we read I think at that time we were reading something from someone in special education

[02:10:00]
and how is that formatted but I know when I do get hold of the superintendent it's more of whether it's special education I send those directly to her I don't I just I just send them there's no response needed but mine is primarily special education and also processes and questioning because when it comes to the law that's you know other than that that's the way I the majority of my communications to putting this language in after number five creating a new number six and then adjusting home numeration after that

[02:11:00]
okay you can sleep soundly now board member Jackson this is how I have fun these days Okay so we've got that language coming on page one after number five it's the new number six and we have in number three on the same page board members will make a good face effort to and then continue with the rest of that evaluate the necessity urgency alignment blah blah blah so we've got that edit we've got the numbers and actually

[02:12:00]
we took care of the number 5 at readily available is readily accessible and and number 8 edit on page two we've scratched out a future and we have the next board agenda and the very last section and with a discussion coming up regarding media correct Secretary of Georgia how do we how do we create this what is this motion look like

[02:13:00]
did I get everything I think you got everything and most of that is in the Action Memo too so we can reference the Action Memo and then add the couple other ones that we did with the well I think yes I think we have to my account one two edits on page 1 1/20

[02:14:00]
Brent okay and so I need a motion to to bring this discussion to a close so actually I need an amended motion but I can't remember did I make the original motion or did the original motion sorry for that just to help you out number three and page one number new

[02:15:00]
play number six two an added to number 822 all right so I want to amend my emotion to approve the addition of section 4 or request for information

[02:16:00]
Coliseum process to the aps Board of Education governance manual including page one edit number 3 page one adding a new number 6 page two editing number 8 all changes that were discussed and agreed upon by the board this is board member benevida I will second this is board member Jackson OK Google yes finally our next item is to discuss the aps Board of Education governance manual and it says I'm the presenter but I think I need

[02:17:00]
to First have the ad hoc committee present its process and and the process for for the manual that is before us I can do that we'll start with the process and then we can go into some of the suggestions the whole governance manual review goes back to last year and also bear with me because I'm having a hard time breathing these days but just to go back from the beginning I know there was a request from the policy committee to do a governance manual review around August of last year that was taken to the executive committee and that is reflected in the September

[02:18:00]
notes for the executive committee we had a policy meeting in September and it was told to us by executive committee that there would be a full board governance manual review scheduled for November so with that policy committee still met we did some revisions to the to the governance manual we then had a November meeting that were the full board met and we created a survey the survey was then submitted and completed December 6th by by most board members the ad hoc committee met to go over the server results before The Retreat on the 20th and during that meeting there was suggestions from board members on Spotify the survey results that

[02:19:00]
in process because there was the policy committee that was a meeting for the governance manual board member tomari to and also Benavides had some concerns and suggestions that were also put in that survey that we wanted to discuss at The Retreat what happened at The Retreat on December 20th was not fully what we expected as ad hoc committee because we wanted more discussion on some of those items that were more suggestions I mean concerns and not suggestions so that was something that we wanted to get back to and we can go through that as we go to the governance manual actually going back before The Retreat on the 20th we had a December 18th meeting where there was a unanimous vote to pull policy or part of the government's manuals ijk off of consent agenda so that the full board can review those with the governance manual so then we looked at that on The Retreat on the 20th and we gave

[02:20:00]
our suggestions from the survey and what that look like where we had our sticky notes and again we wish that we had more discussion around that process because that was our intention as that how committee but that did not happen so during the break there was a chance for all board members to send in some more suggestions questions that they had on the governance manual and that was due in January so after that the ad hoc met again and we spent over four hours reviewing each government's manual that was submitted To Us by the board members with their edits and what we did was created a table of suggestions around those those results so that's what we'll be looking at today is the tables some of those suggestions and what that looks like and I know that I met to go over that beforehand and she also made sure that this new document of the governance manual that you all received for this meeting

[02:21:00]
has that policy language that we that we talked about before the governance manual review so and she can talk about that as well in that process but that's the document that you will have now but I know that's kind of like all over the place because it was a long a long process coming so is there any questions on like what that looks like before I go into the table so I just I just have a question I appreciate it I guess my question on this particular agenda item is for YouTube's because we are doing a full discussion of the board governance manual

[02:22:00]
on Wednesday at the board meeting with the full board you know I know there's five of us here but it's not the full bored I guess I'm wondering why we're going to go through a discussion of the government's manual tonight when we are when we need to when we're going to do that again on Wednesday combined with the fact that we can't actually make any changes tonight because the agenda has already been posted for the Wednesday board meeting so I wonder for like efficiency say if it makes more sense for us to postpone this discussion until Wednesday when the full board meets so I'm happy I'm happy so I'd like okay

[02:23:00]
how do other people feel about that I'm curious about the rules surrounding the the first read the second read the timing of that where this is concerned and also Community input I just want to make sure we're not inadvertently you know preaching those and but I don't know what they are so I'm just throwing it out there so we're in Jackson can help me with this but I believe the first read was when we brought those survey results to The Retreat on December 20th and then we were supposed to have a second read right with the first policy meeting of the Year okay so the survey

[02:24:00]
there was an opportunity to provide comment so the first opportunity to provide comment was from November to December so we got the first set of comments that were the the survey results the the so the what okay what was so what was the December 6th the survey right right so that was the one that was the service that actually created and yeah and then we got those results and then from

[02:25:00]
Maps when did we get those results so the survey happened on the 6th and then it was published got the survey results and that's when we created our document that we shared with you all for the December 20th Retreat so right so it came November was the first there was an opportunity to comment via the survey from November to December 6th a question about November I'm just trying to get the timeline here correct so in November at November on the floor so we can just have a second to that motion

[02:26:00]
listen to postpone then we can have this discussion I will second board members Jackson's motion to postpone for clarification sake we are motioning to table a discussion I am motioning to postpone this discussion item 5.1 to Wednesday February 5th because it is already listed as a discussion action item on the February 5th Board of Education because and does that I just want clarity about this from parliamentarians and other board members understanding

[02:27:00]
does that preclude us from discussing what we are what we dove into you we can just are you asking me I'm asking everybody with their understanding is so my understanding is that we are having a discussion on the motion to postpone so any in in in in in in in in concert with that the reason for having a motion to postpone is because even if we were to continue on with the discussion of the governance manual we would not be able to make any changes or amendments to the government's manual because the governance manual has already been placed on the full board agenda for Wednesday so to stick with

[02:28:00]
who am I to give the community their opportunity to comment on the board the governance manual as listed on the agenda we can't make changes now because we wouldn't have the 72 hours that we would need to have to have it posted so the overall point is that any discussion that we have on the government's manual right now would be futile and inefficient because we couldn't make any changes to the government's manual anyway without violating oh I what I heard and that that picked my interest was that on the 5th there will be a 30-day public input on Wednesday well because that's a public meeting right like the Board of Education meeting is on

[02:29:00]
Wednesday that is where public forum occurs that's where if the public has any sort of input on the on any of the agenda items on Google one the governance manual all the things that are already listed that's their opportunity to come and make input at public forum the governance manual should be finalized and moving forward after Wednesday so understanding all that which means that we would table all discussions

[02:30:00]
may I have a roll call vote then we need clarification from 4:00 so we have emotions and I understand if we do have a discussion we can't change anything if you vote in favor of the Oceanside on what we want to do so if there's concerns we can talk about it now before roll call right and so I think we've gone through this and then I asked the question that's what we have been doing all night long

[02:31:00]
which is somebody made an emotion right right for to act on and we got a second exactly let me clarify my motion is to postpone discussion on the governance manual until the 5th not supposed to discussion on the government's manual its to postpone discuss until Wednesday until February 5th the Amendments the actual amendments language of the manual so because everything that's listed in the alley committee meeting that exact document is already on the board AG

[02:32:00]
weather for Wednesday so we will have this discussion on Wednesday with the full board president I'm saying it doesn't make sense to have this discussion now and again on Wednesday yes I'm just getting clear about what discussion we're going to have after the vote right because that's what promotion is to postpone until Wednesday so we're going to proceed with and I think that answered your question we are now ready to

[02:33:00]
who are the roll call vote Dr Albright Pinellas Florida and so we will have a discussion about the manual and we were talking about so I agree let's make this some let's make this surgical so what topics do we want to address now in order to

[02:34:00]
keep it productive well I would like to just go through the table that the ad hoc created because that shows most of the changes that would be brought up okay so there's a suggestion that we go through the table I need to take a restroom break or a water break I think we should because one of our members is not here so yes okay so we will be right back in 5 minutes

[02:44:00]
board member tomaricho you are here right yes okay so I'll wait for superintendent Blakey and okay and Dr Albright are you with us I am okay great then I think we will proceed after that quick break here's what I'd like to call because we don't need to prolong this we heard from at hawk chair astorga she reviewed the process and so

[02:45:00]
I'd like to hear from other board members and their response to board member asparagus outline of the timeline so and then we I agree I think we should Reserve our conversation or review and discussion about proposed amendments to Wednesday so we'll make this short and sweet I hope so I want to allow board member Benavides this one more time to recap your questions

[02:46:00]
there a lot of people on this call thank you for being here but I don't want this to go all night I just want to go back to my original question I want to make sure that we are not reaching the first read second read and ignoring Community input on this process if I can be sure that we've done that then you know I'm good yes my questions I have two of them the first one is as I'm looking here at the summary of governance manual suggestions this is the first time I've ever seen this other times it's been coming to the point where the clear understanding of first second and third read wherever

[02:47:00]
I'm really clarified and this document right now is pretty easy to read but I haven't seen this at all in any other documents that were put before us or even the qualify it as first second and committee read my second question is I would like to know how the ad hoc committee you served power over a standing committee and how this automatically went to the board I find that we're one not following our own proper governance practices that we have in place and all the sudden this is totally a big surprise so that's how I'm going to leave it thank you and I just want to point out a few things

[02:48:00]
community members can look at that and if they have any comments questions or concerns they can always email us or come to public comment just like any other agenda item so that's how we would get that so throughout this process it's been public the notes have been public the survey results were also on diligent things like that so that's how we would get input if

[02:49:00]
take it to community because this is for board members it's not something that we are putting towards the district and I don't know if member Jackson you have any to add for that is there any follow-up you know you summed it up is there any follow-up question for that board member going to be this that's great thank you of course and then tell me to so this document that you see in front of you with the table is something that board member Jackson and I created just to clarify some of those results I know that it's a lot to look at when you're looking at the entire governance manual with all of the updates and striking different colors so we definitely wanted to make it more clear like you're saying this was supposed to be presented to you all the first policy meeting of the year we just didn't get enough we didn't get to it because it wasn't enough time so

[02:50:00]
does would have already been presented to you all before the board meeting on Wednesday so we would have had a month to look at it before but since we didn't we ran out of time and we didn't go over it that's why you probably didn't see it or yeah so I just wanted to clarify that for you I don't know if you have any follow-up questions very confusing but then all of a sudden now we have a document so that's what I'm trying to understand because the reason we gave you the full governance manual document so that you can see explicitly where those changes occurred and you can have that document and we realized it was even hard for

[02:51:00]
change the the method and the other thing when we're talking about Community especially when we went into the goals and there was specific things that I know that were said about changing them and I know people don't want to change them but my concern there is a particular voice was not included in clarifying those goals and that was another reason why and I'm sure on Wednesday I will state that point as a discussion but it's I'm just rather shocked and I'm only going to say that because as in my second question it was just about how did the ad hoc committee you serve its particular Powers over a standing committee when we already have these government's policies in place and why did it all of a sudden change yeah good question so we actually did not

[02:52:00]
see this committee at all when we had our full board meeting there was an ask for this ad hoc committee to be created and there was asked for members to nominate themselves to be on it so that's how that came about so anything that we did we already knew we would bring it to policy committee and we would have discussion here first so in no way is that a hawk committee like overriding any of the work of the policy committee has done we were just an Avenue to make sure that everybody's voice was heard well reviewing the government's manual the other my other question is then why does why is it going to the board directly and not going to the policy committee it was going to it's already been on the policy committee but like it was already said last meeting it was on the agenda and we didn't get to it so that's why we're doing it this meeting and it's just so happens to be so close to the regular Board of Education meeting because it was on the implementation

[02:53:00]
calendar to have it reviewed already this month yeah but why the rush also when we were finding out that this document in itself and its present form was never presented this way in the beginning or in our first and second reads why I wasn't presented this way because again this was something that we created to change methods but feeling rushed it just happens to be like that in our implementation calendar and I would also really like the full board to be able to have conversations about this I wanted it to be her last name so it's not something that we intentionally rushed it just played out that way because of the way the committee meetings were set up but you also just stated you were rushed I said it feels rushed and I think I also want to go back to our Retreat meeting and I feel like most board members feel this way we did not have enough time in the retreat for as much discussion

[02:54:00]
and as we would have liked for the governance manual that was part of the ad hocks intention was to have a longer discussion at that Retreat and that's something that our coach also mentioned to is that that would have been a better place to have more of that conversation for that first time that we all got together that also just didn't happen so I share your sentiments it feels like it's a lot but we also have deadlines and processes that I want to agree with me because I'm going on leave so that's one of my my things too as I want to be able to be involved in these processes while I'm here well and you know the question too just to the December 21st if it was critical that we were to review with the ad hoc was putting together why wasn't that conversation held with Ashley for that whole agenda on the 21st

[02:55:00]
well it was on the agenda it just wasn't as it wasn't as much time as we had liked so well and I think that's it that's something that we did but that's the that's where the conversations break down and if it's you know and I'm trying to understand what the council great City Schools presenting and doing what they were doing I just don't understand why you guys were cut off and put it at the end and that was not definitely decided on but I don't think it should be at the cost of us not being able to read and do what we needed to do in a timely manner and I don't know why we're cutting that time because if it was the you know if the great City Schools took away that time I think they need to be stated that we shouldn't be penalized to get this done and get it to a vote when they said he gave us that

[02:56:00]
I'm in the beginning I wanted to in regards to the retreat I think that the the point of the retreat was was twofold right like there were a couple of agenda items on there and part of it was just a reiteration of sosg and was that board member request of can we have like a reminder or a primer on on you know board responsibilities as it relates to student outcomes Focus governance and I think whether intentional or not that discussion went longer than intended and that is why the board governance manual discussion just got pushed to the end I don't think it was intentional on on anybody's part it's just that the first part of the

[02:57:00]
the discussion just went a little bit longer will board member Jackson I am going to disagree because I feel if this was an important matter that discussion should have been hell with Ashley so that we could have had that time and did what's needed now like I said before I feel like we're paying the price because now we have a deadline to meet and we have all of these other things and we're rushing this when that meeting should have slowly been intended for us to discuss this matter and I don't know why it was not the focus so I'm going to thank you so I appreciate appreciate the point that you are making it sounds like we all could have used a little more time management

[02:58:00]
in this process and if we didn't take the first few steps and talk about the proposed changes the way we should have we did have a policy meeting where we could have done this and we decided that the meeting was only going to be an hour long and we didn't get to it and we didn't also ask at the end of that meeting because his work is so important nobody brought it up and said can we extend this meeting because we really need to get to this we know what the inflammation implementation timeline was going to be on the agenda for this week so this is a lesson in time management I think we all can take and hopefully we can learn from that thank you and so I'm going to make my comments I don't expect a response but I I am concerned when I hear that the discussion

[02:59:00]
was here at the policy committee that there that there was as much discussion that phrased there is at the there wasn't as much discussion as we would have liked at the 20th December Workshop I want to be really clear we have not had any discussion about any of the Amendments and what I have heard so so first of all that does that means that we do not have a first read yet because the first meeting and I'm reading from the what I want to point out finally a clean copy and it's 8:00 because I have eight copies of

[03:00:00]
of this manual that the ad hoc committee has worked hard on I don't dismiss how hard you have worked on it but everything that followed from the December 20th meeting has been for not because we cannot in good conscience say that we have had a first meeting it says here the proposal will be presented as a discussion item along with any objectives or rationale for the proposed policy and how it satisfies the boards identified scope number two under first meeting once reviewed by the policy committee the proposed new policy will be made available for public review and comment for 30 days or until the next regularly scheduled policy committee meeting the public comment period will provide an opportunity for formal

[03:01:00]
potential changes to the proposed policy that has not been we have not had this clean copy for 30 days nor has the public and I would argue that this becomes super important in this election year because it sends a message about what the expectations are and and what are values are and I have taken issue with much of the language particularly in 4G and I also want to just point out that we made agreements back in November with strategy should the committee use to solicit feedback we settled on a survey the second

[03:02:00]
was I will feel that this has been a fair and inclusive process if if I can be included as much as I want to be as long as everyone is heard equally and I don't feel like I have been heard equally I did provide very specific language in on the survey and I want to remind everybody we were told that the first two questions were the most important that everything that followed was optional those were the coaches words there was never any mention about specific language the questions were suggestions offer your suggestions and so I offered you know we're missing meaningful tribal consult

[03:03:00]
the board president Authority revisit to clarify and or change at least to responsibilities the appointment of APs board members to outside board of directors such as nmsba Council of great City schools these should be voted on by the entire APS board I mean that's pretty specific the aps board member representative to these outside boards should articulate and vote the will of the aps board not the will of one particular officer that's pretty specific APS voting member should allow judicious temperament and representing the aps Board of Education should practice the student outcomes tenants of resolving questions and or conflicts before accessing a lawyer should be available to all board members oh sorry that was two different specific languages

[03:04:00]
restorative practices mediators should be used for conflict resolution I mention that the community engagement and Outreach with the targeted populations of the Martinez and yassi Community must be improved so I don't see I don't feel heard and so I do have I think if we had had time to truly discuss on November or sorry December 20th we could have these out and clarified the process and I'm with board member so I think you put it well we are paying the price for poor coaching and it really does call into question the professionalism and ability of the council

[03:05:00]
and that's that's all I'm going to say I don't think we need to I don't expect an answer tonight and I will say that specifically just a lot of the points that you mentioned as you were as you were speaking which I appreciate thank you for that what we did is anything that was concrete from the server results I gave us suggestions went into that first that first page or governance manual packet that you all got so specifically a lot of your answers said in process you had nothing that was specific I could Implement and we can go through that

[03:06:00]
if there was time that first meeting in January to go over the other suggestions that you did give in the governance manual you would see that they are reflected in not only that full governance manual with a lot of edits but also a lot of them are reflected in the suggestions so the tribal consultation the changing of the goals and the goals and adding language those are reflected so I wanted to make clear that we tried our best to make sure everybody is input was there and it was different processes that it went through again if we would have been able to discuss this you would have seen that in a different light so I share your sentiment that this probably didn't go as we wanted to go and not as planned so that everybody feels included but the process that we use definitely was and again I'm willing to me with any board member who feels like they were heard to make sure that they know

[03:07:00]
is there a voice was was implemented and I want to recognize what you just said you know when you and I met after the last board policy committee meeting on the 23rd those that discussion those items are those changes are reflected but what I just read from was the specifics here these were registered the survey and so this was you know this is dating Back to December 6th I had specific language it was in the first two categories which again our coach told us you don't have to go beyond the first two questions everything else is optional so because I was

[03:08:00]
is limited on time and wanting to submit something what I chose to do was put my specific language under the second question the board's overall in terms of the boards overall governing manual what do you think are the three weakest aspects of the manual that's where I chose to put my specifics and I understand I understand that you have been put in a difficult situation but I agree that we the aps Board of Education should not pay the price for four coaching for guidance and and that is in fact what is happening and I'm I'm

[03:09:00]
very concerned very concerned about it all because it put you in a bad situation but it certainly most definitely puts this governance manual in a tough situation and one more one more thing and then I'll bring it to her arrest if we're going to demand that restorative practices be implemented in APS if we ask that of teachers of students of Administrators then we most certainly as a board should be practicing the same thing and so I promised that this would be short and sweet and board member benefits you asked to keep it to 10 minutes we are at 8:25 which is well over 10 minutes and board member

[03:10:00]
Jackson I will recognize you but I'll give you one minute to make a statement thank you so much I just want to commend board member astorga for taking the reins on that discussion I appreciate her succinct analysis of our process and I do feel there is an underlying believe that not all of the board members survey results and or suggestions were Incorporated and I want to publicly State here and I will do it again on Wednesday that we were thorough we were honest we took the suggestions as they were giving to us and had we had the opportunity

[03:11:00]
at the last policy meeting to get into the full discussion on the governance manual had we planned to do I think that a lot of the concerns that you are addressing tonight could have been alleviated but we were not given that opportunity to board member benefits this point and we probably should have recognized that and and asked that we continue that discussion at the policy meeting we did not but the truth is is we as a board made a decision back in November that we wanted the governance manual done now and so that's what we're going to do we're going to have the discussion and then we're going to move forward so I just want to clarify we were very honest and very forthright I don't want to be cut off with that I like I don't think

[03:12:00]
play that's not fair you're making an accusation and we put our best effort forward in the two reviews that we did as an ad hoc committee for this governance manual and I will state the exact same thing that board member historica said if anybody has questions about why something was in there or not please ask me I would be happy to have that conversation so I'm going to move on to the chair report the action items approved at today or today's meeting will be on the agenda for the March 5th Board of Education meeting the governance manual discussion prepares us to vote on the manual at the Board of Education

[03:13:00]
we did not have a board policy committee discussion and and so it's questionable whether we are prepared but we will end up voting on the manual at the Board of Education meeting this Wednesday February 5th we will not meet in March due to the legislative session are for policy analyst and superintendent are stretched thin these days I do want to Circle back to my first point the action items approved today will be on the agenda for March 5th Board of Education meeting on the website for 30 days

[03:14:00]
cheap for others to look at for the public to look at or will that come Dominguez I think that we already discussed that member historico explain that because this is board policy and not APS policy that the way I understood it is it doesn't necessarily need to be OK Google oh no no no no no no no no no I'm talking about so policy analyst I need your help here or Doctor Albright so in the next 30 days will

[03:15:00]
count as the public feedback period if pending Madam chair pending approval of proposed revisions tomorrow at the board meeting it could be posted for 30 days for public comment yes or are we talking about the are we talking about the the policy diet approvals tonight but the RFI the RFI amendments are very good so I just want that clearly stated for the public

[03:16:00]
and as far as the governance manual edits those are the clean copy is available for viewing and for the next 2 days and I'll leave it at that thank you will be Monday April 7th at 5:15 virtually and you can watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that we are adjourned thank you and
