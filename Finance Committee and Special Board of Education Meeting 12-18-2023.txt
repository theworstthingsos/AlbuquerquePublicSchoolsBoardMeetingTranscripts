[00:12:00]
Nikki office pleasure to be before you we were hoping we would continue with the Run of approvals but here we are happy to answer the questions before I answered before I defer to the response for that question I would just like to recognize the team before you who worked really hard to get here and they've taken a lot of input from the board over the last few cycles for the adoption of instructional materials and I'm just very proud of them I'm going to defer to our director for instructional materials who can speak a little bit about the process and get to some of your questions thank you Doctor Gonzalez president members of the board member Peterson I am delighted to answer this question because I think we have indeed worked incredibly hard to really really live the portals and guard rails and the principles of high quality instructional materials

[00:13:00]
one of the ways that we've done that especially with Elementary where one teacher will be teaching Ela SLA and ELD is the working group and steering committee at the elementary level that contained together more than 100 teachers District staff representatives from lce special education and Dean edit title one day they developed this really exceptional scoring tool that had I believe 10 factors I'm not looking at it right now so that might be incorrect but each one that we asked teachers to look at it every stage and give evidence there were also is a part of the bottom for and you know for bilingual class classrooms for English Learners like through that perspective so we didn't only look at the strength of the Spanish language arts materials or that you know he'll be materials or supports for students and special education

[00:14:00]
looked at everything together when we're looking at representation how is that for our students in bilingual programs when we're looking at is this going to encourage our students to collaborate with each other we looked at that in terms of you know the ELA and the SLA we had the opportunity to do field testing for the first time and that was amazing we got such incredible Rich information from the field testers that not only helped us be confident in our recommendation but I truly believe will help us build continue to build because we have obviously started working on how to implement we have all this information on how it works and the feedback we got from Pilot teachers they loved it we made sure that we had bilingual program teachers as field testers we made sure that they were students there were special education teachers

[00:15:00]
we we did our level best although there is always more to do and if there is something that we have missed please tell us because that is how we are growing so we do want to know if there's anything we've missed so we can do it better next time but we worked really hard on that and I want to thank all of the teachers and community members and everybody that gave input and every possible way to help just get so much input they're always be more input but those are some of the things that we did I think having a chance to Pilot it even with the limited number of teachers is really important so I'm happy to hear that I think that's all I have for the moment in case someone else wants to ask you a question any other questions well I

[00:16:00]
I sent my question in and got the response today so thank you thank you for that and I want to build on what you just said the difference between the information that we've received for this adoption is Light Years different than the information that we received two years ago so it is very obvious the work that you guys have put into this even you know with the with me asking just the questions about the graph right yes thank you for thank you for for being willing to say you know what that something that we missed and we'll build on that for next for next time so I think that with each process that you guys have gone through it is getting better and better which is then alleviating the need for us to ask so many questions because the information that you have presented is

[00:17:00]
it is amazing and the one thing that I just wanted to highlight I don't know who put together this document but it was exceptional whoever responded to this it was exceptional I just want to point out it said building on trust and engagement created in previous Cycles we've now done one cycle at every level and believe that our changes in behavior and process May encourage teachers to be more interested in changing their behaviors and processes as we all work together to improve student outcomes I don't think you could have said it better we're all trying to change our behaviors what happens in the boardroom happens at the curriculum development happens as we move down so I appreciate the information and I just kudos to you you guys have obviously put in a lot of hard work to to get to this point so thank you I wanted to comment

[00:18:00]
the following piece at well actually you repeat this idea twice building on trust and engagement and that is critical if we are to move the needle on a professional development and of course we know that when there is that engagement of teachers I think great things happen in the classroom where they're supposed to have happened there and and the fact that this is a goal write future goal so thank you any other questions were mostly around anticipation of delays you know do we anticipate what that may look like because we're not going to actually even be implementing until you'll be late and I know that we've already been through a

[00:19:00]
we've adopted something and we're in the process of of implementing and so I'm curious you know as we're watching ourselves get a new one adopt a new one and actually implemented have you noticed what are you noticing around that piece of adoption that hopefully we may need to take you know into this next round aside from it maybe being delayed from the publisher Madam chair board members and teachers are giving us a very specific and positive feedback about the professional development that were putting in place for Odell now and then we have plans already to start with with approval to move forward with Middle School implementation and professional development this semester and I think were noticing the fruits of our labors the

[00:20:00]
adoption team did a great job of enlisting input participation and engagement from all stakeholders and it's really helped break down silos that that we function under in the past and we now collaborate from professional development to adoption to just creating documents I'm making sure that each department has their lens over the work we're doing because we all share the same desire for student outcomes and we know that that's part of the behavior change that we need to make in order to result in positive student now comes thank you so did I have a motion I do not okay so I will move to approve the district purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for high-quality instructional material program for K through five English language arts English language arts in English language

[00:21:00]

[00:22:00]
and I'm happy to answer questions no excerpts music to my ears as an English teacher finally yes any other questions had a really strong writing component in it and that really caught my eye because this is a second language Learners lots of times the way they really grapple

[00:23:00]
did language and the the alphabetic system is from their writing and so I'm curious if if one of the programs we selected was it I think it was good in the butt in the Middle School selection is there riding component Madam chair members of the board for Peterson I am texting one of our middle the middle school program that was available for public review I'm just going to let Merry Christmas thank you for that question and yes this has a very strong writing component to board member Peterson it is teachers and differentiates based on

[00:24:00]
teachers are special ed teachers we even have an inclusion teacher and a special ed teacher who have used it they said their kids were writing more than they've ever written when it asks for 120 words some of their kids were submitting three or four hundred words so it was amazing for them surreal books and writing 200 250.000 dollars for high quality instructional materials program for 638 English language arts second house Danielle Gonzales yes Whitney

[00:27:00]

[00:28:00]
I'm happy to answer any questions I'll move your approval of the November 2023 cash disbursements this is Danielle I have a roll call please Danielle Gonzales Robert Peterson is discussion it's an update on the fiscal year 2024 budget and are presenters and Toya and I also see renette papa here with her as well thank you I am here to present an update on the fiscal year 2024 budget next so in this presentation and an appointment 25 projected

[00:29:00]
and then an update to our SF buns you'll see in this operational budget wheel in December we will we are working on the templates the budget templates that will be going out we're changing states making necessary adjustments and testing for any changes to ensure the formulas are working correctly and then the next slide is our budget versus actual so that First Column the 923 594 386 is the budget that we had for this fiscal year are you today at expenditures or 316 million 938,596 and we have encumbered 528 million + 743

[00:30:00]
743 773 and then our balance if you'll notice has gone down significantly from last time it's 76992 2:49 and I just wanted to make sure that I clarify that the balance is what is left to spend this fiscal year from January 2024 to June 2024 and it is our hope that we will spend all of that money down and so we have the analysts are working with the schools and departments to remind them of any remaining funds that have been encumbered and haven't been used yet and and we're hoping that will utilize all the things that were given to each of the departments in schools so the next slide

[00:31:00]
is looks like a busy slide it's our projected revenue and as I think Julian mentioned last time and there's a lot of different parts that affect the revenue there are two portions that we have received now that are actual numbers that we can put in there one of them was the TCI index and the other is the national board certified number that number is has gone down from 5703 to 3390 so you know there's a lot of different things that could affect this one of them is probably a lot of retirements possibly and the newer teachers that are coming in may not yet the national airport certified so there's probably going to be a little dip and then hopefully next year we'll see that number go up again but

[00:32:00]
listen this budget that's in white it'll it's just a projected Revenue so far but you know each little item is we get more information will be updating it and then we'll have a better number it's still more projecting that it'll still be higher than last year's Revenue just due to we're hoping that the unit value will increase just because we've had a lot of people out there you know letting legislators know that the answer is coming and hopefully they'll help us with a little bit of that and plus we already know that couple of things have been mentioned the possibility of 4% increase it because it all comes into this these numbers so that's it for that one and then

[00:33:00]
next one this is pretty exciting cuz it's our Sr funds update and one thing that you will notice is that we are moving along quite well we have 83% of the budget either spent or encumbered and so that's that's pretty good cuz we still have 6 months to go and the ones that and we still have a lot of individuals we have been meeting with each of the Departments that have part of this budget and everyone has said you know their getting those pills in there and so next month hopefully for at least the following month you'll see almost all of the budgets and covered the nice thing is we're seeing some that budget remaining is really going down there's zero in the other locations which is the charter school allocation and it's going really well and we feel like we will be at the point where we will have

[00:34:00]
spent all of the funds that were given to us and with that I stand for questions oh stop it up to the floor I have a question so on the slide 5 where it's the whole budget where it's broken down by the different areas where where does the top schools fit into that how are they funded with with and like is that coming in at the I'm just I'm just curious if you see these well yeah I'm pretty sure it's in that tier 2 is like kind of plus what we received for the additional you know going to the 10:40 and then any

[00:35:00]
National things in the top since they had additional days and hours they gave us a little bit extra for that okay so that's where it kind of comes in and so this particular funding is is dependent on whether they're going to continue that right so they gave us Grace with this and said we'll have the additional hours for everybody but if they go beyond that 11:40 This Is How They funded it yeah what what happens is that is right now it is it's where cuz we made it go an extra year because it was pretty much going to be going away so but it did help us that little tiny bit to give us a little bump in our Revenue but yeah moving forward and you know we're not sure exactly what

[00:36:00]
we're going to be able to keep moving forward and I don't know if you wanted to but we do have some schools that will be impacted potentially because the cliff is coming and they wouldn't be funded going forward with that Tops Model yeah and it's all going to a lot of it will depend also upon the calendar that we have and you know there's a lot of different little factors that will add into this okay so at this point in time it is mostly funded through operational

[00:37:00]
to look for additional revenue and some of them are looking into the community schools that in that in the second year of implementation that funding could be allowed to support the extended day and they're also looking into the MRI CSI Otzi funding which we have been communicated that if they fall under any of those they can use the funding for to continue their top programs frustrations with that is the when we invest and there's progress then the progress means that the support that actually got them there goes away and that's something that I mean this year after year after year with education

[00:38:00]
as soon as as soon as it's working it's somehow there's this belief that that can continue without the support so I mean that's just something for those of us that are in a position to be talking to legislators and other folks with we need to be doing because we know you are doing everything you can to work magic I do have some more questions at the New Mexico Taxation Research Institute so they're listening that I have is on the either before or after school programs are those also covered under Esser so that would be the middle

[00:39:00]
school before school program how did we find that one so have there been conversations in terms of what would happen with the calendar it just depends on the calendar I was supposed so that before school programming which as I understand has been really instrumental and helping our kiddos because of that late start so curious about where that would fit so that would be another one that's okay that's what I thought then another question so we've noticed that you said hopefully they get that but what's the deadline for incumbents for schools both I mean so we have this deadline to encumber because if we don't encumber then we have the opportunity to flex it around and move around but as I understand with Esser it's really hard

[00:40:00]
play cuz you have to go through lots of lots of doors and windows and channels to get it approved so what's our what's our drop dead date on that have everything in comfort and by February okay so that's like that's pretty that's coming up quickly so if it's encumbered by February we still would have that is not yet fully confirmed by New Mexico is 93224 liquidated by 10:31 2024 you could go to even come to the board with things in one month so for us we're saying that the deadline is way sooner than that yeah and the deadline to bill for it for him

[00:41:00]
is November 1st by 5:00 p.m. so the turnaround time with me on a manageable okay so because it and I'm just thinking ahead for the board is really looking at what what balances we have left right so that we can make sure we can either put them in quickly to something else because I understand that that process to get it approved has to go through many channels before it can even get approved correct it's very tight very tight yes for anything over 5,000 we have to submit a form to ped they have to give us approval we have to wait for their approval once we get their approval then we can start moving forward then of course we have to bring it to the board we have to yes so there's there's a lot of things that you know the purchase requisition has to be put into place depending on how they're going to find that so yeah

[00:42:00]
so it's we're hoping that everybody has everything in by February so probably in the March 4th we should see those almost everything and covered that's our hope okay well hopefully there's a lot of conversation going on about like really pressing because if it's not spent its or there's not a plan for it it's the chances of that even getting approved are going to be slim to none okay and then just this naively you know because the board certification numbers were down for the teachers and you had said new teachers and I just don't understand this part for teachers who have national board certification do they have to do anything to maintain that licensure or is it just once they have board certification it's done I don't I don't I don't know that so I was wondering if there was continuing at that was required or something and you know is there something that perhaps was also a limiting factor for that

[00:43:00]
Dr Blakey there is a recertification process or national board certified teachers I believe that it is every 10 years okay all right and so I would assume there's a cost to that correct there is and it's quite comprehensive and detailed in presenting essentially A Renewed portfolio Okay of illustration of their professional practice that's involved as part of the recertification so it would be interesting to know if that drop included some of those folks right that either needed to go through that recertification process and couldn't do it or for some reason that there was something that lapse I mean just be curious about that that was what struck me a little bit because that's a that's a pretty big drop that's a significant drop and I'm just curious how much of that was attributed to people you know retiring with us but how much of that was also attributed to folks who just chose not

[00:44:00]
but I am curious if the schedule this year especially for elementary school is making it harder for people to deal with that portfolio because there's there's a lot I was just it was just a big number any other questions all right thank you so much right so our next finance committee meeting will be Wednesday January 24th 2023 at 5 p.m. will be held here in the Allison Bruce King educational complex

[00:45:00]
