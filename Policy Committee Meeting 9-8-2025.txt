[00:03:00]
is at the discretion of the chair I was not given that discretionary decision however I completely agree with that decision to remove gatekeeping language no one board member or chair should have the discretion to circumvent public comment in fact I look forward to the same implementation of the policy to all other committees including executive committee at hot committees audit and finance committees and so with that I'd like to welcome our public forum guests when you signed up to speak you were asked to review rules expectations which our presiding officer well I will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agenda specified in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public

[00:07:00]
according to US News & World reports out of over 35,000 public high schools in Texas in the nation rather than eliminate the opportunity for our community to excel you should celebrate

[00:08:00]

[00:09:00]

[00:10:00]
1000 charter schools in APS when considering you change thank you thank you Mr Brown our next speaker is Matthew Paul Matthew are you there yes I am so you'll have one minute of the policy committee my name is Matt Paul I'm the executive director of public charter schools in New Mexico it was a shock to read the policy committees agenda last week first because it doesn't match the tenor and intent from the Board of Education from the past handful to dozen of months and secondly because it reads as a blatant attack on Charter Schools it's probably in particular because it goes directly what families want and what's good for students charter schools are achieving it consistently higher levels than traditional district schools and reading math and science and most notably with low income students and over 70% of New Mexico families have an overwhelmingly positive view of our schools and want more of them not West in August when the Board of Education took up the issue of aligning

[00:11:00]
Charter contracts with the district it was largely met with confusion because you have the mechanisms you need to do this already however right now it appears that that resolution was meant as a trojan horse to allow the committee to discuss how to eliminate and reduce Charter Schools as its present in your agenda I hope today is conversation is consistent with your previous engagement with Charter Schools one that supports all students in Albuquerque regardless of which public school they choose Thank you thank you sir our next speaker and we're proud to be one of the highest performing schools in New Mexico I'd like to take the next 45 seconds to answer four of the technical questions raised on the

[00:12:00]
agenda today so what is the benefit of APs authorization for Charters will you get to join a family of schools United by the mission of raising student achievement and you get access to the states best authorizing entity the aps charter school office led by Dr Joseph Escobedo what's the benefit of APs of authorizing Charter Schools imagine a portfolio of schools that includes a National Blue Ribbon School closing achievement gaps for economically disadvantaged students at triple the rate of traditional schools that's a win for the district and for kids what is fair language for a moratorium well you simply cannot write Fair language for something that isn't fair limiting school choice by definition is not Equitable or fair at least now we will continue to serve all students no matter if they're on IEP economically disadvantaged every learner who walks through our doors will receive the same level of Education we're excited to collaborate with anyone who wants to actually partner on policies that raise student achievement thank you thank you sir

[00:13:00]
what's the speaker is Leticia Archuleta Hello Kitty can you hear me okay thank you so much and policy committee thank you so much for the time this evening I just wanted to share a little bit about our Charter School my name is Dr Leticia I'm the executive director at Health leadership high school and I think when we talked about the policy one of the things that I really want to be able to reflect on is how we can come together as a community to really support students one thing I know positively and to ensure is that every person that's in this space this evening is focused on what's going to be best for students and I think that that's really what we need to focus on when we look at assessments and how we assess student needs as well as Charter School needs to be more mindful about what that looks like right now there are two particular areas and which were assessed one of them being

[00:14:00]
graduation cohort and the other being our NM Vistas and it's not a true reflection of what we do and how we serve students so I really hope that tonight and this evening is an open an opening of a door to be able to come together as a community and work together to support the needs of our students thank you thank you our next speaker is Dominica Travis sorry schools required and recognizing Charters as an essential part of serving families who want options while staying connected to the district 8 PS Charters have created life-changing opportunities for students at risk of dropping out

[00:15:00]
to offering unique one-of-a-kind educational experiences today 1 and 5 APS families chooses an APS Charter School in 82 percent of New Mexicans believe parents deserve more Public School options families are telling you what matters most the ability to choose the school that works for their child reducing these options with those voices and their choices we urge you instead to continue viewing Charters as partners in serving families who want meaningful options while remaining part of the aps family thank you thank you our next speaker is Lisa I believe it's a Meijer so close my area

[00:16:00]
I'm Lisa Miriam director at Digital Arts and Technology Academy and thank you madam chair members of the committee for this opportunity to speak today but I'm not promoting our school but promoting what's best for students families in our community Charter Schools play an important role and enhancing educational opportunities for families across Albuquerque they help ensure that students and families have meaningful options when seeking an educational experience that meets their unique needs interests and passions review our school data as a valuable partner with APS in this work expanding access and creating a more robust and diverse agricultural educational landscape for families with inner city policies that play some new Charter Schools or that seek to reduce existing schools through attrition harm the quality of education for All Families limiting Choice restricts opportunities for students undermines Innovation and

[00:17:00]
works against the goal of building a stronger and more responsive educational system in Albuquerque thank you thank you our next speaker is Zayn rosette you have one minute

[00:18:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:19:00]
thank you again and my parents of a charter school student my daughter goes to Native American Community I'm also an employee at McKinley Middle School educated there and I strongly oppose any policy aimed at reducing the number of public charter schools in Albuquerque Charter Schools like NACA have our meeting the needs that APS does not met and they are helping students achieve academically and culturally not said is nationally recognized for its innovative approach to education in indigenous knowledge language and wellness and has changed lives and create the models that is respected across the country reducing Charter School options would harm families who rely on schools like knock knock and help their children Thrive so please ask you to protect charter schools and the students they said thank you thank you sir our next

[00:20:00]
where is Lori Webster Daniel good evening Madam chair and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity tonight to make public comment my name is Lori Webster I am the director at Mountain mahogany community school and 8:00 p.m. authorized Charter School Mountain mahogany has been authorized by APS for 20 years and we have a long history of mutual cooperation and learning with the district and I asked to recognize the work being done by charter schools in our community and to honor the intent of the charter school law charter school should be authorized based on the Merit of their application and monitored in accordance with their contract APS should not be adopting policies that limit the development of charter schools or seek to reduce the number of existing charter schools

[00:21:00]
all charter school students are public school students and we all share the responsibility for their success and should be working together to make that possible thank you thank you for next speaker is Miller Mahalo I believe a senior at Eastmont High School in San Diego Chargers for the past four years and feel that the ability of school choice has been in me and my peers greatly my Charter School is giving me so many opportunities and a moratorium on Charter School to deny that to so many students now I like to I like to prose three main reasons to why can't the contacts of a moratorium would be unfair and restrictive to students and families so first of all its parents and students Choice family is looking for Alternatives might feel that they are denied options which is extremely unfair along with his

[00:22:00]
equal treatment so existing Charters can operate for their allotted time before renewal but new or seeking renewal Charters are shut out which just seems blatantly unfair and finally freezing Innovation this moratorium has the potential to prevent new models of programs from emerging even if there's a strong Community demand for them not just myself but the whole student body at my charter school has been positively impacted by The Innovation collaboration and dedication to a quality education that East Mountain strive to provide to every single students a more only restrict that access to Quality education for all thank you very much thank you sir her next speaker is Todd news hello thank you so much sir okay thank you madam chair Dominguez and the members of the policy committee my name is Todd Nelson the head of school of New Mexico International School we are a APS Charter School in our 15th year and I will actually be

[00:23:00]
in front of you in about 2 months asking for a renewal of our Charter with you are very proud members of this community we were originally charters in the PEC and we sought reauthorization after our first term because of the community that was available community of leadership that was provided by APS and and we've been very proud members since then so I urge you to not take any action that's going to jeopardize the development of future Charters it's hard to add to what's already been said but a New Mexico is constantly on the list of all over the place where the bottom of this where the bottom of that but not in our Charter School law that's where New Mexico shines and I think we want to promote that and I think APS should be helping promote that thank you so much thank you sir her next speaker is Stephanie Harris beaners

[00:24:00]
thank you thank you thank you to the committee members my name is Stephanie banners I'm a mother of four children who have all benefited from APS charter schools and I currently serve as a government council member at their school so I understand the need and the desire to be fiscally responsible when it comes to educating our students but if it were not for the charter schools in APS my four students would have otherwise been educated and a private school setting or possibly homeschooled and I know that as Mr Paul said earlier over 70% of Albuquerque residents feel the same they want more access not less I am one of those parents on the school I served consistently has a waitlist a family of eager for a place for their own students I'm requesting that the board not considered a moratorium on APS charter school girls on the contrary you were all elected to lead her the vision for a better educational future

[00:25:00]
for all of Albuquerque instead of canceling charter schools that have seen growth and success or hindering new charter schools from taking route and a soil right for Innovation I am among other constituents urge you to further support and encourage the growth of school choice through APS Charter Schools thank you thank you our next speaker is James Nestle Mr Nestle are you there I did on mute myself I'm sorry I am the School board chairman for El Camino Real Academy Charter School in the South Valley I've been an experience board member for over 20 years I have had unfortunate experiences with this Charter authorizer I

[00:26:00]
all of you you are governed by state law I have already been up in Santa Fe when Santa Fe Public Schools and APS tried to place upon Charter Schools a law limiting and putting a moratorium and it failed the reason it failed is it violates the law I suggest board members on this Board review the law for themselves talk to Art Melendez he knows what he's talking about

[00:27:00]
current members of the public policy committee my name is Julia Rivera Tapia and I'm a proud to be an educator with over 20 years of experience and most of the mother of three remarkable children who are all on IEPs for 15 of my 20 years in an education as a teacher instructional coach and administrator I have worked in charter schools because I believe in the powerful impact these institutions can have on students charter schools are often crucial for children who learn differently it is vital to recognize that Charter Schools offer high quality education and specialized programming that is accessible to All Families not just those with significant financial resources this level of inclusivity insurance that every child regardless of their background has the opportunity to reach their full potential I urge you to support and protect Albuquerque Charter Schools implementing more of moratoriums or reducing the number of charter schools contradicts the aspirations of countless families and students would depend on the unique opportunities that these schools offer together let's advocate for

[00:28:00]
tailored learning experiences that Charter Schools provide your commitment to this cause can make a profound difference in the lives of many thank you thank you our next speaker is Virginia Demerol hello thank you Virginia's have said in support I have two children who have been involved with Native American Community Academy Ace leadership high school and tiara all award-winning programs I would also like to say I think Charter Schools can be supportive and successful as other parents have said environment for students who learn differently I have one son with an IP so I have seen this first hand the smaller environment the more personal attention from the teachers this

[00:29:00]
this can be the key that unlocks educational success for these kids and if there's changes that need to be made I would encourage the policy committee to lean into ways that you can expand collaboration for students with disabilities with Charter Schools there is understandable concerns in the current federal voucher atmosphere that Charter Schools will weaken districts but I would say no the charter schools are gems here in Albuquerque you can lean into this day or your strengths and they can help you serve children with disabilities thank you thank you our next speaker is Lauren Scott hello good evening Madam chair and members of the board my name is Lauren Scott and I am a teacher at Mountain mahogany Community School which is an APS authorized charter school and turning its 20th year I'm speaking on the agenda item discussing the

[00:30:00]
is revisions to Charter Schools authorization I believe that traditional and Charter Schools can Thrive alongside each other as a teacher who has worked for both there are many times when I've used ideas and methods from either model for example I first used Advantage math when I worked at an APS school and I push for the same training on my Charter School I'm also currently part of an Innovative Outdoor Learning Program with the teachers from traditional APS schools and we have a lot to learn from each other I believe that students will benefit most when we spend time learning and collaborating with each other rather than spending time trying to restrict one model tonight I urge you to consider what opportunities Charters can give students and how we can work together to increase student achievement thank you so much thank you next speaker is Lauren Mitchell Jones Lauren are you there yeah I am

[00:31:00]
sorry it took me a minute to get my stuff together once you begin speaking excellent thank you good evening members of the policy committee thank you for this opportunity to speak tonight I really wanted to lift up what I said earlier and also Lauren Scott I have three great kids in traditional APS schools and for the most part we've been really happy with that and I think partially because my kids really get to see a really broad cross-section of everybody that lives in Albuquerque and I think that we have been given a really great Community perspective on what it's like when you build community in your neighborhood schools and around your neighborhood schools and that has been such a benefit to me and when I see all these parents you know Charter Schools really are an important part of our system but also you know it's disappointing to see how many kids are having to be driven all the way across town to get to school

[00:32:00]
and it seems like in some ways that it is breaking down our neighborhood schools and our neighborhood communities and I think that's something that we've had a little bit of a struggle with the other thing I want to say is that in being at a smaller Elementary School there's been quite a bit of pressure on our school to Market our school as though they have to sell their services and I feel like this just is not really benefit our school Community to have to feel like they're competing in a Marketplace and I just Public Schools public it's it shouldn't feel like we're running a business and trying to Market our ways to encourage more people and more students to attend our Public Schools so thank you excuse me for going over time thank you board chairman Dominguez I believe that concludes public forum and you're on mute thank you and thank you to all who spoke tonight

[00:33:00]
I think I hear the passion and the concern and I think together we can meet the challenges that school board members have to face in their in executing their fiscal responsibilities among other things so I look forward to more conversation let's see we're going to move on to a discussion item which includes the first read of tribal consultation policy and let me get to my to my notes here so the background to the tribal consultation which is been a long time coming of a new policy at the August 6th 2022

[00:34:00]
live Board of Education meeting this discussion will be a first read of the tribal consultation policy to establish a government-to-government relationship with input from tribal leaders the policy chair myself has recommended an addition to section 4J of the aps Board of Education governance manual Administration has provided support documentation for the discussion outlining three options to include the requested language we either create a new policy we we suggest that the current draft be a revision to the Board of Education governance manual section 4J or the revision be added to board or revision be done to board

[00:35:00]
the IH 9 Administration recommends the requested language be included in the existing board policy ih9 and so that is part of the discussion and part of moving forward tonight I think at least a couple of us have have worked so hard on this in over a year and a half so I'm eager to hear from from others I can start I completely agree that this is long overdue and there is a need for language about tribal

[00:36:00]
consultation especially in Albuquerque Public Schools and we have so many different students who come from different tribes around around the city around the state you know one thing that I have heard from Community is that in order for us to fully be transparent with language about tribal consultation then we need to do what we're asking and provide more consultation on this policy with our native and Indigenous parents and leaders so that's one thing that I did want to put on the table is all the way I support this in the language and I support putting it in the policy I was 9 that was stated I do hear that we need some more guidance when it comes to our tribal leaders I also do want to ask if we have heard anything from PD because I know that they are also working on their own language when it comes to tribal consultation so I'll ask the team that and wanted to just up with what I've heard so thank you for pointing out

[00:37:00]
all of that I should have let me go back and give you all history we have met with tribal leaders we went to the government to government meeting in July and handed out this language and keep in mind that this language is high level what remains to be done or is is drafting the procedures and it's in the procedures where the nuts and bolts of the details around tribal consultation will surface so we can have the high level language the steps after the simplement would be meeting with tribes of those details and so that will happen as soon as we hear from ped

[00:38:00]
both board member tomaricho and I met with and I'm going to get his I'm going to have to call him by his first name because I forget how to pronounce the second name Damien or ziskie he is executive director and assistant to the assistant assistant Secretary of Indian education we had a productive conversation and so I asked him if there was anything that was egregious here and she said no and look forward to us being leaders in this in

[00:39:00]
an effort that she's trying to implement at the state level we also gave it remind me board member to Amor did we share this with President Negrin and a staff member when we went to Window Rock with the students I thought we left him a copy Mister was another individual in the legislative with the Board of Education

[00:40:00]
executive directors of Indian education at Isleta for sure and Sandia and and so I mean we're going to continue to talk with these leaders here are the challenges to my knowledge the parent the engine parent education committee is not meeting because we don't have an executive director of Indian education so the chair is waiting for the district to to move towards convening them however before we lost that position or the person in that position we did

[00:41:00]
share this at was it may or April yes so I've also contacted the US Department of Education the Julian Guerrero he's had input on this the policy analyst for the national Indian Education Association has had input so it's not it's it's been a year and a half and I think it's been a very deliberate process having said that I recognize that I'm confident that this high level language is as fine as can be minus conversations here tonight again the the procedures are the would be the next step and that's where we would

[00:42:00]
have to meet with tribal leaders of their designs to hash out how they see consultation being meaningful effective timely Etc so sorry about that I should have included that history earlier and OK Google I believe that unequivocally we need to support our Native Americans students we

[00:43:00]
I believe are doing that through the use of our inclusion of Native American students in our goals they are are overwhelming focus in our policies and so I think we are absolutely acknowledging our responsibility and working towards our responsibility towards our Native Americans students and I believe that we as a board and we as a district are diligently maintaining that effort to work in support of the Aussie Martinez decision to support those students I do have a few concerns about those policy the policy recommendations they are similar to what I stated before but I will

[00:44:00]
take this opportunity to restate them the first is similar to what board member astorga was mentioning and that is that we are within the policy that we already have the IPP policy that we already have the Indian parent group and the tribal leaders are the ones that are supposed to bring forth the request for change to many policy it's not the district and it's not the board that is supposed to make that request and to support that I direct you to PJ 29 or Indian policies and procedures policy that we have on the first page it states that when the data indicates that Native American students might not be participating on an equal

[00:45:00]
racist or maybe not making progress the Indian parent committee and the tribal leaders will recommend a plan to the aps superintendent or bored or will make suggestions to the aps superintendent or board to modify the educational programs or provide services I will also direct you to that same argument to policy for procedure for within the IPP that states the Albuquerque Public School District will modify the IPP if necessary the procedure for that is then that the changes to the IPP will be agreed upon by the district tribal leaders of the impacted 11 communities tribal education directors the Indian education committee the Indian parent committee

[00:46:00]
and the District Indian education department all of those entities have to agree before A change is brought forth then those changes once there is the agreement then it comes to the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education during a dually scheduled meeting in which we have the opportunity to review and discuss the modifications so a question that I have for I don't know it was Miss compost on or should I direct it to Dr Blakey you can direct it to me she's not on okay so a question that I have is have all of those into the entities that are listed in the current policy that we have to be working under right now have those entities requested a change or a modification Madam chair board member Jackson to my knowledge there hasn't been a formal request for

[00:47:00]
from the groups that you mentioned okay so essentially the way I read that is that we are then now we're now trying to create a new policy on tribal consultation without actually having any tribal consultation so that's the first thing that strikes me the second thing that strikes me which I just mentioned is a procedural that we do not have a new policy which means that we have to currently be working under the policy that we have and the policy that we have says that all of those entities have to agree those entities have to request it and then it is brought to the board of education so we're already violating the current policies that we have another thing that strikes me is that there are actually are opportunities for the Board of Education members

[00:48:00]
to participate and again I will direct you to the current policy under policy one there is an entire list of opportunities that board members can attend under policy one I will read them there's the aps Indian parent committee monthly meeting the aps Indian education committee quarterly meeting the aps Board of Education public Hearing in the fall there are the tribal leaders consultation Summits one that happens in the fall and one that happens in the spring the monthly impact Aid and IPP meetings and the impact a public hearing during the fall so another question that I have Dr Blakey is can board members attend and participate in all of these opportunities that are already presented within the policy that we

[00:49:00]
yes and do you think to your knowledge or just kind of based on your experience if word members were to attend would that give an opportunity for Meaningful collaboration yes so we could in tribal consultation add a board specific consultation if that is what what your requesting I mean I think it's a good request right because it seems like there's an opportunity that some board members feel like they're not having the opportunity for Meaningful collaboration but opportunities are there maybe we just didn't know they were there and so it would be good for us you know us to show up the next thing that

[00:50:00]
miss me a little bit about some of the language is the use of sovereign to Sovereign Nation I am almost certain that that is incorrect and slightly disrespectful to the the tribes to the Nations to put the board and the district on the same level as a Sovereign Nation the aps district and the Board of Education we are not sovereign Nations and to include that language I believe is disrespectful to the government status language needs to be struck in the same vein I will repeat the statement that I made that the board is not the local education

[00:51:00]
agency the APS school district is the local Education Agency and according to the New Mexico Indian Education Act section 22 - 231 it is the Albuquerque Public Schools district that is responsible for any action between the local tribes and so I wonder if this policy language is a potential violation of statue my next point of concern is directly to the language the proposed language all of that language is already included in the IPP

[00:52:00]
and I will take this opportunity to say where I think that is so the first sentence that starts with the per every student 6 success act and that language is already listed in the Preamble is already listed in the the Preamble the statement that the one two three four paragraphs before the attestations the next sentence that starts the aps Board of Education all of that language is very similar to what is already listed in policy one for example the proposed language is to include but not limited to resolutions initiatives memorandums of understanding but in policy one

[00:53:00]
it already says Albuquerque Public Schools will disseminate relative sorry relevant applications evaluations program plans and information and then it has an entire list of materials that will be disseminated so we're being a little redundant with language that is already included and and under which we are already working the next sentence therefore to promote positive outcomes for Native American students that language is also highlighted again both in policy one procedure one as well as policy 2 there's actually a huge list on page two the next sentence the aps board of education for their commits to engage in meaningful collaboration that is listed in policy 3

[00:54:00]
where it says the Albuquerque Public Schools district will annually assess I would actually make the argument that we are assessing monthly because of our goals but will annually assess the extent to which Native American children participate then there's also the district will review School Educational data and evaluation with Pueblo Governors and other appropriate tribal officials in parent advisory committee meetings and other forums dot dot dot so that language is already present and I already made my point about the Sovereign Nations I think a three more points I don't know if you guys had a chance yet to look at your email but we did just recently receive an email from the Native leadership Collective of Albuquerque

[00:55:00]
making very similar points to what I have just stated that before a policy of the sword is adopted the board should engage in the very sort of consultation it is calling for the board has not included enough needed voices in this process to make this type of change and has not clearly demonstrated why the current consultation process needs to be changed so that is coming from you know a group that is representative of the students that we are attempting to help second to last thing that I will say is I'm a little concerned about the statements that were made by the chair before we started about the fact that you have been spending a year working on a policy that was not authorized by the board we know

[00:56:00]
set our government's manual says that we are supposed to work is the board and it sounds as though you have been working on policies that were not bored authorized and so that causes some concern for me because I know that if the shoe was on the other foot you would probably be concerned if I was out doing the same thing so that causes me a little bit of concern that that something was happening without the board's knowledge so finally I think based on special on the native leadership Collective of Albuquerque letter that just came in I would request that we table this discussion until we are able to robustly and in

[00:57:00]
in alignment with the policy that we have a consult with the tribes and the urban indigenous leaders and Educators the next tribal consultation is coming up in October and I think that that is our opportunity to actually have this conversation with them and more importantly listen to what their voice says and decipher whether or not there is a real need for a change in this policy or if this is just a few of us thinking that something needs to happen without true tribal voice so that's all I have to say about that board member Jackson any responses

[00:58:00]
I think many times this discussion and I'm glad that we are wanting to pursue tribal consultation and the voices of tribes and I'm glad we're having this discussion because I can tell you forthrightly that we've never had this and I know Courtney states she disagrees with the that piece in the the proposed policy but that's not the issue of us the school district Being Sober to Sovereign we're talking about the relationships between tribes that we will honor those relationships and we will not interfere and I think that that's been misconstrued in this whole conversation the other thing is that I understand the input of the the leaders of our community because I know a lot of those leaders I know what they stand for and I know that

[00:59:00]
what time is these issues only become the Forefront when we think that there's an attack but there is not an attack and the thing about this and I don't want people to also pursue based on Courtney's words that we did and we we did all of these things before him and presenting a policy it was not that way there were conversations that were had because the one thing that happened with this proposed policies there were strong actions taken against one member for taking the initiative to do and to speak for that concerned but now we're sitting here and I hope we do consider those voices of trees and I hope moving forward we do that every time because I know PD is going to propose budget reviews

[01:00:00]
for accommodate of for our you know for for us pursuing a number of these initiatives that do include native children so we are going to have to step up to the plate and that's what PD is going to bring forth and so I'm aware of what we're trying to do but I also know based on comments from the last board meeting is that we weren't ready when are we going to be ready to me when I hear from the board meeting previously that this was a personal this was an agenda item from two board members and I still draw a fence to that and people around me not because the thing about it is you are not Native American you do not know the atrocities you do not understand tribal leadership when I sit in those meetings to ask you whether we fully engage meaningful

[01:01:00]
do not and it's not true we sit at those meetings and just say yes and listen but we have no idea what's going on and that irritates me and it irritates me to the point where meaningful is not even considered to be true and just for this particular community and group so yes I am at the place where do you want to hear I do want to hear their voices and I do want to hear the the city also but I know that people feel like they're being attacked and that's not the issue and I would hope that on this board significantly that we look what what are these conversations and are we really having the meaningful conversations because I can tell you as a Native American board member we don't have it I'm sorry to have to tell you

[01:02:00]
and being and working in Indian Head and Indian education and special education I really draw a fence to many things that were doing and I'm sorry I have to say that and I do want to stay we do need to go to tribes we do need to go to leaders and that's probably the first step we need to do and I hope we do that and every account and we honor what Courtney just said we honor those policies but I can tell you we don't and that's all I'm going to say thank you if I may yes thank you yeah I just want to say that this is exactly why I voted in the last board meeting to bring this back to the policy committee because we need these types of conversations and just to Echo the sentiment of board member to

[01:03:00]
you might have language somewhere in documents about tribal consultation or Native American children or tribes in general but working within the education system I know firsthand that we need to repeat it as much time as we can because it doesn't always come forth or it doesn't always mean that because we have language in a certain policy procedure that the work is getting done hence why Ozzie Martinez was created right and why the lawsuit stands is because we know that the district has not been doing that work and yes I agree that we have those populations in our golden rules but that does not mean that within the system of Education our Native American students are indigenous students are ESL students are actually getting the necessary tools that they need to be able to drive with an education so that's one of the reasons why I do support this tribal consultation is because we have to be committed in a way that systemic and not just because there's one policy that means that that's what

[01:04:00]
it is and by doing more and having this conversation is not only within board members but with Community with other tribal leaders that's going to happen one way or another right we're going to be able to understand through procedures through systemic change through even cultural and social change that these conversations are happening that these policies and procedures are actually known so thank you remember Jackson for bringing those these Carnage for all the members that are listed community members that are listening that's what we need to hear right we need to hear that we do have a language somewhere with this might be happening but because we have to bring it up again obviously it's not working so I just wanted to Echo that what board meeting was saying is that we have to do more just because it's written down doesn't mean that it's actually happening and hopefully that came across how it was meant to be said in my head but thank you thank you

[01:05:00]
Ramos board member Benavides do you have anything to add I do thank you chair Dominguez and thank you all for your very meaningful contributions this evening especially board member to amorito it's very touching to hear you speak so passionately about something that you know about that none of us really do and so I appreciate your perspective and I support you 100% And I I want to kind of expand on and ask for additional support from the Native Community you said that we should we should be having these conversations and so I'm curious what can we do or have we reached out to the communities to ask them to please come and speak at public comment and to give us input on how they feel about these proposed changes so I cringe a little bit when I hear you know invite them to public comment because that's not the place for a tribal leader in fact in fact

[01:06:00]
what has become very clear to me in talking to Native leaders tribal leaders is is this and it was helpful to hear board member Jackson go through all our policies because it underscores something for me it is exactly that point their tribal leaders are looking for a shift in framing the conversation everything that was listed all the policies they are dictated by the district and by the way Sovereign to Sovereign Nation was a term I had never heard in my life until a tribal leader

[01:07:00]
roast me and asked me and I had to I was embarrassed because I had to he asked me board member Dominguez how are you going to honor Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationships and I I told him forgive my ignorance but I have no idea what that means he said you're an elected leader and that's a very different position then the superintendent as an elected leader you make policy and that policy impacts Sovereign Nations so you're a sovereign by the very fact that you're elected and and so we want access to you as an elected official we should have direct access and that point was driven home

[01:08:00]
for me when board members home where he told joined the board and what she found was that we had approved a resolution that had bypassed tribal leaders and I double so I took that resolution to a national Indian Education Association and ask for input and it was the South Dakota educational Cooperative they are a Cooperative of tribal leaders and urban leaders and they pointed out that the very reason you need a tribal consultation policy that is at the government not at the administrative level

[01:09:00]
is because you want to avoid doing passing a resolution exactly like this one that circumvents tribal leaders entirely so while the intention was good and I voted for it the intention was good but I had an incomplete understanding of what we were doing with that resolution and so this tribal consultation for the board hopes to prevent that from happening ever again I don't know if that answered your question but board member benavidez yes it did thank you and and so I apologize if I if I freeze it incorrectly about inviting people to speak at public comments but hearing input is always helpful when we're making these decisions there's very strong emotion and there's lots of History here and we want to make sure we do it right and meaningfully and we never want to offend anybody and so

[01:10:00]
that being said I'm wondering if we have just a few minutes to go through very quickly each draft proposed and maybe you can just walk us through what you are proposing and what the possible ramifications are that way we can kind of move the conversation along and and and and and get to some kind of resolution whatever that may be okay so not to not to rush anybody but I'm just I would really love to hear your perspective on the changes proposed changes you know I'm only seeing I think I I think what I'm seeing here is that there's only one draft of language it's a question of where do we want to place it is it a new is it a new policy or do we incorporate it I mean I'm not

[01:11:00]
not quite sure why we ended up with PJ 29 other than that it's Indian policies and procedures but this is Administrative and again it doesn't change the Paradigm and that's what tribal leaders are looking for they don't want to be dictated to they want to set the parameters themselves and so there is I did see that we have if you're looking at 9 please and I can I can share with you some some changes that I would suggest to IH tonight and they begin with the second paragraph the Board of Education will Foster first of all get rid of a

[01:12:00]
your partnership because they want more than that they will Foster relationships with tribal leaders and and I would add again Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationships with tribal leaders and maintain not you don't see two-way Communication in any I don't hear that kind of language in any of the conversations from tribes so I'm not quite sure what we would do that maintain I would say tribal consultation with tribal governments whose jurisdictional boundaries include areas within the Albuquerque Public Schools boundaries that might need to

[01:13:00]
because I have questions about that what do we mean by jurisdictional boundaries because the heater nations are not within our jurisdictional boundaries are they or are they and then include areas within the Albuquerque Public School boundaries well we've we've grown out of that language it's no longer that or more if you'll notice I reference Navajo Nation the 19 Pueblo and the Apache Nations tribal leaders so that last sentence might need reworking

[01:14:00]
I mean about the only thing that we can keep there is in accordance with state and federal law and let me just remind everyone that even though Essa has been around for quite a while we have violated it miserably and I think what I have learned over a year and a half of conversations and research is that the table of power and we represent that and they want very direct access so yes I apologize I'm not going to keep monopolizing the conversation but I just said this is just a point of

[01:15:00]
verification and I'm not sure if anybody else has the same question but when I was reviewing the draft and specific to ih9 what it looks to me is that the only real change is the red text saying tribal consultation before the aps board of education is approval I could be incorrect in that but what you are referring to to Dominguez is changes to the second paragraph significant changes in fact and they those don't exist in the draft and so can you please play exactly what were were evaluating in this particular draft well I mean if one of the choices again were either adopting a brand new a brand new policy or we are

[01:16:00]
incorporating that language into the IAH 9 Indian education policy however we would have to change other language in that policy to make it to bring it up-to-date so I I don't know what the implications of that are for the purpose of moving this forward because this needs to move forward so I'm open to guidance from superintendent or policy analysts go ahead OK Google is to your question about why

[01:17:00]
there's two colors the blue and the red the blue paragraph that is present in all of the documents ih9 the governance manual and the Standalone new policy is the proposed language that we received from chair Dominguez and she and it looks like inadvertently language was left out which is the red language the tribal consultation before so we added that in because it was an addition to the first batch of language that we were sent I hope that helps it does thank you very much board member Astoria I just had a question as well if we were to adopt it into IH 9:00 would that mean that this we would have to create a whole new draft tonight correct so we would be approving not this draft but a whole new draft so that we can include your

[01:18:00]
I believe so I think so I think it would slow down the process is that right policy analyst Martinez I'm not sure I understand what you're asking if we decide to play this music station that second paragraph of age 9 so not just the draft that was proposed but additional language we would have to come back to the table and approve

[01:19:00]
new recommendation ooh that's a good question I believe that because it is this is what I think because it's a revision to an existing policy the blue language is the proposal that's on the table if this committee decides that they want to recommend other revisions there within they're able to do that if they'd like and so we would then the whole thing would move forward to the 30 de public feedback is that correct yeah that's correct okay so so if we were in agreement that we needed to delete a Cooperative partnership and make that will Foster Sovereign to Sovereign Nations relationships with tribal leaders and

[01:20:00]
retain tribal consultation with tribal governments whose but see this gets gets dicey after governments whose jurisdictional boundaries include areas within I don't think that applies anymore because we've grown I think we'd have to stop with after tribal consultation with tribal governments with the with the tribes listed below something like that or reiterate from from that sentence below Navajo Nation the 19 Pueblo and the Apache nation's tribal leaders or their designs and we have to include as well as pertinent indigenous Urban leaders before approving proposed policies

[01:21:00]
this part and again I hesitate to call it a Cooperative partnership because that's not how leaders see it yeah The Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationship will Foster an agreement between the tribes at 8:00 p.m. education policies and procedures in accordance with us state and federal law those would be my suggested edits so yes I just wanted to raise what board member Jackson had recommended about a meeting in October

[01:22:00]
how you're talking about going outside of Albuquerque Public Schools boundaries which I think we we have students who may not fall within the tribal boundaries of APs which is so I think that would be good but I do want to wanted to uplift member Jackson if you wanted to just bring that back up and remind me what date and meeting that was we could potentially figure out a time that works Madame board member I can help with that the fall tribal consultation is October 6th and the Indian parent committee meeting is September 18th so in my mind that I was thinking is if this goes to the 30-day public comment or revision that would be a good chance for the tribal consultation leaders to come together and review

[01:23:00]
making sure that all voices are at the table I don't know how do you feel about that board member don't worry we did talk to tribal leaders at the government to government meeting in July but I think I think to be a little more direct because we do have something in front of us to give them that were able to have those discussions and get input and to do it at the government government to government meeting gives you a great opportunity to have many tribal leaders there because the thing you're going to face come December is the switch over

[01:24:00]
the Pueblo Governors those won't be there in those governors will be exited out for a new governorship in January so I think that would be a great time and I also think that the parent committee meeting September 18th was also be give us the time to to present and also talked to them but also we need to I know what was mentioned to was PD or posted here from them anytime soon so that's another piece I don't know cuz I know that their policy not their policy but I don't know if it's a policy recommendation is going to continue it's going to be more in depth because I know when we went to the last government to government meeting and attended the presentation with secretary

[01:25:00]
but when you go that she gave all of the steps and how that was going to be included and board members were mentioned and and how that was going to look was based on all of those particular areas the budget High School graduation and being involved with the whole I keep forgetting the word not

[01:26:00]
have until September 5th at tribal leaders could give feedback on it before they gave our guidance so we expect that now that they have that closed on Friday so probably in the next couple of weeks will receive the guidance that board member to Murrieta is referring to you from ped and they did mention that it would have guidance for school boards as well in that new guidelines from PD I just want to remind us that this language is high level language it does not it just says that we will honor tribal consultation and that we understand that it's a governance a government to government relationship that's all it's saying the the details are exactly

[01:27:00]
what would be helpful to pan or to flush out at the October 6th meeting because if if we if we don't move to if we don't move forward with a with a draft tonight to present for consideration and keep in mind the second reading isn't going to happen until November anyway so we can still we can still approve a first reading take that to the to the government to government meeting on October 6th and that way we can get some feedback

[01:28:00]
the second reading in November and hopefully get approval by the second before November ends and that is my strong recommendation that we have a tribal consultation policy by November which requires us to leave tonight with language a first read language if we want

[01:29:00]
I think I think the cleanest way to do this would be to revise ih9 and update the language to reflect what tribes are saying now what tribal leaders are using now with a few edits easy edits to that second paragraph that all tribal leaders are using however we have not spoken to all tribal leaders you have spoken to a few some of us have spoken to none we as a board we have to remember that we have to

[01:30:00]
work as a board not as individuals we as a board have not spoken with all tribal leaders so it seems a little putting the cart before the horse to create something that a tribal consultation policy when we have not spoken with all tribal leaders I I think that we are doing this in violation of the current policies and procedures that we have I really hope that all of us have read through the very very robust PJ 29 Indian policies and procedures that outlines the Federal Regulations the state statutes this this policy

[01:31:00]
policies and procedures are not the district telling the tribes how to act there are attestations and notations to federal law throughout this entire document this is this is law this is what is required it's not the district telling the truck the tribal leaders what to do so I just want to restate I'm concerned about bringing something with the claim that all tribal leaders have been consulted when that is very clearly not the case thank you board member Jackson thank you turn Domingo's I'm curious and I apologize for putting you on the spot but I'm curious if Administration can give us a quick defin

[01:32:00]
answer on whether what's been proposed here is violating statute I'm hearing that a lot and I want to make sure that we are not doing that and so information that's definitive would be very helpful right now we would have to take it through to legal to get that advice one on it being if we're not following statue okay okay I really wish we had done that before so that we could we could know but I understand everybody's busy and that's probably not the process so my apologies correct typically the process is once we have the draft with input then we bring it for legal review okay thank you yes I was going to say I think that's still can happen once we decide on a first read

[01:33:00]
draft and again we have all of September the rest of September and we have all of October well half of October to to do that in preparation for a second read in November hopefully with many things ironed out with information from tribes as well tribal leaders as well as some understanding from the secret secret okay so just to clarify we are only at this point evaluating changing the language to Indianapolis

[01:34:00]
excited and we are not going to consider the other drafts that were provided I just want to make sure that we are concentrating on one area so that we know how to move forward and and I would like it if we haven't decided on that to be able to do that and if we're going to evaluate all three that's fine I just want to be clear on what stage of the process we're at I think our the report that I read said and I'm looking for it said that we had three options we could either create a new policy we could modify or revise or do the government's manual and the administration suggested by okay

[01:35:00]
can we do that and and just make some modifications to that second paragraph that mirror updated language so I guess I need feedback from 233 the board procedures get hashed out later down the road with tribal leaders guidance what you propose for the second paragraph So if we're going to go through this if you don't mind okay yes I'll read it exactly as I am

[01:36:00]
proposing the Board of Education will Foster Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationships with tribal leaders and maintain tribal consultation with tribal governments such as the Navajo Nation the 19 Pueblo and the Apache Nations tribal leaders or their designated as well as indigenous Urban leaders before policies period and then it would move on to this Sovereign Nation relationship will Foster an agreement between the

[01:37:00]
eggs and it's kind of redundant if I think we could just get this Sovereign relationship will Foster an agreement between the tribes in Albuquerque Public Schools Indian education policies and procedures in accordance with state and federal law so we would keep that that last sentence the only thing we're changing is cooperative partnership becomes Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationship was that clear it's clear but if anybody else is like me I feel like I need to type it so that I can see it I can't recall all of that information off the top of my head I apologize

[01:38:00]
so so is the policy analyst maybe can share her screen or did you catch all of that I know that was kind of fast period I did not catch all that but hold on let me pull up my let me pull up the document and we can work in the live document just a minute

[01:39:00]
thanks for your patience chair I'm almost there all right I think I'm allowed to share my screen can somebody let me know if you all are looking at 9:00 Indian restaurant at the top the

[01:40:00]
very top of the paragraph right here Board of Education public schools are there any changes to this paragraph no great this one needs to be a foster after will Foster a sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationship and we're going to take out Cooperative partnership correct yes okay relations with tribal leaders and maintain tribal consultation instead of two-way communication tribal consultation

[01:41:00]
and strike through two-way communication okay with tribal governments such as the blue language or the green language down below the listing Navajo Nation right there all the way to and probably indigenous Urban leaders and then copy and paste that into who's jurisdictional boundaries

[01:42:00]
you're going to strike through all that all the way to the period

[01:43:00]
what is cooperative partnership for foster an agreement between the tribes and Albuquerque Public Schools Indian education policies and procedures yes strike through Cooperative partnership and insert Sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationship board member is Foster the right word

[01:44:00]
Foster an agreement it's been a few months since we talked to you know what it's okay it's a first read so if you don't remember or unless you have something to add instead of like we need to add those adjectives to agreements

[01:45:00]
Foster get rid of an in front of agreement and add sorry to where are you pardon me where are you in the document OK Google and put in the four critical adjectives formal meaningful timely and effective and then it would be agreements plural

[01:46:00]
and that's that would be it but I do have a question about that last the very last paragraph after the revision the the draft so the superintendent or designee I mean the the Board of Education also has to draft procedures that layout tribal consultation processes so does that need to be stated here I mean the superintendent and drive the administrative implementation of the

[01:47:00]
what language but where do we fit in language that makes it clear that the Board of Education will draft appropriate procedures and processes with the guidance of ped and tribal leaders tribal and urban leaders do we need to add that policies all procedures are done by Administration so the board to create procedures acceptable process

[01:48:00]
that we embark on has to be informed by tribal leaders and that's that's what tribal consultation is in that's exactly what the ped and tribal leaders and urban leaders are set to hash out but it has to be with us so we already have procedures and they are listed in PJ 29 and I would argue that those are procedures that are have been framed by Administration necessarily so again this is about tribes having more

[01:49:00]
in the implementation of this policy so I'm just looking for guidance from the policy analyst if if we're going to add I think we need to make it clear that those processes will be guided by how this tribal consultation gets implemented will be guided by ped and tribal leaders we should definitely run this through a legal review but my thoughts on it would be this two things one if p e d has not released the rule on what the tribal consultation policies need to look like I would recommend that we wait until we see that language from the PED the second thing I would say is that the IPP which I

[01:50:00]
to me reads that this last paragraph is referencing the IPP which is developed in consultation between the tribal leadership and Indian education and the district so there is tribal input but I would caution maybe getting too much in the Weeds about language that impacts the IPP that's thank you Miss Martinez that's what I was going to say and I guess I got a little confused along the way with the procedures are you indicating that the so as I read the policy the board is directing the administration to to do tribal consultation as outlined in law are you saying in this policy that the board is doing tribal consultation separate and apart than the administration so would be

[01:51:00]
so I do agree with Miss Martinez we would have to get legal review on it just to make sure that we're not too entities you know we represent the school district so if the board is doing its own tribal consultation separate and apart than the school district tribal consultation I'm not sure if we're within our bounds to do that and I'm not sure what that does that mean all seven members are expected to I don't I don't know and so I think you're right we wait till he did provide some more guidance on that and we we figure that out just so that we're more trees want access to the table of power to policy so and we represent that

[01:52:00]
board members always have to attend tribal consultation or so you could put some guidance around when we do District tribal consultation that board members attend or a certain number you know you could do it that way as well right okay yeah I said we're done with this and so this is the recommendation for policy committee as a first read this one the version that Miss Martinez so

[01:53:00]
is that helpful board member Benavides yes it is thank you okay sure if I may I I believe that we need to do a legal review on the questions that you have before we can post this publicly it doesn't really help us much to post it get the feedback and only to find out that we may be or not in compliance with statues so I just want to bring that up okay and so I would like to be part of that conversation and I would definitely want I think it would be important for me to be to know who is going to look at that because we need legal expertise in this area

[01:54:00]
did you I'm sorry I thought you did you say something I just said and I forgot what I said sorry about that I think I was talking to the dog that's on my lap okay so are we next time I just want to

[01:55:00]
we know where what next steps are okay period you might want to just stay for the committee kind of what how your wrapping it up with the understanding is so that everybody knows okay so we have gone through edits we've decided first of all that we are not going to well we are going to revise IH 9 Indian education to include the edits that were just discussed and to insert a new language that was reviewed previously and

[01:56:00]
we will pass it through legal review but I have requested a scholar or a legal scholar that is an expert in tribal consultation because this is a New Concept but tribes are heavily invested in it and I really want to make sure that we have a Native American Voice guiding legal on this and so yeah the next steps would be to have a second reading November and in between we will be attending the September 18th parent committee

[01:57:00]
education committee and I would suggest that all of us attend if if you're able to and then October 6th this will be presented to to the government and I guess the tribal consultation that the district hosts is that correct I will work with because she organizes this one to set aside time for that discussion so we'll be in touch as soon as she works on that thank you

[01:58:00]
okay I thought I saw a hand up but if there are no more questions or comments we're going to move on okay so the next item on our agenda is a discussion of item 5.2 discussion of the rationale for revisions to board policy Casey charter schools and I just want to provide a quick introduction to this first I want to thank everyone who spoke tonight I know the concerns shared come from a deep care for students families and schools thoughtful Community engagement only strengthens our district and I recognize that the board has not

[01:59:00]
he's met that standard I for one learned that lesson clearly during the Taft right-sizing process and I'm committed to ensuring that all voices are heard tonight we're here to review policy Casey which governs Charter Schools this policy has not been updated in many years and no longer reflects current realities our responsibility as a board is to review and strengthen policies so that they align with the goals and guard rails we recently adopted goals designed to improve outcomes for all students and I think that is a goal for Charter Schools as well so it's to improve outcomes for all students in both traditional and Charter Schools I want to be very clear the agenda does not include closing any charter schools are work tonight is focus

[02:00:00]
it's only on updating policy we Face real challenges federal budget cuts and the states continued work to meet the Martinez yassi decision even as the state faces cuts that makes it even more important that we are responsible stewards of resources committed to equity and clear in our role as authorizers of charter schools this is not about undermining missions it is about Clarity accountability and partnership Charters choose APS authorization because they expect high standards and collaboration that requires a better informed Board of Education it requires stronger communication with governance councils and policies the district can Implement and promoting

[02:01:00]
improving processes that promote Clarity and policies of the district can Implement effectively I believe this is an opportunity a challenge to face together with creativity and collaboration we can find Positive Solutions to the challenges I listed above as I often say of Lando Todo tiene by talking with one another we can find solutions that serve every student because that's ultimately what we're after and so with that I open it up to discussion

[02:02:00]
48 emails that I received yesterday and today in support of charter schools and so I think it's remarkable that there is so much support and I want to thank everybody for for their comments and for being such strong advocates for charter schools in public education in general I want to also reiterate what you said to Mingus that this is just a conversation and I had somebody call me early and they were really panicked and they said why are you guys trying to get rid of charter schools and I said no that's that's not what I'm here for and I don't think that that is the intention of the policy Committee in general and so when we decide if

[02:03:00]
play decide on something definitive please let's keep those things in mind and mainly keep in mind that this is a benefit to our students and to our community and we want to keep those Partnerships I mean I did provide some technical questions to ponder and to consider and I appreciated Trace Smith for doing the homework actually answered some of these which is Illuminating I mean we don't know we don't know we don't spend enough time with governance councils and frankly we don't spend enough time with each application each applicant so it's hard to and I'll speak for myself if I feel ill informed

[02:04:00]
play time were faced with contract renewals it's never sufficient so I wonder if we might start then with what is the benefit to Charters that apply for APS authorization over PEC authorization and maybe somebody from the inside could help us with that so you brought some technical questions in in the discussion rationale I guess my question is is what what is the purpose of these technical questions is it to

[02:05:00]
pull up a new policy is it to explore is it to have a conversation because you know this these questions have been interpreted I believe rightly so as an attack on Charters and the the policy that we have policy Casey is directly pulled from Charter law this this is law this is like I will stay again the the questions that you have posed are meant to cause fear in the charters it's meant to you know construct construct fairy language for a moratorium you know I have I have emails in support of Charters this this these technical questions just as they discussion have

[02:06:00]
heated fear within Albuquerque of our students who are our students these are our APS students and I do not understand why this is even being brought forth may I answer that question there is overwhelming support for Charters and I do not understand why we are why we are causing fear amongst our students and our families good question thank you first of all I want to challenge the assumption that having this conversation was done to cause fear amongst Our Community Partners and amongst our students and our APS community that is not the intention and children

[02:07:00]
please reiterate that that is not the intention that is not Doom well I think that's the question what is the intention okay so if I met again as I stated we are facing Federal Cuts we're going over the next three years there is going to be a tight budget and so to talk about expanding charters in this District at a moment when we are right sizing neighborhood schools is an imbalance that cannot it's out of we can't talk about it a lot but is there is there expansion I mean I heard expansion

[02:08:00]
a lot so I just want to make it during public comment and nothing's been brought forth to us while we did we did the last two years we did approve new to the district I'm not talking about a moratorium on already existing Charters I'm talking about new to the district we had two charters come before us and I was not it was never clear to me and I wasn't alone that we were approving new to the district Chargers two of them that that's not okay that's a breakdown between process internal process and the board so that needs to be addressed but I thought it was

[02:09:00]
important to signal that we cannot do that my interest is to do Charters the charters that we have we should do well and not all of them I would argue we do not do well by all of them not all of them are facing the same success level that aims does or that Coral does and so and unfortunately many of those that are not doing well have and I am going to use quotation marks around doing well because there's an assessment problem that we need to look at so this is about getting you know we're holding traditional schools to account with goals and guard rails and I don't think it's an imposition of

[02:10:00]
any sort on Charters to to ask first of all it's not law that they have to come to APS for authorization it is law that the state offer choice so I want to clarify that but if we're going to provide Choice within the district we need to do it well and how do we navigate that together in collaboration with governance councils and CEOs and principals at those schools I want to hear from them what what the challenges are and especially from those charter schools that have a high level of children with special needs and oftentimes some Charters push

[02:11:00]
out that can't stand and that happens often too often e l l students why are we making Charter Schools report SAT scores on ell students that that just seems like there's a disconnect there so I'd like to revisit assessments and by the ways and principles are in a I'm getting these ideas from them they don't understand they don't think that SAT scores are the best measure of what their kids can do and if we attend I mean even future focused education conferences list for consideration that or or encourages us

[02:12:00]
to rethink How We Do assessment and so that has to somehow trickle up to us as an authorizer so I'm I'm what I'd like to do is clarify the mission of Charters within a PS and in particular how are we going to do Charters well especially when the vast majority at some schools are Martinez Yazzie we have to have some kind of alignment and understanding right now I feel like I'm rubber stamping the application process and that's that can't stand two years ago we had a workshop at The Rankin Center where we were able to

[02:13:00]
you have an exchange of ideas between board members and governance council members from the chartres why did that stop that shouldn't that should be instituted we should have regular updates and frankly I think having to look at 10 or wait a minute 11:00 11:00 is way too much we should be looking at five and doing it well so I don't I think we're not doing things well I want our Charters to be supported and to do well and so it's that intense but certainly we cannot expand at this moment we're facing serious talks to our budget so it would be fiscally irresponsible

[02:14:00]
to even have that door open for more Charters to be approved that's my rational or something like that said Charter law is very specific the role of the board within the law is very specific we have the right to deny we have the right to authorize we do not have the right to dictate we do not have the the right to declare about assessments that's admin

[02:15:00]
I will absolutely agree with you that that thing that we had at ranking was awesome like and I think that that is something that you know we we do yearly I mean I think I thought that was great it brought us together and it was a great opportunity to to have interactions but that's not a policy issue that's a that's a process issue that's something that Dr Blakey listening to us right now says oh okay I'm taking notes of what this policy committee is saying and and I'll talk to doctor Escobedo about that and that's that's not what we write into policy and we we is the bored we we have the right to deny an application we don't have the right to stall or or not even allow the applic

[02:16:00]
location to come forward and but that's what you just said you don't want to expand you said that is that's a very different we are not told by law that we have to take that we have to take a charter school correct correct we have the right to deny we do not have the right to stop the application from coming forth so if we have the right to deny and that's in law already so I think if the fear that has been caused is the language of how do we construct how do we construct language that honors current contracts but allows the district to reduce the number that is where the fear came from and I think that we can

[02:17:00]
improve processes but that's not we don't need to change the policy let me rephrase this when we had we had lost a couple of correct me if I'm wrong doctor Blakey we had lost a couple of charter schools and and then that created openings and somehow we ended up approving to new Charters to I think it was both Collegiate and Ames New to the district and what I'm suggesting is that when we lose Charters we don't necessarily have to bring in Chargers new applications to

[02:18:00]
play whatever we're losing by attrition again it's in it's in an effort to be fiscally responsible given the cuts that are coming down the line and to expand is simply should not be an option if we lose Chargers we should leave it at that until we until our policy better reflects the new reality and the new reality is a decrease in budget and whatever next steps are going to require of the district I think we need to be more intentional about those two things so that is the point of

[02:19:00]
revisions to Casey charter schools at this moment what is the strategy and how are we going to reflect that strategy in policy a strategy for this new reality it sounds like we're having a bit of a finance conversation and so I think it would be helpful if we knew exactly what resources go to Charter Schools okay that's great

[02:20:00]
the budget

[02:21:00]
1092 how how are we honoring the dictates of Martinez Yazzie and how does that how does that impact the contracts with some website kids how does a charter address that population that's

[02:22:00]
struck me as an interesting threshold for them to meet I'm not convinced that all are Charters are doing their part but I mean is there a reason for that is there a good reason it's an opportunity to explore that are there any other questions that we would like our superintendent to address I'm sorry are you asking me these questions that the administration yes provide us with answers to these questions at because the answers are going to help us formulate a strategy for

[02:23:00]
or a policy where we can express the strategy that we're going to have for charter schools in a PS3 and it's not just for clarification you're asking questions that you'll send us to you're not asking me to answer the question right now some of these right like I don't want to put you on the spot so feel free to answer any one of these that you feel comfortable doing so I think we talked about what is the benefit to a charter that applies for APS authorization I did hear an answer to that a community of support but I find that interesting because

[02:24:00]
not all charters feel so supported so I'm I'm curious I want I want to explore that further what disadvantages are there to be an authorized by the public education commission from your standpoint I heard that again it's it's more about being part of a community connected to a community but I'd like to delve into that a little bit more what's the benefit to APS to authorize Charters at applies to us for authorization over the PEC or pedal what are the challenges I mean we need to be honest about the challenges that we're facing and I want to hear from Charter Schools what are their challenges I mean I've heard some and and I'll tell you

[02:25:00]
and I don't disagree with them they especially those schools that have a large population of Martinez Yazzie groups having them take an SAT assessment and to measure their success the charter success on the SAT there's a disconnect there and so what what other avenues are there for the what other avenues are there for a quality assessment of whether or not a charter deserves reauthorization because I don't feel good about rubber stamping a school that has a 2% score

[02:26:00]
in math is that is that an accurate representation of what students know I don't believe so specially if it comes to Martinez and Ozzy kids so all this has implications for revising a policy that accurately expresses a strategy about how this district is going to what purpose Charters will serve in this District given our goals and guard rails and by the way you know in my conversation with CEOs and principles they don't necessarily take offense to everybody wants their kids to read everybody wants their kids to do math everybody wants to

[02:27:00]
kids be ready for post-secondary opportunities and everybody wants kids to have a sense of belonging so we're not we're not imposing anything that is out of line with the mission of most Charters so board member Jackson thank you if since we're kind of having conversations with Dr Blakey so Dr Blakey I guess my question to you is do you feel that a revision to this policy is necessary and before you answer that it's also kind of in the context of our government's manual it's the superintendent who brings us opportunities for

[02:28:00]
or changes when necessary so given the your knowledge of the district your knowledge of the finances your knowledge of Charter School authorization the district the the department is a revision to policy board policy Casey necessary chair and member Jackson I think that you know with Charter Schools the New Mexico Charter Schools act really governs what the authorizer is and isn't able to do so I feel like that kind of supersedes the policy because it is pretty strict in how the performance contract that the schools bring forward that's connected to the mission of their school really guides

[02:29:00]
authorizer in what the work of that school is so I think between like the policy and the charter schools at there is little like leeway among I haven't heard of us having a specific number of charters in our portfolio but I certainly could talk more to Dr Escobedo about that but I haven't I don't know if like it has to be a specific one leaves one comes I haven't heard about anything like that other than like you know you we want to make sure that doctor doesn't feel overwhelmed with the level of because he does a pretty good job in the work that he's been doing with the schools that you don't want to overwhelm him with the number of schools but I don't know about like we don't have a specific or anything like that with the number of charter schools we do get to percent of their budget that comes

[02:30:00]
back to the authorizer so I think there was a question about what is the benefit of the monetary benefit is a charter that 2% either goes to the public education commission if it's a state Charter or goes to the school district if it's a local school board that authorizes it thanks Dr Blakey so and I think just the last thing that I will say on this is that I don't believe that a new policy is necessary I will unequivocally state that charter schools are public schools and I am thrilled that these families and students are part of the aps family I'm thrilled that we had two new Charters come in bringing

[02:31:00]
strong academics and new opportunities for our students and I I think that we are running the risk of overstepping our overstepping our boundaries and like I said I think we have whether intentional or not have created fear and apprehension with 20% of our APS students and families and administrators hopefully it was not done intentionally but based on the amount of emails that I received and phone calls I I think that there was fear and so I do not support a revision to a policy I think that has done a great job I think are there some Maybe

[02:32:00]
procedures that could be updated yes but that is a conversation of the superintendent and her departments and the policy as it is right now I think is sufficient and so that is not as my comment anybody else I will just stay real quick that after hearing all your reasoning is I do agree with a lot of it I just don't feel strongly that this policy is where those specific processes need to be put I do believe that we need a training on charter school and potentially better Communications with governing councils I think that would be amazing I also speak to my Charter School

[02:33:00]
Ed's principles and staff and and they all have the same the same goal but just to work with the district better and to find a way that we can really sit down and figure out how we can become like one I know many of the charters have already adopted the golden rules a lot of them already come to Mr Scoville for guidance and ask board members for guidance so I I do see a line of communication already open and I want to make sure that that continues to grow I do understand your concern for expanding Charters and making sure that we first put first are APS Public Schools but I just don't I don't see the fit of everything you've presented into the specific policy thank you board members started Ramos let me I'd like to read

[02:34:00]
the Casey charter school policy it's not very long it's only two significant paragraphs on the last time this was revised was in 2016 there's no mention of goals and guardrails you know we make such a big deal out of the goals and guard rails this is like a framework that has taken up so much conversation and effort there's no mention of Martinez but here it is the Board of Education May approve the establishment of a charter school within the Albuquerque Public Schools district APS shall review all applications for locally authorized Charter Schools the Board of Education reserves the right to deny an application for a charter school the Board of Education

[02:35:00]
reserve the right to suspend or revoke the charter of a locally authorized Charter School however there are more details behind that it's a high standard that we have to meet Albuquerque APS shall establish a process for application submissions review and approval or denial I think that needs to be further elaborated upon what's the strategy given the new goals and guard rails and Martinez Yazzie all contracts negotiated between the Albuquerque APS and a locally authorized Charter School shall include the requirements outlined in charter schools procedural directive the Board of Education shall deny the authorization or reauthorization of a locally authorized charter school if the requirements outlined in the charter schools procedural directive are not agreed upon and approved by both parties this reads

[02:36:00]
high-level language there's no like what is the goal of having Charters I think I think one goal is to have to give families choice I kept hearing that tonight and where where do where do Martinez and Yazzie kids fit in that where's the commitment from the board to requiring or requesting minimally that Charters abide by the vision and the values I mean we say we have these this vision and values where is that stated here nowhere so right now it's

[02:37:00]
launch everything is kind of I don't see enough guidance for the process of approving Charters I just I don't it's all procedural and I guess we don't have a North star on Charters and I think we need to articulate that North Star and that's what I'm suggesting the next steps are yes and so you just said it I'm just going to say it really quickly so what I'm hearing is the goal for this discussion isn't necessarily to to get rid of charter school to get harder for charter schools to to become a part of a PS4 with the girls and guard rails that are district has adopted and what we are working towards

[02:38:00]
kind of your overarching goal here yes yes and specifically you know it was mention of Martinez Yazzie which are our first two goals do but I want to add that language to Casey because we don't know if the next iteration of the goals are going to have Martinez in reference to it but I think yes those are the two elements that I'm interested in integrating number to remember that clarification

[02:39:00]
play would want and I'm suggesting for administration to help put together a conversation with Mr Joseph Escobedo and the board members so that I want for one can get a better understanding of the entire process of authorization for charter schools because the language that you are proposing would just a line write this policy with the rest of our goals and guardrails which is is fine but I really want to know more before I agree with anything about racism works so we can further have these discussions thank you number two do you have anything to add I do understand you know that we do need a line just as board members

[02:40:00]
Edwards the Eagles and the guard rails but also with Martinez and yassi I do know when we did have the review of the applicants for the last number of schools that applied it wasn't clear especially to us who were we were trying to figure out the whole process but I think that whether or not we decide to have that training and the conversations with the charter school department that would help iron out some of these areas of concern and I do know that I think with families of Charter they don't really understand the process and what their governing boards do and and I can only say that because

[02:41:00]
do I get emails from different Charters that have concern about bullying about a teacher about something that's going on in the school but often asking the question did you go to your governing board I think the process is not understood and and I'm sure some parents do understand it but I think the whole even even even finances because many parents want to ask us to build a machine to get them this to get them that so I really think that this whole process of Charters and even parents understanding how that works for them and how their governing board should work for them my other concern and many times is just purely special education I need that there are various degrees

[02:42:00]
of not following federal law and Ida because of Staffing and even the lack of really making sure things they were being more accountable but I don't and I'm just bringing that as a topic of concern but and I'm sure that is for their governing boards on how they handle that but it is a big factor when we are addressing the needs of kids with disabilities because many times within the charter school environment they will say to a parent when a kid with a disability comes that they can't service that kid and then they become a behavioral problem and then they become three strikes you're out and then those kids have to go back to public school and and for the amount of money that goes to Charter Schools you know it's the question of are we really truly

[02:43:00]
serving kids with disabilities and that needs to be addressed and I don't know if if that's what Joseph and with his staff because I do know we do we do help within special education but I do know sometimes kids fall through the cracks and it is a big concern but yeah I'm just those are some of my areas and I just feel right now Community needs to be more informed about how Charter Schools work and and their voice and how they need to use that within their governing board because they do come to us with very concerning issues so anyway I just want to throw that out there thank you so it sounds it sounds to me like maybe

[02:44:00]
the conversation is veering more towards information that board members that we need to have like the understanding of the policies the governance to governance interaction the how we can help how we can assist how we can be a partner with the charter schools more so than changing policy language and so maybe that is something that Doctor Blakey or Dr Escobedo can can assist with before we move forward with policy language as far as policy language specifically is concerned we are all advocates for the goals in the guard rails and for our Yazi Martinez students however we cannot legally we can't insist that chart

[02:45:00]
we can't require the goals in the guard rails and we can't prescribe the the makeup of the students that is all random and so we can't put into policy that it has to be you know a certain a certain group or that they have to follow the goals and guardrails because they have their own missions and they are they are autonomous so we need to be really careful about putting language like that into any sort of policy the place where we have where we and I mean we as the district have the ability to guide is through the performance contract and that contract is negotiated and then is brought forth to the board of education and that is where we can have discussions as to what their goals are and what their guard rails are but in order but we as

[02:46:00]
what's as an authorizer cannot place our goals and guardrails onto an autonomous entity thank you all of you to visit the PEC website because they make it very clear the whole state is talking about at risk populations so the state imposes that on PC authorized schools and so I want I strongly encourage you to go read that language because we are not imposing anything that isn't already been asked of Charters perhaps you're correct that how it gets expressed in the contract

[02:47:00]
probably need more guidance about that from legal how we can achieve a more strategic expression of of authorization I'm going to if I may I'd like to see something like this possible policy language the district will provide the board a charter school strategy and timeline of processes and approval deadlines that reflect a commitment to student outcomes based on the Golden Girls the strategy must address the vegetarian and resource capacity of the district to justify the purpose for district authorized Charter Schools but I do think we need

[02:48:00]
I see provided the district has the aforementioned strategy in place the board will approve existing District authorized Charter School contract renewals only after the district and such Charters probe adherence to following having followed proper processes and deadlines which we come close to doing but not entirely so that's what process comes in but I again there are two concerns budget cuts and how we will be fiscally responsible and to Golden Gardens in Martinez Yazzie particularly so I'm happy to you know if you if you have ideas for language I certainly

[02:49:00]
I think the next step is to field suggested language and again I would encourage you to visit the PEC website to inform yourself about what's required at that if the PEC can require it we most certainly can and so yes unless we have more to add to that I'd like to bring the discussion some suggested language around a strategy for a strategy that guides the Board of Education in proving

[02:50:00]
Charters what is the role of charters in our district so let me find my agenda for the rest of the meeting and the talking points here are the tribal consultation policy will be posted to the website for a 30-day public review after I have

[02:51:00]
I'm sorry I thought Dr Blakey had her hand up and will return to the park after legal consultation with an expert in Indian law and tribal consultation specifically and will return to the policy committee for a second read at the November policy committee meeting the October policy committee meeting will include consideration of revisions to the charter school policy and I'd like to close with this in mind again I want to thank everybody who who shared their perspectives tonight on charter schools and board member benefits please yes yes I just wanted to acknowledge that the next policy committee

[02:52:00]
it says September 8th 2025 at 5:15 obviously that's incorrect and so I apologize for not seeing that before we accepted the agenda when is the next policy committee meeting October 6th okay thank you and thank you for catching that policy or excuse me agenda approval without correcting that again schools I want to remind us that tonight's work is about reviewing and strengthening a policy not closing schools as a board are responsibilities to improve outcomes for all students to follow the law and to ensure resources are used equitably that takes Clarity accountability and partnership we may not agree on every detail but we all shared the same

[02:53:00]
and that's helping our students succeed by continuing to talk and work together I believe we can find solutions that serve every child in our community and I will continue to have conversations with Charter School leaders who offer productive conversations and guidance that's my commitment and I believe we clarified that the next policy committee meeting is October 6th at 5:15 virtually and you may watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that is has come to an end the meeting thank you for your patience tonight thank you
