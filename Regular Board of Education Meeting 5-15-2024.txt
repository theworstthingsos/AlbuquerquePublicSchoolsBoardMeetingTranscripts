[00:07:00]
now for 8 years giving free coffee the Albertsons across from Del Norte has frequently given us gift cards to help pay for items and excuse me the rest of it is paid for by the Alum Knights which is a group of of alumni from the different years and we've also had different sponsors provide prizes for our teachers so thank you again for your time and your service and I look forward to hearing what other speakers are going to share with us thank you man our next speaker is Kathleen Hagar you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you all and thank you for letting me be here tonight my principal I'm sorry so far as from special education to work on a district practice that needs to change a few weeks ago a student hugged me and said thank you Mrs Hager for not letting me get killed today

[00:08:00]
Hannah's classmates were in my office again after being evacuated due to Violent behavior in their room students were making me cards to thank me for keeping them safe I hope this gives you pause as it does to me this is my Tipping Point no child or staff member at an APS elementary school should be in this much fear from another student we have a problem at 8 p.m. at least at the elementary level on how we are currently dealing with the federal law Ida parent preference and the interpretation of Lee Street in environment for a very small number of students who have repeated violent Behavior currently we are asking to act as a behavioral health care facility and as a result staff and students are getting hope both physically and emotionally it needs to stop not just from others but also

[00:09:00]
self-harm to from the students themselves with young children are witnessing I am asking tonight for you to one get an outside legal opinion of how APS has been interpreting least restrictive environment the request of parents and keeping exhibit children exhibiting repeated violent behaviors in general education environments to help APS create a protocol that honors further and the privacy of struggling students but informs parents when their child has been targeted or has witnessed verbal or physical violence at school search request a survey of current employees to get a better idea of how many incidents have occurred this year I have a hearing another school when she went to get medical help they ask how hard can a 6 year old virtue minutes I'm sorry can you wrap it up in a very quick sentence I got hurt

[00:10:00]
how many weeks ago by a student who's been exhibiting behaviors for 2 years we need your help I know it's a tough situation I know we have federal laws but we need your help thank you thank you man or next speaker is Jayden cimilre would you be speaking of 2 minutes thank you it's good to be with everyone and this is my first but I represent a lot of the parents that Hubert Humphrey Elementary School I'm here to express concerns over the bell schedule changes for this next year and Hubert Humphrey was put on The Late bell schedule so Elementary School will start at 9:15 and end at 4:00 we're worried about the mental and physical health of the students at with this late start time I have three children who attend Hubert Humphrey and right now three of them are in baseball

[00:11:00]
so getting out at 3:05 we're able to make it home do a little bit of homework have a little bit of downtime have dinner and then we have to leave the house by 4:40 however if my kids are getting out of school at 4:00 by the time we get home there will be no time to have rest do homework and eat dinner as a family before we have to continue on to other extracurricular activities before we had been on the late schedule and released at 3:40 but we had a short Wednesday so emotionally my kids could handle two longer days getting out later and then having a short day when they would have more time to rest in the coming year we won't have that short day some of the kids who ride buses won't be getting home until about 4:40 in the winter time that's just about dark so there won't be any time for the kids to have the balance that they need to continue to be productive in school additionally younger children generally wake up earlier than teenagers my kids naturally wake up

[00:12:00]
between 6:30 and 7:30 so then they have extra time in the morning but it can be less guided with working parents so I went the bell schedule to be considered again and see if there are changes that can be made particularly for our elementary school but for all elementary school children so they can have the balance that they need to continue growing as young healthy children thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Melanie Mellencamp minutes thank you good evening board members and superintendent Blakey I am an APS parent as well as a staff member at Hubert Humphrey Elementary I'm speaking tonight to address the new late start time that was assigned to our school next year as others have spoken in the past few meetings this late start time is not good for our young children I teach kindergarten and a

[00:13:00]
dim dismissal is entirely too late for these young elementary school children if the Middle School families dislike the late start time and it created struggles for them why would you inflict this time on Elementary families we were told that we were assigned this later start time because we used to be a later start school in previous years a 3:40 p.m. dismissal was given when we had a half day Wednesdays and a shorter school day before the state mandated longer days that logic is not acceptable I have received emails back from APS leadership stating that this is a transportation issue we took a recent school count of how many students actually ride buses at our school the number of bus riders were counted and three of our six buses had only 126 and 7 students what a waste of resources and tax dollars to operate many almost empty buses it seems like there is definitely some opportunity to combine bus routes and use the buses

[00:14:00]
more efficiently our kids should not suffer for the mismanagement of one Department if buses are being used more efficiently it seems there should be more options for Bell schedules that work for families I know APS has set up guard rails with a focus on student outcomes as the priority in order to achieve this our district needs to be student-centered not Transportation centered APS stated that last year data pointed pointed to it being better for younger children to start school earlier and older students should start later why is this changing again did the data change in a year or so many families did not budget for before school care because we had no indication of our bell schedule which change you gave parents and staff zero opportunity to provide input you simply handed this very late school time to our community please reconsider another

[00:15:00]
change with the late start time what we want is what's best for our students and this absolutely is not it thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Dr Camilo you have 2 minutes once again for a children's health and well-being of New Mexico specialty but now you all have heard that principal was fired and other employee performance at the Disco Heritage Academy

[00:16:00]
play against this many medical doctors in other countries found there is no solid evidence supporting the medical transitioning of young people why aren't American clinicians paying attention sexual sexual explicit age and appropriate pornographic books have been identified in many districts across New Mexico Beach in the appropriate inappropriate books are in both middle schools and high schools besides being on the library show some teachers have a sexually explicit pornographic book to be read by students isn't that child abuse did you know this sexual permission will promote confusion and deceptions in their minds and therefore lead to increase mental and emotional illness and suicide that

[00:17:00]
I shall have the following powers of duties or duties on a subject to the rules of the department developed to develop educational policy for the school district that said you develop educational policies of Reading Writing and arithmetic not sexual policies of perversion mutilation castration and sterilization which promotes abortion molestation and transgender among students please do the right thing for the sake of our children's health and well-being thank you thank you thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Don Ortega you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking after noon I'd also like to express my opinion about the new start time for elementary

[00:18:00]
the notification email that we were sent can state that a lot of feedback was received from the Middle School families about how that time created struggles only to have that time inflicted on us most parents need to be at work at 8:00 a.m. and the bus coming in that much later is going to create quite a bit of a burden also it makes for an incredibly long day especially if we have activities afterwards I mean if there's data that exists that these new start times will help us out get out of 50th place in education I'm all for it but I just really don't see it and also the the calendar as well with the two with the such a short summer break and all these different breaks it makes a challenge for a lot of families to get get their kids taken care of on those on those days it's a problem

[00:19:00]
for the teachers and make such a long day for them it's hard for them to stay energized and ready to deal with a with a bunch of kids when they're there for 9 hours it's not like they're sitting in a in an office all day and you know can you know don't have to answer don't have to take care of so many children thank you sir our next speaker is on the zoo and that is Amanda Slade are you there yes you have two minutes OK Google Hubert Humphrey Elementary we have experienced the later bell schedule

[00:20:00]
with my middle school age student this year and while we haven't loved it I feel like he has been able to tolerate it better than my elementary-age student will next year my student who will be in third grade next year typically wakes up sometime right after 6:00 a.m. so she can possibly be awake for 3 hours before she goes to school Under the new schedule and I feel like this late schedule is really missing out on those hours where are Elementary School age students are awake and alert and ready to learn and instead putting him in the classroom in the afternoon when they are tired and worn out and it also is going to place a burden on families as it's going to push extra curricular activities late into the evening we won't be home to have dinner together or spend time together as a family and his house going to push

[00:21:00]
what time is back so I just feel it's in opposition to what the natural sleep-wake cycles are for children that age I also just want to emphasize what has been said you know that we've been told that this is a bus issue and we asked you to please reevaluate the best situation at Hubert Humphrey last Wednesday afternoon on a typical school day the number of students on 6 bus used at the school were counted with the following writers 352513127 and 6 students this seems like a misuse of many resources we asked you to look at that and see if changes can be made so that an earlier schedule can be available tomorrow schools and we're specifically asking for Herbert Humphrey thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Gail Stewart also on zoo

[00:22:00]
hey are you there yes I am here thank you okay when you began speaking you have 2 minutes thanks I wanted to speak tonight because I know the board's going to be talking about which focuses on skills habits and mindsets for Life success and I am particularly concerned tonight about students with feel alcohol Spectrum Disorder or fasd being left out of this conversation and left out of the school on May 4th which is a Saturday I attended an all day workshop at the dimensions Center that was entitled first New Mexico Summit on fetal alcohol Spectrum Disorder the fasd education and Community awareness Workshop there was a noticeable lack of Educators there were a few staff from Las Cruces public schools and some staff from the racing

[00:23:00]
other than that no one identified as being associated with public education the fact sheet that was provided during the conference has the following information that APS needs to to realize in the context that you have no department or staff who are familiar with or looking at the impact of fasd Credo prenatal alcohol exposure can be associated with lifelong physical developmental behavioral and electrical changes according to the CDC fetal alcohol Spectrum Disorder adversely affect one in 20 or 5% in the United States which is about two and a half times more than students impacted by fetal alcohol Spectrum Disorder right now in New Mexico if I'm sorry we have approximately 3500

[00:24:00]
and according to the fact sheet without appropriate diagnosis and support students with an fasd face higher than average school exclusion rates we have an adequate diagnostic services in New Mexico and schools do have a responsibility under idea thank you thank you ma'am and our last speaker tonight from the administration in this district there is a systemic problem with our administrators I'm not here to talk about my daughter's experience the beginning of the school year with the principal said there was no need for bathroom policy even though she was denied bathroom had to go throughout the remainder of the day with bloody clothes I'm not here to talk about the time but the teacher decided instructional material included the movie Meg

[00:25:00]
I'm not here to talk about the time my daughter was a car seat in the locker room in the reported to a teacher only to be identified as the offender and then when we push back we were told Administration can handle that and then we waited for administration to get back to us November December January February March April May we're still waiting this isn't about the New Haven access point that was closed and we begged to be opened it was open and closed again this isn't about any of that but all of that and the most recent example I want to share with you was with my daughter couldn't take her bully anymore and tried to redistribute power I got a call from the dean she explained to be consequences that I think that's a management problem if the teacher has a behavior in the classroom that's your job to manage Dean was undeterred my daughter was going to get detention the next day I found out it was escalated that was more than attention so as a parent I called and I said this is the definition of detention by the state this is the definition of the attention by special education my daughter

[00:26:00]
identify this is the definition of a hamburger of APS and she said no we have our own handbook we're going to go with that she either lied or misrepresented because in The Trestle County handbook doesn't say anything about Jamie publicly a student which is what she did when they made her go out with her peers and pick up trash in fact it doesn't even talk about detention outside of tardies three times so the Administration has yet to get back to me I've left several messages I asked the secretary to give a note we have a toxic environment and I think we have it at other schools and I beg you if you want students to improve start changing adult Behavior by getting rid of those toxic adults who administrators thank you thank you very much that completes public forum I'd like to thank our public forum guests and with that we will move on to our next item on

[00:27:00]
your agenda which is our student outcomes focused governance as part of our commitment to student outcomes Focus governance we will now monitor progress as noted on goal for which is to increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills habits and mindsets most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness as measured by an evidence-based and aligned tool vice president Tom morito will facilitate this discussion so I will turn it over to you thank you president Gonzalez has the board president mentioned we are monitoring gold for in the interim goals or point one or two and 4.3 tonight before we begin the discussion we must confirm that the monitoring ports are complete I met with Dr Blakely last week to review the reports and I believe they meet

[00:28:00]
criteria but I will open the floor for anyone else who may think otherwise does anyone have evidence that the reports aren't complete excellent since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will turn to presentation starting off by hearing from our four high school students who spent the last semester serving as board member interns they will be introduced by President Gonzalez at the conclusion of their presentation return to Dr Blakely and staff to discuss for thank you vice president for this evening that I can't be there to see them presentation

[00:29:00]
I'm all for are Juniors at Albuquerque High School go Bulldogs they have spent the last semester working with me and with the board Services office in the pursuit of several objectives the first of these was to identify strategies is to identify strategies to leverage student voice especially on behalf of the board and this has included research on student board members in other districts in New Mexico and across the country and also looking into an engaging with student-led and student serving organizations here in Albuquerque in the process of this work they began to dig into the boards goals and particularly how students in our community view these schools think about these goals or where is goals and in the context of that the students were especially interested in golf 4 both in seeking to understand the boards intent with the gold that also exploring how other students across the district across APS view the goal

[00:30:00]
how students view the skills habits and mindsets themselves also how students view the Panorama survey and how students view existing and emerging strategies in schools to build social emotional learning and more so as they are all four full-time students they have been using the time that they do have available to meet with APS staff and with students to explore these questions and are here tonight to present their initial findings and I want to just underscore that this is not a scientific Endeavor this isn't a research project the students that are interns have reached so far we know are not representative of all of APS and we also know that there is much much more that we can do to both Explorer and to augment student engagement and voice but I'm excited that we are beginning to take a small step into that and this represents just the beginning so with that I'm really excited to turn it over to 88 Applegate Lila

[00:31:00]
friends Elsie Miller and McCarley tricky high school and we were recently granted the opportunity to intern with the Albuquerque Public School Board and recently are Focus has been around in the social emotional aspect of learning so next flight please so our goals we have been working to achieve all and turning with APS include one advocating for the integration of gold for principles not only at our school at schools across APS to really Express the importance of students while being in their everyday school environments and to build an understanding for students of what goal for is and how aps's implementing it to to empower students expression and participation

[00:32:00]
where we've been encouraging student voice and opportunities to use it three effectively communicating student perspective so using our voice and our opportunity we have with APS to share what we learned from other students for establishing reliable methods for Gathering honest and input which will expand on as we present about the Panorama survey in the next slots next slide please as in turns are project has primarily been surrounding the Panorama survey which students from grade 6 to 12:00 in the morning and ultimately the goal of the survey was to assess student social and emotional skills their school climate perceptions and students overall well-being and ultimately the board wanted to receive accurate data so that they could assess areas that are in need of improvement and then ultimately to proceed with a plan of action although

[00:33:00]
as we collaborated with super sack Albuquerque High Senate and activities directors there's a lot of we found that there's a lot of controversy surrounding the survey and this was primarily because students didn't take it because it was administered during the advisory period which is not very well attended by the students there's a lack of understanding surrounding the why of the survey and ultimately there was a lot of dishonesty I know in my personal experience I click to see for each response and called it a day I was done within five minutes which contributed to the inaccuracy of the survey so students just really want to understand the why and the importance of the survey and where it's going because we all truly do value our student perspective and it was just unclear to us regarding the measures that the board was taking in order to understand it and

[00:34:00]
okay so when we met with student Senate and super sack we initially gave them a kahoot that just asked if they took the survey if their friends took the surveys and then if they knew why they were taking this taking the survey and then towards the end of our presentation after we explain more about it we asked them three questions we asked them to write their answers on sticky notes and we asked how we can better survey high schoolers how they achieve goal for in their everyday life and then what if I say we give a freshman to better achieve self-efficacy and then just for other feedbacks and general suggestions next slide so as for results it was really clear based on their answers about go for and how they experience go for they experience it through balancing academic and personal life and also through other things like responsibility and decision-making and then

[00:35:00]
this also really showed when they said what they would advise a freshman which was like involvement and time management all like parts of Gulf War it was just really like like Elsie said it was the why behind it that they didn't really understand because when we asked them if they like remembered the survey they didn't at all and then once we explained the questions they were like oh like I remember that but they didn't it says a lot that they didn't know it initially but based on their feedback on how we can better serve a high schoolers they said that a better communication understanding will not only for students but also with teachers because I know teachers didn't really understand the survey that would help and then also integrating it better into a curriculum so putting it in English classes and I know some schools did that but for all schools having it in four classes would make it better attended and also adding incentives and engagements to make it more fun and involving and then just again

[00:36:00]
adding educational sessions so that teachers would know and then kind of switching subjects as far as other feedback there was a lot of students that said well we ask them if they would want a student board member and they were really confused as to why we would need that because the District board members should be representing their voice so they said that they would appreciate if District board members would come to their school and be more involved so that when they're filling out these surveys they know where the information is going and they can just be more once again next time okay so we want to use the feedback that Aida was kind of mentioning in the previous slides to encourage the board to implement if you have these ideas within the district so the first thing would be kind of activities throughout school so an example of this would be sticky notes positive affirmations on them that you can go up to

[00:37:00]
little clothes pins with like kind of notes on them that you can clip on people's backpacks and I think that this would just really Elevate the environment of schools and then also providing consistent workshops to promote goal for habits and skills for students so an example of this would be seminars or assemblies and I think this could really be utilized as a way to remind students of aps's objective in goal for and as well as promote surveys and other kind of activities several students suggested that in an interactive advisory for the students that the next time that the survey is administered such as like a Hands-On Workshop or even an open discussion about the questions as well as mentioned a big emphasis on increased engagement with the District board representative even if it's in the means of like

[00:38:00]
an assembly where students are introduced to who's representing me like where is my student voice being portrayed next slide please okay so here's some of our hopes and objectives for the coming year as interns for the board so we hope to advocate for more student voice and our main priority in this would be getting a diverse perspective so not just students whose voice voices are more easily projective and they're more involved but the presented the percentage whose voice is not as easy projective projected and then we also are planning to host to beginning of the year Summit for students to acquire information surrounding goal Force so the premise of this would just be give to give students tools such as the kind of activities that I mentioned in the previous slide so then they can give that back to their school and implemented in their school and then also collaborate more with student sentence and super

[00:39:00]
back to promo code for which we've been doing a little bit already but we just hope to get more into that and then we met with activities directors a couple weeks ago and one of the major topics of discussion was the Panorama survey and they suggested that the four of us would create kind of like a video explaining the purpose of it and just kind of giving students more guidance like around why they're taking the survey and instead of just kind of throwing it up so that is the end of our presentation so thank you and you have any questions for us I want to thank you for forgiving voice to your peers and you've given us a lot to think about so I think we rushed this lesson is what it sounds like from a teacher's perspective anyway we just need to slow down and

[00:40:00]
I know it's not easy to do and you guys didn't you don't seem nervous at all and I'm in all of that so I heard everything you said and what I'm taking away from this the the two things that I wrote down are better communication for teachers and students on the survey and and why they're why you're being given the survey and also why would they need to be a student board member when we each represent a specific district and maybe we can be more of a presence in your schools and be more of a voice and so heard that loud and clear and thank you for your input I also want to say thank you what you brought to my awareness is that many times within our

[00:41:00]
ladies we just think of the adults and we don't think of the students so thank you for bringing that forward and I appreciate your honesty and also just reflecting on the way this survey was conducted but I also know that with this goal for it is going to take your voice and for you delivering that this evening also states that we have a lot to do technology that voice so I appreciate that and continue to do that in whatever you do but we all know that we have a lot to work to do too so thank you so much you guys I am very impressed with your your presence and your ability to to present in front of a large group of women I even sit up here and I get nervous so I keep you guys were fantastic I do have a couple of questions for you

[00:42:00]
it's okay cuz I know you've worked hard on this and I and I want to kind of dig a little bit more and so my first question is and you've kind of alluded to this but I'm hoping that you can elaborate do you find differences in the definitions of goal for and do you specifically find differences between how the students would understand what goal for is versus what the adults would think go for means I think within ourselves and then I'll just the feedback where you received like within the sticky notes I think everyone has a different definition of like what is because I think we all have different means of what that what accomplishment means to us I think it definitely does vary between students and adults because I think adults have this perception of what they think successes for us and I think we like to work in small

[00:43:00]
and I think students have a different understanding as we're coming of age and I think that's why student perspective is so valued is because we're the ones actively in this education so I think we have gathered like an understanding of what we want what we appreciate and what we need to see in the future and so I think that's kind of why student perspective is so valued is because I do think that there's a difference there's oftentimes a difference between and perceptions between the adults and the students of what goal for and social emotional learning is videos before I asked more questions so you mentioned success and you don't have to be the one to answer this but what would successful successful go for look like to you as students what do you foresee is what did the adults need to do to make sure that you are successful reaching

[00:44:00]
well I think like the biggest thing would be students having the confidence to go out into the real world and like perform like perform how they need to like job applications or I mean just things like that even College too I know we have to do the next step plan and things like that but I think more stuff like that but also kind of going off of what else you said with confidence and I think like giving students more workshops and stuff like surrounding confidence would really like be able to boost like like student's ability ability to have success like once they graduate high school or Elementary Middle School honestly I think that students want a comfortable atmosphere within our peers and our teachers and because I think comfort and confidence kind of

[00:45:00]
Wilson 6 hours in like an excitement in our education and excitement moving forward whether it be College whether it be working whatever it is for us so I think just if the board can really work to create like a comfortable atmosphere where we're going to school excited to learn not where there's a ton of stress rounding but I think that's where the social emotional learning focus should kind of surround videos and I just have one more question if that's okay if that's okay and you specifically mentioned about advisory and it not being very well attended I will agree with that I have a 10th grader who does not regularly attend her advisory class much to my consternation but the reason being was that she said we're just not doing anything in there she'd rather go hang out with the teacher that is going to teach her something so my question

[00:46:00]
what do you think would increase advisory attendance specifically as it relates to go for I think I mean personally I have that same experience I feel like I walk into the class and it's silent and like the teacher doesn't really talk and we all know that like it doesn't really really matter cuz we don't do anything but I think advisories would be more productive if it was like running the service if it was more like interactive and like you could like all talk about it maybe the teacher like says like the question says like oh like how do you guys actually think that you experience self-efficacy you like in the mornings like something specific where people can answer and like even if they don't want to answer their already like talking about it and then with like other activities to just kind of making it less where it's like an assignment and you finish the assignment and you're done but making it more like what can you get out of this class like what can we talk about even

[00:47:00]
you're going to need to know when you graduate when you move on to like your next steps things like job applications college applications interviews things like that I also think like another way to make advisory more fun with instead of having just like online assignments and like videos and stuff to watch maybe more like art activities or just like like more interactive stuff like Anna was saying I think would be beneficial and increase attendance I think that advisory is kind of a place where students do need to kind of have a break from all their classes and maybe centering advisory around a more study hall type of period would be helpful especially for students who are overwhelmed and have a lot of homework and don't look forward to going home and continuing their school work so maybe creating advisory as a place for study hall because I know I have a study hall class and I really enjoy it and I really benefit from it and I think

[00:48:00]
since every student has to have an advisory if that advisory was a study hall for them it would be very beneficial did you have one more thing you wanted to say if advisory period I think it kind of relates back to our presentation and I think just creating a bigger understanding within the teacher to promote that this relates to your student perspective I think that'll make advisory more beneficial and then also what Macaulay was kind of saying like art activities but then like relating it back to social emotional learning like make like a little clothes and like clothes in that says something encouraging and give it to the classmate like I think relating those back to social emotional learning would be something that's like exciting like I want to go to advisory but also keep it like productive and then yes they study hall fantastic thank you I really appreciate you letting me

[00:49:00]
can I ask you some questions cuz I know you guys have put a lot of work into this and so appreciate you kind of letting me dig a little bit further into what you've learned because we're about to ask some questions about go for and now I have a lot more questions to ask the administration so I appreciate it thank you have a comment oh another question more of a comment because I believe you truly expose a ton of gaps that we aren't necessarily aware that we had even initially when we created goal for I think we received like some push back about you know Panorama was it going to be a really solid tool that was going to measure the success of goal for and when we're hearing the realities of you know what came what we appeared to think was going to happen versus the reality of the end result their night and day and

[00:50:00]
and in my heart I'm sitting here I'm like dang we got it wrong like I'm just going to own up to it like it because I really like we have the best of intentions going forward and how we think something is going to be received but we don't know until we actually see it play out and and I want to thank you for being as honest as you were with us because for me I'm like we have to go back to the drawing board and really figure out how we can connect the dots here and I will say this too like I think when you talk about advisory my biggest pet peeve is coming to a meeting and feel like I'm wasting time and I feel like if you guys feel you're doing that an advisory like we got to do better just putting it out there and so thank you for speaking thank you for what you said today I don't I will say in my heart of hearts I don't believe any of it fell on deaf ears I think it's actually going to spark a lot of change and you're going to see the ball roll in a direction that is really going to improve out

[00:51:00]
AP exams and sat I think and a whole bunch of other things going on and so the work they were able to do is pretty amazing I also just want to understand that this is just a slice of information from a small group of students so we can read into it what we want to read into it we have to take with the size of a grain of salt that is needed to acknowledge that it's just a little as I said dip of our toe into the water of student engagement and student voice and so I know as the aps administrative team presents on their strategies and their initiatives related to go forward and even clearer picture

[00:52:00]
one small group of students talking to another small group of students and then I also just wanted to flag that we're not done with them yet so we have had our first semester which I'm super excited about and they will continue to engage with us even over the summer to plan our fall student Summit and so looking forward to continuing to work together but then also seeing you all in the fall and in the summer as well and so just thank you for your time and for your presentation thank you I'm president I have a question real quick before we move on it'll just be quick thank you for your presentation I really enjoyed listening to everything that you have put together real quickly you did mention that you wanted your board members to engage in your schools more with your students I wanted to know what would that look like for you to be intentional from your board members to be not only just that your schools but engaging with you and listening to what you have to say so

[00:53:00]
what would that look like I think as simple as an assembly and an introduction of who are district members are and board members are and kind of having that communication from adult to student and knowing that there is an opportunity to like work with the students so we feel heard and I think opening it up to any students who want to voice concerns or feedback or anything that they are concerned about in their daily School environments would be really important more specifically I think even if they had like a I know a lot of schools have like an Instagram page if there was like a poster like here's your District email and like any any like ways that they can be contacted I think that would be helpful thank you so much

[00:54:00]
thank you and we have one more question so in listening further to your responses to board member Jackson and I'm just checking in to make sure I'm getting this right your advisory teacher is that person you have a relationship with throughout the day I think it depends on what students that the majority of us students do not have close relationships with our advisory teachers even though some of them are like our core classes I know McCarley your advisory is our math teacher but my advisory teacher is but one of the Librarians and I think it's going to switched since I was a freshman so

[00:55:00]
I think that's very hard to do in most schools but yeah so thank you for that and and so as a follow-up then does it matter that you know your advisory teacher yeah I think it definitely makes a difference I think like my advisory teacher still doesn't really do that activities that are like planned for advisory still but I think it does make a difference because then you can connect with them more like they'll give you advice on what to do and yeah I think it definitely makes it for sure I think you'll definitely also hold students accountable because I think if I have advisory and then I see my math teacher next class and he's like where are you why is there a Starbucks in here so I think if we can build awareness within those core teachers or whatever those advisors are and then also make them teacher I think that would be super beneficial

[00:56:00]
okay thank you thank you very much anymore questions I'm just taking pictures thank you smile now look at me sorry thank you thank you so much as a reminder for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the discussion to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned with the board goals and guardrails those questions must be

[00:57:00]
strategic measured Focus ask oriented result-driven and time bound so let's get started good evening board members thank you for having us we do know that we've submitted the reports in advance we have some data on the slide that is been represented in the report and so rather than read it to you we would just be ready to welcome your questions this evening and so

[00:58:00]
for 5th graders to conceptualize setting and achieving long-term goals so my question is what strategies and resources can be provided to support fifth graders in sending realistic and attainable long-term goals thank you for that question remember benavidez that was definitely a key learning for us and thinking about particularly perseverance in the definition of perseverance we might think about persevering through something but then also how the actual definition that we're using in the survey is measuring it and it is more for those long-term kind of goals and thinking about I have a 10 year old who can't even fathom that school is going to be out in three weeks right like it's like well what are we going to do I'm going to do what we do every summer right but and so really having I think the tool center around a lot of conversations that includes students considering their own data so they begin to really look

[00:59:00]
where it is they want their learning to go and then using the tools to do a lot of goal setting goal review conversations like this is very intentional teacher work that we want to support so that they can begin to have those really for a 5th grader probably daily conversations about how are you progressing are you working on your goal what is your goal let's review your goal let's think about you know your future performance because I do think that sort of foresight is hard to develop particularly against as we get older it gets easier for sure and so as far as like the specific resources I will you know say that we we really need to sort of dig into that and as we prepare for the fall make sure that we have those resources so that we can help prepare particular elementary teachers and what those conversations with look like in the classroom thank you

[01:00:00]
hello so after reviewing it and I guess what caught my attention specifically was the rubber off track for 4.1 and what I seem to have noticed was a trend throughout each 4.1 through 4.3 was the lack of family involvement specifically knowing that for 5th graders like that's our infancy stage of trying to develop a lot of these skills do we have a plan where we will include families to help us partner with actually hitting these specific goals to include their students and knowing that it's a joint effort yes thank you for that question we are having a lot of conversations right now especially around family engagement as we think about the many places of family engagement lies in our departments across the district and talking about how we streamline that not just in terms of skills habits

[01:01:00]
but really for academic achievement as well like what is the family role in supporting student achievement and I have to say I don't think it's one-size-fits-all I think what's really important is working with our leaders in the school to understand the Assets in their community and then begin to think what is actually actionable in terms of what family involvement might look like I foresee doing some of that work through our family engagement unit and our community school coordinators so that we are presenting perhaps on the data related to go for for an individual school and then working with families in terms of okay well what is perseverance in your family you know in public forum baseball was mentioned like what a nice way to

[01:02:00]
begin to talk about goals and I can't talk about baseball if I shouldn't even bring it up but it does seem we can insert those and so I just think like calling them out intentionally in the school community and I am depending really on our leaders and I hope to empower them to be able to do that for us if I may just elaborate a little bit and make a connection recognizing that interim goal 4.1 is relevant to 5th graders I think there's a real connection to highlight in the family engagement and the parent input that was requested as recent as yesterday as we look at HB 171 and the re-imagination of high school and high school graduation requirements but very specifically the component of input around the next step plan my hunch is if we were to ask the students who were seated before us just a moment ago tell me about

[01:03:00]
The Next Step plan that you are working on as part of your high school experience you would have got maybe some glazed over looks and I think that is some of the feedback that we've received in terms of how do we use a statutory required component The Next Step plan at the high school level but really the power is penetrating that work down to the elementary how do we help our students in 5th grade may have a hard time comprehending that in a few weeks they will be finished with 3rd grade or whatever the grade level is look and dream Aspire for a meaningful fourth grade year Middle School experience I want to be I can be I do belong so these different skills

[01:04:00]
habits and mindsets using and connecting the dots of the work that we have before us and we are spending a lot of time and we ask parents input on just yesterday how do we reimagine high school well really looking at that next step plan as a example and as a example of potential in really penetrating down to middle and elementary school with real community and parental involvement thank you Google significance and confidence intervals cuz I was really hoping for information

[01:05:00]
call minor are still statistically significant is helpful and so I just kind of wanted to refer to that table and those small shifts and just ask what strategies are currently being used at the classroom level that you think might most account for these differences and by the difference is I mean the small increases thank you for that question president Gonzalez I you know we haven't had some opportunities to mainly talk with principles about what this look like in the school when we gave her fall Administration and I came before you then we reported that self-efficacy was where we were lowest and so we presented a theory of action in terms of if we lean into self-efficacy we felt that it encapsulates some of the other skills habits in mindsets right like if I'm if I'm having an opportunity to experience self-efficacy

[01:06:00]
I have likely experienced perseverance in that opportunity self-regulation and social awareness so as far as specific classroom behaviors or strategies we know that that has varied across the schools as you heard from our student panelists right we have that variety and it's something that we want to address while still maintaining the autonomy but we do believe that the schools where they said we took what you said miss you and we dug into self-efficacy we did see those results there were some schools who had as high as 10 poyntz of an increase on strategies is simply having conversations with students some of it was in advisory some of it though was in the classroom write some of it was in a mathematics classroom one of our really simple connections to standards is in the

[01:07:00]
medical practices of the Common Core and so it was as easy as Math teachers as easy I don't I don't mean to imply any of its easy but it was you know just to say like when you stick with something you can do it right even if it's just in the short term we want to extend that to the long-term but we did see some of those behaviors I was going to say improve but I would just say we sold different behaviors as a result of elevating the conversation and the vocabulary great thank you go ahead Janelle thank you I also want to Echo that the answers that you all gave us beforehand were very very detailed and good and it helped me a lot so thank you for your work my question is in 4.2 next level

[01:08:00]
work under strategic priority 3 you state that you'll emphasize the importance of every student having an adult Advocate guiding their academic and personal growth and what systems will be put in place to ensure that every student does have their own adult Advocate and when can we expect an update and how this has helped increased engagement thank you for that question I think we heard it tonight from the student panelists and sometimes student voice is a little scary because they tell us they do they expose us but I'm grateful for it right they really did tell us something about advisory that maybe we knew but we weren't quite ready to face but now we need to face it and so particularly for Middle School based in Middle School philosophy we know that each student having a champion and Advocate is critical to their development and so we are going to use

[01:09:00]
advisory structure in the middle school but with much more of an intentional focus on the training about why every student needs an advocate the champion in the room and as we probably saw we mentioned in the report several times some really intentional development of advisory lessons that can be used to help teachers to do that but I think at the middle school level there's also a much sort of deeper conversation about again Middle School philosophy what it takes to get a young adolescent through that time period they're doing a lot of identity work they're figuring out who they want to be why they want to be that person and we're really instrumental in doing that as far as we definitely want to get the school year up and running by that training as an emphasis

[01:10:00]
this is particularly at the middle school level and set the expectation and then go and see what is happening I want to continue to use the student voice to get out what is really happening in our schools and see you know are we doing it are we really making that difference with adult Advocates and I you know I am betting that it will make a difference that when we train the people really do want to do the very best that they can and that they will do it and they will rise to the occasion I have a question thank you this is a difficult goal and it just feels it felt very broad right now to accomplish lots of things

[01:11:00]
talking about how do we use a strategy or a statutory requirement to infuse our strategies from pre-k to 12 that gives me a framework at the ties a cohesion and I think this is what my next question is wanting to capture how do we target the most vulnerable students for goal for so that gold for Works in conjunction with the programs that were identified and 4.0 this is 4.3 under strategic priority for responsible because you explained

[01:12:00]
programs like early warning systems and Student Success programs so I'm I'm looking to for a framework that unites how do we target the most vulnerable students for goal for so that it works in conjunction with those programs mentioned in the Jersey just a reminder vulnerable students were not included in that report so reframe on that contacts okay so how do we want it's a problem with the with Gulf 4

[01:13:00]
gaps among all students how do we I don't know I forgot to mention this before we started but Ashley our coach is also on for life coaching if needed so I just wanted to put that out there cuz I totally forgot that she's on the zoo so if you would like to call thank you I reached out to her earlier and I would love to hear from her so board member I do here in in the question in the statements that idea that we want to more than we want to hear all student voices and I really appreciated that the the interns spoke to that they recognized that they may be perhaps the type of students whose

[01:14:00]
does it hurt more than others and what was important to them was that everybody's voice is heard and again having them say it back to me really meant a lot and it you know it was like oh you're right and so I think to that and you know how do we help make sure all students have a voice it does come through I think we have a lot of work to do and building the understanding of the value of our survey and what it is we're trying to do with go for in terms of you know I think there's work to do and about connecting the dots there's a lot of connective tissue that's happening with goal for and skills and mindsets and academic development and Community Development right like these are the skills for Success like we name them in the goal and so that I feel is

[01:15:00]
really important Next Level work for us to think about perhaps I think operation graduation right we want to make sure our students are graduating what are the steps that go 3 is taking to get there and then how to go 3 and go for work together in order to make sure that's true for all students and some students may need a more sophisticated approach than others and that is up to us she figured that out and I think you know referencing the Student Success work is one way that we're beginning to really look at individual students and think about sophisticated interventions and also monitor those interventions that we're not just saying you know we we told Sherry to come to school check like it's obviously much more a deeper problem than just telling somebody to come to school so I

[01:16:00]
and you're looking for that framework of putting all the pieces together and I think that is the next level right going into each one of those specific pieces and thinking how does this connect so that we all understand our role in making these skills a reality for students and I just want to follow up I recognize I'm owning this as a board member that this goal was going to pose and our and our coach warned us this is more of a barred rail then a goal and and we persevered and we'll see I think that's what makes it hard for me to remember getting questions before I go

[01:17:00]
Ashley were you were you trying there are you okay are you trying to get on I wanted to pause to see if you had anything you wanted to add before I asked my question yeah so and I was I'm sorry I moved just a little bit too slowly and they started answering the question but I am happy to provide some additional support around the whether or not this school works it actually does there are a couple of things so there is there a couple of things happening here one this is the moment in the monitoring session when the board is really supposed to be understanding what what is the reality for students so the goal for looking at the goal progress measures the gold progress measure provide data that tells us whether or not students are on track and what kind of progress they're making relative to the goal that the board

[01:18:00]
there is an appropriate time to talk about whether or not this goal is still the the metric that the board wants to focus on that will come at the end of the monitoring session and so if that's a conversation that the board wants to have then that would be appropriate but given the fact that this is really just the second administration of this goal I think that it would be prudent to go ahead and see see this out for a little bit of time to make sure that just to give give the system enough time to work so with that I am available to help help the Strategic or the smart questions if any word with that okay thank you

[01:19:00]
so I just wanted to give you that chance to phone a friend turn your turn your camera on okay so my the first question that I have is is and I'm thrilled that the students got to go first cuz it actually helps me to frame my question Tighter and the the students when I asked them specifically what goal for meant to them they said that it meant the confidence to perform in the real world and a comfortable atmosphere and so my question is my question is what is the most important strategy for go for overall that you will employ to make to guarantee that the adults are focusing on what the students are asking for in go for in order to avoid drift into Comfort or cuddling

[01:20:00]
instead focusing on the grit and the skills habits and mindsets development that our students are asking for so what's the one most important strategy that you will employ thank you for that question board member Jackson for me the most important strategy that we will deploy is professional development we have set aside time in August specifically for school culture and skills habits and mindsets that will be rolled out to our school Personnel we are leaning on our principals to do a lot of that roll out so that being said we have some work to do in order to prepare those resources and that package so a principal can successfully build the agenda to lead exactly what you're talking about that we don't just you know we all know in August you start Strong by October you're tired right great perseverance

[01:21:00]
we're going to make sure I'm messaging is really clear and that they have the tools at the school level in order to continue that so professional development for sure I would say in your one we really focused on awareness of the goal awareness of the survey administering the survey and I was and I'm happy with that but I think now like we're hearing loud and clear it is time to dig into building the adult toolkits in terms of making this a reality in the school setting thank you so and I hope that I'm correct on this we talked about current performance you know I have a future performance question so given that some of our APS employees are currently traveling to the White House to discuss kind of some strategies that are being implemented for chronic absenteeism

[01:22:00]
what changes do you anticipate you will need to address with other policies procedures or even student handbooks within APS in order to bring full alignment with goal for is a big question it's a good question I'm watching to see if it is a good question from Ashley and it could be that it's something that you can't answer now but it's the fact that there are traveling and that we're getting responses from people regarding goal for I'm just wondering have you thought about how that might look in the future yes and thank you for the question and I do think it's a big question I don't know that I can fully answer it sitting here right now but it is kind of

[01:23:00]
read the question that I think about a lot how do we take the many systems we have in our education structure and push them all towards improving student outcomes and that is going to take a lot of alignment in terms of really clear expectations about what we're trying to do certainly changes in adult behavior and how we're used to doing things we really have to do some examination of even what have we done over the last three months right there are things that when I reflect I say oh I will do that differently and then implement it differently first different than better right like in can keep keep taking smart wrists so that we are improving our systems and making them I think more aligned and more concrete towards improving student

[01:24:00]
the work has to happen you know when we think about go for there's obviously the skills habits and mindsets that we measure but then in my mind there's this other piece over here that is counseling intervention mlss attendance work right there's all of these pieces that are going to push this data forward and so this is where the alignment work is happening and where we're really starting to think about okay if we're looking at let's say early warning systems or Student Success systems how do you all of the systems that work in attendance behavior and course performance how do they come together and have that conversation so that it isn't siloed anymore I think in terms of you know it's a strategy for moving that forward it is getting those people in the room together to learn one another's work and it's also

[01:25:00]
ownership of that work that we're all like maybe it's a now that I'm singing out loud maybe it's a redefinition of what Student Success is right it isn't just Student Success in attendance isn't just Student Success in course performance but rather it's a whole package that we're putting together for students I don't know if I answer the question I feel like I rambled a little bit I apologize for that because it is a really big question but I really appreciate it because the more I talk about it the more I'm like oh yes that if I could add to sorry I want to add a little bit to miss jet I think one of the things that led to the invitation from the White House to Albuquerque Public Schools to present today was a recognition of the work that's happened around the student supporting Student Success systems otherwise known as ews early warning systems

[01:26:00]
function with Community Schools so I think to lend that work to a bit of a response is how do we let the data authentically talk to us because if you're going to follow a community school model in tandem with early Warning Systems you're looking at data that's all you're doing what is what are the trends in the data what are we seeing in terms of gaps things student need things that are students need buy school that will then inform our community school council to be able to deploy deploy wrap around services to meet those needs are we seeing chronic absenteeism go up are we seeing need for nutrition in health or mental health

[01:27:00]
Services what are those needs that we're seeing and then how do we provide the conditions the wraparound services for our students to truly be at a baseline authentically engage in school so I think when I think of your question I think about really authentically meaningfully leaning into the data with the common language that this goal provides with these skills habits and mindsets and then taking it school by school to be able to have a narrative a list if you will of things that we need to do at the district level the better support our schools in leaning in and supporting with what our community is telling us based on the data Iowa in general needs a lot more intentionality to it so

[01:28:00]
in our schools I've been on the listing to her as you know to about 10 schools and as I talk about the goals I can tell that schools almost needed permission to address school for intentionally so you'll go to their schools and for example I went to love elementary schools last week and you'll see a lot of intentionality in goal one you'll see them developing their schedules for next year on how much time do we need to address in our daily schedule to address gold one I've seen data on these are all good things because they're focused on one I've been challenging the schools where is that intentionality for golf 4 because Golf Course still feels like it's a hope like maybe they'll do better in this if we do these things then it being intentional so I've been talking

[01:29:00]
listen to the schools about as you design your work for next year and your schedules and your classes where in that are you intentionally teaching perseverance intentionally not just hoping that if they struggle through math then they will learn perseverance but how are you actually teaching these skills how are they you know I just think about where I've personally learned these skills and where will that be in a classroom that you learn perseverance for example of as you know I was a musician so if I practice and I get it wrong and then I have to keep practicing until we can all play the song together and through that I'm learning perseverance but is my teacher saying you need to persevere this is how you learn these skills so kind of what the kids were talking about how do we connect our language to what they're learning so that when they see this that they are it's intention

[01:30:00]
rather than it just happens to be learned and and it's hard because for years we've I mean we're right now we're focused on go one and go to in an intentional way but we've always been very aware of looking at data on reading and math now we might not be very good at what to do with the data or how to make changes in it but we're used to looking at that data in schools for many years but we're not used to looking at data like this and we're not used to being intentional about it so I think we as the District administration have to be really clear and talking to or schools about the intentionality about these skills and not and asking them well where is it in your daily schedule that you're learning social awareness where is that happening in a very intentional way so

[01:31:00]
yes I think that's exactly it and as you were as you were talking and it kind of was like a clarification I just put myself in the eye a clarification that even even for us we think of gold one is Elementary go to is Middle School 3 is high school but really there are two goals for each level like Elementary School one and go for Middle School is go to and go for right kind of that's the mindset that we need to maybe be thinking of so I I appreciate you bringing that I think that's just it the intentionality of it and the other funny thing that I'll just add is I did just get a text that my daughter was not in her advisory Club so thanks APS for noticing that but it highlights the conversation we were just having she just didn't go today I'm the last to bring you a question my question for talking about

[01:32:00]
tension and down really having students have a voice especially within this goal my concern and is how are we with the fifth eighth and 10th graders with disabilities in vain that voice and also what accommodations are we making to be intentional for these children to have a say and what is going on thank you for the question we talked about that a lot whether it be students with disabilities students with language barriers or students will just barriers and in general right for example you know we've got some feedback that the third grade language on the survey maybe just a little bit above where they're literacy levels are and Panorama are partner has been really open to that conversation about how do we make this

[01:33:00]
accessible I always remind the schools it's not a test you don't have to cover any of the posters in the room when you administer the survey you can talk about it you can take it all together you can take it one-on-one I could read it to a student the only thing I really can't do is answer for the student and so I think as we develop the awareness of the importance of the value of the survey and I do think that is work to be done we will be able to elevate all voices and it will take to Dr blakey's Point some of the intentionality of recognizing for some students it may take longer to do the survey together but we value their voices so much that will invest that time because we really do want to hear what they have to say

[01:34:00]
so any of the accommodations would be available but I do feel like there's some good work to be done around let's hear student voice that really matters all the student voices if I may board member told I would just add that when we're looking at our students with the IEP and we think about those students and their transition plans we recognize that that is an area of potential additional connections between the survey and that individual transition plan which leads us to think about what are the structures that we currently have within Albuquerque Public Schools to truly make Transition plans and transition along the Continuum a meaningful experience that is relevant for our students as they progress in matriculate through our system

[01:35:00]
play from 5th to 8th to 10th grade or Beyond and I can tell you that those conversations from a service program point of view or ongoing as well as what is needed in relationship to the conversation we had last month with Goal three as we talked about post high school and Beyond and looking at that transition plan and our students ability to really have the conditions to be a successful as possible again leaning on what are students just before us Beyond High School I think it I think that we as District administration need to do a better job at digging into the data that is provided as far as self-regulation for example that term and several of her special education classes

[01:36:00]
where are students with disabilities are in these areas like and that being said in all areas who are the outliers in our schools and our students and what is it that we can leverage of either programs or teachers doing specific skills with them that is causing us to see the outliers of the schools that are doing really well are they using terms like self-regulation particularly in elementary you hear it a lot and on the other side who are the outliers that are falling behind and how can we dig into the data more in what you'll see in the interpretation in our next steps as well thank you and thank you for bringing up the transition plan think when we are looking at

[01:37:00]
character traits so many times we disclude those as not being a goal or trying to help kids figure out that you're also a part of this you belong and so that these IEPs and transition plans specifically relate all of those pieces and the connections they need in order to understand that I'm included I have a voice and that this is all this is also going to be meaningful for me to learn these characteristics so thank you for doing that okay and I think it's important to say that my question originally was about how do we target the most vulnerable students for golf 4 so that it works in conjunction with early warning systems and Student Success

[01:38:00]
programs those programs Target at risk kids a Target vulnerable kids so I think in the end the question was appropriate just for the record and just so we know and that's why your question about special education students with disabilities may very well fall under this as well so thank goodness for conversation it's in the back and forth that we clarify our questions that we get a better understanding of you before us board members

[01:39:00]

[01:47:00]
Outreach into the contact list and we will you should have that in your drive but I believe we're going to send it out in a easier format and then I also just want as a reminder that this is our way that we can have very committed to wake communication and conversations with our community that is much more impactful than just listening to public forum or just one way so please just remember that we are committed to this and if anybody is still listening if you are a community organization please reach out to us we would love to come we would love to come talk and have conversations with you about what the what we as board members are doing the other the next thing that we've been working on is for our for we are working on Outreach and engagement goals that we are going to bring to the board at an upcoming committee

[01:48:00]
the purpose of this is that we want to be able to track our efforts not just as a committee but as a board as far as making sure that we are actually reaching the individuals and the communities and the organizations that we we need to reach so be on the lookout for some Outreach and engagement goals coming from our committee the next thing we have is the United event is coming up on June 8th at it's going to be a fantastic event and right now we tickets are being sold but we do need to assist with that promotion in all of the ways that you have whether it be on social media through personal emails making phone calls just telling people we have 400 tickets sold so far it would be fantastic if we could get it to at least at them the other thing that the committee has been working on is for for all of the attendees who come to the event we will be submitting a survey to them

[01:49:00]
