one large budget transfer for 7.7 million dollars from the district level to the schools and that was for the additional at-risk funding that was provided for in the scg as legislative by the New Mexico legislature that was the big one and then you may have also noticed that we have started the class size compliance process and we are starting to move dollars from a district level budget to the schools in the form of classroom teachers at ease and other than that we have any questions just a quick question clarifying so the at-risk funds those are the funds for this coming school year current school year I mean that's what I meant okay that's is that early on time they actually did it well what they did was the

[00:13:00]
the factor okay in the scg formula but by the time that legislation passed we had already Consolidated our budgets and uploaded them and so we gathered all the information and then on July 1st we just made the budget transfers but the school's knew about that ahead of time and were able to plan you know in case they didn't want to just add in case they wanted to revamp their entire plan with the extra money added to the original money so we're just sort of catching up okay thank you yay thank you did we get this this year earlier than we have in previous years of the July 2023 intro function transfers for all categorical ones second Yolanda thank you bye

[00:19:00]
what type of vehicles are they are they using it is it a smaller bus is that what they use Christina vehicles on the driver and how many students will be transporting at one time but they don't drive buses so it's not a mini bus

[00:20:00]
it's kind of like an Uber non CDL all right okay I was wondering if the students that need Transportation like you know ahead of time obviously you need to know that ahead of time so how is that schedule like how do you put that together that's a great question so thank you for that there's actually a whole process that we go through when a student is in need of transportation and we're only looking at

[00:21:00]
categories of students and that students in foster care and students that are experiencing homelessness and so they would actually I can talk to I'll use foster care as an example so when we go through a best interest determination process for a student and the barrier keeping the child in the school of origin is transportation then we go through a whole list of potential Transportation options and the last on that list is the alternative transportation and so we try to use we have to utilize any other mode of transportation first we do the same thing with the homeless students when they identify that a barrier to going to their school of origin which is their home school but they may not be close to it anymore they go through the same thing they go through that list and figure out is there any other way to transport the child including our bus services that's one of the things on the list and if there is no other way to transport the child then we offer the

[00:22:00]
alternative transportation the parents still have to sign off on that so they don't we don't just say oh now you're going to have another way to transfer they have to sign off on it and agree to it okay and I this is maybe kind of off topic a tiny bit but not really what about like buses it going to some of the shelters do we still have buses that pick children up at shelters do we do that at all or is that the alternative transportation that we'd required 30 miles away and that's where we call out to the

[00:23:00]
coordinate with the support services to make sure that they are approving of these services that are happening okay so we saw I need and this will meet the need for kids barrier to keeping kids in the school of origin Transportation has been a barrier for many many many many many years and so we're trying to come up with other options so that that's no longer a barrier for our students I shouldn't be thank you thank you any other go ahead so this takes care of the concerns that have come to us through I believe it's New Mexico child first we've just received some correspondence and I believe board member Jackson and I

[00:24:00]
responded initially sent it off but it takes here one of the concerns yes transportation is always been a concern especially when we're talking about Foster students that tend to jump Foster families in and out and transportation is always been a huge barrier and so we've been working on this issue for many many years and finally came with the process that would work between public education department CYFD and APS and the the bus Union to make sure that we can transfer those kids that need to be transported and that's their barrier because federal law doesn't that a child is no longer attending their school of origin but it's the bearer of law to address that issue

[00:25:00]
I just have to clarifying question on the funds that are being utilized for this then are they tied to mckinney-vento and to what federal source so that's a great question Madam chair members of board there are multiple funding sources so right now we do use Title 1 McKinney vento funds for the mckinney-vento students there's some Title 1 funding that we utilize for foster students and we all saw using school-based Medicaid funding and we're working with the children youth and families Department because they have agreed to match the funding that we're using for foster students that's excellent I was worried about will it go away well sounds like great braiding thank you is there in this contract is there a minimum I know there's a maximum of what we can spend

[00:26:00]
but if if the need ends up being smaller than we expect there's nothing in the contract that would prevent that Peterson know it's a there's no guarantee at the minimum on an ass needed basis okay thank you thank you any other questions or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 for student alternative transportation services our next item for consideration and action is the approval of District purchased or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000.00

[00:38:00]
wired that Transportation was to take over the funding of it we are making the required changes over here at the Osuna site we added some razor wire and some other functionality of security so the service is here will be brought down considerably just for holidays and etcetera but the west side is very vulnerable on the exit side of where the bus garage

[00:39:00]
be done here in the next few months too so this is worst case scenario to ask for the service but it's not a long-term because we do have offices at each location for APS officers so we're trying to work with the chief to assign officers kind of as a jump off point at both locations so at least it will detour somebody that's more professional looking at hitting the catalytic converters with each of those catalytic converters on the buses are about 25 Grand damage along with the converter so I don't want to see this come out of my budget but unfortunately that's kind of the nature we're in right now but it is a short-term fix at this point then there is are the aps police there 24/7

[00:40:00]
or just I mean I don't know what their shifts are there cuz I know they were out there now I'm currently right now there's no APS officers at the sides we do have motion cameras inside and out on the west side but we do have the service right now that comes in they come in about 5:00 usually when everybody's starting to leave while they used to leave now they're leaving at 6:00 but they're there in the evenings until we open up in the morning about 4:30 and then they're on the weekends too and holidays so I mean the fencing period

[00:41:00]
just two weeks ago we had somebody that jumped the fence at the Osuna site and with some tools and stuff that we chased off but now with the razor wire he's going to have a difficult time jumping over the fence so we are just reacting to what what are they going to do next to us so but most everything we have in place will keep away more of the amateurs but the professionals are a whole different issues so you figure it out thank you thank you thank you any other questions or equals 250,000 for Security Guard Services as needed yes yes yes yes yes yes

[00:51:00]
where we are and and when you all can expect to hear more from us next time please as a quick reminder education resource strategies were a national nonprofit were based in Boston and we work with systems all across the country to help think about how to transform shifts and resources structures and practices we've worked with large urban districts systems like Albuquerque all across the country and so we're excited to bring some of that lens to Albuquerque's contacts and think about where there might be opportunities as the district has named a shift to a student based budgeting as a priority and as one of the boards guardrails work Saturday to try to bring some of our work to next next slide please today we're just as I said just sharing a short status update we're not going to get into findings or anything like that yet or goal here is to provide a status update on the project progress on the timeline and when you all can expect to hear me

[00:52:00]
as a reminder of where we are in this work and and how we're sort of thinking about the different phases we are currently reporting with Albuquerque Public Schools on Phase 1 which we're calling this diagnostic phase which is focused on conducting a financial analysis of district-wide and individual School level resources to identify patterns opportunities to reorganize resources to sort of help District staff make sense of how spending patterns are aligned to board strategy to the district's strategic plan so building on the findings that were doing in this phase one which is you know we kicked off in May and I've been running over the course of the summer that then leads into phase 2 which is starting to get into this design and planning phase around what do we actually want this this funding model to be achieving and how do we how do we structure the funny models to do that and so will be working we are working now with a broad array of stakeholders as part of our working group we've been regularly engaging cabinet and other members of the

[00:53:00]
distract Community to try to understand exactly what is in this current state and that'll fit into a collaborative group that's working in this phase two to actually design the model from their the implementation rollout are sort of TBD it depends on where we land as a as a team on what the recommendations that we bring to the board are and and where the board decides to go whether that's rolling out a pilot of some of some new funding model and school year 2526 or implementing some potential changes to enabling conditions in a possible pilot maybe in the upcoming school year and so we'll sort of see where things go but our current phase of the of work and are scope at Eros runs actually just for this first phase to to consider recommendations and to bring those back in a couple months next slide please I said just important to remember that like this diagnostic is intended to shed light on the system level changes that could enable the

[00:54:00]
student outcomes improve and recognizing that a funding model is not going to be the thing that gets us there instead it is a tool that can enable the types of changes and so we think that you know you all have names that a funding model redesign is a key component of of your work it's it's name of the Strategic plan and we think it's important that stakeholders all see how that's connected so the funding model is dictating how much meaning where the money goes and that's sort of then allows the other the other parts of the work to happen on how well you know what student experience is what teacher experiences are enabled how do we ensure that all students are having access to the experience that they need in order to see outcomes improved so our goal is to help schools understand like what sorts of changes can be made given current spending patterns giving current status quo and and how can that eventually then feed into this how well piece so you all saw this before

[00:55:00]
we recognize that it is just a part of the overall strategy that you all are looking to achieve here next time please so we want to just give us a short status update of where we're at in in our phase one I think if perfect so as I said we started the start of this work in May when we were in the district for the first time in in late may we held a whole range of kickoff conversations with principal focus groups with District staff with cabinet all focused on understanding like what are the to gather in put on foot of the current strings and challenges of the funding system where should we be directing her now she's what are the big questions that that folks want us to Grapple with and that's what I've let us to begin our analysis which would have been doing over the course of the summer and our team was actually just in Albuquerque again two weeks ago in early August we convened our working group and our

[00:56:00]
current capacity to differentiate resources based off of current spending patterns so we shared some in-progress findings with them to test what we were seeing get more context build our understanding a number of folks who are in the room and have been presenting today were part of those conversations and have been giving us really valuable insights to help sort of coalesce our findings and and help us understand what to bring back when we come back we'll be coming back again in late September to share our findings with the working group in cabinet and with their support come up with the recommendations that we bring back to the board and so we'll actually be presenting at the next finance committee meeting on the 27th to sort of share our findings with you all and and ensure that you all are brought into this work and understand where where the recommendations are going to preview a little bit of like the questions that we were engaging with our sessions have really been focused on two core questions so if you can go to the next slide please

[00:57:00]
we're specifically thinking about how can APS differentiate resources to improve Equity so where are their opportunities to achieve more of a student based budgeting model where different needs are way to differently and we can sort of differentiate in a greater way and how does school level funding and the flexibilities that happen at a school need to look different in order to improve the student experience so those are the two core topics that we've been engaging on there's a whole range of sub key questions here that we're taking into and these are the types of analytical questions that we've been diving into you know what is the current capacity of friendship based off of based off of guidelines and current and current District Baseline allocation processes what is the vision for what flexibility should exist you know how do principals and school leaders want to be able to make decisions for their own site versus what are the things that the district establishes as sort of the core practice across all of its schools and funds accordingly so we've been we've been doing our work to try to

[00:58:00]
create the data analysis and the views that can help this team of working group and cabinet understand this data in order to inform possible recommendations that they bring forward to the board next Slide the the types of things that you know answering those questions that we just showed on the previous Slide the types of things that we could do from there are sort of three full and there's a whole range but here's how we started to think about what the levers could be based off of what we find in our Diagnostics the first lever could be to consider the extent to which you could expand the pool of resources in the system that the system currently allocates for serving specific student needs so for example to find resources that are maybe not as tied to a strategic goal and to shift those to be able to serve as a Martinez students or to support the literacy goal or sort of just to reallocate so that's what we've started to begin discussing already and the diagnostic phase and what

[00:59:00]
are there ways to transform how these resources are used and who makes decisions about their use so that's this question about flexibility to see you know what is the current model for deciding how these at risk for Title 1 funds are used what what constraints are there in the system what flexibilities could there be we've started those conversations and that's what the design phase will pick back up as we think about what should be the experience at all of our schools and then the third the third factor to consider is to adjust the weights for how to french student characteristics direct where these resources are allocated so this is sort of the core of a standard student based budgeting model where you think about different student need types from poverty to English Learners to students special education and you sort of think about how do we wait those those students needs differently to direct funding accordingly and that's sort of the core of the design phase as you think about you know working with this broad array of stakeholders to achieve the

[01:00:00]
that makes the most sense for Albuquerque Public Schools so in our Sheridan in September will will share what the opportunities seem to be coming out of each of these levers and where the working group and the cabinet are directing or sort of focusing the energy and what their recommendations are will bring those back to the board as we start to them think about potentially entering into this design phase of the work so that's that's all I have for you and I'd love to open up for a couple of questions if you all have any as you think about sort of where we're going and and we'll be bringing you back to you on September the presentation board members do we have any questions related to his presentation I have one yes I just want to say thank you for the presentation really appreciate I think it's always really important or it's all not saying important but it's helpful we have an outside resource sort of looking at us because then we can get kind of like this

[01:01:00]
it's really unbiased opinion of like where we are but one of my my questions around the diagnostic as you reviewing that are you also reviewing for like fiscal policy requirements or regulation policy any of those kinds of things that might also be a challenger barrier to the way that we've interpreted or the way that we're using policy or a federal a state or a Federal Regulation in the management of the funds is that part of the diagnostic that's really comes up as we think about what other current constraints in the system one of the things that we are looking at are you know how flexible are those funds that come from seg or that come from federal sources we've heard from a lot of folks that a lot of times you know we heard this term earlier in today's meeting but rating together funding sources that often come from Grants if those are for a particular particular program or initiative about a school that the flexibility within those dollars is what constrained so

[01:02:00]
as we are building up our understanding of what is the currency of the system we're certainly looking at policies that are that are guiding how constrained resources are or not in the district thank you I haven't I have a question so I know that you said that you would adjust the weights for how tourists direct and those will help direct for these resources are located so those characteristics are those decided by each School District or is there like a list that many use just to the unique circumstances and their Community contacts I think the ones that you often see are students experiencing poverty you know students who are English Learners students and special education but others other districts choose to wait other student needs or other characteristics as well as part of their funding formulas and that's what the design phase is all about is looking at

[01:03:00]
best practices what is the research say but also what needs to be true for Albuquerque given the unique context that you all are in and so that's sort of exactly up to each district to determine not only what are the needs that were including but also what are those weights going to be thank you thank you any other questions

[01:04:00]
information that they need to continue this process we are also starting to meet with departments that are currently using Esser funds to either supplement or do projects that might have recurring costs so the first question we're looking at there is is it recurring or is it going away the second thing is are there any costs associated with this purchase in future years if so how do you plan to find those items is it going to be other grants or are you going to need operational dollars if its operational dollars how much and have you considered trading something else for it right it's something else going to go away or you know what do we need to do so we will compile the information to better inform us of the need at this time as you can probably imagine it will be difficult the operational budget

[01:05:00]
to support any additional projects and because of that we are looking at areas of potential savings and encouraging everyone to do their part to minimize the Aether cliff and if I could get the next slide please and so for anyone that's not sure what I'm referring to this is a graph that we have shown before that depicts the cliff we received this from a genomics and the cliff refers to the federal covid relief funds that District received to get us to the pandemic which is going away next slide please ask for funding was 242 million and those funds go away at the end of the fiscal year

[01:06:00]
all who have been given bonds seem to have encumbered if not spent most of their funds were making sure that everyone has been that has been allocated These funds are encumbering all of these funds as everything needs to be purchased and received by June 30th 2024 and I am happy to answer any questions thank you Miss 6 actually I do have a question for you so going back to where you met you mentioned that we met with you know the different departments and do we know yet what the impacts are going to look like from the departments in terms of what dollars will be able to sustain and what are we actually dependent on I'm going to defer if possible to my counterpart on the grant side Madam chair members of the board I don't have the exact amount of

[01:07:00]
FTE but I know that a full analysis has been conducted on how many operational has to absorb its not an option there are positions that have to be maintained and are deemed critical for the ongoing well-being of the district or in students so are you noticing that the greatest impact is going to be with ftes is that we're not any of the other I guess particular categories it's actually people I believe the the the hardest bill of it will be in that area either then that we have an array of opportunities that have been identified by Stephen Curry and

[01:08:00]
they're trying to seize it within the timeline of the Grant and so the the thought behind this funding is we know it's coming to an end how can we best utilize it within within its lifespan and it has it has had an ongoing assessment and that's why the plans for it where constantly assess and reassessed because we were initially going into we closed down pretty fast then we came back from a into a hybrid educational combination really fast also and then we have based on sr2 we did our best to assess

[01:09:00]
Clement as soon as possible the best safety protocols and infrastructure upgrades to ensure that the students can come back on a face-to-face basis and now we are doing our best to analyze and implement the best opportunities out there to close the educational Gap thinking Dr Segura can provide a little bit more detail on what those actual initiatives are at the core in SF funding some of them you have seen them actually going through procurement tonight and you are seeing them in front of you every time because these are large initiatives and the district as you are aware has shifted pretty fast and stayed pretty flexible

[01:10:00]
on immediately identified needs like security or maintenance for HVAC or anything like that so I I think the district is is staying fairly flexible for the and in good alignment with the economics recommendation of staying flexible staying on top of what is immediately identified as priority for the district and also on being fairly rigid and we have been fairly rigid on allowing full-time recurring FTE East to actually be approved within the grant their most likely additional initiatives like the 8th our pilot that is a great initiative

[01:11:00]
we have seen and I believe we have documented sufficient data that it's it's a great program and we we are looking if possible beyond answer but we have seen it coming in with the MRI model and we are seeing some additional funding coming exactly from that model back to us in the upcoming Years hopefully so there's there's a continuous change within the grant we just need to stay Nimble enough to support it okay and I guess maybe you might know more of this like have we implemented more of I guess a system in place to know what what's going to stay and maybe what's going to Sunset and how are we making those decisions because I'm afraid we're going to be having a major deficit Madam chair members of the board we

[01:12:00]
have done our due diligence I believe we meet weekly to look at how we've prioritized the funding where we are as mihaela had stated every department has scrupulously looked through their FTE who's being funded through Esser FTE that are funded through Sr have they know that it's on soft money and that it will expire so it's not a surprise for these individuals and we're hoping to try to absorb them in the natural attrition that occurs each year what we have really invested in is infrastructure so that we can have lasting outcomes for the health of our district and looking at those you know programming attempts regarding like the tops model for example the 8-hour pilot funding

[01:13:00]
I'm strongly you know structured literacy at the younger levels the summer learning Expeditions Credit Recovery all the things that you know we're just trying to give more time more effort and energy but like I said I think that the health of our district is not going to be as challenged as other districts maybe because we have really done our due diligence to say you know we need to cut these out we're going to have to make difficult decisions as a district we absolutely are but people are aware of that and it's going to be you know really aligning with our goals and our guard rails to make sure that we can sustain what we've implemented okay thank you I'll open it up any other questions just to kind of go back to Romero was talking

[01:14:00]
so do you have an idea how much of the Esser funds were spent on people and spent on ftes and then how much when we're looking at those people the ones that we really want to sustain we want to keep them because it was like you said a good program and we want to keep some of these people do you have those numbers are going I do not have my fingertips at this point in time but I will get you the number and before I get to the number I would like some clarification are you looking at to eat that we will have to absorb into operational or are you looking again we did not allow FTP necessarily but we have encouraged extended contracts we have encouraged stipends additional compensation that

[01:15:00]
I'm going to say the very tired teachers could take on more and be reimbursed for more longer day a additional out of school educational program this type of of things and that's not necessarily adding SD just adding the time so you are looking at the pure FTE that we will absorb into operational or where we're planning to absorbing into operational are you looking at the overall salary type as in remuneration for for salary is going to tell us the most about the effect on the you know people like which one do you think is going to really I want to know that like which one's going to really affect the people you know if one of them is going to

[01:16:00]
facts are are staff that we will absorb into operational and and at what rate we can absorb it the other one is directly educational related work that we will not be able to let's say sustained through as her anymore and I don't mean maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe not necessarily that some of this sort of funding was all brown was it all like brand new stuff or was it maybe funded in

[01:17:00]
it's actually a combination of both as Dr Segura said the district did its due diligence and part of that due diligence is plan for the Esther cliff and that means when the funding goes away will you have to write immediately take some brutal Cuts or can you in some way attenuate the the down slope and in order to do that you would have to shift around funding so some some slight increase in reserves were allowable there it's not allowable in most areas of educational we will look into something like that that's her absorbed some nursing salaries

[01:18:00]
and this way we increased a little bit the reserves that when Esther goes away we don't have to start looking in that area and start cutting right away and this was the thought process across all the areas we could so Esther absorbed existing initiatives but it also I'm going to say in most of it addressed ongoing or brand new initiatives like brand new investments in closing infrastructure or closing the educational Gap okay and then I know as you are I mean the schools that are trying to budget and figuring out what's going out here you provide them support I mean I know that right now I can just tell you that when it comes to some of the school budget

[01:19:00]
for Stipe ending for duties and there aren't in their budget they just don't have that I mean just and I'm talking a lot about my schools just because they're so much larger and they're just don't have it in their budget to be able to do that but the need is still there and the kids safety is I mean it's just being effective at some of the schools that have 36 Duty teachers in a day 18 in the morning 18 in the afternoon and now they're down to 12 in the entire day so that puts parts of the school students with no supervision whatsoever but they don't have it in their budget but they going to face this again next year so how are you going to help them figure that out on top of everything else that might be affected by the yesterday let me first say that we have budgeted for the

[01:20:00]
weapons for what we're calling now site supervision instead of Duty or safety that is budget at the district level and we are currently working with leadership and the schools to figure out the most Equitable way to distribute that budget from the district to the schools so that is coming they will have it in their budget thank goodness that's the first thing the second thing I don't have it as easy as an answer for you we are going to have to buckle down and figure out how to solve this for FY 25 either you know continuing to budget it out of operational or you know whatever solution we come up with but we have not we're not there yet okay and so I don't know I mean I just this may not be true and maybe remember Peterson or might have an idea when we were when they were

[01:21:00]
I'm doing all the negotiations about you know the stipends that was a negotiated item right so if we're going to be in and I know from what I understand is when they decided on how many Duty teachers that was negotiated that you weren't going to have more than 12 and it had nothing to do with enrollment how many buses and I mean it just had it didn't take into consideration any of that they just weren't going to get more than 12 or they want to get less than two so if that like changes somehow with that have to I don't know what the process would be then if that was negotiated Madam chair members of the board yes we would have to go back into negotiations to determine what that looks like I think the real challenge this year unlike other years has been that the increase of instructional hours at the elementary level has really made it tight we have

[01:22:00]
flexibility at the elementary level to where before we did to have before and after school supervision to make sure our kids arrived safely and departed safely so it is a new challenge and the quick immediate approach was to you know negotiate that and determine what was needed it was decided that we wouldn't do it off of enrollment because we have high schools of 1700 that have 10 people and get the kiddos off and on their merry way so we tried to determine what is that spot with the additional funding that we received from the state for the additional hours funding using that funding to fund it and that was in that budget so it is an ongoing challenge we've been very vocal about it with the LSC and

[01:23:00]
we're hoping that there will be some leeway given and some support we're also going to just have to look at our you know what what does this look like in APS because other districts aren't challenged with this right now and so it's it's it's it's it's Unique thank you thank you I just have a quick clarifying question cuz I'm so the the expenses and the encumbered at is a total at 70% and that's just through the end of the school year is that what we're when is this when is the cliff I mean it's a June the the cutoff date is actually 9:30 2024 okay in order to qualify for it unless the Secretary of Education provides

[01:24:00]
let's say some additionally way everything has to be encumbered by 6:30 liquidated by 9:30 and build for investment by November 1st okay and so just remind me again so the district team you're holding everything by January so that we would have an idea of where we are right because so looking at 30% of 242 million is a lot of money so the the leadership team has has had some intensive meetings and allocation reviews analysis in order to even if we don't have a PO at this point in time we have a clear idea of where the funds are allocated to go

[01:25:00]
in order to ensure implementation in a timely manner another analysis is meant to be completed at the cutoff of the semesters and ask the hard questions do you still plan to implement full of this program do you think you're still going to need all the money can we revert from this particular program and reallocate somewhere else so there's again we try to stay on top of flexible as possible and spend spend spend it as much as we can we have had sr2 that we have leverage against Esther one and we did a pretty good job on spending that one down almost completely I have I took a look at Esser

[01:26:00]
930 2023 and I'm happy to report that we have asked for reimbursement I don't have the exact percentage of the top of my head but from 110 million plus budget allocated we have spent enough for Investments of as of 6:30 with less than $400,000 remaining okay and hopefully we'll do we'll do the same good job on sr3 okay so we have we have this this time I know what my question was so the being able to divert funds is it only into these categories cuz I know that was the biggest issue is really around the approval process right because it it's time he's us and it holds us up a little bit so it goes what to ped then

[01:27:00]
turn off to the feds and then to the feds back to ped and back to us so actually the feds did a I'm going to say a fairly good job on providing a broad guidance as applicable to most grants so the approval process usually at this point in time is between district and PD program and within the district we have a compliance specialist specifically for Esther that ensures that all Grand purchases have attached certifications and pre-approvals for the from both the budget steering committee program if applicable and a very strong justification by and get with covid-19 let's say after Meats so

[01:28:00]
so essentially we're trying to stay it sounds like we're trying to stay Within These broad categories that we have which is really helpful that they were pretty broad that we can do that so that probably saves us a little bit of time I would hope on on the approvals cuz that's what I worry about is that approval process at the federal level and it holding us up because I know that what I'm also concerned about is that the federal level with them sort of also looking at these funds and looking to to claw back I know that they keep saying that the educational funds are not going to be called back and they're somewhat protected but I just worry about that process and hoping that you know they allow us to at least you know do that within the time frame so our last say timeline with them around you know for the 24th the 924 funds to get approval to like move

[01:29:00]
I'm around or to divert that one is that timeline I believe if I'm if I am building my calendar backwards and I am basically basing it on the last changes to fiscal years that we went through I ask for access to one of the boards first June meetings to do any last minute realignments and usually in special cases procurement can accommodate last minute processing mpo issuing as applicable okay so you mention that I would assume around that 733 deadline for them to like

[01:30:00]
up with some strategies around using that money or where are you guys at so Madam chair members of the board we have been meeting on going in our Esser committee as well as in budget steering and our leadership team meeting to determine what are those immediate needs I know security and more infrastructure has been a top priority as well so I know that doctor Blakey has been asking I believe for additional encumbrance of funds but really it's prioritizing what are those needs to like I said what's going to help of our district long-term versus short-term as a committee we determined this year like whoa we're not hiring of t e at this point like we're done with that we need to look at how to re-appropriate funds so that it's not

[01:31:00]
so we are working on that and prioritizing what that what those funds will will look like thank you thank you any other questions on the person go ahead and bedroom money period

[01:32:00]
which applies to every other Grant and actually because of that we we are able to stay so flexible and absorb if necessary additional additional costs and support other areas of the district if needed so that puts us in a slightly better position the executive director of budget and strategic in front of you and presenting the the plan for Operational Support which normally would not be allowed in a crack it just like we have a crazy way of finding schools though I mean just over wrong

[01:33:00]
Nationwide in New Mexico that we end up having trouble together grants and do I just thinking about the amount of staff time administrative time that goes into simply trying to hold things together is it's astronomical and it would be much wiser to be able to spend the time actually focused on real work with children and just I think it really just a little reminder to communities for reasons that really were out of our control that really and truly I mean I was thinking the the crisis of coverage and planning time and all that stuff

[01:34:00]
legislature decided that's what we have to do community spoke loud and clear that they did not want the school year extended and so by not extending the school year I mean we really worked it reflecting what we heard from the community that we wouldn't extend days way into June or way into August or July more than we have and so to compensate employees appropriately and to meet those needs that's why we are in the situation sorry I do think that it's on us as a board to really continue to work with legislators I hope that legislators can listen to some of these conversations that we're having about the position we're in because of

[01:35:00]
the level of funding that was given for the amount of mandates so and I don't think it has to be hostile I think it has to be just really and truly informative and you don't have time to do that you're doing other things it's really on us that really can be speaking with legislators to do that thank you any other questions regarding the presentation that was given okay thank you ladies thank you thank you okay so our next finance committee meeting will be Wednesday September 27th 2023 at 5:05 p.m. or immediately following the audit committee meeting will be held at Alice in educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard North live streamed at
