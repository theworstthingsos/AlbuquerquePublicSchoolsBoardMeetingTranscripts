laughing but when we do we're very lucky to have some people like Miss Linda Bayway who is a has been in healthcare for over 40 years including working in the hospital for 28 years she is also a CPR instructor for many years and taught CPR to mothers of high-risk babies in the Intensive Care Unit earlier this year was called upon to use for training to save the life of a student who collapsed on campus and quit breathing was very very lucky that was there she performed rescue breathing on the student and maintain his Airway or her way I'm not sure who it is the Emergency Medical Services arrived the student is now doing well and has returned to school will you please come to the podium and join me

[01:01:00]
events of the solar via Apartments had to be evacuated due to a fire engulfing their third floor some of these residents were in wheelchairs others used Walkers many of them had only the clothes that were on their back and had left their valuables and their medicine in the apartment buildings as they had to leave fortunately everyone safely exited the building but the facilities sustained extensive water damage as the blaze was extinguished and it was very clear that the 65 residents many of whom were elderly and disabled and their pets would need a place to stay at least for the night Hayes Middle School gracious and myself were able to coordinate with the American Red Cross to provide

[01:02:00]
add cots as well as a warm safe and hospitable place for our community members I will say that I was there fairly late at night and people were really bending over backwards to make them comfortable the next morning I witnessed numerous staff coming in with fruit pastries welcoming the the the residents and their students were remarkable they recognized that these people needed a little bit of space they were invariably kind when they bumped into them and I know that they had a prior relationship based on a reading program that the students would go over and spend time with the residents and it was awesome it was really awesome and it's exactly what we're supposed to do as a community and his community stepped up several of the people who shared their time talents and Hospitality to create this safe space this evening

[01:03:00]

[01:06:00]
that concludes our recognition and congratulations again to everyone thank you for joining us tonight and we're soon to begin a public forum

[01:07:00]
you are here with the request for the Board of Education to consider provide information or just to see how the Board of Education operates we want to know that you're all welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum upon signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate through the meeting tonight there are eight speakers therefore to accommodate the greatest number of speakers each one has two minutes for comments within the 30-minute public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you and you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the boarding if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to

[01:08:00]
speak within the time allotted for the 30-minute public forum the Board of Education encourage you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board members comments before we adjourn and only at this time of your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so the first speaker is I'm going to call up actually the first three speakers and if you could just line up by the podium we'll go from there the first is Doug Brown Joanna Cox Michelle Lopez members of the APS school board my name is Doug Brown and I'm here to speak on school safety years ago I saw a cartoon showing on a building that said these premises protected by a

[01:09:00]
sense of security sadly I think that's about all that's protecting her teachers and students in APS I see that the APS school board last week decided to support the resolution by the Council of great City Schools while I have no problem with restrictions on the sale of assault weapons that's not the main issue most school shootings did not involve assault weapons in that resolution will make much difference we need concrete measures that will make a difference one thing that concerns me is the focus on stopping the school to prison pipeline that is exactly how Broward County schools ended up with 17 students killed in a Massachusetts to prevent ruining one student's chances for future success and By ignoring major warning signs for years the school systems to be killed and injured in a serious lack of

[01:10:00]
compassion for many victims I grew up in the rural South were almost every family had a firearm at home they weren't locked up and the students knew where they were yet school shootings were unheard of clearly the problem isn't the availability of guns it's the overall deterioration of our society the only thing that works is enforcement of consequences from misbehavior if students do not respond to disciplinary actions then they should be removed from their schools they should be turned over to the authorities I challenge you to adopt such an approach if you can continue on the current path of fear we will one day experience like the one in Broward County thank you thank you that are here with me today I am a proud sponsor of the Rio Grande baseball

[01:11:00]
what program I've been a sponsor for years part of the reason I invested in this program as a small business owner in Albuquerque was the mentoring partnership that the older boys are the senior boys have with the younger boys as well as the constant grade monitoring by the coach Orlando griego this program has experienced through his leadership and his development over the last several years a graduation rate of over 97% which is astounding in the South Valley and Albuquerque as a whole last spring the students that are part of the baseball team registered for this baseball class unfortunately a few days before the school year started this year they were told that this class no longer existed this was an Abrupt change and quite a significant derogation from the curriculum that was in effect last spring when all these students registered as a result of this sudden in abrupt change the baseball program has gone from

[01:12:00]
teams down to two we have lost students because of Eligibility the coach is not able to monitor the grades as he was allowed to before nor does this mentorship program have the ability to work with the students to help them study help them learn and help them grow as young men the South Valley is a beautiful place I have lived there for years as part of my time in Albuquerque I'm a very proud sponsor of the Rio Grande baseball team and I would really appreciate having that class reinstated for the benefit of the players the boys and the high school as a whole thank you Michelle good evening my name is Michelle Lopez one of which earned an academic scholarship and made a college baseball team are baseball family and Community is requesting the reinstatement of our baseball class the Baseball Classic has had many positive effects on our ball players not just on the field

[01:13:00]
open in the classroom as well the baseball class is not just about hitting pitching Fielding conditioning and staying competitive but also learning life lessons such as teamwork self-discipline and hard work this class also provides study hall and mentorship these coaches have an understanding and passion for what they do these things provide an advantage for the players to succeed in graduate so they can reach the next level in their lives Mr Bell has claimed there was no money in the budget for this class however she had a new Lexus new electives she didn't have math science English and history she added Hotel hospitality and animal science these classes in essence replaced the athletic class the Baseball Classic there have been two substitutes and hotel and tourism three permanent substitutes and then the hotel on tourism the fourth week period ended up ended February 16th

[01:14:00]
and the students still don't have a grade in that class we didn't find out as a family that the athletic class was gone until the kids went to pick up their schedules that's when we found out how are we supposed to work together with Administration if there's no willingness on the administration's part to get parent player and coaches input before this happens again we're just asking for reinstatement of our baseball class it's very important to these kids thank you thank you next the next the next alarm

[01:15:00]
budget they ignore the fact that at least half of that is put aside for Capital outlay which is to build buildings and Facilities they forget the day-to-day expenses such as utility bills salaries operational budget I think 8% goes to Central Administration 13% goes to custodial and maintenance and the other 85% goes to teacher and counselor and barbarians and principal salaries and that is completely ignored by the media so I just wanted to let you guys know that that's the space happy early birthday board member Peterson

[01:16:00]
good afternoon my name is Andy Peck and I'm the father of two students at Manzano Mesa Elementary School but yeah so thank you for this opportunity Mr President members of the board thank you for your service to our community is in Southeast Albuquerque which is in at least one of the highest crime areas in our city if not the highest crime area of the city sadly you know a little over one year ago three of the students that attendance were violently murdered and there's a beautiful Memorial Elementary School but Ian were killed my son was a friend of Eli and so he talks about the reason I'm here today is to talk about the lack of security Mesa Elementary School I've been there to visit my son's to pick them up to take them to lunch and the doors are all open to the entire school I play trumpet

[01:17:00]
I want this year and play Christmas songs for the for the kids during the lunch hour and when I went there I could walk right into the lunchroom no problem there's hundreds of students you know sitting there eating lunch and there's nothing stopping anyone from the street walking in to do that I have spoken to principal Candelaria and she's actually now walking those those particular Doors by the cafeteria but all of the rest of the doors to the school are currently still open to the community this week I spoke at the community school council meeting I've consulted with Jim Battier who's with palms and Associates in a 24/25 year veteran of the Albuquerque Police Department and then all been in communication with with Mr Scott Elder who's here today Dr Blakey and Barbara Peterson and other parents and I just wanted to bring up that problem is very vulnerable and it needs more security the school needs access badges so that they can lock those doors and then they can they can get in there's currently nothing stopping someone from coming in the front doors so we need a security officer or something like that

[01:18:00]
to my petition is that funds would be immediately made available to Manzano Mesa to to better secure the school and protect our children especially my two little boys thank you my wife has been an APS teacher for 15 years academics that's the first priority for her and my son and my son's a sophomore at Rio Grande my priority is sports baseball

[01:19:00]
can we get out instead of starting the class at 1:30 like the last year they start around 3:00 this this year so it's an hour ahead or an hour and a half after so by the time we get home by the time he gets to do homework it's already in an hour afterwards before he starts his homework so just real simple just just want to get that class back going that's it thank you thank you and our last two speakers Lori Ann Sanchez and Michael Anderson High School Community baseball

[01:20:00]
do you have a C team this year unfortunately again because of our class A lot of our freshman and sophomore players were not eligible and we're asking again I'm going to say that we would like to have our class reinstated I don't think that the proper steps to take our class away was followed initially and so I would really appreciate the to get that validated and to get that reinstated properly I believe that this class also offers support and mentoring and tutoring for players that class at 1:30 help them to get a head start on their homework make any efforts to get tutored and some of the older players would mention the younger players and a class that they previously had his freshman or sophomore my son now is a junior playing varsity and as I'm speaking we have a varsity game I can tell you that right now with this game going on we would probably have

[01:21:00]
guest room packed jammed with more parents and players and community members but please if you will take into consideration this is our future and we want great players and good students from the South Valley at Rio Grande High School thank you Google Elementary School on the street I came and spoke to the board last year about this time about the importance of physical education I keep saying I'm going to come back and make you all dance with me but we'll do that another day but yesterday I received a phone call from my sister who is also physical education teacher in Albuquerque and she informed me that one of the positions of the positions at her school is going to be cut and as I did a little bit more research didn't have much time

[01:22:00]
add a lot of classes yesterday come to find out that a grant that had been given to the state that the state gave out to low-income schools probably 1415 years ago that the the district is considering returning that Grant on the grant funded like I said low income school so that they could have more physical education for their students and so it wasn't until my trip here to the to the to APS that I found out that the board is considering giving back this grant not necessarily knowing that it's going to cut approximately 30 physical education programs throughout the city and so I was asked to ask to pull the proposal off consent until they can be further discussion on the matter Not only would it be moving possibly losing 30 piece teachers but moving people around

[01:23:00]
because of seniority and things like that could have a detrimental effect to kids throughout the entire city so I don't I know I emailed Dr Percy earlier today and it didn't seem as though he knew anything about it and I know another board member was contacted so until we know what's going on I asked that we pulled it off consent I'm also past president for shape New Mexico so we are more than happy to have that discussion with you thank you thank you thank you for your input that concludes public forum thank you Google thank you Doctor Piercy members of the board community members and staff last week I joined teacher Turtle haste yes her name is Turtle it's a beautiful name and she's a teacher a science teacher at Desert Ridge Middle School

[01:24:00]
in her science class recently was using has been using the Sally Ride Earth cam to capture photos of the Earth from the International Space Station very cool Miss Haste is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration teacher at Sea a Fulbright teacher for Global classrooms fellow and NASA Endeavor stem fellow her experience in background have allowed the students in her classes to access the special camera that's up in the space station three times a year over 2 days the students selected and requested images by interfacing with the Earth cam system stations and iPads The Experience encouraged the students to use atlas's weather forecast they really had to look at the weather for they wanted to see if they were clouds it was a no-go and Maps they chose their

[01:25:00]
change locations based on world news social studies curriculum and personal experiences more than 300 images were requested of the space station I was excited to be part of their learning experience and worked at comparing Earth photos of Japan before and after the 2011 tsunami was very telling and but however without student help I would have never been able to manage so I was very grateful and it was a wonderful time the Mister Rogers Neighborhood sweater Drive benefiting the aps Community clothing bank and Anna Gabriella special projects facilitator APS in manager of the aps Community clothing bank and France of iHeart

[01:26:00]
to record this week's episode of the iHeart media Community show about the sweater Drive they discussed the New Mexico PBS's Mr Rogers sweater Drive presented in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Mr rogers's neighborhood Miss dubrya told some great stories of people who have benefited from the aps Community clothing bank as well as sharing the journey a sweater will take from the donation box to someone's home the Mister Rogers sweater Drive continues through March the 31st and I know we all have sweaters that are gently used but perhaps no longer fit sweater donations can be dropped off at any Bank of the West in the city center in the city center Lobby or AT&T offices in the university and that concludes superintendents report thank you thank you Google

[01:27:00]
what's the score of contracts performance framework and that's a discussion presenter's Debbie Elder officer Innovation choice of Dr Joseph Escobedo get to the charter schools good evening Dr piercing members of the board thank you for this opportunity to bring the charter school contracts to you just as a couple of quick reminders on New Mexico state law states that the requirements for requirements for what a charter school contract should include we need to remember we need to remind the board that this document is the contract or agreement to allow the school to operate for the specified amount of years and cannot exceed five years the contract does guide us in the processes for oversight support any non-compliance issues or revocation and Dr Escobedo will go over more details of the board

[01:28:00]
it is a briefing on the charter school contracts and the template that we use we did not provide you each individual contract because each individual contract is I think 30 or 40 pages so each individual contract has individual items in there that are specific to the school but the general language is all the same and that General language allows us to hold all of our charter schools to the same standards and same processes for non-compliance and revocation if we need to get to that point in addition I didn't want to point out in the briefing document that we provided to you the National Association of charter school authorizer did performance evaluation of our Charter School practices in 2016 and we have improved our contract template and I just provided you that language just as a reminder so we're almost getting to the points in a couple of

[01:29:00]
words that we need them to come back to see how we've improved so that's all we have to say about the contract template if we get any questions on the contract are there any comments on the board members will go on to the item which is consideration approval of the charter school contract performance framework for the ace leadership high school and again the same folks presenting so Madam president of the contract for a leadership High School you did approve the renewal in December and we have executed the contract they have met the conditions that we stipulated in those conditions were they needed to provide us more information on standards and how they were being implemented based on Project based learning their

[01:30:00]
adaptive interim assessments and their plan to increase participation in common state Assessments in addition we have worked with them to develop their three mission-specific goals which they will be used to hold them annually accountable for items of performance outside of the school grade that is reported by the public education department so we are asking for your approval college board members so Dr Jessica indicators increasing the number of a students earning industry certification so that's already that's already occurred I'm sorry specific goals are for the three-year contract that we approved in December so we will be monitoring

[01:31:00]
schools and annually reporting them out through the state performance framework and in our annual report it's a measure for how we hold our Charter Schools accountable and we quickly went over the performance framework briefing but the briefing on the performance framework is also in your packet so I apologize about that okay thank you for remember Peterson so just for clarification this is simply the measures by which working to be there going to be evaluated and what they need to be doing into the kitchen to about they had to meet certain conditions before we even had conversations with them with their contract if you remember back to long ago and December when we had those

[01:32:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:33:00]
what's the emotion that we made back in December and there was an agreement to to do that moving forward okay thank you any other comments have a basic question from Google what's the population of the school and what are what what's the potential Mister president

[01:34:00]
remind me to know what you talking about apprenticeship or 10 or 15 minutes when we talked about like for example and number two their apprenticeship programs they vary every year but we do have some data from this past year that we can use to project that forward and their numbers are not growing they are consistent and the school is full on a waiting list it would just be for me to know sort of how are we doing today and how have we done since the beginning that will be my responsibility moving forward to report to you annually on how they are doing specifically on their mission specific goals their mission specific goals have changed vastly from when they were authorized by the public education Commission

[01:35:00]
no that's part of the work that we do once you approve the renewal we sit down and we negotiate the contract and the performance framework and so these goals will be how they will carry through through this three-year contract that we approved in December great I remember when I first joined the board the school was was in formation and they had Parents out on a Sunday morning in front in front of what was Pros Ranch Market at the time and it was impressed but there was something in there that said if you can't do the math Dot

[01:36:00]
black things that we look at once they come under our Authority July 1st I will be looking at all of those materials to ensure that they are not violating any anybody's rights or so having material like that would not be appropriate and I will be specifically looking for that sir but I cannot do that until July because they're currently authorized by the public education commission it wouldn't be under my authority currently thank you and I just have a process question so the contract that we're negotiating now this is just the beginning of it right so they haven't really been fully executed just yet Mister president July 1st because they are under the public education commission until June 30th

[01:37:00]
we have negotiated their

[01:38:00]
goals around Spanish language proficiency and IB projects proficiency levels and and that will be their goals for the next 5 years as well any comments from the board a board member again so I was looking at the assessments so I understand I mean is used in English and Spanish but the witch is the one that they used to measure language proficiency for the Spanish language to see those those second semester results to see how they did compare from one semester to the

[01:39:00]
I like

[01:40:00]
I took a test in Spanish you know I was I was doing I just ran out of time so I just want to see what it was what it was like so I should have taken the one for like kindergarten better than the one for high school but Dr Percy members of the board we use the of course the iStation K through 2 and the oven stamp then is 2 and above or 3 and above I'm sorry it's not like iStation and it's it's a little different than the and I can't remember the name of the Spanish test we used to give but it's brand new it's quite expensive actually and we will we gave our first one now so we'll have some baseline data to actually base and see what's going to come up with next year so we kind of give an estimate where we think our students can be I mean I would love to hear how how it works out for some of our other schools that have some of these other languages so it'd be nice to to hear what

[01:41:00]
what do you think about it we love to have you in any of the board members come out and visit thank you any other comments I'll entertain a motion for approval do you have a second thank you and the principal unfortunately was able to be here because she is attending the international Montessori convention and our notice their goals are very specific to the Montessori practice and I had a lot of conversations with my colleagues across the country about how do we measure Mission specific goals around

[01:42:00]
is very different in the way it works with students and assessments aren't so like I be you know they're not treated so favorably by teachers so it's a balance that we're playing and so they've been great to work with and again they would receive a 5 year contract or again so when you're looking at the habits of the mind I think there's 17 or 16 habits of the mind right and so it says that there's to increase their score so are all 17 scored from kindergarten on up do you know no so mister mister president may not be the same for 5th grade Sol

[01:43:00]
so what we're hoping and we had lots of discussion about this is that as they grow in in grades they'll continue to grow those habits of mine and and continue to develop so it'll be it's very complex of how they're going to collect the data and such but I think they have a good system down and and again in the past they were really focused on short cycle assessment data of reading and math and I'm really trying to focus them on Mission specific goals because that's what they're for they're not for just using Shortcake assessment data so when you're talking about the common rubric is that the one that was created already by habits of mine because I looked at that as well so they're already created they're not teacher created at the school they're already created so you are using those Mr President and Miss Miller going to be using those and

[01:44:00]
collecting the data and then reporting it to me we will always have a chance to audit the the data if we ever have concerns period one of the questions I asked when I initially join the board and we were talking with the school was what is their Outreach like in a sense of community because one of my concerns about Charters is that in some ways it sets up a kind of segregated education system so who gets the poor kids

[01:45:00]
who gets you know working class kids there's a lot of traffic that comes up and down the street that's near where I live which is fine and It's Tricky for the community but you can sure tell the difference between the school year and then the summer and my concern is mostly just I know it's a lottery system if I remember correctly but is there any way that we can ask them to help us with some of the kids from the neighborhood that would have an incredible learning opportunity if they went there change the way they think change the way they see the world but if we just cater to middle class and upper middle class kids with his school and that's just a general comment I don't know if you can respond to any of it or if it's appropriate to not that's fine but it is a concern I have so Mister president and Mr Garcia are

[01:46:00]
is to ensure that their Lottery process is executed per their board policy that should aligned with State Statute so I have reviewed that and I feel confident that they do that I will I will have a conversation with Miss Henwood about the Outreach to the to the North Valley Community in the duranes community about what she has done I don't know specifically I do know and I attended their actual open house that they had on a Saturday and it seemed well attended but of course you know how do you tell I know that there was a have about 120 students on their wait list but again we don't know and unless we look at zip codes where they're coming from so but we also know that that and this is the work that we were doing in innovation in school choice is parents

[01:47:00]
are you thinking in the fall semester what they're going to do the next school year so we moved our deadlines of transfers and such to online and those processes so that parents may be applying to a magnet school for example at Janet Kahn and also at Montessori of the Rio Grande and then also maybe at Corrales and they just see where they're drunk and so it's it's it's complicated but I do feel confident that the following their Lottery to the TV and it's in line with your question about the zip codes and where the students come from we can get that and most schools have a map of have done that analysis as well thank you so much I'm this thing is offering choice is a smoke screen and defaults

[01:48:00]
Choice when we start looking at what are redesign of schools in APS is and when we start looking at what are funding is and to say that a few schools can offer you know whatever offer the sky and do it by lot and meanwhile not give sufficient support to our neighborhood traditional schools not open up the ability for teachers in every single school to deepen their craft it is a choice and all it does is a siphon off that much more money make more segregated with all due respect all you have to do is look at the demographics of international of Montessori on the Rio Grande their wonderful schools no doubt about it and I see a response but

[01:49:00]
what we offer students and APS in a different way and the choice needs to be in every single School the choice needs to be every single students in every single school has the right to a baseball team into baseball class and a dance class I mean this this thing of saying we can we can make Boutique education and make it Equitable is a false choice and so I'm I'm voting for these cuz they're on the road and my long range goal is that we learned some things and pull it back in but you know sending more students to Charters isn't what's going to fundamentally turn around what happens in the life of every student today and I really believe that's where

[01:50:00]
are Focus needs to be and all we have to do is go through Finance in our budget for next year and realize that giving a handful of kids something that looks really good isn't solving our fundamental problem other comments I'll entertain a motion for Google

[01:51:00]
I'm here with us thank you very much for being here appreciate that very much take some time out of your rather busy schedule as well good evening president Dr period the members involved in it and we're going to explain the purpose and the PowerPoint and its goals executive director of Labor Relations and a partner that represents human resources for Apple Creek Public Schools Lori Webster and she is the coordinator but couldn't be here tonight but I want to recognize her for all the good I didn't see you she is here she is just as well superintendent reading and members of the board

[01:52:00]
I'm from the College of Education at the University of New Mexico I would also like to recognize our Dean Hector Ochoa and also trena Walker who is our department chair for Teacher education and a leadership they are here with us this evening good evening Albuquerque teachers Federation and I just want to draw your attention to the first Slide the cover slide where you see the three logos from the Albuquerque Public Schools the College of Education at UNM in the Albuquerque teachers Federation I just wanted to tell you that working in Partnership again has been wonderful it's revitalization it's a renewal it's a reconnection of a partnership of a partnership that we have for

[01:53:00]
play very long time that we lost for a while and it was great energy intellectual energy and dedication that created what we have to share with you tonight and it was wonderful to work together and I just want to say thank you very much to Dina choa and Dr Flores Dr Walker and all the doctors for helping us with their expertise and for human resources especially Karen for helping us put this together and keep us going and I just want to give a shout out to Lori who's an amazing person because she really did all the work we've brought to you this evening is basically a new ID of for us but it's a national Trend in some respects that we want to prepare our teachers differently

[01:54:00]
next generation of teachers to really understand about learning about teaching and how to Be an Effective Teacher in the classroom and so what we have up on the screen for you to see is that we're looking at the traditional teacher prep program the way we do it now and if you notice it has little formal coordination with a district yes we place our students out in the schools but we really don't have a strong partnership with the district and the university so The Residency model does bring that forth also they spend about 16 weeks or sometimes less of time in the classroom and so with the teacher residency we're looking at a full year so they would start let's say in the fall and then continue into the spring so they would have a full year of working alongside with a mentor teacher and then gradually taking on that response

[01:55:00]
and it's not the way that we would like it to be so what we're trying to do is that we're going to make it more relevant to the school you know and the community so that it's really tightly integrated with their clinical experience that they will have in the school also the student teacher may or may not be connected to the school now you know it depends because they might spend two days or whatever but with this kind of a program we're looking at them here and totally engaged within the school Community we have programs right now in working with APS with the Community Schools where we've already worked on doing some of this where the students are really engaged with the community they're there for longer periods of time and so what we're presenting to you are really lessons learned from other programs that we have

[01:56:00]
add with you all with the with the district and then also the student teachers are sometimes the way we do it now we replace them in different places what we would like to do with the residency is that we select schools and we place a cohort of students at those particular schools and so it's really very tight in it so it would be really very different right now we don't have the funding with this particular program because it is a funded program we will have funding for each of the residents and so that in itself is most of our students work they have night jobs 14000 will be able to really help them with some of those Finance some of those expenses the benefits for this program is is basically like I said earlier

[01:57:00]
where is other places are doing it across the country New Orleans Nashville I saw something today that came out from St Louis and they're really having success with some of these with some of the things that they're trying to do it has a positive impact on the teacher retention teacher quality and and recruitment because like I said there's the mentoring there's a support for them also some of the study shows that there's an impact on the students and so that in itself we are really excited about we're going to continue because I think it's important for us to know about the benefits of this Residency program it's we want to improve the clinical experience and that's the important piece at this point

[01:58:00]
I want to introduce you to the mission of the Albuquerque teacher residency program our mission is to make sure that we recruit prepare and retain what every student deserves and this is a phrase that Linda darling Hammond uses often a competent caring and qualified teacher and I want to point out that this is a way to not just attract people who are looking at teaching possibly as a second career but to actually retain them to give them the support that they need to be successful in their beginning year and of course after residents we have that great mentor program that really helps them to continue their learning and their support so we are basing this on some core values we know that teaching matters we know that

[01:59:00]
teachers matter we know that equity and social justice have to be at the center of our practice as teachers and then this is going to be woven within everything that they do with the embedded faculty member at every school that relationships are the foundation of teaching and learning and so as Dr Flores just said the relationships that people will build within their school Community with their colleagues with the parents and Guardians of the students and of course with the students it matters that you're there for more than 16 weeks it matters that you're there for a full year and you can see the whole cycle of a of a school year what matters also is reflection and inquiry it's not a here's a cookie cutter approach to teaching every child in every school and every District it's here's how we teach these kids

[02:00:00]
in this school in this District growth and development occur over time and we know that we want to form a Continuum of support for people who are interested all the way from pre-service like our teachers Rising educator Rising programs and some of our high schools we should you know keep that interest going and then keep that support going you know residency models are based on International research this is not just something that we're lucky enough to have a grant to do in Albuquerque and a couple other places in the United States this is really best practice that we support a teacher residency just like doctors have a doctor residency or medical residency that you grow over time that you don't learn how to teach in a crash course and then go in and you're the teacher every child deserves it takes a long time to develop our

[02:01:00]
we know that teacher preparation and development integrates research theory and practice and that's that partnership that developed this we integrate everything that we bring to the table from what the district needs and hopes for every kid in the district to what we know as practitioners both from theory and practice has to happen in teaching and then of course it's based on the idea that teaching is a profession that it's not something that you learn by applying for an alternative license and taking a couple of courses if you're lucky at night and then voila you know everything about how to be a teacher it really is a profession and it has a discreet knowledge base our goal for the next school year is that we're going to recruit 25 in teachers we also we already have some people

[02:02:00]
who are showing interest we want them to already have their bachelor's degrees and we're going to place them carefully in the three schools that have applied as full-time residents The Residency program is going to have as I said embedded faculty that will integrate the rigorous work of earning your Masters along with the theory behind pedagogy connected with the actual practice that then they can reflect on every day with somebody there to support them I'd like to add to that that we are targeting the ease with bachelor's degrees because they're already in the classrooms and this actually gives them the ability to have an income and they're perfect for this program so we are meeting with Kathy Chavez of the union for an information regarding that as well the the residents will apply for the to be a residential

[02:03:00]
will be interviewed by faculty from the College of Education as well as from the district and from the union they will also qualify for a masters so they will when they when they are admitted into this program then they will also be reviewed by The Faculty for admission into our masters graduate program as well so that they when they finish they would have their license plus their masters with the three additional courses they could have their master's degree they will be required to pass all state required tests for licensure they will pay the cost for the tuition the fees and the books but as we said earlier they will have the opportunity to earn the 14,000 stupid year and so we will then work with them and then of course like I said earlier they will receive from the state of New Mexico

[02:04:00]
temperature in elementary and secondary education they will take 24 credits toward the master's degree and then the additional three and then the teaching position in APS once they are if the with their successfulness that they will finish the program and then be hired by the district the three School selected for this unique program an opportunity are they meet the requirements of the grant demographics in the theater patterns so they're Emerson Van Buren and Highland High School all of those schools have had strong student teachers in the teacher cohorts in the past and they're all excited about it and can't wait to get this going because they know it all on board and they usually get hired at the same site after they're completely with this program hopefully we'll have so many that will have teachers for other schools as well

[02:05:00]
so our next goal as we're recruiting the residents we also have to recruit the best teachers to be the master teachers and the Master Teachers will have a resident paired with them in their classroom for an entire year we're going to work on recruiting teachers at the schools to apply to be the master teachers and they'll receive a couple things so receive a small differential because I can attest when you work with a student teacher especially when you're working with somebody all year long you have to take on added responsibilities and you also get the benefit you know of the small stipend and but also your own learning and so you're learning in several layers you're learning how to support somebody who is just learning how to teach you're learning how to do that gradual release of responsibility while you're giving them feedback the whole time and you're learning how to

[02:06:00]
talk about your own practice and you actually end up deepening your ability to do your own work and so it's a wonderful opportunity to for the existing teachers in these three schools also they get to work as partners with UNM faculty which I found very enriching in my career every time I had an opportunity to do that during The Residency year the UNM faculty in the college will be very involved they will be teaching the course work in relationship to that be part of also some of the supervision and then the professional development for the Master Teachers so the role of the UNM faculty is it in Partnership as we said and so we're excited about that opportunity to be able to do that we will have a full-time

[02:07:00]
I'm embedded faculty at the school site which is that connector between the university and the school and so that individual will help in the oversight working with the with the Master Teachers working with a students themselves the residents and then also help in the conducting of seminars when we pull them together to take a look at the things that they're learning challenges at their facing things like that and so this additional support I think is going to be really really helpful we are looking at also other faculty from within the college some of our doctoral students that we have figuring out how do we pulling this resources that we have to better serve the student that the K12 population in our schools so the funding for this grant

[02:08:00]
is it is 500,000 Grant from the national Center for Teacher residencies they've provided a lot of support they're out of Chicago and we've met with them several times they keep us on target for meeting our goals and it's for the 2018-19 year so it is just a pilot year next year it's we're going to need to sustain this program so one of our big focuses how to determine how to find money is within our current budget to sustain it because we really do see that this this Clinton medical clinical practice works when you combine theory and practice in the clinical setting and the teacher setting it keeps our teachers longer we're not throwing them in with out any past practice as we are with a lot of our teachers now so we need to find a way to fund this and hopefully as we build our Continuum with our building our Pipeline with the

[02:09:00]
mentorship program that sort of started this partnership 12 years ago before we had par we had the first year mentorship program we can build that into this Pipeline and continuing as we go on we really want to see a continual of support attracting and retaining people into the wonderful profession of teaching to not just be an Albuquerque project but maybe we could work together to make it something that the entire state is focused on there's there's a lot of practice and and research behind this and we'll have our own stories to tell I think this is a focus on revitalizing

[02:10:00]
program that's going to help us focus on the future of the teaching profession in our district and Beyond this is a really pivotal moment for all of us in public education because as things have gotten focused more on this kind of blame and shame accountability fewer and fewer people have seen teaching as a viable career when in fact it's incredibly rewarding and we want to keep telling that to everybody that will listen to the whole Community to people who really want later in life to become teachers or early or transition from being an EA it's a really exciting conversation to be had we are all of us who have worked on this real nerds about talking about teaching and the art and the craft and the research about being a great teacher we enjoy

[02:11:00]
being led by The Residency cohort and learning with others and get excited about people presenting to us so I think this is a great way to start the excitement and continue and eventually develop that whole Continuum I want to point out that once we have these Master Teachers working with these residents and modeling their practice we will keep I hope the residents in our school district and they will eventually become our Master Teachers and our mentors for our University students and then our beginning teachers so it's a great cycle and we want to keep it going and now we will stand for any questions you have thank you very much very interesting program I'm incredibly excited about the program

[02:12:00]
I recently attended a presentation on Mission graduate and so they're real big right on having a profile of what a graduate should look like in most of that profile is developed by our business community and what a graduate should look like and so my question to Mission graduate will is well when are you going to work on what a profile of a teacher might look like or what a profile of a parent or Community member might look like to help get that graduate to look like this profile so they said they looked forward to working with me on that so they didn't have any any answers at that moment but I think this is great information that you provided in your presentation in this PowerPoint that could help kind of guide them as well and reference to you know how do we meet the needs of a graduate looking like this well this is absolutely how we meet the needs and it is about having a teacher that is familiar with their Community with different cultures and with their school so I think this would lend itself perfectly to

[02:13:00]
that program as well and when it comes to sustaining the program and having those business partners who are investing in this I think that the business Community should absolutely invest if they want to see our graduates look like this profile then we need to invest in these teachers so I believe there would be a lot of business Community Partners that we could tap into and one more question on the bachelor's degree does it have to be in education or is it preferred well thank you again for the presentation and everybody on the board I just want to mention that along with the conversation with Mission graduate one of the things that makes somebody want to become a teacher or teacher role models that they had going through school that were so engaged and excited about their own career that they modeled that for the future teachers and those teachers we all know

[02:14:00]
stick in our brains we can name them and then the other thing with the business Community I would like your help with in any way possible is every time there's a career fair there's all kinds of businesses that are invited to introduce a profession to a young person who might want to go into engineering or math but they rarely have teaching as a profession that they highlight it Career Fairs so I would like to make that another connection that we have with Mission graduate thank you other comments or remember Paterson thank you for your presentation but thank you I'm really excited about it you said you have 25 slots is that correct 25% slots does that include OK Google

[02:15:00]
sustainability I was just curious about how their funding good evening some cities have turned to the business Community some are have received Federal grant funding some are sustained with Title One or title to funding from a District budget others

[02:16:00]
have set aside State funding in particular Louisiana has invested in a Statewide Residency program that's funded by the state thank you Peterson yeah thank you it really is exciting and it's very much I could have been listening to the presentation on no time to lose from the from the lesc because it's so much so it's really exciting will there be one question is there a faculty of each of the three schools or sharing time among the three schools with this particular program we will have one but that's where I

[02:17:00]
mention the others that we will have other faculty also doctoral students will have a team basically but we'll have the embedded faculty who is basically the major person who will help in guiding and monitoring and things like that we have other other programs with APS I said before and we do have an embedded faculty in each School those projects have been funded by Kellogg Foundation as well as the ECMC foundation and so right now we have seven embedded faculty working with seven schools this one will be a different one that will be working with the three schools OK Google

[02:18:00]
so many of the strategies that are used with co-teaching we will be implementing with this program as well and they're doing this at the national level you know the training that's been coming forth from Chicago they have a lot of the coal teaching strategies in in bed in that I mean the thing that's so exciting is that it's not just what it does for the incoming teachers but what it does for the the school as a whole and for the Master Teachers because we keep learning and we need we need opportunities to deepen that so thank you I'm exciting board members Peterson we fail to mention that they'll be in the classroom 4 days a week and then one day of the week they will be subbing substitute teaching for the district as after we gradually release them so probably October November they'll be a gradual release of their duties and then they are you know helping those

[02:19:00]
so it's a joint application and reviewed by both Partners we're also going to interview them together so they have to be interviewed to get into the program and we'll be doing that as a partnership so that'll be like APS UNM

[02:20:00]
when will be on the interview and then when the courses that they're taking are they going to have to go to UNM for the course for the courses we are looking at delivery on site period so do they have to pay pay for the horses at 20000 inclusive of those three additional you know they would have to pay extra but but we calculated what that 14,000 would cover and it would also probably cover those three

[02:21:00]
horses okay and so how long do they have to to complete their masters how many months do they have but generally generally it's 32 hours so it varies in this particular program they'll be done within that year and then if we they went down through the summer they probably could take some of those courses a couple of those and then finish up I would say with an additional semester so a year and a half hour and a half and then I know that you talked about a full year of clinical experience so that's based on the Academic Year at our APS schools though okay and then the last thing I think maybe two things I know you said that they that residency training teachers outperformed other novice teachers so what is that based on what's going on in some of these other states and how do they how are you

[02:22:00]
can you sing them outperforming other brand new teachers put member mother Aragon that's based on some national studies of some of the longer running residency programs in particular Boston has had a long-running Residency program as has Chicago and what they're doing is looking at student growth student academic growth measured by test scores comparing residents first year residents versus first year teachers who were not residency trained so I think in general and I can speak to this as well the research into the field of residency is is quite new and it has a lot of other benefits as well as potentially the benefit of increased academic performance OK Google

[02:23:00]
a teacher did a great job when at the end of the school year the kids still love learning and love coming to their class so that's the measure of a great teacher but that's just my opinion so and then the I think the last thing is I know you Dr Bernstein you had said you're looking for the Master Teachers so are you close to having enough for the 25th residents yeah I think we're just starting and one of the things that we're doing is advertising and making sure people know that the opportunity exists both to be a resident and to be a master teacher so we're at the beginning of that process I just want to say we've also visited the schools we went to one of the staff meetings where the with the principal we met with the principal first and his staff and then we met with all the teachers

[02:24:00]
we talked about the program and encourage them to I want to be a mentor of the students and so we just begun that so we visited all the schools already and so now we've opened it up for an application process and so we're hoping that we will you know get people to want to do that it's tough I know that they have a lot of other responsibilities but like Dr Bernstein mentioned earlier it's what they also gain from helping us in the in the preparation of the next generation of teachers and I think that that's really an important role that they play my last message because one of the things that we have to do is figure out who is applying what level of teaching and possibly subject they're interested in and then making sure we have a match with a master teacher who has been accepted to be a master teacher so it's going to be a little overlapping of in

[02:25:00]
based on the effective exemplary that's not what it's going to be based on correct the ratings there's no criteria for us to base it on the ratings in the New Mexico evaluation and then last thing is I didn't see this anywhere is there some kind of a clawback provision so let's say a resident starts and then they don't finish and they do they have to pay back any of that any of that money do they have to teach for so many years you know I know when my daughter was in a residency she had to come back to New Mexico and then they would forgive a lot of her own self boarder Aragon what we anticipated that we will not be dispersing the full amount all at one time so I believe we're looking at quarterly disbursements and so if

[02:26:00]
a student if a resident were to not continue in the program they wouldn't receive further money so just up to wherever they were that's right that's right we anticipate providing a lot of supports for residents so that they will be successful and that we hope we don't have to have anyone not complete the program and we want them to cheat I mean we want them to teach so we want them to leave so that's why I asked that question because it's like we want to say if you complete this program and we paid for it yes you do have a job with APS but we want to say you have to kind of and speaking to Seattle one of the other programs the attrition rates overall are very minimal maybe one and it's because life happened in that case so they're pretty low thank you all hey Google

[02:27:00]
you just had a general question with regards to an overview of the number of EA who are potentially eligible do you do you have an idea at this point what's the universe we're running a report on every EA with a bachelor's degree already we have the career pathway for them as in contract language so many of them are in the process of working on their ba so we're going to single those out and meet with them individually and let him know about this opportunity once they get their ba but we also need to find out who those other ease are who happen to have a ba in just aren't are just being an EA so we're looking at that data to have a meeting and you know share the information

[02:28:00]
and so we're hoping the community hears about it from this we're working with the talk show in Santa Fe Trina Walker Walker from the program is going to be meeting with them I'm meeting with Mike Brasher the radio station so we are going to be flooding the market with the information in our website and trying to get it out to everybody I've also shared it with the unions all the unions and I guess the other place if we look a little further down the road would be to look at Early College and Career high school for us but we need to really try to step it up and let it have a life of its own of course but it will if we can get the word out thank you thank you baby just a couple quick questions for me will current UNM students who are finishing

[02:29:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:30:00]
some of my questions were answered to some extent of how a master teacher was defined yes are they coming from the same three schools because that's 25 Master Teachers and that's an awful lot of teachers that we would call Master teachers from the three schools so period schools and looked at the number of potential Master Teachers because we were concerned about that but until we have the 25 residents selected we won't know exactly what content area were focusing on so it's going to be we're going to have to sort of do you know about for example you got three Schools elementary

[02:31:00]
Elementary School teacher they might be a master teacher just because they're an elementary school teacher Miss school might start to differentiate a little bit High School definitely does so you're going to are you going to have kind of an equal number in elementary middle school high school or you just don't know yet we just don't know yet we're hoping however we thought about adding an elementary if we have more K-8 or perhaps a secondary Middle High so we're sort of waiting to see what we get okay yeah I think that's that's an interesting and of course most of the programs call them but we want to call them Master teacher so we know they're not the regular Mentor teacher in April that would be an interesting question because

[02:32:00]
not be exactly what you want either it might be it might not be you know I mean I think some of the things that I remember Muller again said are important and that may not be how you have the criteria also in the subject matter area there are different people who are good and might be better as a mentor then just in their own subject matter I mean I can maybe you can teach the subject matter very well maybe wouldn't want to be a manner or maybe not being very good man or even though I might want to try that and that's a different kind of a role than just being a subject matter expert and I talked about that a lot of expertise is how you

[02:33:00]
who is going to be stewarding the next generation of teachers in to the classroom you look at people who have experienced so it's not level one teacher is necessarily hopefully you have a level three teacher you might have to match with level two which we have found in our mentoring program I think that you look at expertise as a teacher but you also look at those kinds of attributes and attitudes about how a teacher works with somebody else there are wonderful amazing teachers who do it as a solo act best and not necessarily as somebody who's going to be letting go of their classroom their students and and imparting that knowledge on somebody else so there's an aptitude to it all so right

[02:34:00]
what's almost like having a teacher's social emotional learning social skills and so forth which is a little different than just being a good teacher necessarily and relationships that you build with last year students so to speak which I'm sure I understand that relative to their own teachers you know because that's kind of part of the deal when you're trying to teach people a subject matter and we know that that's not always a good skill that everybody has so very good I think it's a great program absolutely thank you thank you thank you thank you

[02:35:00]
thank you I'd like to go on to the consideration for the UPS Board of Education

[02:36:00]
Percy members of the board this document should look very familiar to you with the exception of board member Montoya Cordova this happened you approved it October 23rd prior to her coming on to the board so there are just a couple actually one change and then I have a correction since that October 23rd date the aps Education Foundation now now is inviting all board members to attend their meeting so in addition to Dr piercing on the foundation to attend those meetings so we will send those and get those dates on your calendar and then the other change I just noticed late this afternoon under the school health advisory Council called

[02:37:00]
those are the only things that are changed so I asked permission or your approval unless board member Montoya Cordova wants to arm wrestle you for one of those slots on the organizations the only thing I'm going to say is that I don't know how this is going to play out but on the Community Schools partnership with my work we have a vested interest in that because we're also funding some of the work that they're doing and so I've been asked to to go but I have been holding back because I know we had two other board members there right now I would be going I just want to let you know I would be going and showing up but I'd be showing I could potentially be showing up as part of the Workforce Solutions Department

[02:38:00]
but I was just worried because there would be three of us there is anybody see that as a problem we do this every year if we kind of look at this again every year and see if there's any changes we need or maybe another organization we need to participate with and so we do have you know some of those things so we've talked about other things that really because they're board member here they can have an interesting what APS might get from anything you do is valid for us

[02:39:00]
all your Workforce Solutions now becomes an APS Adventure yeah so we like that so I need anything else on this if not well I think I don't do we have an accent OK Google

[02:40:00]
so we'll go on to item 7 B1 which is the update to the handbook board member mother Erica wanted to pull that off I think you have a couple of Corrections at least on this maybe and I'm not sure what other things so if you have something you'd like to say thank you please do just on the the ration of the reason for these as I had mentioned at the policy meeting the end New Mexico 6.10 there is no such there's no such code and that's listed several times and I did call again today to make sure that there wasn't so that really needs to be needs to be taken off because there isn't such a code and then the other thing I looked there's like three or four maybe more than that that they need to be taking off so

[02:41:00]
I think in the glossary of terms there were there were at least four play four or five places so we need to make sure and take that that off cuz there is no such code and then the other thing in I'm trying to think about how cuz you don't have pages I think it's on like number item number nine where it starts in red on all absences in there we are supposed to have taken out in the first bullet we were supposed to have taken out in and I know they tried Dr Percy to to kind of rewrite it in a way that it was more easily understood I still have a hard time kind of understanding it when I was looking at in school that year well what does that mean does that mean a calendar year and Academic Year it's still it's still

[02:42:00]
I'm still confused and I I try to rewrite it in a way that I thought would be more understandable and I looked at a couple of other districts that had written this and what they had a lot of them had written is this is what they had written and enrolled students so what they did is they put the word enrolled in front of students so they said an enrolled student is chronically absent if they have and everybody has a 10% if they have missed 10% or more of the Academic Year for any reason and then everything else that was there and give me a clue where this is I'm sorry OK Google OK Google

[02:43:00]
top of the page and then it says all absences it's just kind of hard because we don't have the numbers on every page is it okay if I'm

[02:44:00]
memory kind of went over this a bit and try to find the right words I think that would have to get changed in the glossary of terms as well right cuz I think that was in there was in there again but I don't know what everybody else thinks I know we tried we mold over it and yes yes Google I think

[02:45:00]
make the sound sounds good so be sure you get that wording to Brenda on that and and again I think with regard to the nmac I want $6 whatever 180 just remove that you can still say the attendance you know because there is an attendance it's just that we don't have the right number if you got a number on it you can put it in there but I couldn't find it I couldn't find your number but I couldn't find it so if you got a number there if you can't find a number take the number out cuz it's so something else

[02:46:00]
is it going to be it's where everything starts in Blue on number 11 so if we kind of go to I can't even count them I'm sorry one two I think on the restorative it probably start restorative justice practices it's talking about the school safety team that a child could be referred to the school safety team that they may want if there are threats I just think that may be that not should be made because threats if we look at some of the threats that happened in Parkland they were threats and nothing happened so they weren't they didn't take them seriously and I think threats were saying they're going to be taking seriously but then we use the word may because we've said that

[02:47:00]
so it says situations that may weren't conducting a school safety team meeting include verbal and physical threats to do harm so then which of those would warrants which of them may want and which of them may not what kind of what kind of a threat to children safety and its threats or use of use with weapons or explosives so I'm kind of going to somebody's threatening to shoot up a school should it just be maybe will refer to school safety team I have a hard time with the word me these are people threatening to do and it could be before

[02:48:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:49:00]
physical threats threats of use or involvement with weapons or explosives I'm sorry Google

[02:50:00]
on a daily basis you know last year I don't know how many threats we got from all kinds of places and they are jumped on investigated the principles are brought in it's a team effort so that I don't think that I don't know that it'll make a difference I think that you end up sending a number of young people through the criminal justice system when in some cases that's appropriate but I think in some cases it's one of those what I described as a knucklehead face or a silly adolescent you know lack of judgment kind of and I think we have folks who are in place to review

[02:51:00]
what was done it goes all the way to the superintendent I think the redundancy is making sure that we look and somebody looks over one shoulder if you will to say you know I think you missed something here but my sense of it is that what we're trying to do is dictate safety and I don't I don't know through my experience that you can necessarily predict every case summary what happened in Florida I think that whole sentence is more than just weapons Netflix's always

[02:52:00]
changes and all I want to do is make sure that we're doing everything we can to make sure our kids are safe and we're using the words that we need to use sometimes that's all we that's all we have so we need to try to use them that we the best that we can you know sometimes we don't have the money to put into action a plan a real plan so we have to use what we can and I agree with with Lorenzo too that there are some kids that would get you know put go to the safety team that didn't need to but then they might go a little more concerned about is that doesn't necessarily

[02:53:00]
how we deal with them has to be part of the Judgment situation so you know I think that's the point is that we take seriously so we're not going to throw a threat out just because we think well you're just going to look at that and see whether you are a knucklehead or not and we're going to find out whether it's not the situation you know and someone says they have a gun in their backpack we're going to find out we're not going to have a backpack what are you talking about why are you talking this way what a situation

[02:54:00]
figure out what was going on so I I think again the sentence to me makes okay as long as we understand that we're going to take off that seriously and we're expecting our people to be trained to some extent or to at least work with people who are trained to figure out what these are our counselors are very southern people who are dealing with easy shoes all the time I can't expect every teacher to know everything I don't think I think it's okay the way it is but again I think they're just trying to give you some examples here and there certainly not covering all examples they're just saying here's some situations

[02:55:00]
if you're talking about weapons you're probably going to go to the SST you know what I mean period because we need to figure out what's going on why I asked if we could say that but then now we get into the Deuteronomy OK Google

[02:56:00]
Pembroke is for K12 so the may give you that Latitude just on the edge basis so I absolutely think if you've got to what you're thinking about remember me later I got a kid locks in with a gun oh absolutely that's not a May and that's what but we can't delineate every single case because students are very creative in the way they break the rules and having dealt with the twice exceptional students at CCC they did really have to be very very creative to keep up with them so not having it locked down into a an absolute was very helpful with those kids I think we have to have the language that says we take every set threat seriously because we do and I think he needs to be our philosophy so I have absolutely no problem with that

[02:57:00]
we're dealing with threats are not just somebody walking up to you and saying hey I'm going to do X we're getting threats across the internet through social media that is actually crying tremendous resources both using state and federal resources to track back which are resulting in arrests for young people in New Mexico don't want to do that but we need to make it very clear we're not going to allow anything and some of the students I mean we have one young student tell us I did it because I wanted the day off a horrible lesson to learn but no 1500 people you know we've had others that were doing it because they thought it was

[02:58:00]
and we will investigate with full resources and we may really bring the hammer let me let me just done that basis there and then right after it says the first sentence for sentence that says students may be referred to the student safety team together period that means exactly what you're going to do and then we say each other

[02:59:00]
am I going to do that the result of that may well be different things depending upon what you find that was brought up the compulsory attendance what 6.108 point something is 6.108 so I've been doing the research to over the last few minutes and it was and two six point eight point 10 and then but then there was one place where you just said listen to 6. 1 0 1

[03:00:00]
6.10 8.1 6.10 or whatever it is 0.883

[03:01:00]
students

[03:02:00]
who's in the school and her parents as well to bring our schools to bring our students forward in Academia thank you I do think we work on the handbook almost year round is that correct so it's not like we just all of a sudden the last week decided to make some changes to the handbook so if you can take your suggestions in terms of making sure that we have things on in Spanish as well as his English making sure that people know early enough making sure we get that and maybe bring it to the board a little earlier because we tend to be picky and I think that's okay so you know that might help the process a little bit to get a little bit earlier so that'll help okay what's that will go on to the general approval of the consent calendar items less than 70 for the acceptance of the calendar items without that one night of a second can we

[03:03:00]
request some information regarding before we vote on it but I have a second before we have a discussion thank you okay now I have a discussion regarding the funding for the PE I looked through and I can't figure out I can't figure out where that information is coming from is is there is no consume

[03:04:00]
but as far as I know I don't know anything about the idea of cutting the PE or having a grant not renewed or I know nothing about that you wouldn't there is no Grant there was no Grant right and so I yeah there's nothing on here Barbara as far as I know that has anything to do with that yeah I couldn't find it but could we get could we sort of investigate a little bit more information
