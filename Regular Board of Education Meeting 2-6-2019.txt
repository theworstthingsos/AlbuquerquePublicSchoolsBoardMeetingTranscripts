[00:27:00]
and congratulations again to everyone we're going to step now into a public forum so whether you are here with the request for the Board of Education or just see how the Board of Education operates we want you to know that you're welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum at signing in to speak tonight you received a signature forming copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting the open meeting 1978 chapter

[00:28:00]
an Article 15 requires the agendas contain a list of specific items to be discussed or acted on it meetings due to these rules public forum is not a dialogue with board members public forum is an opportunity for the Board of Education to listen to you and hear your comments tonight there are six speakers and two accommodate speakers each speaker has two minutes for comments within the 45 minutes public forum the timer remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you at the end of the time giving please complete your sentence quickly so that other speakers will have a chance to speak you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with in the 45-minute public forum Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting

[00:29:00]
do you may listen to the board member comments before we adjourn it's only at this time that your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so our first speaker is Franklin Chicago my name is Franklin I am a proud Albuquerque Resident Evil I have just finished the writing of my 13th book entitled who will teach the children recruiting and refreshing and Harley effective Educators Albuquerque like much of the state and the country is experiencing an intellectual educational Exodus the book addresses the difficulty of getting Harley qualified license highly effective educators

[00:30:00]
can feel such a science math English as a second language and special Educators in our classrooms we need to recruit retain and refresh classroom teachers we cannot reach the heights required by stemm unless we have fully licensed Professionals in our classes and are now front offices in a report entitled sharing the high cost of principal turnover by the school leaders Network the state of New Mexico is targeted as having among the lowest average years of a principal leading the same school from 2.7 to 3.5 years the cost of replacing that principal is typically 75000 in 2014 figures imagine how much we could as a system imp

[00:31:00]
if we retained those principles if we look into highly performing cities we will find highly effective schools I thank you for your attention do you get a free book if I answer all your questions our next speaker is Berlin Coker the first of all I wish to recite to you the last two lines of the first time that I spoke here with aps's history of statistical dishonesty and administrative I cannot ask if this gets fixed overnight I can only ask that we do better so I really want to

[00:32:00]
stand that from day one I understand that this cannot be solved instantly and I do find it very insulting that you keep asking as if I don't know that there are constant comments of this won't be solved overnight this won't be solved instantly and I do find it quite insulting clarification as well last time I had mentioned the issues with the calendar and the issues are more so with the presentation of the Optics you guys had had during the approval process you had asked if there was anything change from last time to this time and there was they said there was none and you all were okay with that not even so much as acknowledgment of any efforts to put in the public culture days and then subsequently acted as if I had some opportunity to understand that these changes were made and again it's sort of his belittling that you know you get these responses where I only have the two minutes as well there's an admission of the IEP accusation that I had made that they are fraudulent that has been admitted in the last meeting or in the minutes for the last meeting which points to either you don't understand that they

[00:33:00]
are fraudulent or you know it's a problem and don't really want to admit it either way it is very concerning in response to the most recent public forum that you gave the Native American Community it was quite frankly and insult the time allotted that you gave was only 60 Minutes Which is less than the time that we took for the previous board meetings that wasn't enough time then it certainly isn't enough time now as well there wasn't an actual dialogue with the community especially not with you guys as you were all in the audience even so it was at a very prohibitive location that I could not get to through public transportation that is a huge issue as well there was no moderation there was a woman who spoke for things completely outside of the realm of what it was for and there was no moderation for and that's cost for great concern because it shows a lack of protection for hours

[00:36:00]
can you hear New Mexico as we all know the bond election did not go as we had hoped but regardless the members of Carver's local 1319 stanbury to assist APS with future Bond elections District needs and of course our community efforts to training the next generation of Tradesmen and women will the blonde Was Defeated our members and staff phone banks are over 400 members in the Albuquerque area to explain the importance of its passage of the last several weeks we estimated to assist again and future needs labor stands with this District its board members Educators and staff thank you thank you is Janet says good evening members of the board and superintendent reading and like 40,000 people who did vote in favor of the tax increase I was very saddened and disappointed by the results

[00:37:00]
best I felt that our local newspaper took it upon themselves to place letters to the editor and other correspondence and headlines in such a way to call attention to the negative side rather than the positive side and I think other media Outlets did the same thing there has been criticism that this publication didn't explain things so if you turn to the inside page like when the big complaints I heard was how much will it increase my taxes on my house the very first thing that says and you find your house and then it shows you how much more you'll pay I mean I'm not sure how much more I would have paid 100.00 out of 2000 dollars a year I would have paid another 100

[00:38:00]
which I would have been happy to pay because I also noticed that the middle school I went to McKinley which opened in 1954 and much of McKinley is the exact same structure from when I was there in 1960 so it's it's off the table won't be finished a really deloso which feeds into Del Norte and you all know my heart is with the Del Norte cluster and that won't be finished but I just in conclusion I wanted to compliment superintendent reading for her very calm dignified response about where disappointed but we respect the Democratic process and the will of the electric I thought I'm not sure I could have been so pleasant but compliments to your response thank you

[00:39:00]
are next speaker is Tony Watkins Watkins OK Google is the high school and I'm concerned that maybe that protocol didn't make it down to the schools because the number of those ideas been very useful in what happened at the high school so curious to see that actually get into the school hands of the school people secondly I want to support the ideas of going about extending the time for public speaking for political refugees

[00:40:00]
tell the whole story and also I want to support the board member Peterson's idea to move the reaction of the board to public comment to directly after public comment so people don't have to wait till the end of the meeting 300 I was at the community Forum at Paradise Hills and just some ideas around that one it seems like it would be good to form a circle and have someone with a mic in the middle of the circle and just passed the mic around so it could be a dialogue because even though it was kind of different than a board meeting and it was still one of my communication back and forth and what we really need for healing is a conversation and lastly I want to Echo the sentiments of many people at the Forum that we not do cultural competency training but we do anti-racism training and I know many of you are familiar with Anthony racism training many of you have been through the people's Institute Training from

[00:41:00]
nationally and dozens of us have been directly impacted by that training and they're actually doing the executing some of those principles in our daily practice so it's like big Cadre of local people who have been through that training that can help help if you rely on us to help so thank you thank you our last speaker is Cara and I wish I could read your last name OK Google and we are a group of parents who are dedicated to making change throughout New Mexico for our children who have disabilities so we're talking special ed here our children are in March group they come in many colors and ethnicities from many different types of families

[00:42:00]
many are nonverbal often their parents extremely busy caring for them plus other children the financial marital stress that families go through who have children with special needs we appreciate the three board members who attended our recent screening of the kids we lose and we hope to show it again we do feel the condition of special education with in New Mexico let alone New Mexico's rating in our national rating deserves and needs more discussion more than the one to two minutes allotted to parents who are able to leave work to be here in time to sign up and also to be able to stay until the end of the meeting to hear the results of what you would like to say so I'm not one of those parents that can stay but we do again

[00:43:00]
play each and every one of you two are Thursday night every Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. at the law board on Jefferson and mass 10 where we've developed 22 systemic issues a parent in this District were researching it we are looking for a change and I'm putting together projects to do this we would like to see all School staff held accountable for abuse as in the recent Florida media coverage so that we can feel our children are safe thank you thank you thank you Google

[00:44:00]
so I appreciate her being here so go ahead Raquel thank you thank you president Pearcy board members community members and staff I want to start with the word about our loss of the special election last night and election is a very complex and at the same time very simple process that we all Embrace respect and honor as part of the democratic fabric of our country our voters have spoken and we acknowledge their decision I greatly appreciate the efforts of all who supported the district and I'm thankful that we never wavered from the fact that this was about our children we can be proud of that and we are proud of that because when you come right down to it at 8:00 p.m. and we are all in this together

[00:45:00]
disappointed with the results of course I am I worried that this puts in Jeopardy many of the plans for student safety School repair and Technology refresh that were already in motion I know that the very school that I know that very many important school buildings in facility projects will come will not come to fruition and so just as any good teacher would do to improve a lesson plan we are working to reassess review adjust and revamp for now all sb99 accounts are frozen and or put on hold until the high priority list of District needs is Rihanna realized and updated I'm hopeful that will have a report for you at the Capitol Outlet property and Technology committee meeting on Monday keeping my fingers crossed about that and the work of learning and

[00:46:00]
learning and teaching continues at our schools it has never stopped and it never will it is our most noble responsibility and we take that very very seriously so I would like to talk about some very positive things are happening in high schools as they create new innovative ways to work with Community Partners and talk with students about their futures for instance students and parents from every part of the city recently participated in job club that was hosted in partnership with Workforce Solutions I was so impressed with job Club in the energy at the Convention Center address and potential employers got together and the best way to describe this atmosphere would be to use the word joyous it was fantastic such energy in that room

[00:47:00]
Rio Grande High School has was chosen by the Acer Foundation to bring in speakers from cool speak school speak is a youth engagement company that come that works to keep students inspired parents involved and teachers engaged cool speak spoke with students about the importance of following your dreams and continuing your education partnership with the national Hispanic Leadership Institute APS in partnership with Junior Achievement and Mission graduate hosted a job shadowing day to expose students to Career possibilities that they may not have previously considered companies are hosting more than $900 students from Albuquerque as part of the groundhog week this week high school classes

[00:48:00]
participating in this event each student will spend a day with an organization learning about operations and Staffing possibilities as well as participating in interactive activities and discussions this is the first year APS a city center has been one of the host sites for the event on Monday 55 Avid students from Manzano High School in Highland High School came to city center and visited with staff at the aps Foundation curriculum and instruction Department counseling equity and engagement nursing coordinated school health student health and life skills the employee assistance program and even visited with the superintendent in her office it was really fantastic it was a delight to be part of the process and share some of the behind the scenes activities and career opportunities with the students

[00:49:00]
Cibola High School held its first safety assembly this week the safety and assembly spread the word to students and staff about the fact that cultural discrimination bullying harassment and chronic meanness would not be tolerated the message included practical strategies the students could use to safely report and stand up for each other more over the group of students from diverse backgrounds plan together and delivered a message about the power of kindness and the impact that we can have on each other's lives if we pay attention are respectful and if we are Advocates each in our own ways this is a powerful and empowering lesson for everyone to hear and reflect upon the students were very engaged in walked away with Keen awareness of how the simplest the simplest of thoughtful interactions can make a world of difference for individ

[00:50:00]
the assembly was impactful in multiple ways this concludes the superintendent's report thank you thank you secretary reading we're going to specializations we have a presentation of the partnership between the aps Communications office in K&W to add a new digital content platform to the district's Outreach repertoire the discussion item and Monica is executive director of communications period

[00:51:00]
help flush out the actual reality of Albuquerque Public Schools and we absolutely agree the aps Communications Department and partnership with the district's radio station kanw FM next week on February 12th if you want to put that in your calendars will add a new digital content platform to the district's Outreach efforts it'll be a monthly broadcast hosted by a captivating Storyteller who is a relatable APS expert in the aps office of communications has discussed having a podcast for a couple of years now as you may or may not be aware podcast with the fastest growing communication venue out there they're convenient parents don't have to show up to a public meeting you can listen to a podcast and boost your intelligence for information by simply just sitting there they go where you go and we found this to be a really attractive

[00:52:00]
for the clients that we serve mostly our students are parents but the rest of the community so recently retired Grant Middle School teacher and band director Mark Goodrum approached us with the proposal to start an APS podcast and from there we went to the superintendent the cabinet of course Brenda Yeager helped us and here we are just a couple of months later thank you very much in the Albuquerque Public Schools his wife is an APS teacher assistant and their two sons are San Diego high school graduates Mark brings a lot of the table in terms of the program and lending his teacher voice to our podcast before I introduce myself

[00:53:00]
that podcast give you a chance to hear what the podcast is all about hello and welcome to our first episode of the aps open book podcast my name is Mark Goodrum and we are so excited that you have taken the time to listen to our podcast you might be asking yourself who is this guy and why should I care what he has to say about Albuquerque Public Schools thanks for asking graduated from Sandia High School I am proud of the students teachers and staff of Albuquerque Public Schools I felt it was important that the accomplishments of the schools and particularly album

[00:54:00]
who's between the community and the district to help solve issues in other words the way problems are solved is by dialogue I took the idea of a podcast to District administrators and here we are with the support of the district I hope to use my expertise as an educator and that of many others to pull back the curtains on School District Operations and give people a real time view of 143 Schools 83,000 students and 1400 + 7. 0

[00:55:00]
stream and prevention I think you will be rattled to learn just how often students contemplate suicide and relieved to know something is being done about this I guess today are Victoria War Reed District crisis resource counselor for Albuquerque Public Schools and Nancy Wiggins special ed teacher at Grant Middle School and Nick Estrada a senior at Volcano Vista High School welcome everyone thank you so much so the podcast gives us an opportunity to talk about a better understanding of of the school system in our natural environments as part of the podcast and so Mr

[00:56:00]
president with your permission we'd like to invite Mr Goodrum to come and speak to you mark come on up thank you good evening well well with all that I hope I don't disappoint first of all I feel I'm going back in time a little bit I started in 84 at Manzano high school as the assistant band director and Manzano has a deep place in my heart along with Harrison Middle School started down there for 5 years and I just loved that part of our life we were young just moving from Louisiana my wife and I in 20s and just starting a career I'm originally from Boston and went to school in Louisiana State University and that's where I want

[00:57:00]
I also want to what I was experiencing sitting down and watching the Educators come up here and the open Forum of the speakers and the wonderful young people that came up that's what I hope that we can bring together on this podcast it is going to be challenging because it's only once a month and this is Whirlwind of topics but how many of you listen to a podcast

[00:58:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:59:00]
and here we are I really need to say thank you to Michael and Kevin and K A&W for their expertise and professionalism and getting this thing this was not what I expected believe me when I retired I didn't expect to be standing in front of you all or doing this podcast but I really think it could be and I think it was the first episode of a very good tool to reach out to the community and let me close by this I just think that I'm married I think there are a lot of people that are in relationships here and have some type of relationship and we all know in a relationship it will not work if we don't have communication and that communication you know sometimes my wife and I argue and a lot of times it's great and so my point is that that communication with this podcast would you like to have

[01:00:00]
I'm back as well many topics coming up in the future so with that if you have any questions or comments or concerns thank you very much for your time and let me open up to the board for questions how long is the podcast good question where averaging around 30 minutes right now 30 minutes episodes

[01:01:00]
that we did a lot of research before we went into this and about the average the average time is about 20 minutes but this topic required to just a little bit more and how the process is working is that Mark is meeting with the communications team to go over topics we have been very clear that a podcast is not a public affairs show so that he's doing a lot of research behind the scenes he's telling us who he wants to talk to you what information he he'd like he's Gathering that and then bringing the story ideas back to us we actually had a rehearsal before we shot the before we recorded the first episode because we wanted everyone to understand that what we're trying to create here is a conversation where we have no professional sports

[01:02:00]
yes but not a single billionaire until that changes the focus is always going to be on crime and government because governments the only industry so one of the only tools we have to tell a story is to bring our folks out and someone who's been in the classroom for 33 years and has heard so much and has his own opinions coming in is better to be able to guide us to what wants to you know what should be discussed out there so we're sort of following marks ideas exploring what we think people would like to know more about and we're being very candid one of the things you're going to hear in this podcast that you know we don't talk about a lot because it's difficult to brooches the District Attorney's 1800 thread assessments a year do some people that's alarming that podcast is that good thing that's 1800 kids we've reached and possibly provided services for so

[01:03:00]
it's a whole it's a whole production behind the scenes the idea is to focus on one topic per month and this is also a direct response to some of what we heard from from the board the superintendent has asked a few of us to put some effort into better Partnerships with kanw and knew we'd love to see something like this with our partnership with me as well thank you appreciate the opportunity to work with you all I want to thank you and thank you very much

[01:04:00]
play Mr Brasher then who's going to have the final final say on the topic of the month the from our standpoint will probably be the distribution system in the car and the content will be determined by by Markiplier a lot of collaboration so the conversations between my office is superintendent and the office is involved there has to be enough content and there has to be enough information of Interest people are really not going to tune in to learn about the district they're going to tune in to learn about the things that they've never heard before and that's what we're going for so it's a collaboration

[01:05:00]
so how do we turn this into a dialogue I mean I see the potential for getting a lot of issues I mean just tonight in public forum there any number of issues that came up that certainly need to be addressed and so we keep finding ways and and I appreciate the pieces that are coming together I think they need to be more with the real long range plan of how we get information out to the community but we're better than that even though we need to get better at that than figuring out how to get the information in the dialogue in and so how do we use this as a format one of the

[01:06:00]
cutest things about the podcast is that it is free as of February 12th you can access it off a PS dot edu you'll be able to hear it on kanw you can get the link from K&W it'll be on iTunes on YouTube on every possible platform where podcasts are available I forget the number of hundreds of millions of people who now listen so this now becomes a tool the success of getting it out there is in the promotion and that's part of what we're doing tonight part of the next couple weeks Mark will be talking with local reporters will be sending emails to everyone imaginable sending them the link asking them to listen and then we've already set up an email account from Mark Mark will get that feedback and based on some of that feedback other topics will come with the discussion and what happens once the dialogue is out there

[01:07:00]
absolutely the two-way communication is so important to make this work so one thing is Monica mentioned was the email that will be out there for the community to give information social networking through Twitter as well as Facebook and others that way the community can reach back to us and give us ideas and and bring in topics and you know the sky's the limit real quick I'll mention that would like to reach to the parent organizations at the schools and and get their input ideas comments and questions through just means as well

[01:08:00]
thank you very much appreciate the initiative that you're taking and I'm very pleased that K&W helping to get this launched My Hope Is that will be able to reach people from around the state so that the various opportunities that you have through I don't know what they're called channels or whatever ways of communicating on Native American Insurance we have a number of Unsolved issues and I hope that

[01:09:00]
there may be a way to figure out how we let people know that yep we don't we don't know the answer to this just yet but this is where we intend to go it's confounding at best but I don't think that it's something that we need to shy away from so I appreciate it very much

[01:10:00]
conversations if need be because I know that you know that can be challenging sometimes yeah good question are there protocols well to be honest with you we haven't gotten there yet I'm sure that while you were asking the question if something came my way through email or what have you digitally I would obviously send it to Monica and have a conversation about it and try to find a way to proceed that way but also just try to address whatever the topic may be respectively and have that conversation protocols written down right now we don't we haven't really glad you brought it up so I'm sure you know

[01:11:00]
has gone through my mind as we were playing this on is when anytime you deal with the public you have to know that it's all out there and so you have to be ready I worked at AutoZone and so you know many years and also middle school so my point is that you just have to be ready to address those issues and those questions and comments take it one step at a time and have more than one person involved to try to make this come out as cohesively as possible I don't know if I had to leave you a question but we're working on it all right thank you I recently bought a new car and

[01:12:00]
so I go to the dealer and blah blah blah and so the salesman comes up and he's one of my former students and I said I can I'm terrible with names and I but I remember eyes and I said and he said Mr G and I said oh my God and he said his name so he's all grown up for kids and I've had hope for 33 years I have to tell you I loved teaching

[01:13:00]
fan for 33 years and Fine Arts and Music in schools and seeing the kids at Grant Manzano Harrison and all the kids and so anyway this is a small tool that I think can help us as a community Albuquerque the city and the district to have a better relationship I'll shut up thank you for stepping up and wanting to do it I mean I think it gives us an opportunity to explore that one tool and see how it can help us as we're moving forward so let me just a little bit with the

[01:14:00]
I mean you have somebody there you're going to dialogue and you're doing that kind of a dialect so that's kind of an online dialogue do you have the opportunity to have people either call in or send an email or something like that to ask a question you know that kind of thing and then the second part of that would be after the fact people obviously can send something in and we may be respond to them and in some kind of a not exactly a dialogue but you know kind of an offline dialogue about other thoughts about that a lot of time and effort goes into actually research information to decide

[01:15:00]
what information is going to be most interesting to people so there are it's not a live call and show I do sit in on the recording of the rehearsal and the actual shows so that if anything was said that shouldn't have you know we're always careful with privacy there are issues sometimes that can be sensitive so we can catch and Kevin Otero as Michael brochures mentioned is fabulous if we need to edit we did not edit this time but the whole concept of a podcast is it says if someone is dropped you in the middle of a conversation and if there's feedback later Mark has an email address and part of his commitment to the project is to respond to those listeners either via email or phone message and we'll know after the 12th how that goes and what kind of feedback we get and determine from there you know how we go about addressing that and I'm

[01:16:00]
what's your mark would be delighted from time to time if you'd like to invite him back to sort of give you a summary of how it's going it's not in the studio and can you tell me if it's once a month is there a specific time and date did you do this are you planning to do this let's put it that way there will be a Broadcasting

[01:17:00]
play time on the podcast is which is probably where they'll have a pretty good listenership you know it's available 24 hours today is basically to be able to listen to it anytime you want to that's alright I suppose to some specific time because like we always have specific times I wasn't sure exactly how that worked with it but yeah okay that's good well I greatly appreciate that you play an instrument

[01:18:00]
play don't know the protocol here so forgive me but you're okay the Rio Rancho Horizon band it's for over 50 I don't know if you like that we need clarinet players and that's for anyone here does anyone else

[01:19:00]
March 2nd which is a date when my granddaughter is actually performing in Legally Blonde performance high school and that's a priority for me so but I would be remiss if I did not plug the Albuquerque concert band yeah and I know that because Gabriella plays in that game so thank you very much I appreciate this information and thank you for I think it is a great opportunity for us to do a little bit more in the dialogue and a little bit more in the programs and and so that may be a good way to do some of the discussion on on the Native American on the different different kinds of things that we are trying to do or that need to be done you know and some of those discussions and I know we have one on

[01:20:00]
that's more of a Life program the kind of thing I think so thank you period in the community the next topic for February superintendent really has accepted marks invitation to sit down and he had many questions that I would have never thought of cuz I wasn't a teacher for 33 years but he thinks there's Great Value in the community getting to know the superintendent and asking what it's really like to have that job in those responsibilities every day so the March episode will be on the aps superintendency

[01:21:00]
released

[01:22:00]
play 30th whenever that was and that was up to 4190 and 85 cents and so just as a reminder that's the base of what every unit is but every student may be worth more than one unit so that's where we get the average person to cost at the very top of the document but it's a 4190 and 85 cents and then we put for you the 2017-18 final unit value this is one of the earliest times that I can remember the final unit volume fairly early it's fairly it doesn't have to be until January 31st

[01:23:00]
just off the top of your head how many total units do we have 75.00 * 12.1

[01:24:00]
130 when the funding formula to 0.250 so you'll notice that there's 113 million being appropriated for that and then the public education department or Governor's budget has almost 7 million for an increase in the bilingual Multicultural factor and then you'll notice that the LFC budget takes credit for capping the agent 22 and moving that 6.1 million dollars to the higher education budget to support adult basic education or students after 22 who want to earn their GED the small school size adjustment you'll notice that there's a 14 million dollar credit that is a 3 year that they're proposing and then they're adding this rule isolation factor to give real school districts another bump their major difference is between the funding of extending extending learning

[01:25:00]
set the governor's asking for 183 days to be funded at 18.795% and then lfc's looking at 1% and that's the

[01:26:00]
lawyers contribution and then on the second page you'll notice some funding for insurance fixed costs there is a bill that would prohibit or prohibit Public School Personnel from earning less than $12 an hour and that is being funded at 5 point 95 million so then you get into the hole compensation that everyone has been talking about so teacher compensation the governor's recommending a 6% increase for lfc's recommending a 5 and a half percent principals looking at a 6% increase for principals and then 7 and a half percent for in the out of sea budget other school Personnel the governor's asking for 6% across the board or legislative finance committee and then you can see the difference is between the proposed minimum salary from tier one the governor

[01:27:00]
asking for 41,000 to be the minimum for tier one and outfits recommending 40 and then for tier 2 and tear 3 there at the same at 50 and 60,000 and then sending a minimum principal salary of $60,000 across the state so you'll notice other funding that we watch Transportation public Pre-K fund to really think about how do we move towards Universal Pre-K and the four and five year old or the 4 year old program and then again that instructional materials the one time funding the reason this hasn't moved quite frankly is that there will be a new Revenue estimate coming out next week no later than Friday gas prices have dropped but

[01:28:00]
that was three or six to nine months behind that drop when we're actually going to see the revenues drop so we'll have to wait on that Revenue estimate but over the past few years that has learned to be a reality check that there isn't that much money available so that's why these things haven't moved forward properly so I'll turn it over to Dr doll unless you have any questions on the budget if you want to take them separately yeah there's probably take him separately

[01:29:00]
legislators don't understand that there's a team that makes schools work so that's that's number one is their conversation going on I mean we can't we can't hire a selfie we can't attract Otis we've got to be compensating them equitably with with teachers so that's the first concern and then the other one when it comes to salary and to put a lower percentage increase for the lowest paid employees in the district I mean we need we need the legislative

[01:30:00]
Mr President and Mrs Peterson this exact conversation was happening in House Appropriations just today the public education the secretary designate was before the committee reminding them of her budget request probably the third or fourth time they've done the presentation but while we were getting ready to leave that exact conversation was going on what is the recommendations for all staff and the conversation again was pointing out that the executive was recommending 6% basically across the board so for teachers principles and all staff just 6% with the LFC was dividing that up so really talking about what language they were going to put into the budget that would require the school districts to do exactly what your point is but also leaving local control to do more if there is sufficient dollars from my understanding gets really works through the negotiation process after the

[01:31:00]
the public education department the authority to Grant a diploma to a student who had met certain factors so they have

[01:32:00]
I don't remember the factors will have to check on them but if they set a cap that the K through 12 or scg funding cannot flow to any student who is after the age of 22 those programs wouldn't be funded so the 6.1 million and there's about 600 and or 6,000 I don't remember the number but there's adult students across the state that are getting funding and so I think we only have about 10 students in Albuquerque Public Schools who are in the Glendale school like Gordon Bernal other schools who are trying to do adults you know support

[01:33:00]
do not reoffend so this should be concerning to this should be concerning to to everyone I think that's something that we need to make sure that we keep our eye on so this is still currently in the current version of Senate Bill 1 and then in House Bill 5 the original version of that still has the cap in there there's been a lot of work to try to figure out how to like this fix about allowing the public education department to Grant the diploma there are some concerns from legislators who tell us that they don't you know their needs to be a clear distinction between an adult being in the same classroom as a 16 year old and so I think they're trying to really think thoughtful about this and so you know we just have to wait to see what actually the solutions are but we've tried to Advocate your position on that issue

[01:34:00]
to my heart these are people that are very marginalized and and forgotten and those people that are in MDC and at Gordon Bernal that are really trying really hard to get their diploma they deserve it it doesn't matter they may have dropped out of school and we didn't pay for it you know when they were 15 or 16 and we're paying it for them now when they're 159 it doesn't matter when we pay for it it matters if they get their diploma so this is just something that's really very very important to me and and several others discussions and again we're expecting a new rollout of changes Saturday I guess so individuality and then you may not get it until you're 65 doesn't matter that number is not what matters it matters having that diploma in your hands and we just did some research from

[01:35:00]
we can share it with you that showed all of the states in their age caps in Alabama to actually just passed in age gap of 17 so they're going the other way so just to give you perspective on how much we've dug into this issue I guess a lot of it's going to be in the way that it's implemented as well because I know with a lot of adult education programs work with them as part of Workforce Solutions and they're all so meeting the needs of individuals that are maybe incarcerated in different kinds of ways in different cities and so they do fund those programs but I also know that they are limited in the amount of funding that they have to do that so you know yes it is important that those individuals you know however they get there right I just I would want to make sure that in the implementation

[01:36:00]
can actually apply and become an adult and provider and at least receive those funds and continue to do the pieces that they do because I think that's part of what it's just like one half dozen of the other I think they're probably is currently a blended funding structure right now for them but you know how do they how do they put it together so that they're working in partnership with adult and they can still do that when I did meet with the adult ed lead last week we were talking about this because she was talking about that high school equivalency and I think also another bill that's talking about expanding how that high school equivalency can also be administered so that we're not just limited by one but that there's like a structure that makes it possible for there to be a range of how high school equivalency can be giving out yes and Mr President and his really trying to figure out a high school dip

[01:37:00]
Multicultural education program Factor there but then also looking at how instructional materials if there's conversation around what that's going to look like around some of these Multicultural pieces and is it is it just factored in is part of that because I know we've never really had enough money to do everything that we need to do for what is required but how are we doing it or what are the conversations around some of those Equity issues around how to have other

[01:38:00]
reins of instructional materials that are around the Multicultural issues so that's a little bit and Yolanda Monday this is a little bit of transition to the bills that we've been watching so it is in the budget and there is discussion about some of the backfield being below the line but the recurring to be in to the scg and so the conversation is that there would be a one-time lump of money to kind of back up what we've been missing as well as set a new base for recurring funds in conjunction with that we know how spill 45 was passed off the floor that was Cheryl Stapleton on instructional materials and I sent a little bit update on that last Friday so that bill was originally slated for the rocket docket last year because it and it was aimed at

[01:39:00]
releasing some of the restrictions around instructional materials to free up purchasing than the ways that you describe so that ped can continue to create adoption list and recommended list and have you know teachers come in in the summer and vet resources but that school districts and schools were no longer required to purchase 50% of their money from that list and so that was and there was a striking of private schools as a part of that instructional materials that I reported last Friday since the Moses court case in New Mexico last December just about a month ago complicated the conversation around House Bill 45 in terms of it being on the rocket dockets so there was an amendment it was moved on with an amendment that says so we if it keeps going we stand to have more freedom around purchasing an instructional materials the Amendments that was brought by representative Eli had two components one of them was to

[01:40:00]
for ped to certify that once every Public School child had a book for every class then disbursements could go to private schools and the second one was that would go to private schools that you know certified that they were not in violation of hate statutes and didn't discriminate enrollment against any of the criteria New Mexico state statute on on hate crimes so we'll see what happens with that when it rolls to the Senate OK Google and then instructional materials or will Community organizations and partners be able to make recommendations to that list so usually those and this is just speaking from my own experience but usually those processes help work in conjunction just that 50% of the money and current law has to be spent on

[01:41:00]
play Ed approved list and the other 15% could be spent on what local schools and school districts or classrooms decided was important to their curriculum so the PED process is PED bringing in teachers from all over the state to kind of that resources so usually they create a list of options and then school districts and schools can choose from that list Thanksgiving at home and doing the things they're doing however they do it you know whether they do it through adult money or

[01:42:00]
what do they do it whatever but they should be able to do it you know I can't I can't imagine that's not a cost savings to us to have these inmates actually get a diploma it's got to be a savings of money you know so they got to be able to do it they can't just put a blind cap on stuff and say good luck and good luck Alabama I'm sorry OK Google we made this chart and we have about 25% of them that we're tracking and this kind of priority list down below the two biggest areas to kind of watch in the next week or so our baby through

[01:43:00]
Senate Bill 1 and its companion will be hb5 or House Bill 5 we anticipate that to be introducing committee on Saturday House Bill 5 as Dr Escobedo said is published right now as the original sb1 without amendments we provided sb12 at our last update and after that there were three amendments added to that sby one in committee the mandatory on K5 plus programs was taken out so K5 plus schools by 2022 and that was stricken on the cap on Charter Schools was looking and under the Extended Learning where it had you know this is what a teacher contract looks like in an extended contract this is what it looks like in a K5 plus contract they tried to kind of differentiate the salary and then decided you know now we're creating 9 tiercel

[01:44:00]
second and third levels and and let districts decide what extra work and how that gets compensated so we expect House Bill 5 to have some amendments rolled out with it that will maybe vary from SB ones introduction Beyond those amendments we also there are four bills that were introduced that are not slated to be heard in committees yet around impacted so their house bill 325 and 326 and their companions are Senate Bill 172 and Senate Bill 170 so right now those are HBO 325 matches SB 17223 House Bill 326 matches Senate Bill 170 these are aimed at taking impact Aid

[01:45:00]
bunnies out of the school Equalization funding formula so that it flows directly without to the districts that are federal impacted districts and that that credit doesn't get taken out of their scg distributions and we are working with Miss Coleman and her Department to continue to look at how that those bills once they're introduced are going to impact APS so that we can offer that information to the sponsors is there anything on the list other than those and then of course the election law office is House Bill 407 Senate Bill House Bill 407 along with Senator Daniel Soto it is a 4707 page elections

[01:46:00]
are they are they fixing on that won the the bond tax issue I am going to turn this one over to me so that we can actually have one for example in November and still get it on the December tax rules Mr President members of the board the short answer is yes it's written into house bill 407 and as you know Linda Trujillo is a former board member and she's the sponsor in the house so she is monitoring that very closely and we are in direct communication

[01:47:00]
are you getting this okay it's just such a refreshing thing to have nice bills I mean it's not that there are things that we don't have to participate in and work on but it's really astounding to look and see that the tone is how do we support schools and it is a nice thing yes presidents for evaluations and Native American student needs assessment I think that maybe the use of teacher attendance for evaluations kind of said and optimistic tone that we're moving into an air of looking at legislation that's more about supporting them punishment so that's a nice tone that eliminate teacher attendance

[01:48:00]
on HP 77 I like that very carefully and I talked with Tammy just a little bit on that and that's the Restriction of administrative expenses I think that's a bad Bill and it isn't anything to do with the fact that we do we believe that we're doing way too much in the Administration has 2600 I believe is the category of Maintenance and operations were in trouble because we have no control over utilities and how much and so forth and these people got to realize that so that's a concern I have no concerns with Central Administration

[01:49:00]
but they should have just eliminated some of the other things in the law period we should not have anybody but police officers and security sros who have the right to have a weapons on campus people 18 and over or whatever or whatever that is sorry it's unlawful for you to have guns on our campus and that ought to be taken out of I told her she said well that's part of the law says no if you take those things out of there you know because we wanted to be very carefully controls and those people better be well trained in our people are for sure so they should have some real Christmas songs

[01:50:00]
play with concealed guns and I don't want anything else on the campus now you say how do we have enforce that well we can't really cuz if somebody has a concealed weapon we don't know it but I'll guarantee if something happens and they have it on there we at least have due process that we can actually say you know you don't have the right to have it on campus so and there are restrictions on guns other places you know where they cannot carry concealed weapons so it's not like you can't happen but I just think that if they're going to write anything on that bill then they ought to take it off of there so that's one of my comments on HB 15225

[01:51:00]
is there any made option to say both CYFD doesn't doesn't want to do that then we can negotiate that I don't understand you see the requirement or not you know there's no negotiation on this so you know and the problem is is that if we have somebody who who has a foster child and they live way away from the home school where they are and they want us to transporting an education of the student and and where it's best to have the student educated which is all part of the bill but you know a couple others can you tell me anything about the charter school

[01:52:00]
authorization moratorium the HB 434 that would prohibit chartering authorities to authorize any new charter schools from I think the beginning date is June 31st 2019 through January 1st 2022 any Elias or any state or early age it would be any school district or the public education commission 454 I didn't get a chance to look at that can you give me a quick summary about gifted education requirements this is adding a bunch of requirements to get to education and really trying to take a step towards putting it out of special

[01:53:00]
a little bit of an anomaly State and we do have quite a few of our gifted parents who are very active yes and I read the bill and understood about that much and said oh we need to watch out for this okay thank you very much that's what I have I appreciate it greatly comma

[01:54:00]
mission is relationship with CYFD and sorry I know that's those conversations are going on and I think that's really helpful and I think a lot of that bill is okay I just pointing out kind of the question about them because I know the transportation has come up and in our conversations

[01:55:00]
multiple in different places about funding capital for for the Chargers and we already have that requirement when we do Bond and tax levy so I'm concerned about exactly this overlap of what are they talking about in terms of the capital funding and setting up a separate fund for Capital use for for Charters and I don't know how that goes and it's kind of disorganized you know what I mean in other words I can't figure out exactly what's going to overlap what and and there's going to be you know redundant stuff that's going on here in terms of the funding of the capital you know we had 16 million dollars it was supposed to go to to Charters state and local and so I don't understand exactly

[01:56:00]
capacity or our ability to do that but but they've got to be careful with that because you know that it could be a redundant kind of funding thing and then it was disorganized and I mean it was here and someone was there and they did something at the end and you know period the amendments were I think a big part of that conversation we did work with District staff and some of the sponsors to give our input and I think that amendments in the bill will be posted in the next day or two then online I can send the link out to that so you can read it allows local school districts to have prioritization about who they found on you know

[01:57:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:58:00]
House Bill 129 the rural school districts president Piercy member Mueller Aragon I don't know if I can if I know for sure what the input of the rural school districts is on that particular bill I think the Clause that Dr Percy is mentioning that's in existing law that wasn't a part of the proposed new legislation was a intentionally When It Was Written in 1987 as a car out for Roxy programs or Hunter Safety Classes that may take place on campuses and I we spoke with the sponsor of the bill to to let her know that we also feel like that period so that it it couldn't be extrapolated at a school to say you know this 5th grade teacher who does lunch duty on our security team so then that entitles her to

[01:59:00]
play gotten so her intent and opening the legislation and she got an lexcs endorsement from it she reviewed her bill to them in November and December hearings and that was the only analysis so that the Clause that carve out for Roxy programs are hunter safety was not really something that she maybe he was aware of or realize was another loophole she could continue to to close so I don't think it got a lot of attention for the gun issue in terms of allowing students to have guns on campus so it was heard in judiciary this afternoon I'm not sure what happened to that so it was overboard law enforcement to get from where they are to a school so that's awesome school districts as well so I mean we just have to often

[02:00:00]
think about about them and these students that may have to have their weapons on campus the other thing is on the house bill 152 I haven't read it so my question is when they are deciding about keeping a child in the school that they were in before they become become a foster child so how is it decided what's best for the foster child rather than what's best for the foster parent not withstanding Transportation Etc on Spotify period

[02:01:00]
order for a foster care student to stay in their school of origin you have to have a whole meeting to be able to do that to determine the in the best interest of the student if it's in their interest or the parents interest if it's in the best interest of the student to stay in the school even though the Foster can't live in a different part of town then they have to stay there and ask us far more strict than our current New Mexico law so this one is is really just tightening up and line nothing with USA anything else on that they can't they can't actually go to a different school if that's the best interest of the student yes so that's a negotiation the determination period

[02:02:00]
2007 I believe the school of origin is always been part of that but welfare agencies Across the Nation have ignored it and so it was tightened up in the every student succeed to ensure School stability for students and so the school of origin is defined in there it's defined as part of mckinney-vento homeless act and it's the same definition and at all possibilities it isn't too weird to try to keep a child in the school of origin if it's in the best interest of the student not the best interest of the adults around the child and that's been an ongoing discussion if I might say battle discussed

[02:03:00]
when they put a child into a foster home and so we still have foster parents being told in New Mexico that if you take this child we will move their school and they cannot do that they legally cannot do that and so we are now in a lot of discussions with CYFD House Bill 152 has started a lot of discussions it may not be turned into a memorial so that we can have even deeper discussions about how we move forward but the best interest of termination process is defined and it has to happen and it's about the best interest of the child and we're not going to keep a kid in school of origin if they're coming from Gallup but we also buy Federal Credit

[02:04:00]
and so there's a lot of educational issues around that and so that bill was really to try to align what's not currently in State Statute to the federal requirements in both fostering connections and the every student succeeds act thank you hey Google

[02:05:00]
police officer a retired police officer somebody who's actually trained to how to do this and not have to wait for 30 minutes or an hour or whatever the time frame is to get those people there so that's something we have tried not successfully but I think again that's something to be considered at least give the opportunity for districts that want to do that to actually set their own Police Department

[02:06:00]
thank you very much for being here is always for her support and her updates and if Tony Watkins is still with us I'd love to get a copy of the Southern Poverty Law Center addressing hate protocol again so if he still with us he can email it to me as well and

[02:07:00]
from the open group a few of us we were able to go see the documentary the children we lose which was incredibly powerful so if you have an opportunity to watch that documentary it was it was it really takes your breath away it was incredibly powerful so thank you for all the work that open does and and Karen with open as well again thank you for all the folks who are here this evening and for your comments and thank you for all the work that doctor doll and Dr Escobedo did on our legislative update thank you hey Google and a lot of perseverance too to be pairs

[02:08:00]
child welfare situations where we have children that are really vulnerable so I really appreciate the commitment that they made to to make sure that the you know those children were safe and that they got directed to to the right kind of services and supports I think you know in terms of the comments really around where APS is and how we can be better at a dialogue and and really having a conversation and not just presentations so that we can start that process is Mr Watkins was saying that the real process of healing is like how do we sit in a circle how do we really talk about the pieces I had the pleasure and the honor of being able to be of the participating anti-racism training when I was with the with an organization and it you know it was it wasn't pretty it was hard it was difficult

[02:09:00]
but it was definitely something that has stuck with me for a long time it's difficult because I think a lot of our institutions and our way are Protocols are processes are are sometimes just what they are you know we as stated in public comment were Bound by the open meetings act and needing to put these pieces in play and that doesn't really fit really well culturally with some of the things that we have to do but I don't know what I don't I don't know what the resolution is yet I want to I want to figure that part out so that we can be better at it so that it doesn't feel like it's this Push Pull or that we're not listening or that we're being offensive or that were being treated and the conversations are having because it's really I know it's not how I feel so it's very difficult I too would like to see protocol you know what was actually implemented

[02:10:00]
then where we're going with that I think it's one step there's like many steps we need to take I want to also acknowledge the superintendent readies presentation around the safety and assembly having been part of adolescent health and public health I know that safe team assemblies are are the best practice and it's definitely a way to get to that first step also that's necessary for putting young people in a place that's a safe way to also have difficult conversations we have to be able to allow them that opportunity to do it but we also need to put some structure around it making sure that you know that that they are safe and that there is a conversation that is LED and it's guided in a way that's going to lead to something that's productive and something that's not destructive so I think that's a good step as well

[02:11:00]
I appreciate hearing about that so on to some good stuff too the job fair was definitely a highlight of my Saturday that was awesome to go to and see 600 + students and their families participate in a job fair that was hosted by the city I thought it was incredible to see the students from some of the high schools that I know are coming from Albuquerque they were ready we had students that actually got interviews on the spot and we're filling out their applications and so it's just those small steps and those pieces that I loved seeing the convention center a bus because there was also another event for some young people so there was families just kind of all over the convention center on Saturday which was a great reminder of just you know what a city needs to do so that we can pull together and really put things together and

[02:12:00]
understand that it's families and children that were serving and so I saw that partnership on that day and I was really it was really excited and I was somebody inspired by the fact that our city was putting something together like that that could be so well attended and that we opened up that Convention Center for Families that were participating whether it was in the dance competition or it was in the job fair so that was good and then finally I just want to say you know 83,000 students 14,000 staff members that's a really daunting task for us and there are many views there's opinions ideas thoughts processes and everyone has a part the difficulty is making sure that everyone feels involved and although we didn't win the election I am also encouraged I'm not I'm a person who

[02:13:00]
part of Public Service my entire career 40 plus years and I've never been part of an agency that ever has been fully funded whether it was child welfare mental health public health education none of them have ever been fully funded and what I do know is that in those areas that I've always worked there's always been crisis there's always been challenged but what always makes it nice or what is always made it possible to work in those places because the people like the 14000 staff members that we have here with APS or the 83,000 students that come to our schools and those parents that believe in us we somehow rise above those challenges and those those crisis that's before us and we're going to rise above it we're going to have to I don't think we have a choice so I'm going to remain hopeful I'm not

[02:14:00]
I'm not upset I'm not going to point fingers I'm not going to be mad like that but what I do want to remind everyone is that it's not just the 83,000 students and the 14,000 staff members here too because it's part of Workforce Solutions I also know that it's going to be a little bit of a crisis for us around unemployment because we are definitely going to see a cut in contracts that are going to happen to some of our contractors and our subcontractors and as the agency that oversees the unemployment side of that and the public works out of it when that gets cut going to be seeing it in unemployment wages and unemployment taxes so I just want to put that all in perspective because I'm reminded about what that means that we're all part of this together and those contractors and those employees are Tradesmen are all of our folks that

[02:15:00]
are you working out there that depended on us for that we're now on hold for them and we're also on hold for those families so thank you thank you thank you I'm going to go to the phone candy do you have some comments to make yes I'm here thank you yes thank you for your report the superintendent radio one of the things that I wanted us to stop

[02:16:00]
truly something thank you thank you I will be there shortly I want to dress a little bit of what was said during the Forum I believe Mr Watkins has has the point here and I know that is a Community member being a part of United States people together for just making that one change it makes a difference to have everybody looking at each other not everybody's back but actually in a circle it creates healing also having people introduced

[02:17:00]
it doesn't take much to do that and then handing the microphone to those who want to speak around the circle even if you're not quite prepared I think it works really well and I think this is one chance that we may want to make and make sure that the next space that we have this community Forum that it's big enough so that we can do that and that's one recommendation and I I truly take that to heart cuz I seen it work and so thank you for that suggestion as to what is as well and I I had an opportunity to attend the ribbon cutting for just really a lot of fun high school this is the principal the teachers and you can truly see that it is amazing work Billy

[02:18:00]
I really enjoyed that and the other thing I wanted to say about the mill Levy bond election you know I you know I'm glad to see that our community is very involved in that we had 29 percent of the voters rise above it and move forward one step at a time and I'm looking forward to seeing how we can do this and I know that we can I know that we can and I think we need to have we need to do it so that we can come up with a plan and I know one of the plants and it should be a priority it's a safety of our schools

[02:19:00]
the safety of our students or teachers in our community and so I'm looking for a plan that we can work through in in addressing This concerns and the other thing I wanted to say Megan you rock thank you Candy I'm sorry cancel meeting and

[02:20:00]
when we talked about how how do we create schools where we have real and honest conversation how do we bring in the community how do we create the kinds of environment that we need to I think that the community school councils are real examples of how hard it is to develop that but how we can go about doing that very intentionally and so I think I think there are things that we have in place that we can keep building on and working on the other thing when I was at Hawthorne and I I guess I'm going to sort of

[02:21:00]
and regardless of where projects were we have all always work together to make sure that those projects went through that the growth on the west side was addressed and at Hawthorne this morning I look and see 8 portal that are probably 50 years old themselves in a building that's around 70 years old and you look at that environment and you cannot tell me that the message that we give children in schools like Whittier where Brown water is coming out of the water fountain and Hawthorne in the same situation with crumbling ceilings you cannot tell me that we can look at those children in the eye and tell them that we value them as much as any other child in the district now we have saying this is we did not do the job that

[02:22:00]
should have done to get the information about this bond issue out there because Albuquerque Community has a history of supporting schools and I think that was one of the things that that we sort of took for granted thinking that that was going to come through and carry the bond and I think we underestimated the amount of distance the amount of the places that we needed to be to get the word out of the first time this year

[02:23:00]
you know it's what teachers do it's what school districts do it's what Educators do we step up and make sure that we keep paying as far away from schools and from children as we possibly can but we're stretched about as far as we can be stretched and this year finally we start looking at an operational budget from Santa Fe that can start putting back in place the counselors that we need the social workers that we need the support personnel and the kinds of salary increases that are staff Desserts when roof start crumbling we're going to have to start making some hard decisions about

[02:24:00]
the pain is going to be real and once again the school district will step up and do everything it can to patch it together and make it work because that's what Educators do but we faced accusations of dishonesty of lack of transparency we heard that over and over again and we have a job to overcome that I think that simply saying it's on our website isn't enough but the fact is that plan was based on need and I walk around Hawthorne and I walk around and see the amount of need and we don't have an answer for it right now and so we just need the community to understand

[02:25:00]
and that we will do everything we can to work but we're not doing right by our students and we had a plan that we need to figure out how to explain how to verify how to be as open because we have absolutely nothing to fear it has been done objectively in based on need and we have a job to do and I want to thank the Carpenters and aft for the work that they did around this and it wasn't for self-serving needs it's because it's what our community needs and it's anything that we have always as a district said we don't fight over another we look at me

[02:26:00]
try to move forward in the best interests of our community and that's what it's about thank you very much period first of all I wanted to let us all know that Franklin charcoal is really an amazing and amazing person and I think APS should really use his expertise as other states and other countries other countries do and Tony I agree with you we need to listen more and dialogue a lot more than what we do but most importantly right now I want to thank everyone who cast their vote and the aps box collection thank you for being informed and knowing that an election was being held thank you for exercising your right to vote when so many people did not matter and the more voters that we do hear from the better because then we know more what people are thinking and more with the

[02:27:00]
hearing from 30% is always better than hearing from 3% getting more people to vote is always a good thing for our state as many of our County clerks and Secretary of States have said and believe I am sure you've heard that many people are calling our voters misinformed uninformed lacking in knowledge or Awareness on educated on the ballot questions anyone who said this is by definition calling you ignorant I beg to differ I don't believe that to be true as you went out to exercise a right we as Americans have and that is not ignorant punitive comments calling voters misinformed is disrespectful and has no place in this building on this board the voters have spoken and I apply them for being for children for expecting better accountability for wanting better management and administration for wanting better for APS students as we all do for prioritizing students over unions prior

[02:28:00]
prioritizing students over the board for prioritizing students over the superintendent for prioritizing our students over the educational profiteers many in the community were called uninformed because they said that this was a 19 percent increase in overall property taxes and they were called for a better word Liars to set everyone straight and to be transparent I am not a star mathematician but I can add subtract multiply divide and do fractions and percentages so to calculate a percentage increase you take the 10:45 that we are currently paying which would have gone to 12.45% increase so 12.45 - 10.45 equals 2 / 10.45 equals 0.1

[02:29:00]
913875598 * 100 equals 19.14% if my math is wrong you can correct me but I know I was taught very well at Sacred Heart Catholic Church Catholic school so I say kudos to all of you who said it would be an overall 19% increase good for you you were paying attention in math class the community also said that if the mailbox passed they acknowledged it was going to be under 5% increase in personal property taxes and we allow for 3% increase reassessment of our properties so in time we know that it's going to be more than that as we all who owned property see our property taxes go up but no one said anything about them being misinformed about this increase their math so we can't have it both ways simple math catches work for one but not for the other

[02:30:00]
taxpayers all of you out there and all of you listening generously fund our district to support our students and our schools but we did have a big ask and I wonder why we weren't in touch with reality and the struggles of those living on a fixed income those living on a disability check those young people trying to buy their first homes those seniors living on Social Security that have nowhere to go and want to stay in their own home those tenants who can't afford an increase in rent those small businesses whose profit margins are already so slim to be so presumptuous to believe that 12 to 15 dollars more a month is it difficult for those who struggle from paycheck to paycheck displays of ignorance and lack of understanding and how people out there struggle when 60% of our residents rent property don't own it imagine the effect on this group of people we replace

[02:31:00]
turn on our residents When government is reaching into someone's pockets they first have to have to ask if they want you in their pockets and yesterday the people said no the second question had this past would be from the someone who's Pockets you are in they would be in our right to ask government to be accountable for the money the money that they work for what I saw yesterday is voters protecting their money the money they work hard for protecting their parents and grandparents living on Social Security protecting their daughter buying her first home protecting their brother who lives on a disability check protecting their tenants from rent increase their customers from an increase in the price of goods and services so no I am not surprised as I had my finger on the pulse of the community and saw the writing on the wall when the city pulled out of holding the election alongside

[02:32:00]
why did they do that one of the hundreds of people who made their well-known said they didn't want their taxes to go up that they were tired the GRT having just gone up last year County taxes have gone up two of the last three years Santa Fe talking about an increase in income tax gasoline tax vehicle excise tax they spoke loud and clear that Albuquerque ends have grown weary and tired of ever-increasing taxes and no increase in opportunities as stated by the New Mexico business Coalition voter said that they do not have an appetite for increased taxes government can so often be so confident that taxpayers will continue to allow them to write checks on the backs of hard-working New Mexico's on the backs of property owners and renters yesterday they said no more we cannot ignore the fact that New Mexico is still a poor state

[02:33:00]
perhaps our residents have no more to give perhaps they want us to live within our budget perhaps they want us to right size our district to the current enrollment Trend which is in a downward spiral I want to know is sure all the parents all the concerned citizens and mostly students that we have resources and that everything is going to be okay there are grants we can apply for there's anything else is still going to get their share of property taxes and will continue to receive the share of property tax collections as we move forward property tax distribution to APS are not going away APS has the resources to do what's right by their students their buildings how we can save 30% on buildings by doing away with a little bit and Davis we can save another 1% we can sell off property that is too small to build

[02:34:00]
or buildings that are at minimum capacity we can stop adding square footage when our enrollment continues to decline thank you taxpayers for financing as well despite the demagoguery you often hear from the profiteers by those who choose to use children for their own ends the election seems to be a repudiation of what the community sees APS to be the talk in the community was 30% of our students don't graduate have you talked to those 30% lately 70% of your students aren't reading at grade level 80% aren't able to perform math grade level they said we need to do better by and for our children this isn't okay and no one would say those numbers are okay I don't and I don't believe any of us here on the board do you APS they said are failing our children of color and why they think it's because we

[02:35:00]
you should not be reform-minded that we choose not to think forward that we refuse to replicate great programs and Great Schools we refuse to do an audit of programs that may not work anymore we refuse to have an inspector General off APS grounds we refused to tell our own success stories because we might offend an a school can offend an F school we refuse to truly Embrace Choice a real civil rights issue talk about limiting choice for our children many said are children of color that they consider racism is a homegrown New Mexico Hispanic woman I find this despicable choice in what schools your children attend allows parents without the financial means to send their children to a private or secular school at least they have a chance at a good Charter and shame on us for not closing those Charters that are not

[02:36:00]
swing right by our children or for that matter any school that's not doing its best for our kids we are here for all of those children to do what's right by them by our future I once asked a few years ago if anyone who works for APS would raise your hand if they were willing to put their job on the line if things weren't going substantially better and not one person raise their hands I am assuming again no one would raise their hand again but then I wonder who would risk a quarter of a Million Dollar Plus job I asked you or any of the 100,000 plus employees who are here or our bond Council who wrote the questions that seem to have not had everything in it that they needed to have like was said at an economic Forum meeting just because something is legal and statutory doesn't mean it's the right thing or ethical thing to do

[02:37:00]
I will be putting my position as one of seven who serves the employer of superintendent reading on the line in 9 months so I will raise my hands and take responsibility for what happened yesterday and yes I will continue to put my job my position on the line I don't know who else will thank you but I just got an email that had eight points against the election and all of them are wrong all of them are missing for him all of them makes statements that

[02:38:00]
do you have in fact said many times that that's not the case and so some people are misinformed it doesn't mean that all of them are but some are you can turn the speaker up so the point being is that we do appreciate the fact that they're more voters that's important to do and I'm a little surprised that we only have 30% volume

[02:39:00]
what it is we need to do better and most certainly statements on the ballot need to be better we need to understand that people need to be able to read the ballot and and understand that but there are a lot of people who are supporting us and appreciate the unions I'm sorry but we don't need to bad Matthews because they have to support us and we need don't need to complain about our kids who go out and campaign for us because in fact that's something they want to do it's their schools they have the right to do that just like anybody else right just like anybody else and if parents want to take him out and wanted to show them some of the Civic ideas

[02:40:00]
there are some nice things that went on and I tended the Convoy of hope I think that's a very interesting collaboration of faith-based churches as well as businesses as well as Community people in terms of providing goods and services and mental health capabilities and that too to all of our all of our community people and went to the Hispanic around table that was very interesting listen to Howie's talk a little bit about the education aspects of encouraged by the fact that we're going to address some of these education issues that we have and they'll see celebrities in our schools and I'm and I think our

[02:41:00]
approach the trying to look at the master plan on that and to involve more of the community members like our you know carpenters and and other folks is is very encouraging They are tearing apart engines there and I guarantee you the kids are learning a lot they had a woodworking shop where they had all the lot of them more modern equipment there period

[02:42:00]
that didn't help a lot in terms of trying to clarify those terms in the kind of things that you're asking I think those are important things great you like to K&W partnership but we've been asking for that for a long time and I think again if we can can expand that a little bit maybe we'll get a forum where we can actually have not not quite a dialogue there but real specific topics that we can have a real deep discussion in that in that podcast about so that we can actually understand a little bit about from experts and things like that about what's going on and how we're trying to address those issues I appreciate and we need to explain to the community and we need to make sure that that

[02:43:00]
is clearly understood because clearly people did not understand all the things and just my latest email told me exactly that so independent of how much we try to say that we have it there and we have it on the website and we told them this information if we have people that don't get that somehow the question is will then how do we get that information correctly to those people and so that's what we need to make sure we do and I know we'll be working with our partners on that will be working with our staff on that and trying to understand I'm going to go to the announcement of the upcoming board meeting the next board meeting will be held Wednesday February 20th 5:00 meeting will be held Monday February 25th at 7:30
