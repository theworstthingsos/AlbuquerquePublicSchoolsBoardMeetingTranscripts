[00:02:00]
adoption of the January 15th 2025 Board of Education meeting agenda may I have a motion please I move to adopt the January 15th 2025 yes Jackson yes

[00:03:00]
next on our agenda is minutes approval our next item is to consider approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on December 18th 2024 and the special Board of Education workshop on aligning resources and governance manual on December 20th 2024 may I have a motion please this is board member Dominguez I moved to approve the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on December 18th 2024 and the special Board of Education workshop on aligning resources and governance manual on December 20th 2024 with amendments please those who would be minutes should reflect all comments related to the vote on item 6.2 on page 11 and I'm happy to submit the language for that and it also needs to

[00:04:00]
reflect the language around dual language students at Alvarado not just the students in the Taft boundary area and I'll provide that language for you as well do we have a second any discussion on that motion

[00:05:00]
yes thank you I would just like to see what we're actually approving before I would vote on it so without having the actual language I don't feel comfortable saying yes with the Amendments know I'm board member Dominguez do you have the language Let Me Find The Well to address the first request it would simply be the language that the statement that we both Heather been a board member Benavides and I the statements we made along with our no vote I don't remember don't worry too period

[00:06:00]
additional comment is recorded and so in the name of equal representation I would ask that the minutes reflect comments associated with all votes that's easy to capture that's recorded regarding let's see I don't know if the parent who submitted the language sent it to I can't pull it up on on let's let's talk but it would reflect what was said in in public forum so I am sure Dr Albright will correct me if I am in on this but typically during public forum

[00:07:00]
what does specific language is not reflected in the minutes I'm looking at the public Forum Topix included right now and it's just the topics and not the specific language because that is a recorded message and so anybody who wanted to see the specifics would be able to go back onto the YouTube to see that what exactly was said but I can see that the general topics has been included so that's really the general topic would be that to clarify the language that all dual language students at over not just at Taft boundary were addressed not just the students in the boundary were discussed okay so again just trying to capture what you're trying to

[00:08:00]
so if I'm looking at the 2024 the 1218 2024 Board of Education draft minutes in public forum number for I see topics included is request to table or vote no on the right sizing plans for Taft and Coronado are you requesting that that include Alvarado yes not in discussion under public forum because you were asking for a public forum sorry I ate it was so look forward because you're just requesting a public forum topic be included is that correct so under background I guess it's I'm sorry 6.3 under background the very last

[00:09:00]
bullet point as part of this transition School boundaries will be adjusted now that doesn't mention dual language you know what will drop that Amendment and we'll just go with the amendment to reflect all comments related to the vote in 6.6 point 6.223 is considered to approve to repurpose middle school as Coronado dual language 6.2 is 678.300 discussion

[00:10:00]
read it yes with the condition that efforts still be made for Community involvement 6.252 so it's on page 11 of the packet and different so the vote should reflect all board members comments associated with their vote so any further discussion now okay you popped off do you have any further discussion I don't but I guess for clarification I'm not going to vote in favor just because I want to make sure that those actually get recorded or we can view it in advance without having the exact verbiage I don't feel comfortable okay so the can you

[00:11:00]
a manager Amendment since you pulled one of the Amendments out and restate your your motion to approve the minutes with your specific Amendment so I'm asking for approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on December 18th 2024 and the special Board of Education workshop on aligning resources and governance manual on December 20th 2024 to include or to reflect all comments which were captured publicly related to the vote on item 6.2 we need to be careful not to privilege any one board members comments associated with the vote over others is there a second

[00:12:00]
okay I'm going to call the votes and may I have a roll call vote please Dr Albright yes ever been a Vida Dominguez yes no Brittany Jackson yes okay next up is public forum so our next item on the agenda is public forum remember Benavides will you please share the instructions for public forum it will thank you welcome to our public forum guests thank you for being here this evening when you signed up to speak you were asked to review rules and expectations which our presiding officer for remember Jackson will and force the New Mexico in advance the items that will be discussed in voted on during the meeting therefore public forum isn't a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed

[00:13:00]
will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called online guests will stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers you will each have two minutes to speak otherwise you will have one minute tonight we have blank speakers I am unsure of the number would anybody like to provide that remember it's 12 we have 12 speakers tonight we have received many emails already in addition for those of you here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you thank you thank you so much all right our first speaker is in the room Mr Danielle to have two minutes once you begin

[00:14:00]
open Home Mr Bill on the bike wasn't on we make sure they turn it on okay it's on now sir good evening my name is Daniel I want to talk about retaliation towards mandated reporters of child abuse I have seen several child abuse cases go uninvestigated and the reporters being retaliated against by APS staff members principals HR risk management and APS police a couple APS police officers have an improper police report and when asked to fix them they are very rude and do not want to do it they retaliated against myself and other employees is getting out of hand that students are being abused by staff members at elementary schools and that is being swept under the rug and no one cares APS staff members emails back

[00:15:00]
inappropriate for them to get involved which I find it not I think APS staff members anything reported to any of them should be turned over to anyone who could do a proper investigation of any child abuse or any incident happening on school campus that means with parents assaulting teachers teachers assaulting ease or other staff members anything reported to APS of a crime should be investigated properly and not swept under the rug and if it is not done a proper investigation and it is reported then someone needs to step up and make sure in a proper investigation is done set a swept under the red light several cases have been which I got tons of emails and reports showing that thank you guys thank you sir our next speaker is in the room Miss Janet Sayers that doesn't seem to be joining so

[00:16:00]
you got bumped up you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking ma'am yes good evening Madam vice president I think and Acting Superintendent and Blakey I'm Janet Sayers I am in board member Dominguez district and tonight I just want to point out two things first I'm glad to be here with fellow APS graduates Treasure Island and former County clerks over from Highland but still Del Norte number 7 is the best high school acknowledged even though the the federal holiday is Monday today is actually Martin Luther King's birthday on January 15th and since he

[00:17:00]
been 96 and Linda Stover's mom just turned 97 she can identify with how would our lives have been different if he could have lived you know the last 50 plus years so my comment tonight again is about the recreation areas and play fields on a PS grounds that are totally completely separated from the school buildings you know all these multiple fences to protect the buildings from vandals but also use that should not happen but it just seems a shame that there are dozens of wonderful grass fields wonderful play equipment areas that they're nowhere near the building and in fact they're buffered from many of the buildings by a significant

[00:18:00]
space that includes a haze Middle School at Inez at Sombra Del Monte Mitchell Elementary and it just seems like there ought to be a way that APS could figure out how to how to let those be used especially during the summer and on weekends so that and I will prepare a written statement about that but thank you so much thank you and speaker is going to be on Zoom Mr Dell or are you there I am you'll have two minutes good evening Google first of all I want to thank all of you for your dedicated service to our community and most especially to our children and grandchildren we applied your consideration to require a course in financial literacy this is a necessary life skill for

[00:19:00]
students whether they are on a college track or learning a trade are states ranking show how debt can stifle a Young Person's dream almost half of New Mexicans are on Medicaid one out of four of our residents rely on food stamps to break the cycle of poverty in our beloved State we need to set our young people up for financial Independence and APS is on point in asserting that this starts with education in all areas including financial literacy are students need to graduate knowing how to create a budget understanding interest rates and late fees and how to invest wisely study suggests financial literacy can enhance students overall decision-making skills critical thinking and goal setting abilities having our students graduate with this knowledge will not only help keep them from digging a hole of debt it will give them the tools they need to get jobs they

[00:20:00]
start businesses they dream of and Bill financially financially independent lives requiring a financial literacy course for graduation is a concrete step in setting our students up for Success the greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce respectfully encourages you to support this critically important measure thank you thank you sir our next speaker is in the room Renee Pacheco you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening and public schools so this family has sent their kid to kindergarten through fourth grade to a public school he went through kindergarten half of kindergarten and first during covid he struggled with Reading Writing

[00:21:00]
and spelling teachers ignore that he was behind blaming it on online learning but not solving or working on improvements for him he still was behind in third and fourth he was failing all the subjects he was depressed he had low self-esteem he hated school and he hated himself and felt that he was stupid the only response from the teachers was don't worry he'll catch up and they were denied services for their son because he did not qualify for special ed although he clearly identified as having dyslexia he was going to be a Child Left Behind so she pulled him out of APs into a private school who was willing to help him these are the words to have these are her words I have chosen to share my story with the board not to attempt to speak poorly of APs

[00:22:00]
but to allow the board members to see what we have experience at the hands of APs I know I am not I am not alone in my experience with APS and I truly hope that the board can step up and improve APS for the students whose parents do not have the means to afford private schools thank you very much for next speaker is Dr Selena you have two minutes once you begin speaking school board members and superintendent a happy healthy New Year to you and your family

[00:23:00]
I am outraged by the recent both of New Mexico Democratic Representatives who chose to abandon the rights and protections of women and girls by voting against the HR 28 protection of women and girls in sports Act of 2025 recently Congress passed a critical legislation which amounts in 1972 education amendments to reinforce the Title Nine in sports recognizes a person sex based only on their biology and genetics all are three New Mexico Democratic Representatives turned her back on our state female athletes and their safety Ashford Washington for the Republican party in New Mexico state of Tennessee opportunities for women and girls in education and Athletics by voting against this essential protection act New Mexico Congressional Delegation has

[00:24:00]
jeopardize this opportunities to devoted to continue training and diminishing college scholarships for female athletes and compromising their privacy and safety in competitive sports today the female athletes of New Mexico have been let down by the Democratic officials who chose to prioritize radical Genesis over the well-being and rights of the women and girls they are supposed to represent RPM stands for only against this attempted the issue of women and will continue to fight for their right to feel safe and secure in their species and in sports in court and that said would you also please not allowed to pornographic materials in libraries thank you may God have mercy on us and APS thank you sir our next speaker is in person Mary Walker you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:25:00]
good evening Madam president and school board members and APS superintendent I'm an EA and special education in the severe needs classroom in an APS Elementary School and my name is Mary Walker Herrera the suicide risk and transgender people is higher than in the general population and seems to occur during every stage of transitioning it is important to have specific attention for suicide risk in the counseling of this population and in providing Suicide Prevention programs it is important that mental and health practitioners pay attention to this risk and create a safe environment in which these feelings can be discussed at all stages of treatment and counseling this came from the Amsterdam cohort of 1972 to 2017 in her books several detransitioners are interviewed and many of them had a history of mental health issues as a child one in particular had issues which included anxiety

[00:26:00]
depression gender dysphoria appetite changes trouble with bullying anger confusion with puberty cutting nausea irritability mood swings and suicidal ideation she came out as transgender at 11 years old and expressed the desire to transition to the opposite sex even though at least one of her initial providers said that she couldn't start hormones until age 16 or undergo surgery until age 18 to 13 according to the legal complaint this was done without adequate psychological evaluation on quote for lawyers alleged given the hate and push back that detransitioners receive it should surprise no one that there are not that many detransitioners out there yet and like so many others this young girl's parents were also presented with

[00:27:00]
the infamous false dilemma it is better to have a live son than a dead daughter thank you for listening and letting me share thank you our next speaker is in the room Bushra how far is it you have 2 minutes won't you be in speaking now good evening to vote in favor of personal financial literacy education requirements thank you for bringing the subject to focus the office and I have traveled across the state to advocate for financial literacy and every school district it's an order to work alongside treasure on Toya to support Financial education for every child as a young person I can tell you first hand how crucial it is to be equipped with financial knowledge right out of high school seeing as we are in expanding digital age a growing number of Genesee like me turn to the internet for financial advice

[00:28:00]
is there a report shows that nearly 80% of Millennials and gen Z rely on social media and influencers financial influencers for guidance on managing money while the internet provides an abundance of information it also exposes young people to a lot of misinformation Financial advice from unqualified sources can lead to poor decisions often leaving Young People financially vulnerable and in Dire Straits that's why it's more important than ever to ensure that students have access to Accurate reliable and comprehensive Financial education in high school while they Gain real work experience and before they enter the real world as adults by integrating financial literacy requirements and to our curriculum we can ensure that every student graduate is not just with academic knowledge but with the pragmatic and accurate skills needed to make informed by financial decisions this isn't just about helping individuals students it's also about investing in the future of New Mexico's economy educated consumers and smart financial decision makers Drive the economic growth of our state I urge you to prioritize this issue every

[00:29:00]
student deserves a financial knowledge and preparation to thrive and by adopting this requirement we can make that a reality thank you for your time and consideration thank you ma'am our next speaker is Mr Frank Baca sure you have two minutes called elected County Commissioner for district 2 and I want to thank you for your service here I think you have the most difficult job there is in as elected official in government without a salary without a full-time staff member and so many constituencies so I was just saying that I commend you for your passion and your commitment to improving the lives of the youth in our community and provide opportunities for them to reach their full potential I believe we say share the same related goal which is simply making

[00:30:00]
First Community healthy healthy and vibrant and that is why I'm here asking you to support financial literacy to be the one have credit as a graduation requirement as you know financial literacy is more than balancing the checkbook is maximizing your earnings it is learning about savings and learning about investing money borrowing money is a utilization of experts including financial advisors accountants bankers lawyers is an introduction to such esoteric terms at least that were to many of us as hard money lenders he like triple net leases and I guess I have been asked as well they really remember all that of course not and no more than they will remember everything that they're in the US history that is this exposure to these topics that is important and this is Will expose all of our students to this important topic and not just a few that get that

[00:31:00]
I was at home and they will learn enough when in that situation to Simply think and remember what did Mr so so tell us about this topic and I'll probably ask questions and learn be able to as somebody said earlier not just survive but to thrive in life thank you so much appreciate your consideration thank you sir our next speaker is Mr Tim I can work sure you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you my name is here as well to speak on financial literacy on item number 6.1 I think Mister Baca and Mr Archuleta will have said everything I wanted to say and they certainly said it better than I so I would like to introduce Linda Stover Linda's a deputy County Treasurer and she is very interested in financial literacy and happy to volunteer any service that you need from her or me

[00:32:00]
as the County Treasurer that we can do for you for financial literacy is it important issue as Mr Baca and Mr Gillette pointed out it's more than balancing the checkbook and it starts really earlier than high school but we appreciate you bringing it to the high school students now and I will say that Mr Baca hit it right on the line I never want your job so thank all of you for what you do Madam chair and members of the board thank you sir for next speaker is Amanda Reyes when you have two minutes and community members in the meeting my name is Amanda Reyes and I have been an educator and parent in EPS for combined

[00:33:00]
of over 20 years I'm speaking today also in support of the financial literacy graduation have credit for personal financial literacy and I'm speaking on behalf of nusenda credit union and the jumpstart Coalition for financial literacy I Echo the concerns and opportunities of the speakers from the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce state treasurer's office Mr Baca the County Treasurer and and all those who are supporting financial literacy our students in school Community reflects significant diversity including linguistic ethnic economic and experiential the school board has the opportunity to support academic career and Community Success Through a standalone personal financial literacy course I encourage the school board to make a decision that best supports the future growth of our students and our community by giving them access to those critical topics such as budgeting saving and understanding

[00:34:00]
the basics of financial institutions new center is deeply committed to continuing the collaboration and curriculum support for personal financial literacy and well-being we know our students leave the future of our communities thank you for your time and service to the community thank you and next speaker is and Travis sicker Travis you have two minutes OK Google here in the audience and I feel like I am in such good company talking about financial literacy and also seeing people who have been here since I was a brand new teacher and I reached my 20th year in education I can't believe that but this is why financial literacy is so important to me so for me as a brand new teacher

[00:35:00]
I originally was paid for my first contract 30,000 a year which seem like a lot of money but when I started to spend it and also my take-home was 21,000 it was very very difficult and nobody was really there to guide me you know sometimes my administrators would help me my friends my friends had mixed advice it wasn't always great but I really struggled as a single mom and as an educator to to make my budget work and to have that Financial Security and now 20 years later I've learned some lessons and I'm really happy about that and part of How I Learned those lessons is I became a financial literacy teacher so I teach dual credit students across the state personal finance and my students report that they have learned so much and the skills that they have learned

[00:36:00]
they share with their families and they feel like their lives are going to change I met with a student who actually is a refugee student and when I explained compound interest she said miss this is really important and I said it absolutely is I've met the social studies standards there's too much to teach in a US history class in high school and also address this critical concept of financial literacy so I encourage you to relieve the burden of the Educators and offer it as a standalone class thank you thank you man and board members that completes public forum all right thank you all for attending public forum and now we're going to move on to our next item on the agenda which is student outcomes focused governance so our next

[00:37:00]
my name is to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring reports for goal for an interim goals for 0.1 and 4.2 skills habits and mindsets for Life success the facilitator for this will be myself and the presenters are doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent leadership and learning Dr Kenneth Salazar associate superintendent and Sherry Jett Chief academic officer so thank you for being here all right tonight we will be monitoring goal for and interim goals for 0.1 and 4.2 skills habits and mindsets for Life success before we begin we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I met with the administrative team last week and reviewed the monitoring report and I want to thank you so much for your time and doing that Dr Gonzalez

[00:38:00]
I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report has been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements this is a reminder the elements are is there a goal is there a data is there an interpretation of the data and then is there an Evidence and plan to support that data does anyone have evidence that would suggest otherwise we since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will now open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked the questions that are technical or technical in nature before tonight's meeting and if you are following Along on line the questions in answers are posted with the agenda material for everyone to see tonight each board member is

[00:39:00]
connected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails as a reminder those questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure Focus ask oriented results-driven and time bound and just a reminder we have a nice little cheat sheet on our diets to help us along with our question asking so I think we're going to go ahead and we're going to go ahead and get started and board member Dominguez do you have your first question I do I'm going to jump straight to 4.2 I found 4.1 made sense and and I appreciate it

[00:40:00]
the strategies and and the plan for 4 for interim goal 4.2 in the section evidence and planned actions on pages 6 and 7 also 43 of the agenda packet which of these strategies address those students who are not taking the Panorama survey and or who have a language from the report quote who have a less favorable demonstration of tested skills good evening

[00:41:00]
one of the things that we have looked at or 4.2 specifically is is the data-driven approaches of student comparisons within Panorama one of the things that we've seen is there are certain groups that do not perform favorably compared to their peers the plan with that is to meet with departments to develop a root cause analysis and strategies as to why we see why we believe that they are performing not performing favorably compared to their peers and develop some strategies towards that another thing that we're looking at is making sure that our schools reach a high response rate as you can see the data for response for high school was a little bit less than Middle School in elementary so we know who those kiddos are and we also are utilizing our current structures

[00:42:00]
identify and support those students whether it's through a counselors being able to identify students who do not have the skills habits and mindset survey data as well as Student Success systems that are high schools are currently have access and experience with by me good evening Mr Hawkins board members thank you for having us for this conversation this evening I think directly related to the students who perhaps don't participate and we know in 4.2 even though our data shows a pretty significant increase particularly in high school participation there are still voices that were not hearing and so I think in addition to doctor cells comments I might add that we leverage our Student Success systems in our high schools and so without getting too technical this is basically a system where we're able to flag students when they start to drop in their attendance

[00:43:00]
leave your course performance and now the skills habits and mindsets because we have that data however in the absence of that we still have those other three areas that help us identify so we know students who didn't participate in the survey and we also know those who may be slipping behind and exhibiting other risk factors and so the Student Success system isn't able to engage with the student check-in what's happening how can we support sometimes our community school coordinators a part of this process right so it's a really robust system to make sure that the students are not following through the cracks and because we have this additional factor I would say in that sort of index if we're seeing a kid doesn't have the survey results like we immediately or wondering why not so we're able to address that and I think as we move forward we'll be able to get even deeper into how we help student

[00:44:00]
participate in communicate their skills habits and mindsets I have a follow-up to your answer so what evidence do you have then that the strategies you just listed that address those students the most vulnerable what evidence is there that what you just listed the student support systems are impacting having an impact yes thank you for that I sitting here and I have this nice notebook but that would be one thing I don't have specifically in my notebook this evening is that exact date which I think we could definitely pull for you but I can speak that we know that our high schools in particular

[00:45:00]
that have established Student Success systems have seen fairly dramatic decreases and chronic absenteeism and on the flip side of that obviously kids in school more often which is really the first thing that we're striving for is to have the student with us so that we can begin to impact all of the things that we wish for our students and so board member Dominguez would be happy to maybe put together a graph of some high school in particular but I can also tell you where in the early stages of developing that for our middle schools as well remember Dominguez members of the board Mr Hawkins to spend a little bit of academic officers response I would share maybe a little bit of a qualitative response in regards to the evidence that we've seen so being a year and a half into this work well we can recognize is a year and a half ago there was not coming language to speak about skills habits in mindsets

[00:46:00]
characteristics necessary to facilitate a space where the student every student within the district is able to achieve in Reading in math in life skills what we've been able to witness over fast forward a year and a half is we now are able to see that we are able to offer professional development to principals with common language and people have a sense of what perseverance means self-efficacy what that means social awareness and so on so in turn this survey as begun to take momentum in terms of it's coming up again and again we're offering this in my classroom students are taking this survey so the broader organization if you will in terms of teachers counselors who have been trained for example our counselors being trained in this platform now also have that expanded common

[00:47:00]
which to be able to set the conditions for us to Foster an environment where students are able to thrive and engage in the content and the curriculum the educational experience that we have for them at every grade loan and congratulations on a fantastic response rate it's amazing to see so many students engaged in this survey and asking these questions which I think are tough for comprehension and then just answer them honestly is very tough it's tough for me to do so that's fantastic and I'm also happy that the question I'm going to ask is based on the fact that both groups got gains one was less than the other but that's fantastic as well so I just wanted to acknowledge that that's really good news but

[00:48:00]
the results for grades 3 to 5 and I'm just going to reference my question your answer and then my question to follow up to that so I'm going straight to 5 reported significant increases in self-regulation and social awareness and on conversely what accounts for the smaller increases observed and self-efficacy and perseverance within the same age group and so your response I'll just be brief we did not see as great of Gaines in South Africa surveillance development at least students in grades three to five are still building their their belief in their abilities to succeed self-efficacy and persistence and overcoming challenges for severe in the answer you did reference that you all are in the process of conducting focus group interviews with the elementary schools that showed increases and self-regulation awareness efficacy and perseverance together for their insights but I was wondering what additional strategies can be implemented to better support the development of self

[00:49:00]
who did not answer in the affirmative in those areas sorry that was very long thank you thank you this what we've seen in in elementary school is a really big focus on explicit instruction in SEL and also routines which really focus on social awareness and also self-regulation what we want to look at is how do we embed goal setting as far as perseverance one of the things that we are working with as far as looking at the standards baseball card and how do we involve that kind of goal setting within the elementary school conversation with their families so that's an example of how we can embed more of the perseverance in self-efficacy into our elementary

[00:50:00]
cool area we are we are really looking at reimagining the daily learning experience of every single student and getting them ready for future success how we do that is we have to be impactful and it has to be consistent and so I think that's where we're looking at is how do we when we do these focus groups with principles what is the consistent best practice that we're hearing across the district that we can leverage and build upon as a district thank you specifically under the secondary school Success focus group study based on Fallout 2024 survey results of the plan is to conduct focus group studies with those the schools that show high

[00:51:00]
Precision skill habits and mindsets together insights on affected practices and cultural factors because this is high school I would like to know what are we doing for the counter group you know the ones who are not don't have the high increases in these skills and and habits and mindsets especially if we're looking at the Martinez in groups so if you could just give me some insight on that plan thank you I would like to answer this in two ways I think the first one would be the focus groups is really looking at high leverage best practices that we see in the schools that have 100% growth in all aspects of skills habits and mindsets and and really identify those backs best practices one of the

[00:52:00]
things that we're looking at is how do we look at building a culture of safety belonging and Care looking at how schools developed a sense of belonging to build upon the skills habits of mindsets but also look at how we can be deliberate in that approach one of the other things that you spoke of is the Yazi Martinez groups we also have the ability within panoramas to compare the population of student groups so for example special education were able to identify and work with those departments to identify the root cause of those and so those are kinds of those those are basically those two initiatives are data-driven approaches based on the fall October 24th service so we really want to get get deep into how can we be more intentional and not leave things up to chance what are the best practices from those that are doing growth and then also how are we supporting those

[00:53:00]
student capabilities that are not as favorable in addition we've also have identified a schools that the top the top performing schools in the bottle performing schools and are working closely with our assistant superintendents and the principles on how we can look at their skills habits and mindsets as a district or as a school overall remember to members of the board Mr Hawkins just a little bit of an expansion to that is one of the things that I think we have celebrated in the work of progress monitoring is really growing deeper with the data and looking at the data and letting the data speak to us in terms of building the strategy and as we look at the data we are recognizing things in all of our goals and guardrails but specifically we know that we have some answers within our schools and looking

[00:54:00]
at the top 10 schools for example that achieved growth in any one of these areas is really an exercise that helps us identify what is working why we're seeing the girls help us tell ourselves a story so that we're able to replicate what's working assist some of the schools where we're noticing the data is maybe flat or even declining so that we're able to take a support methodology in terms of cross-pollination of best practice within the organization in a way that is intentional but we have really used this approach in terms of identifying where our schools are growing and succeeding what can we learn from them to cross pollinate throughout the organization

[00:55:00]
it is not identified within go for specifically that is a lens which we use in all of our work beyond go one and two is really looking to see how we are faring with a different student groups with a specific and intentional focus with martinez plus African-American students because that has been the charge to the beginning of our work with our girls when we're looking at focus groups and and in particular who you choose to be on the focus groups and as you mentioned special education I would like to know how do you conduct those focus groups if you have a child who is not able to speak or for

[00:56:00]
conduct how to address some of those questions that you may ask what is your what is your plan for those students board member to the plan for the focus groups right now at this stage is principals what we were also looking at is we have three schools in the district that showed the highest growth in that level so we have we have identified elementary middle school and high school that those groups are going to get a more Deep dive into then identifying and interviewing principles teachers family students so those schools specifically that had double-digit growth in their areas we really were going to do a little bit more in depth into that process before the focus groups for the 68 schools it's just it's going to be the principles and it's going to be more of the systemic questions of how they did things more systemically so that way we can really look at

[00:57:00]
I always go with the quote from Atomic habits is you don't you don't rise you don't rise to level your goal you'll fall to live with your systems so what are the systems at your school that you have in place to that supported this growth that you can explain to us because the system is how we build in the sustainability at the schools and and then also increased those other schools I think if I may and thank you for allowing us all to respond but I think we all have a lot of ideas about this I would just Elevate I think in relation to the quote Dr Salazar shared about systems are advisory support and student Next plan system that's listed in the strategy section her own experience with advisory and I personally wasn't happy about that we know this is a missed opportunity for us to reach all of our

[00:58:00]
particularly through our next step plan this is the opportunity to have those conversations about College and Career but also skills habits and mindsets what do we need to develop to look at all of this data and also again get to the students who maybe aren't participating because their next step plan is a requirement so I wouldn't say the system is quite where I wanted to be yet but I appreciate that this is a strategy that go for is leaning into so we can really leverage that time to support all of our students thank you thank

[00:59:00]
regards to so given the data on response rates at the bottom of page seven in the goal for monitoring report so the overall report what strategies are you finding are most effective at increasing response rates additionally go for is as important as schools one and two what strategies are you using to communicate that to communicate that administration of Panorama is as important as I ready thank you madam vice president Jackson so for the the first question with the strategy and response rate a school and it's a high school and so at Rio Grande High School instead of utilizing this particular period

[01:00:00]
is it utilize advisory to administer the survey what that school did is what they just said we are going to administer survey during third period so all classes during third period will administrator the the survey so that means students don't transition they stay with their third period teacher and they would administrate at the survey that they would then administrate the survey during that time whether it was in chemistry whether it was in and so it was a school-wide approach to really looking at how do we look at surveying our Cato's in a more robust way and making sure that they're in their classes we've also seen schools that have a makeup strategy for those kids that missed the particular day date is as well as increasing their response rates and then also part of the the focus groups with the principals there is a criteria of survey administ

[01:01:00]
what were the techniques because a lot of the schools that we saw that had Rose also had high response rates and so that's what were the strategies that you use so there is a there is some criteria and about four or five questions about survey Administration and how they included their teachers how they included the the school white approaches to that because it's it's more than just telling a teacher you need to take your survey it's it's a school-wide approached to do that because there's behind every system of actions there's a belief in that of a system of beliefs so if we believe all our students need to take this survey that's something that we've seen some of the schools really include a lot of their stakeholders into that Madam vice president of the board Mr Hawkins in response to the question regarding the importance of the survey in relationship to other to assessments like i-Ready I would like to commend the work of Dr Salazar and

[01:02:00]
West and supper because we handled it the very same way in terms of monitoring the participation rate throughout the window in other words principles coordinators testing coordinators are able to see the participation rate from the very first day of administration to the close date of administration Dr Salazar has done an exceptional job of reminding principles and coordinators about we have five days left and you're at this percentage you have four days left you're at this percentage I'm sure he's a really popular but he does well because we care about what this survey tells us the information we are able to Garner from it because an argument can be made and I think I feel very strongly about this argument that if a student is able to manifest any of these characteristics we're going to have

[01:03:00]
start time talking about reading or math so really I commend the work that's been done in relationship to getting these numbers higher because what is able to do is give us the data we need to inform the work and the support that this building gives to our schools so I think that's really really important thank you suggest something to follow up all right and I will move to a couple of other questions then I'll move back and okay according to the report we had an increase in engagement for the survey overall but we still missed about 6,177 students do we have demographic information on those who were missed so that we can ensure we are engaging all types of students and what is the

[01:04:00]
we had a 87 response rate as a district but we know that we need to identify what those barriers are for those that whether that didn't have high response rates we all know the schools that did not meet the are threshold that we held for ourselves which was 95 percent that was the goal that we were trying to reach for October 24th October survey and so we are also working with those schools to identify what are the some of the systems that we could look out for the spring I even even talking with the assistant superintendent for high schools he was letting me know as well that schools have already have already been planning okay this is what we're going to do in the spring

[01:05:00]
because we weren't successful in this particular strategy for the fall and so I think that is the those are like more of the systemic approach to that question but the individual students I think that's where we need to make sure that we we know who those students are and make sure that they are also represented within how do we support those whether that's the counselor's social workers or others trained staff that can work on one-on-one basis or small interventions thank you one more question for this just let the record state that two of the questions that were sent in I am deeming is technical so I will send those to you for an answer after the meeting but the second question is one of the strategies noted in the report is building restorative approaches can you expand on this framework I'm interested in knowing if this is only tied to discipline or is some or if it is

[01:06:00]
anything that can be used overall including academic success and truancy can we connect these approaches to the closing the Gap initiative in the reported strategies thank you madam vice president Jackson what we know is school is a personal pursuit in a social contract and so how do we look at both of those priorities when we're working with our students with the coaches the main priority is relationships relationships are are critical aspect into the growth of of Learners whether that's the teacher to student relationship and as well as the student relationship through the rest of his work we're looking at how does that align to the skills habits in mindsets work so it's not just a punitive view of this is what you do when something happens it's more of a proactive approach to really looking at

[01:07:00]
what are the relationships that we're building with our with our students to be able to build social awareness and also built in self-regulation and it and it leads to itself as far as once we start working on on those particular constructs to help students be able to collaborate with each other then we could also look at how does that time to self efficacy and build it in goals and perseverance so those are the kinds of things that we're looking at as far as the relationships are the primary focus of this over coaches initiative that we have come thank you and that is those kids who are struggling the most and so My worry is that the current

[01:08:00]
focus group strategy in place for the silences the voices of the most vulnerable and I I appreciate that you are constructed the strategy is to construct the framework of best practices to share how can you make it doesn't have to be either or I mean we have a treasure Trove of data on those who have a less favorable demonstration we do

[01:09:00]
spell again what strategy what plan is there to and what's the timeline for that strategy to get Incorporated which focuses on the kids who are struggling because right now we are not focused on all kids it's easy to pick the ones that you have so what's the time line to implement a strategy a plan that captures the 6000 that I suspect using the data back

[01:10:00]
the question the theme that has manifested in this conversation is one that we've had as we've looked and reflected on the data because it is an obvious thing I have a couple of thoughts as I maybe start to answer this question I'm sure the team has additional thoughts because it's one we've given a lot of thought to so the first one is we are proud of the way the survey participation rate has moved up so we're able from one sense to gather that quantitative data from our students Voice through their participation in the survey we recognize that we have these students that have not taken the survey that concerns us because an argument can be made that they are the there's a real concern with that student group hey we know who they are so I think part of the beginning of my answer is

[01:11:00]
knowing who they are it is a call to action to change adult Behavior to now connect and that's the key word I want to use connect their lack of participation to the systems that we already have in place and the services that we have in place in terms of giving a critical look to how we are using different pieces of data so Antonio Gonzalez for example did not take the survey what are my grades what does my attendance look like what is my participation outside of this singular survey maybe perhaps in the past maybe I was out that day how do we drill down school by school because although the number may seem large is a district when you take it down by each school it's not as large and were able to drill down with intentionality and part of the conversation to give you a window

[01:12:00]
went to what we talked about was how do we take the work of Student Success systems how do we take the work of Community Schools how do we take the work of counseling of nursing these different departments that we already have and take this data to inform their practice their because now we know that we need to establish a net for the students as a district to support them and make sure that we are following up because information is great but information when you have information you have information and as adults we need to use it to direct response to your question of what's the timeline this conversation has already started and I think we've already begun to build the strategy for our future progress monitoring reports on this work because the data is telling us and

[01:13:00]
sing us along that way in other words we're not waiting we're already building the plan for future progress monitoring reports not waiting until 6 months from now yes but I would also like to add is even though we we do need to look at with those 6,000 what what are we doing with those those kiddos are looking at is the the student groups who are not performing favorably compared to their peers one of the two there were two new filters that we've added this year into Panorama those are actually the ones that have shown double digits decreases in the other in the in the reverse those two groups were working really closely with the directors and the managers

[01:14:00]
McKinney vento and Foster Care to relook at how do we support those students that are really that are the data is telling us something and that's what I tell my staff the date that kiddos are trying to tell us something with the survey so when we do look at those were able to identify and that's why there's there was this important urgency to make sure that we have high response rates and so that is something that we we we we are not unable to we are unable to do if we if they don't take the survey but with those kiddos that didn't I think we do need to look at what is the difference between how do we support these kids and in we also have to look at two that we have about 100 kiddos who opted out of the survey as well so we have to make sure that we're looking at did they opt out or did they not okay and you know I do want to recognize there's a lot of work

[01:15:00]
if you talk to them but thank you thank you okay all right so I have two questions and I'm hoping it's a little bit of a shift Gonzalez so the first is in regards to thank you for responding to these questions my question is in regards to the answer from the grade three to five results that you you sent back and is probably very similar to 6 through 12 so to answer for both but my question is I'm curious to know more about the strategy

[01:16:00]
between the use of the aps units of study and how you are using that to develop the skills habits and mindsets to focus on goal for particularly in regards to your answer the last sentence of this answer that said there are increasing academic demands that these grade levels that might discourage some students especially if they lack consistent reinforcement of growth mindset so how are you marrying those two in a strategy thank you for that question by President Jackson and I can start and then I'm going to invite Dr Salazar to jump in because he was really instrumental in helping us and the beginning of the development of the units of study to make sure that the skills habits and mindsets how to place in that work and so I'm sorry reflecting also on board member of benavidez question about like how did what are the strategies to grow

[01:17:00]
these skills habits and mindsets and in particular to the units of study it's very much around the concept of Mastery when we see our students achieving and mastering their skills we've all experienced that when we're able to do something we weren't able to do before we can call that out for self-efficacy right but it is I'm going to lose to Dr Gonzalez's response earlier it's the vocabulary that we have in common across the district that we can start to call out in the academic setting to say your demonstrating this particular skill habit or mindset and I do believe in a really important part of that approach and it's why they're in the units of study is our ability to do that we know we help students when we can help them identify their feelings named their emotions and really talk about how do I develop something like

[01:18:00]
perseverance for example Dr Salazar I'm wondering if you would talk about specifically what we put in the units cuz I think you have a really good grasp on that thank you madam vice president in the units of study when we were building it out in the beginning we were looking at how to make sure that they were standards-based and also making sure that the skills habits and mindsets where where would we put that within the units of study because we know that Gulf War is the foundation is to really building out the ability for them to learn and read and do those those academic outcomes one of the things that we looked at with the units of study is the I can statements that teachers usually will put on the on the boards I can do this or I can and what we've done is provided I can statements that that are specifically for skills habits of mindsets connected specifically to those units of

[01:19:00]
so if it's a unit to study unit 1 We Have Skills habits of mindsets I can't statements aligned to unit 1 unit 2 we have I can't statements skills habits and mindset so students and and and and and and going with cheap academic academic officer jet said is our teachers are doing it in the classroom but we want to leave that and we also want students to be able to identify the skills and the habits that are doing because your identity is made out of the habits that you're you're doing and so if you're able to say I am demonstrating self-efficacy you have you will be able to start and label that and notice that you are demonstrating self-efficacy perseverance self-regulation social awareness and so that is that is something that we have intentionally put into our Ela and math units of study is the I can't statements directly connected to the skills and mindsets just as a follow-up is that just for Grace three through five or is that three through is that for all you need

[01:20:00]
volume to 70% and what was also really nice really beneficial is the the the the group that created the secondary cuz I was secondary at the time they were really ensuring that the developmentally appropriate for middle school and high school which was one of the questions that that you that the board has asked about what's the differentiating between middle school and high school there is that difference of Developmental complexity of Middle School developing the prefrontal cortex and understanding what what vocabulary so you'll know that the I can't statements and advanced more in the vocabulary of the statements as a progress from elementary middle high no thank you for that and I think it was also probably reflected a little bit in the videos in the orbit videos which were which were great so thank you for including those I have one more question and then I will check in with my fellow board members and then we might be able to wrap this up and

[01:21:00]
my my second question is also just a follow-up to some of the answers that came in regarding the next step plan I noted in the response that currently 2,817 secondary APS parent and Guardians have created their accounts I have to think that there are more than 2,817 secondary APS parents and Guardians and so my question is I'm actually one of those I have created my account I'll just let you know but my question is what strategy are you using to make sure that parents not only sign parents and Guardians not only sign up but they utilize it because I will also call myself out and say I've signed up I haven't quite driven myself to utilize it

[01:22:00]
cuz I'm not quite sure how important it is yet so what strategy do you have to make me really feel that this is an important requirement thank you madam vice president Jackson we know that perseverance is a powerful predictor of graduation research has shown that if students have perseverance they see higher graduation graduation in itself as I tell a lot is perseverance to be able to persevere through those four years get your credits is a demonstration of perseverance in itself as an act what we've looked at is is how do we embed within the next step plan opportunities for students to intentionally increase their goal setting skills and and as well as their perseverance we have worked with the state to really look at

[01:23:00]
how do we make the next plan more effective for 8th grade 9th grade 10th grade upgrade 12th grade because those are the groups that are in State Statute that have to take the next step plan and we have actually they the state has embedded our perseverance questions within the next plan that the students take on the survey so they're getting more exposure to what does goal setting look like how often are you setting goals for families one of the things that we are doing right now is getting the buy-in and the the intention of utilizing level all within the school and so we have recently developed some resources for our school instructional councils to that include also a timeline that they can use an example to leverage level all how to look we are also have things to sapper we have an internal visualization of students and similar to the response rates with skills habits of

[01:24:00]
we are able to identify her school how many students they have we have in level all because we're working with level to get that data so we have a visualization of percentages of students who have created their accounts and we also are now looking at who are actually utilizing those accounts so I think it's more now of first looking at the internal systems of a school and and making sure that everyone is aware of the the benefits of what level can bring to the kiddos in regards to the next plan and then how do we communicate that with the families one of the things we have worked with my colleague associate superintendent Mark Garcia is really looking at how can we utilize a parent conference which is in the spring and have students share their next step plan with the parents in the spring because we saw in the data that the next step plan not a lot of there was not a lot of Engagement not only with families but also with the students himself

[01:25:00]
and so we really looking at how do we increase that particular structure within our district and involve the families and we really see there's a high leverage point of involving the families and having the power of the student sharing their next step plan their goals for their next year with their families during the parent-teacher conference love it anybody else I can't help myself you know what I commend you for creating your account and I'm not surprised so that maybe we don't have a high number of accounts yet or activity from the family side the heavy heavy launch for the families will be related to The Next Step planning and the parent teacher conferences in the spring and so I think reviewing that data after those conferences and I'm sure and I'm confident we will see a really large increase and once we're able to do that because the next step

[01:26:00]
play on is housed in level all people will be in the platform and the next thing you know it's a very intuitive site I encourage you to go through like this you know tip it's like cool videos and things that students would be drawn toward and I do believe that families are going to be able to sit and look at that together and be excited about the possibilities so it sounds like it's still kind of in the infancy but we're we're moving towards that okay well thank you so much I think I heard board member benavidez say she had a follow-up questions so I'm going to move to her thank you Jackson and first I want to say how sorry I am if I inadvertently caught you and Dr Gonzalez off in my last question not the answer for Salazar and then I said Thank you so I apologize and then I just did it again because I thought I heard vice president say it does anybody or does anybody else want to go and so I'm like I do you know so sorry I'm eager tonight I apologize but so so my question and I want to thank you Dr Salazar because

[01:27:00]
but of the 6100 students who did not take the survey 61.77 100 out so and that was going to be my question and that's a very small percentage who opted out and and I'm happy to hear that but I'm curious what are the strategies that you have or have you developed one to try to encourage those parents to encourage their students to take the survey and they've been successful and what's do you have any results on that what I think that one of the things that we have is the process is very School base and so we really need to make sure that the communication from the windows are happening that there's an adult process I don't at this current time we don't have a robust okay they're option out do we call in the families

[01:28:00]
and so I do think that is something that we can really look at as far as with those hundred students that opted out what what can we do to support you because they they will not have the survey data that we can utilize but that could be something we can really look at is what is the process not only just to opt out and understand what your opinion out for but then how can we support you because just we still know that you are able to provide the student services that we offer as a school so I think that's something that we could definitely look into for that process and I understand it's a small percentage but I think it'd be interesting to know why they opted out thank you for your clarification and how we are taking

[01:29:00]
1 4.1 and and also 4.2 to draw draw a line not a line but to make the connection to literacy using self-sufficiency perseverance self-regulation and social awareness and as we look at our percentages in our Target goals specifically for the 6th through 12th grade students when you identify whether those kids don't take the survey or the the 6000 you know numbers how do you also look at the literacy component for a majority of these kids who are in 6 to high school and meeting the needs of literacy what is that plan on once they're identified because I have a concern for like say if it's a senior and you only have so much

[01:30:00]
within that year span to give them at least the basic skills before they graduate how do you do that identification and and what is the plan for when we see these lack of skills and literacy when we get to the 6th through 12th graders maybe struggling as we look at leadership of Dr Blakey and really realizing the vision that she said for us in relationship to our goals is really starting here

[01:31:00]
to see how it is we are structured for success in terms of coherence of support to schools in terms of knowing what the left hand is saying to the right hand and vice versa and we have I'm pleased to report there have been several examples of departmental consolidation departmental organization in terms of the way we have set ourselves up I hope for more optimal success in terms of just taking Dr Salazar's department for example departments that correspond to the work of go for and the work of students that will just use the 6000 students that we've been talking about this evening for example they are now housed under one umbrella where is in the past they might have been in several departments and what we see now is we have a coherent conversation of singular conversation with folks that are working in family engagement

[01:32:00]
or social emotional learning or the work of Community Schools it's not one person in Community Schools work in seven different departments so I think that's there's a story to be told there because we exist here to support schools in really building the plants to respond and respond quickly and in real time to the students that you're discussing and calling us to action with so I think that's one thing that we've really worked with intentional steps aggressive steps it's been I think an example of profound changing adult Behavior starting with the way that we I hope are leading the change in organization and The Way We Were structure here to respond to the needs of the schools and I

[01:33:00]
flies that my response is at the very large macro level but I'm going to defer to my colleagues to have perhaps maybe a few more thinking one of the benefits of being able to utilize Panorama is when we when you're able to look at a student profile not only does it give the social emotional learning it also gives their literacy scores their math scores all on what their attendance all in their all-in-one area what a teacher and what we are doing as well as we are done teacher training January 6th we did an online training online to all secondary teachers what were what we have in that platform was called The Playbook within the Playbook there are specific strategies that stakeholders teachers counselors administrators

[01:34:00]
utilize what is also beneficial is it's not just SEL specific there's also mathematics Ela social studies Playbook strategies that not only just build on the academics but also embed some of the social emotional learning so what we are hoping is as more training and professional development occurs for our teachers they can start leveraging and utilizing that platform in a more intentional way to wear looking at the strategies that are specific in the playbook for leadership for example and there's also developmentally appropriate as well as a teacher can select I want to look at a 5th grade specific literacy strategy that also helps with self-efficacy and they're able to dig into that and it provides a lot of strategies that teachers can use so that's an example as as we're getting teachers trained what what the capabilities are within that

[01:35:00]
thank you I am I'm glad Dr Salazar elevated the platform where we have many data points on a student and what I was thinking I agree there's a lot in the question but one thing you know that I think we have to stress particularly as were supporting our teachers to help with these particular aspects is that it's a very nuanced approach your doctor give examples of you know you can go and you say this student is struggling and literacy and self-efficacy and yes the Playbook will generate here's a strategy that you could use with this student and that even that level of detail may not have been past practice and so a lot of the professional learning and learning to use the platform and Shifting the mindset more to the whole child and I'm a high school teacher so I feel like I can say this like

[01:36:00]
I understand that but you know there's content there's a lot at stake there and so how can we really slow down talk to the student talk to the family and think about what is the exact right intervention here and how do we implement it and then how do we also progress monitor it to make sure that it's successful for that student because what works for me may not work for Dr Gonzalez and so on and so forth so I just you know that question really made me sort of slow down and think how do we do that and how do we message that so thank you just the other side of the coin is also to remember when a parent finds out that my son or daughter at 10th grade or or Junior don't they don't have the skills you know what would that feel like so thank you for your comments and for the work you're doing thanks

[01:37:00]
one more question and then I think we're going to wrap this up but I just want to point out there are only four of us up here and we are Tiny But Mighty and we are really digging into the school for skills have his mindset so a former Dominguez so one last question how can the board help with the next step strategy we do community engagement events and Outreach and to that end it seems this is timely because today I reached out to superintendent Blakey about this how can we are having Community engagement events January and February and some

[01:38:00]
the light went off the other two nights ago and I said I need to change my presentation to include you know goal what I mean the concepts behind the next step strategies so how can we collaborate more effectively on this message thank you for making that connection and I think the simple answer is raise bring it up I mean sure the story help us Elevate the importance of level wall it's going to be perfect timing because your community engagement exercise will coincide

[01:39:00]
and kind of lead into the middle to the end of the spring semester which will be when we are going really all hands on deck working to ensure that our students indeed have that next step plan in place I think the other thing to take into account is feedback is important because as has been mentioned before we are piloting the level of platform for the New Mexico public education department and any feedback that we can give them as they roll out the tool throughout the state as we understand it next school year period

[01:40:00]
websites the background on my think that is readily available and I think I'm just making one more connection if I may it will also roughly connect with the work and progress monitoring of call 3 which I believe is taking place in March so we will be able to make that connection and I'm sure you will hear a little bit about level all again at that time okay okay thank you that was that was a great question

[01:41:00]
as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and her team and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions and I'll read them just one at a time the first one does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal I see two yeses does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal I think so we have a yes I'm going to take it as a yes I'm going to round up okay is there growth toward division is there

[01:42:00]
allergy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision this is where I'm struggling to understand and I'm not going to do we all have to agree we all okay so I'm struggling to understand how the strategies to address the behaviors the student outcomes we seek to improve in the population that have struggled myself since I was at Highland High School 40 now going on 40 and that

[01:43:00]
worries me but I'm hearing so I'm happy I will not hold up the vote okay I will agree but I need I need a conversation to to fully understand and I'll leave it at their there will be emotion and you can vote as yours but I didn't ask you to is the is there is the strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision yes okay so at this point I need a motion to accept the monitoring report this is boards any further deliberation okay so if

[01:44:00]
when may we have a vote a real call vote please thank you so much I appreciate it okay here we go moving on our next item is to consider adoption of the Apso I already did that oh no no no no I'm sorry sorry to education student outcomes Focus governance self-evaluation for years 3/4 one the presenter is myself vice president Courtney Jackson so do not come Focus governance is the framework designed to drive the board's ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective

[01:45:00]
promise to improve student outcomes this is the process of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing behaviors with those most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes board members have been asked to individually complete the self-evaluation form for our board actions from last quarter we have done this and have submitted our individual results to the board office for tonight's discussion before we proceed do any board members have questions about the process to date scene okay so thank you I will now review the results for each of the six competencies of the sosg self-evaluation I'll share our Collective scores for each competency and then pause for questions or comments before proceeding at the end of this review we will have

[01:46:00]
brief conversation about what we feel is possible by the end of our next quarter we received scores from all board members the total ranges for the total scores was from 17 to 74 across each competency there was not one where all members agreed so because of that we will go through and discuss the all the competencies do you give me just a second I need to get back into my computer so the first of the competencies is visions and goals individually board members have rated us as having achieved 35 as a consensus

[01:47:00]
on the number of points and focus level the range was from 0 to 35 does anyone have a different score there was a different score and if so what evidence do you have to support your position I had a score of 25 and I looked at the the rubric under the blue section the final four right column it says the board used a process that included students parents staff and community members in a way that leads them to express ownership of the adopted goals and I would say December 18th as the reason that I did not give us a 35 I think

[01:48:00]
we we failed in this regard community members tried to voice their they did voice you know the goals and guardrails but I don't think we we weren't effective in this area we lost we lost Focus so that's my reasoning anybody else like to comment on this section of us need to reach a consensus to decide if we're going to keep the total at 35 or reduce it to

[01:49:00]
25 as suggested by board member Dominguez the consensus of most of the board members five board members said 35 12510 I think because the consensus was 35 we will oh yes I'm going to also agree with Josefina or board member Dominguez I think based on our lack of Engagement during the right sizing even though there were various

[01:50:00]
area stating that we did I did attend the Los Ranchos council meeting and there were many things brought up in the air that night but I also felt they weren't addressed and the community was very worthy and stating those needs and then also the letter from the council to defer that date was never presented to us as the board once it was submitted for us to review and see and also stating their voice as a community so my my 25th so I understand and agree with what board members Dominguez and what is because we all voted together we voted no on that initiative however

[01:51:00]
mastering student outcomes Focus says the board used a process that included students parents staff and community members in a way that leads them to express ownership of the adopted goals so for right-sizing we could have done better but we did use a process and we held the community engagement event for the budget development and we held two of those and I think that that falls within that column and so we should get the 35 points and and I do understand how important the controversy over the right size and effort was and it's still is but technically we do we did do an engagement event aligning with the goals before before I respond so also additionally in to what board member

[01:52:00]
Adidas said the December 18th meeting had to do with right-sizing it did not have to do with our goals we currently do not have any goals or guardrails that are about right sizing per se and having Community ownership of our goals never implies that we are not going to have community members who are upset with us so I again I understand the frustration behind the the right size and discussion but that is not the right size is not one of our goals those are the four goals and we did have a process that created the ownership not only beginning back in November of 2022 but leading up to up to today so I would feel comfortable leaving the number up

[01:53:00]
351 you're helping me understand that I need to articulate this in terms of the impact that major topics have on the communities ownership of those goals the right sizing topic involved a an elementary school and middle school and as such the the academic impacts were involved in to so thank you for helping me clarify to you know that we have to do when we're grading ourselves we need to make the connection to those goals and I and I would

[01:54:00]
still argue that goes one and two and again this is about us did we do a good job in engaging the community in such a way that they felt ownership in a decision that from what I heard was impacting outcomes on those two goals so we don't need to know where the consensus I know I reiterated that night that student

[01:55:00]
what time is widely affected by Community engagement and I don't know how we separate that but and and the reasoning that's my my my my my my one reasoning for all of this is that yes I see the goals and yes I understand the work that we've done but sometimes I feel that they are connected and then we proceed them as not so I am still going to stand by what I believe thank you as you should thank you and I I I I I think since we have we do think we have other board members who have submitted their scores on this and because the consensus does lean heavily towards 35 I think I would be comfortable leaving this on top level at 35 for now and if future discussion needs to occur we can certainly

[01:56:00]
do that as we move forward with our self-evaluation okay so next moving on to values and guardrails individually board members have raided us at a consensus of 15 as on the number of points and focus level we do have one two three four five who rated us at 15 we have one rating at 7 and 1 rating at 10 is there any discussion on this topic for values and guardrails I'm going to propose that we just go with the consensus so we don't blame her this consensus

[01:57:00]
but I just want to stress that if we're looking at values and values is one that I don't see the great for that so I'm going to stipulate that one there are many things within our board you know values is important but also state that I don't I don't see that so I will go with the with the the majority and I'm just stating my opinion okay thank you we will then stick with the consensus number of 15 next moving to monitoring accountability individually board members rated us as having achieved a 10 as to consensus

[01:58:00]
on the number of points and focus level 1 2 3 4 5 rated as a 10 when is the 7 and 1 is the 0 would we like to have any discussion on this point I need a clarification just so I understand that the grading I was 0 and I looked at and I might have misunderstood the report from board member Tapia Romero and call him in the second column it says the board Investments no less than 10% of its so bored authorized public meeting minutes monitoring its goals in her report I'm focusing on the 7% that you're reported and then we had what was what did things average out to in that quarter because I think

[01:59:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:00:00]
which is why nobody was able to judge to that works at 20 but for the quarter we were over 10% okay that's where my misunderstanding was okay so can I move you back into the 10 yeah thank you all right so any further discussion on this point okay I'm going to go ahead and read it as a tent to communication and collaboration individually board members have rated us as having achieved one as a consensus on the number and points of and focus level so just as a as a knowledge base we have one two three four as the one one is the 101 is the five and one is a 0 so we have

[02:01:00]
little bit of a little bit of a discussion here among the communication and collaboration but the majority right now have us as a one so is there any unfortunately one of the people is not here to discuss her difference so do add Hogs count as I guess not I'm looking at the pink call there were more than six board authorized public meetings in a single month during the previous 12 months right and I think we've discussed this before because in January we had quite a few with the superintendent search and so I still maintain that because we we violated that that will never we should never get a zero but yeah because of that but I also

[02:02:00]
I want to stress we're supposed to be disgusting you know gold monitoring discussing and or approving not approving gold monitoring reports I guess we do that publicly the question is for me so according to this during

[02:03:00]
period at Hawks do not count moving forward at hawkswell so but for for this for this time period that we're evaluating at Hawks do not count so that should move you and remind me why I think that we got some clarification from from our coach that yeah so do you have and I'm going to keep my one okay okay so it seems like again collectively we're at a one and so are are okay moving to Unity and Trust the consensus is a three with two as a one so we like to stay with the consensus or do we feel the need to discuss the unity and Trust option

[02:04:00]
okay good with score 3 I think we have a problem with unity and Trust so I'll leave my score as is and and then move on cuz we're belaboring I'm the same way I'm agreeing with Josefina is my score the one I understand the need to move along and I appreciate that but if it would you like to point out which area you have that we did not meet and the approaching student loans focused to or I'm sorry the meeting students focused to get us two or three so my my problem with with this exercise is I think of the labors I'm not a points or even a great person I'm about standards and I don't

[02:05:00]
can I take your shoe with the tool and its entirety but but it particularly in this Arena of unity and Trust I think there have been so many breakdowns on this board this past year that we're pretending a lot and I won't go into a discussion on pretending but page 91 and great in their behalf the song So if I can just like make a synopsis it's it's not necessarily that we haven't met these one two three four paragraphs that are included within the meeting student outcomes for number three it's more you have a general uneasiness with the unity and Trust

[02:06:00]
when we are using the words unity and trust and then we grade based on how that behaved I don't know if it's more Behavior or if we look at Adobe Behavior or we just looking at processes and accomplishments of these particular areas that why use unity and Trust when it should be something different because I don't think we're really working on those areas and so here's represented yeah misrepresented so what I feel so expressly with everything that has happened in the past year and and more importantly is

[02:07:00]
so what I talked about on just this past January 8th so that's my reasoning because I have a real problem with why we're using unity and Trust if that's not what we're really looking at that's my answer okay thank you very much do you have that okay if I think using using the terms unity and trust is is a way to kind of Orient towards these specific behaviors within the government's manual that create affective board behaviors and so these are kind of like the evidence-based standards that if we are doing these things it will eventually lead to Unity and trust it sounds like we're not at consensus as to whether or not we're actually there but if we can practice these particular methods within this manual

[02:08:00]
I can get there so if it would be okay I'm going to keep us at the consensus of 3 so that we can move forward with to continuous Improvement which is kind of a nice follow-up that we have continuous Improvement 1 2 3 4 5 board members ranked us at 11 board member ranked us at 3:00 and another ring to set 0 do we want to stay with the consensus of one or have a discussion you're good for you trying to figure out why I guess I did not count December 20th as a governance

[02:09:00]
I don't think we accomplished what we were supposed to it doesn't but we have had other crannies I think it's within the 12-month period right is it the 12th month so so you're moving us to a one that's what I hear you say it has been I can't read my cursive I don't know and I'm deciding October through December and it doesn't have I mean you guys have consensus so it reads the board has provided time during regularly scheduled board authorized public meetings to recognize the accomplishments of students and staff regarding

[02:10:00]
progress toward goals and interim goals I I don't remember that from October to December I couldn't pull up a memory of one okay well I'm going to kind of keep us moving if that is okay with a consensus of one so what I find is that and this gives us a total of 65 points for the last quarter and now we need to set our goal for the next quarter I'd like to hear from members of the board what you believe is possible by our next self-evaluation in the next quarter can we stay at 65 I will remind the board that last quarter we set a goal of 69 so we felt a little bit short and so do we want to maintain that 69 as our as our next school did we want to stick it 65 I would hesitate that we say that we're going to go down so

[02:11:00]
6965 or are we going for a 100.75 and actually wouldn't be able to happen until we have our superintendent evaluation anyway so I'm hearing a 70 I'm going to go for the 60 okay I've got a 7068 to 69 currently average so you're taking 69 okay so we as a Tiny But Mighty bored up here we are going to say that our goal for the next quarter will be 69 so at this time I will entertain

[02:12:00]
Motion in consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation may I have a motion to accept I moved to accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 65 points on the student outcomes Focus governance self evaluation instrument and this is board member benefits may have a second please second any further discussion Dr Albright may we have a role called the police department yes okay moving on to our action items and 6.1 our next item is to consider approval of the new graduation requirements to include one half credit for personal financial literacy and one and a half additional credits for electives are presenters tonight are Dr Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent leadership and learning Missouri jet our chief

[02:13:00]
officer and Mark Garcia are associate superintendent of secondary education and to additional guests who I'm hoping that you guys will introduce okay thank you Dr Gonzalez you have the floor good evening Madam vice president members of the board and Mr Hawkins this evening we have an exciting agenda item that will shape the future of our students as you know in 2024 the state legislature passed HB 171 requiring school districts to update graduation requirements this gives us a unique opportunity to rethink how we prepare students for Life Beyond high school after Gathering input from students families and staff as you saw in the community white survey we established an HB 171 committee that collaborated to develop updated graduation requirements these updates ensure compliance with the new law

[02:14:00]
while supporting the work of the district in goal 3 which focuses on increasing student participation in rigorous academic and career programs that prepare them for success in college and careers House Bill 171 allows school districts to determine how to use two discretionary units and that is the asked tonight because that does require board approval to get us started in this important work based on our collaborative work and from the community feedback we are recommending first adding a 0.5% personal financial literacy course to graduation requirement to Eclipse students with essential personal financial skills and second expanding 1.5 elective options which would give students greater flexibility and teachers an opportunity to innovate in their practice and

[02:15:00]
their interests their Collective interests in a lining their course work with students college and career goals we have a presentation for you this evening that provides a brought overview of these and other planned administrative changes we are committed to working closely with our students our teachers and schools throughout this process to ensure a smooth transition and keep everyone informed I'd like to emphasize that this work begins in August with our freshman walking into their High School The Freshman Class of 2029 it's hard to say that out loud but this work is beginning tonight with the approval of these two discretionary units we will have the beginning of the information we need to begin to register our students for the new Academic School year but make no mistake the work will only begin this evening and we will

[02:16:00]
continue to keep the board updated as we work in the collaborative and Innovative way to reimagine the educational experience for our students at the high school level as they marched toward their graduation I will now turn it over to associate superintendent Garcia for the presentation but before I do that I would like to thank the committee that helped us get to this point I'm representing that committee tonight is El Dorado High School teacher Sean Thomas and Volcano Vista High School teacher this is their representing the broader group and with that I turn it over to Mr Garcia good evening vice president Jackson member of the boards Deputy superintendent Hawkins It's really excited tonight to have the opportunity to get to really explain the exciting re-imagination of the

[02:17:00]
experience for all of our Albuquerque Public School students I also want to thank Sean Thomas and Lisa Valdez but I also want to thank all of those advisory committee members which included many stakeholders we had students some family Representatives also principals assistant principals Business Leaders so we really had robust conversations and without further Ado I'd like to unveil our planned you all so our purpose of the presentation tonight is to inform the board about House Bill 171 and the administration's recommendations for the two discretionary units highlight key updates to graduation requirements and provide you the opportunity to hear about our Innovative and then last showcase aps's

[02:18:00]
focus on Choice flexibility and career connected learning so what changes occurred in House Bill 171 like Dr Gonzalez had said House Bill 171 was passed in Spring Grove 2024 to modernize the graduation requirements for New Mexico students some key components included two local discretionary units chosen by each School District Next Step plans to guide students college and career goals graduate profile creation to line skills with Student Success and adjustments to court credits with Pathways for increased flexibility and I'm going to pass it over to Lisa thank you both very much for caring some of the things that we want to highlight with regard to what the graduation

[02:19:00]
requirements are going to look like and how to spell 171 is Shifting back just a little bit English for example which is my specialty this is why I'm an English teacher traditionally what we've had is for credits that were required for high school graduation now it's still for credits but what house bill 171 does is it provides us with the opportunity to provide students with Choice the purpose of all of this is to ensure student engagement career connected learning and culturally relevant connections that are going to help them with that sense of belonging that way that we just talked about in the previous presentation we've already gotten in place period

[02:20:00]
ways that are coming very soon that allows us for some additional choices again honoring the spirit of Hospital 171 and student Choice what's going to also change is in math for credits as they have now Algebra 2 is still going to be offered at the high schools but it will not be a required credit for graduation going down to science there's three credits that are required for graduation right now the house bill 171 shifts just a little bit making it too loud credits that are necessary for graduation learning and different different Pathways career Pathways social studies is for credit this is going to be an increase in the number of credits also talking about the personal financial literacy we have such a little bit

[02:21:00]
we're going to do more deeply dive with Mr Thomas in just a few minutes here PE will have some flexible options we're going to looking at and we're recommending that dance JROTC as well as band options become optional for that PE credit that has historically been but still still in place and then Health the 0.5 credit that has been required we're going to be moving back or suggesting to move that down to Middle School level next what we want to talk about a little bit is how does all rolled out in the timeline that we've been spending together with all the stakeholders that miss your Garcia in the spring and summer of 2024

[02:22:00]
stated we did surveys of the community and numerous stakeholders we reviewed that data there was a joint memo that was sent out by the Union as well as our district offices and that came down to the community to let him know what changes were being put in place through this new legislation all of that in addition we can being an advisory committee Mr Thomas and I were a couple of the teachers that's not on that and they did represent a cross the district and and different areas so we have lots of interchange in them moving into the beginning of the school year and August in September tasked with going to their site and Gathering data with regards to what kinds of opportunities that could open up

[02:23:00]
all of that data was was disseminated it was through surveys of teachers students are admin and races were tasked with bringing all of that data to the advisory committee the advisory committee also did a deeper dive into the development of The Graduate profile and that was part of our work at the very beginning of the school year in August and September moving into September and October we started reviewing that data that the instructional council's brought back to us as well as looking at core groups and the advisory committee started looking at those recommendations and happy

[02:24:00]
the recommendations for communication of all of this information both to families the communities the students Administration and every stakeholder that we've got involved my understanding is is where we're just waiting for you guys to pull the trigger on us and we've got our communication plan put in place and with that really the community input driving or graduation changes so just a bit about the graduation survey it was conducted in May of 2024 by our soccer team the survey reached over 7,000 parents Guardians students teachers and community members and the survey focused in areas such as course requirements for incoming 9th graders Next Step plans and career connected learning so what the community told us was that personal financial literacy all groups Express

[02:25:00]
that personal financial literacy or financial literacy is an important course to take in high school with only 5% of respondents indicating that financial literacy is not important early high school credits nearly 70% of respondents supported middle school students earning High School Health Credit and then career connected learning 83% of respondents felt at APS should expand career connective learning opportunities so I think we should thanks for the opportunity to speak I think the main goal that we talked about in the committee was separate from the survey that went out we use the survey to inform our decisions but they were separate practices and the committee really was focusing on man we should retain as much Choice as we possibly can because if we want to keep students engaged and we want to make sure that the graduate and that they graduate for years which is awesome important that we

[02:26:00]
put on the opportunity to choose classes that they actually want to take so that they can set their own goals for their own artistic academic and career you know outlooks and when we did that we were really pushing back on that so you know this personal literacy Finance credit that's going to be 0.5 we have two discretionary credits that's what one of the things we're proposing you today we were hopefully initially with the committee we're hoping that all two of those discussion area credits would be for an elective option and that was what was recommended by the committee but through the surveys to be such a high demand from the community that it offered that the district working with the committee decided Well let's do a point five personal finance but we'll leave those other one and a half credits alone so that students can actually have you know students and how they're going to build their High School curriculum the Health Credit in middle school this is always going to be tricky whenever you move levels but

[02:27:00]
set the idea of maintaining choice if we move that down to 8th grade and make that a high school credit that they need for graduation it provides more opportunity for Choice when those kids get the high school in terms of being able to tailor the curriculum towards their interest so that was what the Hope was there and then we do have an additional social studies credit that came out of the law that we're trying to figure out what to do we're recommending and I think it's a really powerful thing that you know they're going to take world history US history and geography and they're going to take government but there's an additional class that these students can take that would be of any of the social science or social studies of those that exist and those include like a wide variety from everything from sociology to 85 African American classes that we can take so if you follow it with me to the next slide I think the reason why this is going to matter to our kiddos and

[02:28:00]
there's been a number of years that have passed without any changes to the requirement for high school graduation we're teaching now students who are entering a job Force 75% of whom don't even know the jobs that they're going to be feeling that in order to make them in cage Learners and home those critical thinking skills we need to open up that choice that Mr Thomas was talking about kids and that's why the spirit of 171 is so exciting with regard to the kids are going to go through their High School experience it does support that development of critical thinking

[02:29:00]
skills that are going to make them adoptable and flexible human beings when they enter the workforce and they work enter the World As Leaders that we know that they can be a lot of these decisions that were made at House Bill 171 all deal with the feedback that we received from all of the parents the parents the students the business owners as well as our administrators our teachers everybody have a say in this and that was why it was community-driven again another song of why it's so exciting we want to make sure that our graduates who are leaving our high schools are ready for their next steps we want them excited about their lives we don't want them looking at doing what is my life going to look like we want to lifelong Learners and we think that hospital 171 opportunity to make that happen for them

[02:30:00]
I think one of the things you know with New Mexico history going away as part of this logs it's no longer a requirement and this idea of introducing financial literacy based off of the information that we got from the community to fill in there this is a nice bridge to the fact that like we have to back something with health for at least one year because the kids that just moved out of 8th grade 9th grade won't have that Health Credit so we're going to have to hold on to that one more time at the high school level so this does that nice we have discussed with the district ongoing process of the state social studies or if it moves on its really can follow a license when we looked at financial literacy so we can figure that out later but for next year it's this bridge that we think is probably necessary step for us to align the curriculum in the way that students will need to graduate and then we

[02:31:00]
look at that 1.5 credits of electives and I think if you look at the slide and just look at the opportunities and options you know electives really truly should be exploratory it's not that you should take an elective and go oh that's what I'm going to do for the rest of my life I think the idea that we have one and a half credits that we offer is student Choice give students a really good chance of like going on and exploring different opportunities that they want to have and I think at the local level here we approve that looking at individual schools we can do a lot with you know maybe making some semester electives or going into doing exploratory classes that you see in some of the middle schools where you'd like the will and you do like art and drama and music and all that stuff so there's an opportunity to really create exploratory education with his bill and so that's why we're hoping to leave those as a student choice and absolutely in Capstone that's not a I think it's really important for for the General Ed

[02:32:00]
location of her specialty population to really create a project that they see through from beginning to end that student created in those types of classes it gives us a really good opportunity to start introducing Capstone classes to the general population is right now it does it doesn't have to be but it does seem to be that it's really only the AP kids that take advantage of that so you know I mean we can read the slide so the implementation is obviously we got to figure this out and get these credits proved so that we can start doing course offerings and get kids registered for next year so you know by February 2025 of course registration Begins for the class 2029 we're right up against that already and one of the things that school principals will tell you they told me loudly was we're like a month behind so I think it's good that if we can move forward with this and then it's going to be an ongoing change because the the really cool thing about House Bill 171 is that there's an opportunity to continue to

[02:33:00]
visit our horse offerings to make it more inclusive for students interest so we should be growing and growing and growing and giving kids more and more opportunity to kind of tailor it and I know that a lot of schools especially small secondary schools that have small populations don't always get the offer like this wealth of electives but now all of a sudden you know you can offer now taking psych for instance is is an actual credit for graduation and it might encourage some of these classes to make at these smaller high schools so this might be a way to get more Dynamic course offerings into smaller schools and obviously I think that's everyone on the committee from from the top brass of the district teachers would really like to see that and so that's kind of what are philosophy is I think we would love to continue to be partners as teachers and I think community members were excited about this work and the and the district level that we can continue

[02:34:00]
disinformation implementation going together right this is at the very least going to be a four-year process of trying to work this out because it's it's for the class of 2030 we're going to have to track them and and and and you know collect data and see how they do and what were the options and did they get to take classes that they wanted but I honestly believe but maybe I'm just an optimist here that this will be a continual opportunity for growth where we get to continue to make classes that meet our students needs and and things that are kids want to take next year may not be the same course offerings that they're clamoring for in five years and so we should just continue to add classes to student choice and the nice thing about all of this is you know we have a common core standards we have the inquiry standards for any subjects so it's easy for us to take these standards created by the PED or even the national ones that we use and at least adapt the skill-based standards to pretty much any class that these kiddos take we should be doing that anyways but this kind of will force our hand make sure that we're doing it will be able to

[02:35:00]
will be able to offer the students Choice with Mexican American literature Native American literature black literature so that we are making those connections the kids have those choice and they don't have to pay those classes for elected actually can earn Core Credit for those classes that are both culturally responsive as well as connected to Career interesting and at this time we open it up for questions thank you thank you so much thank you so much that was an incredibly robust exciting presentation and I just wanted to take an opportunity to thank you for the collaboration that you undertook and it's very obvious from the presentation that you you really gone out and and listen to the community voice as you've adapted this and I think

[02:36:00]
I'm a board perspective Community engagement is really important and so I'm just I will say from my own perspective I appreciate you adapting for the community voice before we move to questions though I'm going to ask for a motion to approve this so that we can move to deliberation and discussion and thank you board members or I do see that you are on so thank you for joining us I move that we approve the new graduation requirements to include one half credit for personal financial literacy and one and a half additional credits for electives this is board member benefits okay thank you and now we will open the floor for discussion board member tomorrow's for every student

[02:37:00]
and then going back to the the extended pathways on I think it's slide 8 where you talked about options may include courses such as AP African-American studies sociology Native American government ethics so for talking about Equity because I know there are concerns for how to get these programs within schools for the kids who do want them and what's that process look like and how are we going to make sure that if there is a need that it's going to be a focus to get those classes and those schools thank you I would like to respond from a teacher's perspective and then in the District Attorney's a couple of things that I think are important about that I think number one I think

[02:38:00]
in in line with the superintendent blakey's goals on that number five that she added where she wanted like teacher input in school and put through the Isis to inform practice at schools I think this fits really nicely in with going to the IC visiting having teachers talk about what they feel comfortable what they feel qualified in teaching producing curriculum from the ground up right and so when we talk about local control yeah I think there is District control on what we do with this discussion area Alexis but I think also on a more school to school level I do think that curriculum doesn't have to look the same at every school and and that's actually a benefit because that allows us to respond to our communities so I had how do you how do you think how do you expect to see when you're looking at Native American governments

[02:39:00]
how do you expect to do to incorporate that if you don't have a teacher that's very knowledgeable in that area again for the teachers perspective if you read the state standards I need to be teaching that anyways and so I mean we can always pull that out as a broader class if we have a community that demands the course such as that through our icy and kind of build up that class and see if somebody's offering to teach it but I do want to emphasize that a lot of our electives are kind of microscopic looks at class and curriculum standards that we already have and so I mean really for for government Civics we should be representing the Native American government classes you know governments of New Mexico in that class already so I know that doesn't really answer your question but it is there and then I think you you find if we think that's absolutely a requirement for a community we ask for Community if this is something they want

[02:40:00]
there's already a course number for it we find a teacher who wants to teach it and they build it up and they reach out to other teachers across the district to find a curriculum that they can build up with that also one of the things that we've done and tried in the past if we started holding the students who are upcoming for example with Native American literature if that was going to fulfill an English 11 credit reporting the sophomores with regard to how many of the kids might be interested in taking that and we can get a predetermined number before registration and the teacher said that her voice in the interest in wanting to learn the curriculum to line those to the standards got enthusiastic teachers that are just for getting the kids in the classroom engaged in what they want to learn so there's been mechanisms that we've been putting in place and then working with our partners at district office to put in the pathways for those

[02:41:00]
we should teach a philosophy class and so I mean we already have a process for this a little bit in terms of creating classes and we can propose that and so we build up a philosophy class from it so I mean I've been part of that ground up process and just as our students that they want to choose and align the curriculum choices with I mean you don't think teachers have the same passions a kid asked you to teach something you're going to tell him no you know what I'm saying so I think you know the the kids know that the teachers they need to go talk to will be passionate about these practices and they'll build that class for those kids and it will be awesome

[02:42:00]
one last question as well yes I'm sorry vice president Jackson Deputy superintendent Hawkins I just wanted to add that we're also modernising How We Do course requests in this District back in August 7th we presented on go3 progress monitoring and part of that doctor Blakey talked about a vision of providing horse request cards that had all of our courses on them so we took that concept and built off of it and this year we're doing a standardized course request catalog for all of our court for all of our comprehensive high schools for our core content areas 100% of our courses are going to be explained in each course catalog so that we have opportunity knowledge in

[02:43:00]
listen to really allowing students to identify courses at their school that might not have traditionally made but then really working with schools and supporting schools in providing them the resources to really try to get teachers to work with us in Champion these courses courses that I think about are traditionally some advanced placement courses that might be at one school might not make it another but we're really going to really try to modernize how we're doing that so I just want to elevate that the reimagining of 171 is not just resting with the class of 2029 but we're actually really taking a comprehensive approach and providing these opportunities in real time for our students right now so I just wanted to mention that as well tell me based on a transition plan

[02:44:00]
how are we going to cooperate these extra requirements and what is that going to look like is it going to be the freshman year of the sophomore year the junior year or the senior year as we take on the transition plan because I know we do the next steps plan but my concern is for transition plans for kids with disabilities how we incorporating that I specifically worked with our special education department really specifically as a starting point to look at horses like financial literacy so we look at students on ability Pathway to graduation there's no effect may or may not need the students needs based on the students transition plan goals okay so students on an alternative program of study based upon meeting or surpassing IEP goals and objectives with or without reasonable modification of delivery and assessment method reinforcing skills attainment

[02:45:00]
at a student's ability level which may lead to meaningful employment the IEP team designs the ability program of study to meet the students needs with IEP goals objectives and benchmarks developed to meet the most appropriate program for the student and then when we look at students on a modified Pathway to graduation there is also no effect meet students needs based on their transition plan their Career Cluster and or Independent Living goals and then last students on the standard Pathway to diploma also know about the students needs as they will have the ability to access all available courses based on their transition plan and if you feel at any time during the process of that IEP or the meeting of the transition plan and if that child is capable of taking that the financial literacy will you also provide

[02:46:00]
is that for them so that that's an opportunity absolutely okay you know she was one of the biggest advocates for financial lip gloss for that population of people specifically so I think within that demographic this provides an opportunity to for like I know that we're moving like this this is a good class for everybody to have access to it I know you know we can debate that for a long time but I think having it as an opportunity for the students to take that class I think it's okay thank you no longer going to be a requirement because that was my absolute favorite class and I think it's so important but I couldn't be more

[02:47:00]
excited about the thought of personal financial literacy being a requirement and I want to give a quick shout out to commissioner Baca and Deputy Treasurer Stover and Kern County Treasurer former state treasurer eichenberg for being here this evening very busy elected officials being here this evening to advocate for such an important change to the graduation requirements and something that treasure eichenberg and I have worked on for many years to get there when I was with Miniatures office and so we always talked about one day this is going to be a requirement one day and we didn't know if we get here so I could not be more excited and I think you all for your work on this is in a particularly you too I know it's very difficult in the work that you do and thank you all in the district for advocating for this soap what is or do you have some examples of the topics that are going to be taught in this financial literacy course never benavidez if I may just

[02:48:00]
what's the address to the New Mexico history component and then I'll defer to my colleagues in regards to the financial literacy implication that you are referenced my heart broke with yours but there's good news that the New Mexico history standards are not going away rather they are being embedded into the US History course so Connections in regards to New Mexico history can be lifted up and elevated in US history a b New Mexico history as a course could continue to be offered as an elective in a school pending student interest in that class so I just wanted to make sure that we clarified the New Mexico history piece because I think it is an important piece that we don't lose sight of New Mexico history and our state of Michigan

[02:49:00]
South board member benefits of the board a question about what this personal financial literacy course will look like it's a beginning point for what the course will look like we're leaning on our social studies experts because they know the standards of personal financial literacy to start us out again we are in a bridge or next year but to start the course out our course objectives right now for our framework are to set smart financial goals and development plans to achieve them so let me back up one second I apologize so completion of this course students will be able to set smart financial goals in development plans to achieve them make informed decisions about education career path and employment opportunities create and manage a personal budget

[02:50:00]
understand and utilize various banking services use credit responsibly and avoid debt problems understand the importance of saving and investing and identifying and managing Financial risks board member benefits I think one of the things that got hung up was I think as a social studies teacher when he says social studies teacher are aware of these standards I think it's because we felt like we were already teaching them most people don't know this and most people don't look at the New Mexico standards is a good piece of reading but if you've been teaching for 20 years you know I'm pretty well and there is already financial literacy standards in their we do a whole microeconomics unit on it it sounds like the community you know the you can't argue with the survey that was taken but I think is a social studies teacher a lot of us was just like you don't know what we do we can show you the standards we know that we teach those but I think

[02:51:00]
community in the district felt that they needed to be a more robust option for that that gets them starting to look at those issues younger I even remember you know us talking and you saying that you know kids start working sometimes when they're 15 or 16 so taking a microeconomics class when they're 17 or 18 it's already too late you know so I think that's where a lot of those ideas came from okay well thank you I'm so excited this is awesome I'm going to pop online real quick and board members do you have any questions for the committee I do thank you good evening everybody I'm glad I was able to hop on at the end and get this presentation I'm also super excited I am the chair of the student engagement at home and we were actually planning to do some engagement with students until we talked to superintendent Blakey and she was like we're already doing it

[02:52:00]
so that was great to know that you were ahead of the game for us on that and with that one of my questions is I know you all did the surveys but what other ways did you intentionally engage students to pick their desire on what they might want if I may among the stakeholders that served on the hospital 171 advisory committee were students themselves we have Albuquerque Public Schools that were part of the conversations from the get-go and I will speak with authority holders and parents as well that was one thing that I could say if there's others I just want to add to that in September the interaction with instructional councils so instructional councils have representative from various constituents

[02:53:00]
the constituent groups for instructional councils are actual students to be on the instructional council with the in addition to a parent and other various members of the school community so I just wanted to add that it wasn't just singularity in the survey but also trying to include a student voice in the various steps of the processes that we took great thank you my next question on this is we have been getting some concerns about the Health Credit being moved to 8th grade and not keeping it in 9th grade so if you can just expand a little bit more on why you think that was the best idea I know that there was also a suggestion from a teacher about potentially having an 8th grade health class and also in 9th grade health class that was more in depth for students that might need more education around like 6

[02:54:00]
play things like that so I just wanted to make sure that that was uplifted and that question was asked a board member of store members of the board I do want to talk about this in two different two two respects the first respect in our current Middle School schedule and our current Middle School student experience we are really looking at identifying ways to schedule Middle School different in doing Middle School in response to what the data is telling us but in addition to modernizing our Middle School programming for students and part of that really in this comprehensive age Bill 171 work looking at how we can give students the opportunity to earn credit while in 8th grade which then opens up the opportunity for them to take courses in aligned path

[02:55:00]
raise up their choice which will then lead to in alignment to go through for College and Career Readiness earning certifications dual credit all of those things so that's partly partly you know part of it but then this concept of students earning that credit I think about it like when a student does a dual enrollment course when they're in high school and they have access to a college course it builds confidence for students knowing that they can succeed and I believe that we're really setting students with the foundation 8th grade a little earlier for them to have that opportunity so and then the other part of it really looking at the health standards are Health standards from kindergarten through 12th grade the standards are aligned it's the benchmarks within the standards that are a little bit different but when you look at the 7th and 8th grade

[02:56:00]
is there they're the same and if that if the standards you analyze the information and in 9th grade the students apply the information so now we're going to give the opportunity for students to learn and apply that information students will also learn in 8th grade sooner life-saving skills in addition to abuse training so those students will have access to that as well members of the board if I may I also think like I don't think this was an easy decision we know that it affects employment affects licensure it affects you know articulate you know vertical articulation you know but I think when we looked at it as a committee and and you know I will say that I have very much respect to teach like one of my colleagues teaches get to health and and I know that she's very upset that it's removed from the high school requirements but I

[02:57:00]
also would like to put a reminder just like New Mexico history just because it's not a required class doesn't mean that there are opportunities if you're interested in Health and Human Services there's anatomy and physiology that you can take there's other health-based type classes that you can take if you feel like you need to take a deeper dive on that or even if you're a discussion with your parents do you think that like hey man maybe you didn't get what you needed out of middle school health there are still opportunities at the secondary high school level where we can create classes and curriculum around that as potential electives might want to take so just because it's not a required class does it mean it's a dead class I think that's really important and then I think secondly you know as the committee was you know with all the stakeholders were making this decision I would like to see students like going to school and that doesn't mean that health is not one of those thoughts I know people who love their health classes it's not an insult to hotel but I do think it's a compliment

[02:58:00]
choice so if we move like Dr Garcia was saying if we move that level down to health that gives us just one more class one more opportunity for students to have choice and to Taylor the curriculum towards their interest and I would love to know if this is going to improve graduation rates and and all that type of stuff and I think it will because there's a reason to go to school you know I think what I teach but I teach government is absolutely imperative for our students to know but I'm not full of enough to think that my students go to school to take government do you know what I'm saying and I think they're there for those electives in those things that enrich their lives and where they're they're interested in Focus are and hopefully I can get them I'd like to add something to the conversation as mentioned about our health Educators and this bridge here knowing that are currently 7th graders will be taking Health next year

[02:59:00]
what are current incoming freshmen the class of 2029 still need to take health so this will match up perfectly with personal financial literacy but the following school year those class of 2030 will not need to take health and the idea is that our personal financial literacy course rather than being a social studies credit at that point we would allow the course to be counted with a 300 license meaning that helped Educators or anyone with a high school license could teach that course and that's where our health Educators if they chose to they would easily be able to fulfill and teach that as well and that's what we will build the course out even more robustly so it's a real comprehensive plan with many nuances but we really thought hard and collaborated to try to find a path forward

[03:00:00]
to reimagine the high school experience yes I have one more and I just wanted to say I appreciate all that information that was given and having the perspective of the district and the teacher is is really helpful and I really appreciate that you have this robust team put together my last question is I know that there was a conversations around Service Learning and Capstone projects I was wondering if the district has thought about how to streamline working with Community organizations for those specific areas with when it means getting like and we'll use or having students on site and what that looks like for Community organizations that might be helping with that service learning and capstone's so board member of store got members of the board we're constantly working to create a business Partnerships

[03:01:00]
expanding our work-based learning and our internship program we've been able to really move that forward and I think that what we explained earlier in the presentation is that if tonight's just the very beginning this is really the first step this is going to be a 4-year project that we work overtime and it's not going to be done in isolation our plan is to work with schools and their instructional councils starting now like we've been with starting this spring and then this work will continue through May of 202829 so that we ensure that we're building the courses over time but then also insurance that we do create robust Partnerships for service learning and all of those horses like we both have a task force so District

[03:02:00]
play goodbye and Tanya kunai who ran like what building Capstone classes out like what should it look like what are the goals what are the project aims and that's already kind of written out and and put together so we do have a framework for those type of systems to create these type of structures to support student learning and you know sometimes old ideas and new idea you know so we can bring that back forward and we can figure out how to use that perfect thank you so much yes I do and I just want to reiterate thank you for for this work but particularly thank you for working with community and students and I'd like to know a little bit more about community and students and what what representation so

[03:03:00]
what aspect of your recommendation is informed by students those students least engaged and in particular Martinez and yassi and African-American students and Hispanic even though I mean I'm referencing the language I don't think people realize that Hispanics are never named in either lawsuit so yeah I'd like to hear more about who is represented in the conversation and that doesn't diminish you know anything that you said so far but I think we need to be aware of who remains to be engaged members of the board I know

[03:04:00]
there's not demographic data aligned to responses within the survey but in the process we tried to work with as many students as we could to elevate choice but in addition like I had mentioned this is the starting point and with us working with schools and through their instructional councils for the next 4 years that's where the real I believe magic is going to happen and elevating student Choice when I talk to a little while ago about our course catalogs and how are elevating opportunity knowledge and allowing students to really have an opportunity to to make course selections aligned to their post-secondary goals that's another way we're going to elevate student choice and engagement in the choices they take but really schools will work with their unique communities and Elevate the needs and the the

[03:05:00]
desires of both families and students in alignment to the courses that we build out for the next 4 years and I think member Dominguez I think the 1.5 elective credit request is indicative of our commitment to have a comprehensive approach and I think not the alignment to go 3 which does take into consideration the diverse needs of our high school students and I'm thinking specifically I'm going to give one example but there's others is the attainment in the monitoring that we do around the name Seal that's one example of how we are putting our forward as a district to say we are committed to making sure that we have a culturally culturally linguistically responsive portfolio of options for our students who take advantage is 1.5 Credit in the discretionary unit the elective side also gives room

[03:06:00]
schools on an individual basis to basically look and say who is attending my school what are the course requests saying from our students and then based on that data how do we change our approach to really thinking differently and I think this Bill calls us to action in terms of you know if maybe the data at Albuquerque High is saying that students at that school are asking for a Native American studies class but down the road at Highland the numbers are smaller how do we how do we think differently about transporting those kids at Highland Albuquerque High to get that class or an upper level Calculus class to make sure that every student has access to curriculum that they're looking to achieve won't be how do we think differently as we're really

[03:07:00]
play letting the data drive us to really not just do the bare minimum as we're looking at HB 171 but really using it as a call to action to really think about our systems our approach what we're offering and how we can to get them get the most out of the biggest bank for our buck so to speak and really using this opportunity to truly transform beyond the bare minimum of what the bill calls us to so before you handle the mic over cuz I want to hear what you have to say on that topic you mentioned several of the course catalog cards but how quickly can a classmate like how quickly can we create those

[03:08:00]
classes is it right away remember Dominguez I think the first thing is getting the data is to to see what it is our students are asking for once we see that we'll look at it District wide will look at it by school and we'll have conversations with our teaching and learning on Department of Transportation Department how can we really look and say you know what we may be able to do a couple of things next year in terms of taking a step but really the data is going to drive us over time in really realizing the true potential of HB 171 over the next four years thank you is to respond to your original question I think you're right I don't think the student voice has been diverse enough student voice has been hurting but honestly we have to be honest about it schools pick the kids

[03:09:00]
and that doesn't represent the entire School population but it's a start and I think that the idea of creating diverse course options for students we had diversity in mind when we were making the ideas or creating the ideas that students would have so much choice so that if you're more in a vocational route and you know we have CTE we can line up classes so that you can track it to at the very minimum maybe hopefully build into where they can seek out a couple of vocational opportunities and follow that up you know and and for those people who think they're more you know college career Readiness start focusing on those types of classes when within it so I think we try to keep a white perspective on what would students need to be interested in high school so there was a definite focus on a diverse population and the diverse population that exists in APS so that they so that all students have a class they can they can they can

[03:10:00]
attached to but if you're talking about student voice it's limited and I think maybe you know like we have said this is probably at least a 4-year process of not more that may be part of our growth together as we start building out these courses is it's not just the Senate kids there's nothing wrong with the Senate kid they need to be her too but you know it's not just them you know and and how do you incorporate all of those different voices I mean one of the things about participating in a in a committee like this is you got to be motivated to even be part of it and so if you're one of these kids that already feel disenfranchised by the education system it's going to be hard to get you to come to this committee so I think what we're trying to do is create a situation where those kids wouldn't feel this in franchised first and then we can hook them into a program of maybe they would be willing to share their voice as we start to build this over the next four years and you're getting to exactly what I'm thinking is that

[03:11:00]
but they're engaged the kids who aren't engaged and I'm thinking back to the presentation that this board heard from the young men who and I think they were mostly young men at West Mesa who were part of the VIP the violence in program that that is what we need to recreate because you could just see them kind of grow into this new identity it was happening before my eyes and so I think it's just requires stepping out of our comfort level and and going to the kids that have been have been the you know troublemakers engage them

[03:12:00]
as we talked about growing together as a community I want to elevate some of the work that Dr Salazar's doing specifically with a student advisory Council and the principal advisory Council that have recently taken shape and were working with students in a different way to elevate just not one voice but I'll be certain to partner with Dr Salazar and these systems that were building out to ensure that we do get a wide range of voice in that and I mean own my own words as board member you know I'm having a community engagement event and I believe board member benefits will be at on Yahoo mail

[03:13:00]
reach out to that Community some way somehow and and so I want you to know that even though I'm asking this of you all I recognize that I have to walk that talk so thank you and did you have something to offer okay and I think one more time question mark

[03:14:00]
we need to teach history here not from pilgrims coming here but from us we were here and then there was an encounter so it's from here to there and this isn't I think it's an opportunity if there is New Mexico history as US history so it'll be okay for those of you are going to miss you New Mexico history as a class I think there's great potential to like really break out of a word as a social studies teacher and being really defensive

[03:15:00]
I think it's really hard for us honestly to say goodbye to a to a history class that was off in the first one level that was clearly a history class but also a cultural class and and and and and and take on class like Financial personal financial classes I didn't think I was going to teach Financial lit in social studies I thought I was going to teach history so I think I hear that but I do think that there are opportunities here and I think it's worth a reminder I'm sure you'll know this but I mean it's still a long class at the 7th grade level right so I mean kids are being exposed to the culture they're being exposed to the stories and really the New Mexico history standards nobody ever actually taught this in high school they talked to the standards but they would go away far back and bring it up the modern day but our high school standards actually started statehood so it's it's just a little over 100 years if we were to really teach that class it would be the way that the

[03:16:00]
of the communities that existed in New Mexico which is why every teacher in New Mexico history went way back and did you know the native history all the way up but I agree with you I think that if you know it wasn't just the Spanish either it's the Spanish it's the French it's the English it's the Native American population that were all here and and I think encounters the right word when they started to encounter each other what happened and you know it's a paradigm shift but it's not a it's not an impossible one and I think it's an exciting opportunity any other questions I'm happy happy about financial literacy I see the potential for teaching 15 year olds how to check their pay stubs to make sure that they're not being cheated on their hours worked and and understanding Medicare and all that stuff

[03:17:00]
okay so I'm just going to quickly ask my questions so I sent in a huge long list of very specific questions is that regards to the Health Credit I do not expect that you are going to answer those questions for me tonight especially because we're kind of button up against some time but I do really hope that I can get answers to all of those very specific questions that were sent in the reason being is that I do recognize that this is an approval for high school graduation requirements and so the focus of this the task force the request that you're bringing to us HB 171 is very focused on high school I think the ramifications that I am receiving from some of my constituents is that Middle School got lost in the shuffle particularly as it relates to this one Health Credit and that maybe some of the decisions that were made

[03:18:00]
are causing ramifications of upon not only upon the the teachers and the staff within the middle school but very particularly about those 7th grade students who next year might be missing out on that like one elective that they were just really hoping that they were going to get you know they've been waiting to take Spanish and now they might not be able to so if you have a quick answer to that particular question I would appreciate it and I will I'm absolutely in favor of this motion right absolutely we want personal literacy I think that that is fantastic that we have listened to the community on that and I do really really appreciate to your point there's choice now we have one and a half credits of choice so that the students no matter what their interested in will now have an opportunity to explore and I will hardly agree with that I'm just concerned about the ramifications that it's going to have on middle school so if you

[03:19:00]
have a super quick answer to that and then we can follow up after this I would appreciate it vice president Jackson members of the board so that is a concern of ours and also knowing that we have this bridge into getting in in a in a comprehensive plan but thinking about our current 7th grade students in next year and being part of that bridge we will do we're really looking at what possibilities exist to try to be creative to provide an experience for 8th grade students next year so we'll be working closely with our new executive director of middle school learning who has a robust knowledge of master schedule building to see what options there are and we will work with schools and trying to find ways to to Really support our students in their choice I know

[03:20:00]
this doesn't make it any better but the students will then be provided an additional elective when they get to high school but this this Bridger it won't be forever it will be for this one class but we will exhaust all potential ideas of ways to find solutions to it Dr Gonzalez knows that I like to do this so I'm going to repeat back to you what I'm hearing what you are saying to our community to our constituents to our families is that if they have a concern about how this is affecting their child and their potential for their electives you are promising me bored me that you will work with the families to make sure that that their needs are met so we will provide

[03:21:00]
Solutions I can't in front of the in good faith right now promise it every single situation could be accounted for but I have some general ideas of how to work with individual students specifically thinking about this Health Credit could we offer the possibility to do a zero hour after school could we do there's you know for those kids that want to do bad or some of those other things like how do we think outside the box and as much as I want to promise that we're going to be able to deliver for every kid this is a bridge year there is going to be growing pains but what I can commit to you right now and to the community is that we will do our absolute best to exhaust all potential possibilities or opportunities to do this in a different way we've traditionally

[03:22:00]
I'm stuck in doing things the way we've always done it this is actually going to force our hand in doing the Middle School scheduling and looking at the middle school experience a lot different so I just as much as it's going to be challenging growth it is going to move us forward in many different ways I just want to say that thank you okay I am sure that we've all had our questions answered if there aren't any questions just want to make one statement but you go ahead you know I was going to call the vote okay let me just make one okay go ahead let's be real short and as you're talking about this is for Choice personal choice for our kids and our students it just want to make sure that her child with a disability choice is not inclusion and also we can't take

[03:23:00]
always supports if we're requiring children to make especially children with disabilities we can't take away supports we have to keep those things so that they can make that choice I just want to reiterate that inclusion is not the same thing okay that's all I needed to say thank you okay so with that I am going to call the vote Dr Albright may have a roll call vote please on the motion as it stands on the floor yes yes yes yes yes motion passes thank you so much appreciate it all right so we will move on our next item is to consider approval of the grand budget adjustments for the following funds are presenter is not Apodaca Chief Financial Officer and Rose
