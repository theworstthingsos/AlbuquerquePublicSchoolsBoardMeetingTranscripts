[00:07:00]
free benefits contracts and supplies and I know was this just extra time that was paid for since it wasn't any FTE so was that just like extra time or mostly was at supplies board member Miller Oregon this is considered on the liquidated so it is basically the tail and expiring in 5 days we are trying to obtain late budget for it and if we are successful in obtaining late budget for it we will look for existing expenses in salary and benefits and move them against that budget in order to ensure that we spend the most that we can we usually it's a standard operation procedure in most grants to if the grand allows for it so we can try to make the most of everything

[00:08:00]
okay thank you thank you any other additional questions and I'll move for approval of the grant budget adjustments for the following funds as mentioned call second Yolanda thank you dot next time is the approval of September 2023 winter function transfers for budget and Miss Mary you continue to have the floor thank you madam chairman of the board presenting for consideration for the month of September 20th 2023 I did not see anything out of the ordinary and I stand for questions right thank you do we have any questions I have a follower okay so I know that the five

[00:09:00]
the 5.6 million is going to be used for reconstruction updates at cochiti correct that is correct okay and so then the cost yet we still don't know what the costs are going to be for for duranes so we're just in the very beginning stages of that as I understand is that correct that was my understanding okay okay and so I mean when I was looking at this and we were using I think it was it was it I wish I could remember was it called the it was under SEL and I saw the explanation there and I just wanted to just say I just

[00:10:00]
it kind of is a little bit upsetting to me that our current students that we know are suffering through a lot of social emotional problems and we all know that that they that money wasn't used to really help those current students and I just wanted to just say that just makes me kind of upset about that though I do understand those funds can be used for you know these kind of improvements I just think that when I'm looking at her some of our funds are being spent and I know we're under a time constraint to do it I just wish we could have spent it on our current students that are really suffering so I'm not the budgeting committee but based on analyzing the SR funding throughout our allocating and spending it down I know that the district prioritized directing to

[00:11:00]
to the students and based on service availability so provider availability to to us they prioritize training to provide our teachers and staff tools to support our student population throughout it and this the construction and investment in the ongoing in ongoing projects is basically the third area in which we looked at based on directional received and training received from the public education department and I can also reference we were encouraged to look at investment now to to the words long term and this is what this funding was was

[00:12:00]
I understand that and I just wish it was just directed exactly at our kids now so thank you and I remember Peterson yeah I was just going to say I mean obviously our first choice would be to have more counselors smaller classrooms and all those things but we have a huge Workforce issue and I think it's important for the community to understand that that we make choices right now based on architecture with our Workforce and and since the money isn't recurring we've always had the concern about hiring people that we could not continue to employ into the future so I think it's important for the community to understand why we make these decisions with the funds thank you

[00:13:00]
any other questions if not I'll ask for a motion I'll move for approval of the September 2023 inner function transfers for Grant budget well second Yolanda thank you ok Google is the approval of September 2023 intro function transfers for Grand budget thank you for your consideration for the month of September 2023 I did not see anything out of the ordinary

[00:14:00]
thank you do we have any questions Associated to this I do go ahead so I know that the question was answered about the 500,000 that was going to go to communication services and you still didn't really know that was going to be moved to communication and you still didn't and you still don't have an idea exactly what that might be used for and these were also are right for this particular funding it is fun for promoting initiative such as emergency stronger the search for a new Sprint and other communication needs and products identified by District leadership and then

[00:15:00]
the other one that I was looking at was about some of the professional development that was being used and we had a big list of that so my question is some of that was for the training for Odell for the new materials for ELA and I just want to know those materials were supposed to be in every school for the 23 24 school year and as I've been told by schools those materials many have still not been made available yet they are having the PD so if those materials were supposed to be available for the teachers to use this school year and it's almost November and they still don't have everything yet they're going to receive the training and I'm just wondering how you get a PD training if you don't even have the materials to use so if somebody could help me with that I could

[00:16:00]
if I could get a list of everyone that thinks they're missing materials and what they're missing I can look into that and make sure that everyone has their materials the bulk of the materials should be at schools by this point and if someone doesn't have their materials please let me know so I can get them their materials and I think that I know why that's kind of difficult to is that all the teachers would know that they didn't have the materials the principles might not all know they don't have the materials right and so I think and I don't know if there's a way to do this is to get word out to those teachers because some of the principles don't even know that they don't have the materials but I know that there's some training coming up I believe on the 7th there's going to be that Odell training I don't know if it's everywhere but I know what some schools I've been told they are having it then board member on if you're hearing that there are a few things

[00:17:00]
I can tell the Librarians please check in with your teachers I have a very uncommon name in New Mexico and anyone could just email me directly I just want to figure out how to make sure that those teachers that don't have it and principles might be unaware I just want to know whatever it is they can do if there's somehow that we can I know we don't have the superintendent here but if somebody's listening is trying to make sure to get that out there because it is November and they can't be teaching it even though they're supposed to be if they don't have everything there are a lot of materials and it is a lot for them to absorb and a lot to deliver and you know to to sort through so there are several logistical things that but we can look into it if we know the specifics and figure out what exactly is going on at each school okay and then I know what that PD then this was extra that you had to on top of the materials then you also

[00:18:00]
this extra cost to for the PD to be provided correct correct increasingly that is a standard model that we're seeing if we want the kind of in-depth really high quality professional development that will change adult behaviors we don't we don't want to just do the the kind of professional development that won't and unfortunately like everything else it does cost money I wish more things were free no it's good I mean you should have good professional development so I think that's that's important thank you thank you any other questions I'll move for approval of the temperature 2023 function transfers of all non categorical funds call second this is Courtney so I'll consider approval of September 2023 intro function transfers to for Grant budget I went down

[00:19:00]
the approval of September 2023 interfacing transfers for all non categorical funds and we have Miss Julianne Hicks our senior director of budget strategic planning you have the floor man thank you this agenda item requests your approval of 8:00 in a function budget transfers 3 are using at risk budgets One is using the bilingual budget at school and the remaining four are using the General Ed budgets you've got the justifications in front of you can answer any questions on these thank you any additional questions that have not been asked

[00:20:00]
I guess I'll do it consider approval of the September 2023 enter function transfers for all non categorical funds I'm on the right one thank you Google is the approval of September 2023 in Trump function transfers for all non categorical funds and mistakes thank you madam chairman I apologize I didn't do my protocol on intro function transfers from September we answered an initial question about the

[00:21:00]
71234 4th one for 7.88% sure that there weren't any follow-up questions on that one thank you any additional questions related to this item Barbara says nobody else okay I'll ask for approval thank you for approval of the September 2023 thank you dot yes so our next item for consideration in action is the approval of gifts grants and donations for more than 5,000 and Mr Turnbull I will turn it over to you sir Madam chairman of the board

[00:22:00]
did you an item is for consideration approval for some donations first donation is 5,000 to a Sooner Elementary from the Sunnah Elementary PTA 2nd donation is for 16600 that's why Jackson Elementary School from the Sy Jackson Elementary School PTA I stand for questions I just want to give a shout out to the ptas and all that they do to help the schools that is absolutely incredible and I'm so glad that are there to help and if there are no further questions of more than 5000 for $5,201 elementary school and 16,600 to Sy Jackson Elementary School

[00:23:00]
call seconds Yolanda thank you Dr Albert remember yes yes yes yes Crystal for consideration and action is the approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service this is for June 1st to the 30th 2023 this is for Salvage and technology and Mr Turnbull I'll turn it back over to you thank you very much and this is consideration of statements of equipment to be taken out of service do we have any questions

[00:24:00]
the missing assets over 2 years so the last time that we received a missing assets list was back in 2018 I believe is that correct Mr Turnbull that's the last time I remember us getting one because then it's like 2 years then the pandemic happened so that would have been 2020 and then it seems like everything just kind of there was a pause so then we are waiting till like as I understand that there was an uninterrupted years so that would have been everybody kind of went back to school and the 20 203 212 222 and 22 203 so that means that's been two full years so we should be getting one of these lists this year soon shouldn't we correct okay so about should be happening

[00:25:00]
I mean it's almost November so who are the chances that it might not happen in 2023 what I would recommend Port Muller board member mulatto go on is that the finance chair can and with the ad hoc committee we can take a look at that and sort of decide or work on some recommendations for schedule for that so we can make sure that it's it's up to date but it seems like we do have a nod and assurance that yes it's going to come but I think if we could just have the the committee chair and the ad hoc Committee just as we're working with that group get really clear on a schedule for that that would be it's been it's been like five years and then as it concerns like the unaccounted for devices so we also

[00:26:00]
did this accounted unaccounted for device list right and so all that information is yet to be compiled as well dot I mean that's what the answer to the question was so is there a reason that it's taking a little bit longer to like if you have a library book or a textbook or an instrument you know we sign them and the students are responsible for returning them so it's very very much in the same type of category

[00:27:00]
you do look at each Case by case to make sure that we follow our process and so can this list so it said that you are still working on compiling all the information from the last seven years is there a reason that we're having to look for the last 7 years what happened there board member and I'm sure as you know we did have a turnover in that department so we are looking at what has been completed and what hasn't been completed and unfortunately some of you know the management processes so we're catching all of that up and we will be bringing it to the board period

[00:28:00]
glad you're working on it so then another question is there they have and I was told that whenever a device is unaccounted for that it is it is disabled as soon as you know it's on account at 4:00 but if you don't have the unaccounted for list does that mean a whole bunch of those devices are still working if they don't know who has an account on accounted for device with those be the ones that are still not disabled management give some information on technology process okay so the only time I was actually disabled on the backend system is if

[00:29:00]
report have been generated by the school site and I can tell you as of 10:25 2022 to today which is a year 258 lost on police reports for generated by School staff and that included $680 devices because there's some of the police reports included multiple devices okay so then we're just leaving that all those devices have been disabled that should have been disabled them this is I talked to some Capital services staff members today and they were provided some preliminary numbers I know that Mark seems to continue to work on these numbers but when they initially started the large scale audit there was a lot that was considered missing which just meant it it wasn't there was an audit done at the school site but through the additional you know

[00:30:00]
play The Legends at the school sites of scanning along with their large-scale audits the number that I'm looking at right now is what my notes 12,16 5 missing which just means it has not been scanned but again this is this is capital fiscal Services process and I am part of the technology department but that is how I understand it so we have devices that are missing missing status for it's just it's still needs to be scanned and go through the process which will eventually lower the number that you just reported on correct and capital fiscal Services is out doing audience as we speak today but again I don't want to speak for Mark's Department I just I know that I had that information because I spoke to them earlier so

[00:31:00]
just some of the devices then weren't scanned and assigned into tip web then is that that is at the school level that at some of those schools that that's what happened the way I understand it that's correct okay so I make sure I have all my questions answered and how are we doing about making sure that the process for getting them scanned into tip web is getting better is there a process that we're using that will make it better than us having 12,165 devices I don't know Mr Turnbull if you know we continue to provide training to these schools yearly to emphasize the use of their assets and provide any training needed

[00:32:00]
the several trainings we have at the beginning of the year we focused on that because ultimately they have custody of that those assets so we and anytime we we provide the special are inventory team is very good at providing whatever support they can to the school to help track those and and help them understand the importance of tip Webb and keeping track of their assets and I think in addition to this similar to what president said we can work with the team to really tighten up the measures that we've had because obviously we've had a different people come in and out the turnover new systems put in place even throughout the pandemic and to just to ensure that we are just more accountable for these devices yes and we'll have that total like that we should have that hopefully not too far in the future

[00:33:00]
and then we'll have an idea about the cost of the ones that are truly we find that are truly missing cuz I think it's like probably not it's obviously not going to be $12,165 so we'll get those numbers as well and with the cost of the missing assets right as well missing devices yes okay and then the last I think the last question that I have about this I mean I know that the responsibility is at the school level to determine who didn't who didn't return their devices so that isn't on on any Department here that really is at the school level for them to know who should have those devices it really has to do with care custody and control so if you think about it you know perhaps at the beginning it could be the technology department who has haircut

[00:34:00]
City and control and then they assign it to the school so at that point it could be somebody at the school who has care custody and control and then it goes to the student and then at that time it's on the student and they have the care cuz it in control so it's really all of us you know it's it's the school its technology its parents its students all of us to protect the assets so then like Miss Papa John's so as I remember it was like the end I just remember Dr Bowman saying this the last week of school or a couple of weeks before school was out they were going to be in a thing during the pandemic they were going to have the last week or two collect all the devices right and then what's what's the next step after that is that when they would get once they were collected is that when they would get standing to tip web also to

[00:35:00]
I just want to know what the process was for that Josh can you help with that with the with the processes yeah of course we gave instructions to the schools provided training on how to quick collect the devices to the school site and then they also had clear directions on how to issue the students a device when they started the new school year okay and then so I guess that that works for the kids that are still in the school if they move to another school I'm sure there's kind of maybe a different process there and for any seniors there was you can answer this question did any school staff allow graduating seniors to keep their Chromebooks so we did hear rumors of that that was kind of mid pandemic so probably about two years ago we didn't see any real evidence on speaking from the technology

[00:36:00]
on a large scale because that would have definitely been on our radar it would have been something that we definitely would have shut down and it would have definitely been something that we would have escalated up to senior leadership it's just it's just a rumor that can now be put to rest I believe so that's that's our perspective thank you we need to be at the board level on this conversation is really to understand you know what what kind of Abandonment did we have to do because was there a loss of staff was there a loss of resource to be able to do this job really well right so I think we need to take into account because we may have moved resources to support classroom instruction or to move something else and so there was

[00:37:00]
stop and so as a result we just can't get to the completion at the way that it is there's no shame or blame in all of this but I think it just has us going back to look at the way that resources are aligned so that we can actually because what I'm hearing is it's cascading it goes down to the school level and I always worry about it at the school level in terms of another ask of what they need to do did they lose staff did we lose something because we moved it somewhere else so that we could resource this thing so I so I think for us as a school board those are the kinds of things that we need to look at and we can probably get to Once Miss Apodaca and the team tells us with you know the resources what happened and we have a better idea of where we are I think it's really looking at was there a shift in resources to be able to make this work well and again it's just like those operational decisions that sometimes are difficult that has to be made because we're realigning money to meet other needs and other demand

[00:38:00]
but we've got this much of a resource and so I think as we're working with that ad hoc group we could probably look at that as well and see if this was an area where you know things got fell through the Gap because there was also a cut and a resource somewhere thank you any other additional questions related to this if not I will ask for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service for June 1st through the 30th for 2023 thank you our next item for consideration and action is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals are

[00:39:00]
250,000 this is for annual renewal of global positioning equipment and service and miss kensler you have the floor thank you so much I'm asking for consideration for the approval for the purchase of the annual renewal of global positioning equipment service this is procured through a CS contract the total purchase will be 444,000 80.00 and 54 cents and it's using Transportation Enterprise funds with that I'm happy to answer questions thank you any questions if not I'll ask for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars and you'll renewal of global positioning equipment and service a second this is Courtney thank you dot yes yes

[00:40:00]
yes yes Google yes our next item for consideration and action is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds $250,000 this is for a refresh of computer devices and Miss Gensler I will turn it back over to you thank you madam chair members of the board I'm asking for consideration for the approval of the purchase of the refresh of computer devices this is utilizing a Statewide price agreement as well as a cooperative and education services agreement the estimated total purchase will be two 12.6 million dollars and it's utilizing Capital funds that I'm happy to answer questions thank you any questions no further questions I'll ask for approval and move to approve the district purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for refresh of computer devices

[00:41:00]
Daniel Gonzalez yes Robert Peterson yes Brittany Jackson yes our next item for consideration and action is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds $250,000 this is for occupational and physical therapy services as needed and you may continue to have the floor thank you madam chair members of the board I'm requesting consideration for the approval for the purchase of occupational and physical therapy services as needed it was utilizing and RFP way issued the estimated cost is 2.1 million for 4 year contract utilizing both Federal and operational funds with that I'm happy to answer questions thank you any questions or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars or occupational and physical therapy services as needed a second this is Courtney thank you Dr Al

[00:42:00]
Yolanda Montoya Cordova Aragon yes and no Gonzalez yes Barbara Peterson yes Courtney Jackson yes Crystal next time for consideration and is the approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds $250,000 this is for marketing Services as needed in Wisconsin you have the floor thank you madam chair members of the board requesting consideration and approval for the purchase of marketing Services as needed this was utilizing and RFP we issued as the procurement method the estimated purchase for the four-year contract is 1 million dollars utilizing federal capital and operational funds with that I'm happy to answer questions thank you for the questions I just have a quick one so it'll be about 330,000 a year then about is it a form for

[00:43:00]
your contract right so about that about that much depending on what is needed yes I believe there are federal funds that may need to be utilized sooner but yes for the overall for your contract okay do you have an idea on what I know some of this was coming from Esther funds do you have an idea about how much of that million dollars was coming from Master friends because those were obviously have to be spent sooner than the others so I believe 700,000 for this fiscal year is going to be utilizing both and then the other 300,000 for 24 327 so it is front-loaded for the Esser funds okay so the 700,000 is equal between Sr and capital I don't know that the number is actually equal it's a mixture of the funds I could get you further information if you wanted

[00:44:00]
okay and I mean I don't know that you would know this answer or not but when we're using again we're using Esser funds on things that are not going directly into the classroom this is for marketing and I saw all the good things that we can do with that and our school system is you know where we have a great we have a lot of really great schools and fabulous kids and we need to highlight that and tell our story better and I understand that marketing is going to be good for that and it's going to be used for a lot of that but my concern again is that we have a lot of kids suffering a lot right now and that that money could have been directed more toward them and I'm just wondering why we didn't do that was it just difficult because of what member Peterson said a lot because we didn't maybe have the Personnel to meet some of the kids needs is that a big part of it and this

[00:45:00]
what is obviously you know outside with people that are going to be providing these Services I just don't know what the answer is and I have to answer to people about that so I understood I would probably prefer I would like to defer to both Monica or menta or casino because we tend to focus on the procurement method calling all the legality and not determining the need so I believe they are both available online and I think before here's one thing that I like my perspective when it comes to marketing is we've always talked about how we get our message out you know in terms of student outcomes what we're doing is aboard the shifts that we made whether it's with you know digital advertisement Billboards social media you know there's different ways that we have to be able to talk about with families and with our constituents what we are doing that is making the the steps going forward you know so I do see that it might not be like a direct imp

[00:46:00]
in terms of what that's maybe associated with learning loss but really trying our best to bridge that gap of communication because we said that was one of our downfalls and additionally when even talking about all the good things that are happening with APS that's why we we continue to build our enrollment how we can actually retain our students when we're talking about what APS is doing right versus always hearing about what's doing wrong so my two cents but miss our menta you can take you and others thank you for this opportunity there is a more direct benefit to students and I think that the word marketing is a bit of a difficult word it's a misinterpretation maybe we're really talking about communication services so Albuquerque Public Schools is you know has limited resources and limited staff we do a fairly good job I believe of getting the word out to the

[00:47:00]
yes Community but we have never had a marketing budget to go outside the aps bubble so when we have our job fairs and it's critical for us to find bus drivers special education teachers bilingual teachers we have to have a way to bring the public in to know about these opportunities and to get them into our classrooms we do need to step up some of our marketing as Charters have been so successful in doing we have exhausted pretty much all of our organic means of communicating and marketing in the district you're very familiar with the Clear Channel outdoor initiative that we put in place maybe 15 16 years ago when you drive around town you see Charters advertising on billboards they're paying for that space Albuquerque Public Schools is not that is part of the agreement that we have with them we have recently used some of the yesterday

[00:48:00]
ways to boost buys on social media so that again we can extend our reach and try and make sure that everyone out there has information that's critical we're talking about things like the Strategic plan emerging stronger bringing people into Community meetings next week will be focused on inviting the public in to help us pick our next superintendent we have to have a venue to inform people and engage them we also do a tremendous amount of work with all of our departments like the foundation making sure that they have videos for selfless seniors and the gold bar pretty much everything you see daily everything you see that's on the web that's in the news on billboards on social media it's one of a handful of people who have made sure that that messaging is available but we are limited in our reach and from what I've understood and all the years

[00:49:00]
I've been with Albuquerque Public Schools it is a deep desire to make sure that the public has a better understanding of the successes as well as the challenges of Albuquerque Public Schools and that's where these dollars are going to make sure that we can continue to build opportunities for the students know and scholarships are available that were able to help the City of Albuquerque when they want to do a supply drive with APS when school starts to help fill the food pantries at the McKinney Texas we're doing right now every last effort not to mention elevating and celebrating teachers and coaches and counselors and schools going all the way to you know Washington DC next month to be awarded a blue ribbon and every last one of those initiatives requires communication and that is where the

[00:50:00]
funds that are assigned to the Communications office will be used as well as to support efforts like advertising for the school choice Fair Mr can talk about some of the initiatives he has and other things like printing posters for emerging stronger and buying the frame so that they can be hung in schools without this resource we don't have the ability to do that and so this will just help because your department I know is so small you know they're and I know you just don't have the budget that you need to do this so this will really be helpful to you to get the word about out about our great schools and the great things that are happening so I mean that's how I'm taking what you're saying yes for but also to make sure that parents have critical critical information such as when we change the bell schedule and the calendar changed when we

[00:51:00]
