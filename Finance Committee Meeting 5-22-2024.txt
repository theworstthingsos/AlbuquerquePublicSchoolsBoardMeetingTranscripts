[00:07:00]
District it sits with an MVD and once the calculation is complete and the awards are communicated usually we if they don't go directly to the schools we do a district-wide communication letting them know that we are to receive that particular award and then we identify the program within the district who will be handling the monitoring and implementation and in between them both on the finance and program side to build their application based on which they may start spending and we can get for budget and obtain budget authority to align with requirements thank you

[00:08:00]
how much and do we know how many schools this year are losing or have decreased funding not including the SR funds in specific funds we can complete analysis and provide you with an answer are you looking for a specific funding I just wanted like a general if you have like a number of how many schools are actually losing funding this year and if you have if there's anything available to tell us what is the highest amount of school is losing funding like a percentage wise I do not have that because at this point in time a lot of the brands are projected we do not have the actual amount that will be awarded and available as a 71 for most of the schools I can complete analysis

[00:21:00]
great thank you so much members of the committee do we have any questions yeah I just have a quick question so are you are you asking us to approve just the one your contract or a four-year contract it's actually renette did you want him to speak to them sure for 4 years the reason we put the first year is because the Cooperative contract were using is only for this first year however we always make sure we have a proper procurement method in the future so if you know and we renew her I was going to make sure we have a proper picture Okay so that the the amount that you're so you're asking us to approve if for your term but only the first year is the 7266

[00:22:00]
on the number of students and then what professional development we do ask for so we could bring this back to the board in the future for those additional years I mean I would feel more comfortable I guess I'm uncomfortable approving something that's four years if I only know what the first year cost is going to be so I mean I would be comfortable approving this first year and then with the second third and fourth year I would ask that it be brought back before the board just to approve that amount we could do that okay that's just me I don't know if the rest of the committee

[00:23:00]
do you have any thoughts on this whether one year or the four year I agree with the board member Jackson for this year and then approve the following year separately okay I just want to make sure it is there any do we have to make any changes to this since it's I think that's where my confusion came in because it's asking for approval of a 4-year term but the amount is for a one year contract so this is finance so I would think that we would be able to one year

[00:24:00]
in the past we have brought a contracts to the board with an estimated of what the four-year would look like so we could either do one do the one year and or do second we could do the one year with the estimated of the 4 year and then if it goes above that estimate we always bring it back to the board because her the directive you have like a 250,000 threshold so if we are above that estimate we can come back to the board but I guess where the confusion is we're already over the estimate because it's at 7 for one year and you're saying if we go over the 500 for years

[00:25:00]
so if you approved a $700,000 and then the and then we had an estimate and that estimate in the future came in over what you approved we always come back to the board for additional approval okay I'm understanding now so I don't know if you got that message board member Jackson so this is the estimated amount for that they're proposing for years one through four the first year we have a set amount it's going to be if it does end up going outside of the estimated then they'll bring it back to us if not this is the estimated for each year yeah but the 726,000 is the estimate for 40 years now 700 for year 1700 for your two 700 years 3 and so on and if it changes then they'll bring it back to us

[00:26:00]
four additional approval but this is what the estimate is okay so period there is a the estimate is it would it would be estimated 726,000 dollars each year for four years yes okay okay maybe next time let's write it like that next time in the in the documents but then yes then I'm okay with approving a four-year assuming the estimate is 726,000 for each Year's contracts will come back to the board to report that overage the overage okay

[00:27:00]
okay all right thank you for that clarification okay so thank you so board member benavidez and astorga I just wanted to verify if you're okay now approving the four-year contract yes thank you okay perfect thank you for that clarification Miss Apodaca okay do we have any additional questions on this before I continue great I don't see any so let's continue on so our next item will be for online tutoring support and enrichment from paper MRSA I'll turn this back over to you thank you madam chair members of the board acting in superintendent Dr Blakey requesting consideration and approval for the purchase of online tutoring support and enrichment the company is paper the first year subscription is utilizing a tips contract again this is 44 year contract the first year annually is at one point two million but we are asking for

[00:28:00]
Warrior similar to the previous request and this first year is utilizing a tips cooperative and federal and capital A mixture of federal and capital funds happy to answer any questions thank you I will open it up to the members of the committee for this question yep board member Jackson I don't think this is this might be more for Dr Blakey are we are we tracking usage and has usage gone up as far as concerned 1.2 million annually is a lot and if it's so special if it's not being utilized do we know what utilities is thank you for member Jackson Gonzalez are you on to answer that question good morning Cherokee Jackson I'm joined this morning by

[00:29:00]
voice Gormley who will have specific answers regarding usage I do know that we track it I do know that we have been keeping tabs on the usage working on rolling up professional development for staff to utilize the instrument effectively I know that work is ongoing and there is a plan for that but to your specific question regarding numbers from the beginning of the project to date I would defer to miss warmly who can speak more able to ask question good morning Madam chairman of the board superintendent we have a administrative portal where we can track usage from student usage and what students are using we have seen a significant increase from January to May in the number of tutoring sessions mathematicians each product has greatly increased our the reading portion the new reading program that they have

[00:30:00]
has made a significant increase and we've had 2,500 students access that reading program so yes we do get to track and we have seen a significant or after school usage has also increased when we first started the consent we were only getting an average of about 7 students and accessing the the tutoring program outside of the school hours and we're now up to about an average of 45 students utilizing well well that's not nearly what it should be for the 22,000 families that signed consent there is a correlation between increase during the day and increase of use after school so as a student get comfortable with the platform and find its how it supports their learning and teachers experience the same we expect that after school to increase as well

[00:31:00]
did you guys think it is a good tool to have in your toolbox board member Jackson I think that the products that they have continued to expand different areas for support of our students and now our teachers that I think it is definitely worth renewing license for a year and seeing if we can continue to increase usage paper is added a tool for teachers teachers can put either in a Content area or a grade level standard and the platform will generate five for me to assessment questions that teachers can use as a launch before a lesson to see where students are and they're ready to engage in that content they can use it as a point in time quiz in the middle of a lesson or an exit card or take home activity so I think with her when

[00:32:00]
you started with paper they had paper missions and online tutoring and since then they've increased to and the writing reviews the writing reviews have been off the charts we've had over 7,000 students submit different types of work to be edited prior to submission to the teachers and so I think with their expansion of tools and the ability to line these supports directly to our goals and our guard rails the reading the reading tool lines perfectly with gold won the the teacher assignments support goals 2 and 3 they have another new tool called major Clarity where it's a career exploration tool where they students do like a interest inventory and then can get get information about different careers and links to colleges they even have a post-secondary that supports our goal three so

[00:33:00]
I think that it is definitely worth seeing if we can continue to increase and how it supports attainment of those goals we also have some data and I believe zappers trying to help us to see an impact study based on the students and use the tools and remember Jackson if I may just expand a little bit too I'm just going to response I think is something that we've discerned and looked at very closely we've also investigated deeply the work around high dosage tutoring and what that means for students and we know that that is significantly more expensive than what we are currently doing so we are trying to provide as individuals as individualized support as possible with the resources in which we have and we're optimistic with the increase in usage and will continue to work

[00:34:00]
stop to utilize it within the school day and outside of the school day as we move forward and again their professional development plan as set up for as as recent as this Friday for our teachers who are going to be in PD there will be teachers continuing to learn to use the instrument and platform on this professional development day moving into next school year thank you for that and then I think just my last question is a contract question let's just say for whatever reason it's not it's just not working it's not fitting into our goals is Siri an exit built into the contract so if we approve a four-year and after the second year is just not working do we have the ability to terminate this first year contract is based on a cooperative and it is just for Year One

[00:35:00]
to see if another Cooperative available or going out to RFP and typically in all our contracts we we include well there's always termination for breach but also termination for convenience but we are approving 4 years for the budgeting of it but this is just for the first year Under The Cooperative with paper okay thank you I actually have some additional questions on this too okay so do we have are we paying for 22000 licenses or is that what the amount is being paid for it or is it that we pay for it as they use the license or actually purchasing licenses for every student 3rd through 12th grade we analyzed the difference of paying per activ

[00:36:00]
versus unlimited license and it was very close in cost and so if I if our students increase we would end up paying more by going per activity than unlimited usage per student okay and then my final question would be out of the amount of licenses that I guess we have unlimited so it is what it is how can you set how many are actually utilizing do we have that number because I know you said it's increase but I feel like increased is relative on what that number looks like I believe we do actually have a discreet student license I think the last time I checked it was over 10,000 but I will confirm that number and get back to you okay thank you any additional questions

[00:37:00]
is on this item oh go ahead and board member benavidez thank you so much Madam chair and so and forgive me if this has been addressed I'm curious about data that might exist for AP usage math and English and the reason I ask is because we had a parent reach out to us from the Native American community and they paid about $600 for some intensive one-on-one tutoring for their their child and can paper address this so that they don't have to do that I am not sure remember benavidez whether we get exactly what core students are enrolled in we get content but not specifically I'm in an AP language course and I need help with this question we could probably somehow do a crosswalk between the students that are in that and to see if they have access but

[00:38:00]
I think with a professional development we have planned in the fall targeted to each School level and goal I think we can help increase the the marketing or the awareness that this is available to all students and students at all levels I did see a student that was in a AP Physics class I get I can go on and look at the interactions between the live tutor and the students and I just came up on a I believe it was an AP Physics student that was on for 2 hours with a tutor he crossed two different tutors 8 hours sessions and just kept working with the tutor through his physics problems thank you write thank you any additional questions awesome thank you for the presentation thank you so much we will go ahead and continue

[00:39:00]
so our next item for consideration is the approval of April 2024 cash disbursements and Ms gems that I will turn it back over to you thank you madam chair members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey requesting your consideration for the approval of the April 2024 cash disbursements happy to answer any questions thank you do we have any additional questions or any questions related to this item okay I do not see any thank you so much we will go ahead and continue so our next item is to consider recommending the consent agenda board approval for items discussed during the May 22nd 2024 finance committee meeting this includes Grand budget adjustments inter function and intra function transfers gifts grandson donations statement of equipment to be taken out of service for April of 2024 transportation services
