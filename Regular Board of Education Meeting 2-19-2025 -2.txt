authorized by the public meetings act to discuss a limited Personnel matter regarding the superintendents evaluation the matters discussed in the executive session were limited only to those specified so I'll move to 9. 1 6 6

just to provide some some contacts for the vote that we are about to take an ad hoc committee was formed to explore the idea of linking superintendent superintendent incentive pay to measurable progress on the board's goals Dr Blakey suggested that an extended contract would better serve the district emphasizing that continued momentum is essential for improving student outcomes the committee agreed and the board voted to extend the superintendent's contract by two years contingent on progress toward meeting the board's goals during a February March review the board conducted that review during this executive session other compensation based on performance cost of living State salary increases and other measures may be negotiated during contract renewal in the fall

so with that statement I would like to call for a motion I moved to extend the superintendent's contract by 2 years to June 30th 2028 based on demonstrated progress towards meeting the board's goals as specified in the contract this is board member benavidez and this is board member Romero second okay we have a motion and a second maybe we have a roll call vote police yes okay thank you the motion passes and congratulations thank you to you and your team for all of your work on improving students all right so with that
