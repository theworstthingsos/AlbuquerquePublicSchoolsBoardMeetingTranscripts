[00:00:00]

[00:01:00]
spell removal of for the 2023 intra function transfers for non categorical funds and or in the archive security systems and approval of the finance committee meeting minutes of March 29th 2023 so I have a second I have a roll call please yes please yes so before we move on to our next is consideration for approval of the 26 20/23 Finance items on consent agenda except that will start first with items C support you have some questions on this one right I had some some questions that came up after our like some of our questions were answered so

[00:02:00]
I didn't have time to get those answers so and I'm not sure who would be able to answer this one is when it came to the amount that was going to go to pay for the all program training for principals and it said that about 23 it would be about 23,000 in total for each principal and there were 10 right now correct and entrance I believe so and then it said a lot of that was going to be paid to the person who was subbing for them so are they out for the whole spring semester and then there's somebody who's subbing as administrator I was just confused with that answer period

[00:03:00]
when they have to attend the classes at UNM for for the training to become a better prepared leaders in our schools I can follow up with program and provide you additional details on the exact amount of time these Insurance are to be out of schools and just kind of have that Miss Miller like how that money is like giving up if you know the 23,000 how much of its going to go to pain substitute celery I thought that was interesting and then how much was going I'm assuming that they're getting some kind of a stipend as well the principals himself so those I mean those kinds of questions and then if I could I mean if there was anybody here that could answer this would be helpful I just want to know how different this all program was then the Peds principals pursuing excellence

[00:04:00]
and why we're not doing that or we're not and I don't know if we are or not maybe there are some that are part of that principal's pursuing excellence and then also I know that project Echo does does a lot is starting to do a lot more when it comes to education and you know that's that's funded they have funding for that so I'm just wondering if our you know we're being wise about how we're spending or are funds when it comes to you know making our principles the best that they can possibly be so if I could get answers to those questions that would be wonderful just if there's other programs that might be of a high quality as well that might be paid for by other funds and we could use it for something else and then another question that kind of came up when it was I think it was

[00:05:00]
is that Highlands and it was the professional development that they were going to go to in in Dallas so I saw that this was probably for one staff member cuz I think it was only 2 0 0. 0 0 7

[00:06:00]
play New Mexico the same caliber or online I'm just thinking about everybody's being careful with money and traveling and everything so I just want to make sure I'm going to my knowledge there is a cap on the number of Travellers based on funding availability that can attend it from a school so as not to be so far away from from school and out of the classroom if applicable and in addition to that I am aware that are AVID program is looking into applying to become a local AVID representative not and if that's the case we will have other states and districts coming to us and we will not travel so voluminously outside the state

[00:07:00]
looking for this type of training cuz I saw an answer to the question that there was going to be seven total staff members that were going to be going to this training I think it's this summer so if you could just find out for me that would be wonderful thank you any other questions on this item know that I guess I would entertain a motion on this one I'll move for approval of the function transfers for Grant budget for the month of March 2023 second I have a roll call please hey Google no just because I don't have all of the answers though if you could know that please Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes please our next item is consideration approval item e for transfers for all non categorical funds board

[00:08:00]
and so on this one and one of the questions that I had is what is going to be the total cost for the ERS Contract Services I know we've we've seen it before and on here it was like $575,000 it was going to be used but can you tell me what the whole contract with the cost for the whole contract is going to be up the 575 it's actually one and some of these two so there is a deep dive that ER is is doing currently into our data to be able to come up with a picture of how we found where we are and then also conducting interviews with staff and they'll be coming to talk to the board so there's like a whole time

[00:09:00]
online so this just covers the beginning and once we will we are able to determine where we are and then make a determination of where we want to go then that cost me fluctuate so I can't give you the exact total until we know where we're at at this time okay so is that make it look a little hard to like budget for that if you're not quite sure exactly how much or even estimate what might be that estimate that initially was about 750,000 but like I said it was just an estimate because not going through Facebook cuz this is like three years so this 50075 is phase one so this will kind of be for planing of for the first year correct and then the second year and then

[00:10:00]
play third year so that's where we're not sure exactly what that cost will be okay okay I think that was the main question and my apologies to you all because I had written the question and wrote I missed the five on there and I got you guys all confused like what's 75,000 I missed the five on the five I wish I was 75,000 I wish it was 75 thank you any other discussion have emotion please I will move for approval of fiscal year 2023 intro function transfers for all funds for the month of March 2023

[00:11:00]
which is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure of 250,000 for archive security systems for schools discussion board member Mueller article and real quick before you start can you give the number of the page and the digital packet so we're not show page number I think it's on 149 thank you and so the where did this who requested this was this coming from you know APS police like what department requested these new I think it's new servers right security servers correct Dr Bowman I would defer that to she was online

[00:12:00]
members of the board I'm picking me to Aragon yes that was requested through the police department through technology we help support them with all of their most of their technology needs so it was a dual request between technology and a pspd okay and so I think this is when I am just looking when I was kind of looking at some of the you know rational that you have for it but it came really down to is that a lot of these servers are just old and new ones right I mean that is the true justification but then what I saw in here a lot was where we were talking you all were talking about how important it was that improved in attendance at

[00:13:00]
allowing them to learn in a safe and sound environment and that just kind of like confuse me cuz I think most kids have absolutely positively no idea what kind of servers that we use and bottom line from what you're saying is that the servers were they were old so that yes they were old but they were also this is also part of the entire Security package so if we don't have our infrastructure in place then our security and our safety of our students is not going to be there so it was partly because of requirements for ped and then also they are old and they do need to be replaced right and I know that there was a big deal made about connectedness and relationships and making kids feel safer and that the servers played a pivotal role like you just said in the security system

[00:14:00]
but do they contribute to the kids true sense of safety I think that they do contribute to their safety because it is part of the entire infrastructure you know our Police monitor with these with these servers and these cameras that are at each schools and students know that they're there I would also have that I think if you have you know strong infrastructure at a school the staff feels confident so it's sort of leads to all of that so the students might not know what a server is but our teachers definitely know about the infrastructure the staff knows about the infrastructure so I appreciate you know the extra mile that you gave in terms of just the description of that although we are replacing you know servers that are old there's also important of why we need to replace the the service to also create that balance so is there any other discussion I mean I would just like just

[00:15:00]
for you to just say the reason why we are getting them to just update our infrastructure but I don't think that's honestly a lot of that connectedness and the relationships that are kids feel has to do with the people that are around them like President Montoya Court of a sad and their sense of how they feel and not really about the the machines I think it's about the relationship and connectedness amongst the people that are around our children not the machines do we have emotional on this I will move for approval of District purchase of purchase or expenditure that equals 250,000 dollars for archive security system for schools second yes yes

[00:16:00]
Barbara Peterson and Dominguez yes Brittany Jackson yes so our next item is just consideration for approval of the rest of the consent agenda items do I have a motion for that I don't know how to say that maybe our Pollard material can actually get us emotions I will move to prove for the consent for the remaining consent agenda items all

[00:17:00]
I have questions okay if we're ready to have to finish this is you guys to answer my questions okay so some of my questions did get answered in the that I sent in Prior but this this wearable device system that you're thinking of of purchasing it does not have a two-way communication is that correct that is my understanding how I will defer that to we have two representatives from strategic as well as Dr Blakey and talk to Faye yeah one thing about this is that we are actually giving the location and the person is being transmitted to those responders

[00:18:00]
the location and only when I press that button is location to be transferred to those responders and then there's also discreet feedback of vibration that that staff member gets letting them know that that message has been sent so in the two-way communication it is about they are confirming that the message is sent and then the location information which is usually the critical first verbal information that is needed is is being sent automatically so no one has to talk during a time of distress okay so but does it have the ability like if there is a time of distress and a signal get sent to the office today and let me just take a real world scenario if there was a gun threat at a school and some of the teachers were not on Google Chat and so half the teachers would know that everything was okay but the other half of the teachers didn't know if they had this device how would a signal get back to the teacher's

[00:19:00]
staff to know that everything was okay comma or having to go over you know like how how does how does the signal get sent but then how do you how does everybody know everything is okay so absolutely so the number one is just someone pressing that button during the day to day right a medical a behavior a fight however that system can go into a lockdown so by repeatedly clicking that staff members badge that system will go into a lockdown that now is not just alerting responders that this person needs help and where they are and that this is a serious incident and letting the police know it is also visually notifying all building occupants that they need to quickly take action so you'll see there's a stroke and Carly's hand right now that would start flashing a specific color like red during a lockdown think of it kind of like a fire system but for all the other things outside of fire so that starts flashing there's automated intercom announcements that go over so instead of

[00:20:00]
it's a way for everyone to quickly know I need to get to safety behind a locked door okay can you hold up that is not how big the Badgers are the visual way on top of the audible way that you are communicating with everyone to get to safety so you're showing me the badge right now okay and sorry could you show me what like the front and the back looks okay that's front

[00:21:00]
and I would just sit right behind if the existing staff IDs it would just fit right behind and they can discreetly press it right so going back to that two-way you don't have to say anything if you have someone that's confronting you or you feel threatened you can definitely press that button just greatly and get help so thank you for that so I think right now I'm moving back over here I think one of my original questions was there is a mobile alert system that is available through ped right now that has been reallocated for the past five years or starting in 1920 and it's been reallocated every year through the legislature and it is being offered free to the districts and so I think a main question that yes I see that you answered in here but I just I think that this needs to be answered in a more open setting why is APS deferring from

[00:22:00]
A system that is free that is that has been used with districts around the state to purchase a 7 million system instead I can't answer but I have I changed my camera my internet is I apologize but I can see Charlotte can you hear me now you're just coming in and out so keep talking about the next question I'll get on on my phone instead and it might be better

[00:23:00]
it's better already so that the other the other system doesn't allow for the same flexibility that this system does it's very limiting because you have to use your phone as a device and that means that your phone has to be on you not only does that prevent if you don't want to use a personal phone or device for that purpose you there would be an option to not use your personal device and the second thing is you have to have your phone on you a lot of times in those systems as we investigated what schools were doing and districts around the country it's limiting because if you don't have your phone you can't ask you can't get assistance we had a principal that was assaulted in the fall if she didn't have her phone with her so she wouldn't have been able to use her phone for a system like this as well as

[00:24:00]
a lot of times if you're going to if you're like me and you have a lot of apps on your phone you have to go on and find that app to be able to make the alert and so in some ways calling 911 is much faster than finding now that's like having a prevents a lot of those issues so I think it's kind of brings me to my next question so the utility of the buttons and there was there was a mention of it of how it's how it's useful that you can contact the aps police APD bcso can you just kind of expand on that a little bit and and I don't mean to like the labor this point but I think we just had a conversation about a layered approach to our infrastructure in school safety and so I want to make sure that spending $7 million dollars

[00:25:00]
is on a program is going to work well with the infrastructure we have and that we're not just spending money to spend money that we're actually I'll leave it at that so can you kind of expand on the utility of the buttons and how it will be incorporated into the infrastructure yes so part of what happens in the fall we were doing a training with all of our legal or our law enforcement agencies and on as we were doing like the tabletop with all of those on Associates Communications school police APD bcso we got stuck on the first part of the training that was a teacher needs assistance what do they do who do they call and so we knew from that point that we needed to

[00:26:00]
I need something that provided us the opportunity to be able to call for assistance to be able to respond both locally and be able to respond to police in the incident what we really liked about when we found this solution was that as a teacher and as a principal the ability to use it on a daily basis just to call for assistance is really important and so that utility as having it as a layered approach to have staff be able to feel that if they are in an emergency or they see something that they need assistance with they can call right away for Help by pressing the button that could be anything from a fight an injury you don't want to leave a student and you see that there's a fight you want to you know ask for help for it in a classroom as part of our de-escalation training

[00:27:00]
we have we have also found that teachers if they call the office to the intercom and they asked for blue team you know to come to room 112 it often ignites more stress in the classroom and with the student and with this solution would be able to have the teachers just be able to press the button alert the staff and the crisis team could come and do de-escalation teacher de-escalation for that particular student and so the flexibility and the and the uniqueness of this to be able to not just be used in a situation that we don't want to happen at any school but to be able to be used as a communication tool for our staff to feel that they can call for assistance like I said the principal that was assaulted in the fall would have been able to you know what to get assistance right away from pressing it so we felt that that you know leverage to the ability

[00:28:00]
to improve our communication with staff and with principles police and all of the responders that we need in cases of emergencies okay awesome I think that just brought up one last question that I have who's monitoring this like who have we gotten have we decided or have you guys decided yet when the signal goes in is there is there a central person in the office who will be monitoring where does the where does the where is there a component of this that is the monitoring system yes so the schools will be able to have the ability to list who they want to be on the call list for the cases that I talked about like the school cases as far as maybe they want the nurse the crisis team the principal is up to the school to identify who those people are that they want to be notified if

[00:29:00]
press the button three times if the if a teacher or a staff member is is pressing the button multiple times that it is a 911 emergency then that call will go to our Dispatch Center and it'll be the equivalent of calling 911 out of school okay thank you Doctor Blakey you're welcome I apologize for my shopping list and what kind of lifetime warranty is on the system or is there a what is the warranty on the system and and support that comes with and what's the life expectancy of I mean I can see these badges you know getting

[00:30:00]
worn out and not for I mean just for a number of reasons right I mean we work with actually go ahead so the system is under warranty the whole period and in one of the things we've learned over time is you guys just want this solution to work without having to have all the resources and maintenance in place to do it so that is part of our agreement is that we are the ones maintaining it that includes the batteries that includes replacing them if a battery is going low on any of the devices so that is all covered as far as if a bad starts to have a battery that goes low a couple years from now that's replaced at no extra charge to the district as long as this system is in place in agreement contract is 5 years

[00:31:00]
what is the cost going to be after the 5 years estimated cost if we decide to continue you can continue just kind of at that same Pace it depends if you guys want to use the same equipment or if it's hey there's something you know a newer version of this that you would like to do five years from now but that is usually it would just kind of keep it that same pace for future years including the maintenance and warranty and everything okay so then and I know I just I always ask for specificity so that 7.3 million dollar cost you said it's for maintenance it's for the batteries right and

[00:32:00]
and what else I know the the resources so what are you counting as resources so I believe a board member earlier asked about you know how do we make sure it works everywhere on campus we don't rely on your Wi-Fi we don't rely on cellular signal so we do build a Network Technology and create an umbrella over your whole campus so it works out inside practice fields to do that there is that infrastructure that we put in place that is installed so when we talked about that price point it is us coming on site it's installing all these devices putting the visuals everywhere and doing that it is training we train every administrator at every site we go and work with the team there the administration team to make sure they know how to use it they know how to respond there's a lot of District Level Training as well and then it is the maintenance it's a software it's the badges every part of that is included in that price okay and then so when you're setting up all this

[00:33:00]
presses a button three times that's how it's because you've already done all that work that's how it knows to go to to dispatch to APD or APS police that's how we don't need to worry about like GPS right things that you're used to on your phone to get to a school but aren't very good at telling you what floor room so we that Network that technology we put in place it allows you to know you're in room to when you press that button and share that and that's how they know to come directly to that place part of that training is we have a special mold the system goes in that when every staff members give them their badge at the the first part of it they actually get to press that button that is recorded you make sure they know how to press it they get to feel the vibration after they press it that way we want everyone to press it for the first time not when they're in an incident or emergency we want to do it during that training mode and that is part of it as well okay and so I know

[00:34:00]
to one of the questions that was asked it said that this device was not necessarily would not necessarily improve school safety but improves the ability to respond quickly and makes a staff comfortable so they can call for help at any time so it and I don't know who would answer this question then is it still a layer in our school safety infrastructure though and that's probably doesn't go to you probably has to go to one of the blinking yes so definitely is another layer in our safety protocols it includes being able to like I said when we did that training part of the safety is being able to have a system within the district that is clear and that people know what to do in the case of an emergency

[00:35:00]
that is part of our system that is really important in our ability to respond to situations as well is making sure that we have a unified approach to distribute response and how our staff know to call for help and so it definitely is in the layered security approach that we have for how to respond to emergency situations okay so it really is about getting a quicker a quicker response so then this is just maybe a really silly question but how easy it is it like you know you create fake IDs how are easier it is it to create a fake wearable crisis alert system it definitely it's a closed system which means you just can't activate it with another device to clone we are encrypting the technology from end to end meaning it's a close Network we're not allowing new devices outside of some teachers to join that Network so we make sure

[00:36:00]
I mean there's always Bad actors out there that want to do something for not a good reason so thank you and the good news is that they did would be showing you exactly where they are when I press it but that hasn't happened ever in our 4000 sites board member Peterson's District job of not just jumping to every that aren't aren't

[00:37:00]
Shuffle and so I'm I'll support it but it actually makes me pretty fundamentally angry that we are between this rock and a hard place for how we keep schools safe and how we keep our kids safe and that somehow still is a society as a community we're not saying we still cannot take a stand that maybe there shouldn't be a plethora of guns out there that anyone can get a hold of and that we are still over all not just within APS but as a community is a whole not investing in a healthy community in a healthy society and so we end up picking up the pieces and trying to keep a Band-Aid over the safety for kids when we have an invested in what we need to invest in and I would like to see I would really love to have the district put

[00:38:00]
how much money has been spent on various security systems safe entryways fencing all of that that we've had to do so that we can at least pretend that we're doing something to keep Kids Safe instead of putting the money into the program because I think the community really needs to understand that there is a cost and it is at the expense of our students that this is where our money is going instead of into what we know they really need to know what you're saying because for a moment I envisioned lots of people pressing that button and guess what we don't have the personnel and it goes back to what you saying and this is not a reflection

[00:39:00]
turn on our district it's a reflection of where we get our you know the our money and that's the state we can't attract Personnel because we're not paying them $40,000 to start to be a staff member and to help with this so yeah I like the idea the system but there has to be another way right we have to we have to invest in teaching our kids because Superman ain't coming

[00:40:00]
this is our reality so it's up to our community here at school to to find a way to help kids talk to each other and talk honestly about what they're feeling and and learning how to resolve conflict in productive ways this is a great system when those sorts of things break down but yeah absolutely I appreciate your comments and there are certainly a lot of things going on this particular solution one of the reasons that some of our colleagues that we've worked with across the Council of great City schools and other districts have pointed out is helpful is because it

[00:41:00]
actually when you don't have staff it helps to utilize people in the right way by identifying who gets called and being able to make sure that people have access to ask for assistance when they need it schools have asked for years when I was a teacher and a principal everybody wanted their own radio to call for assistance if they need anything and that you know wasn't feasible option however having this is actually a way to help Staff feel build up their confidence that they know what to do if a student needs help or one of their colleagues needs help and it's not just in a violent situation at all and that's one of the things that a lot of schools have pointed out that they've been able to quickly give Aid to students who have medical emergencies but on the playground when they're far out they're able to call for assistance to get the nurse out there

[00:42:00]
I think there was a district where they actually were able to save a student's Life by being able to call for assistance quickly in a medical emergency with so it's really giving staff the ability and hopefully actually pulling up staff efficacy and how they feel they can respond to anything on campus in their classroom if they need assistance somebody will be there to help them and not feel so isolated in a classroom or on the field where they can't get since they need to so it's all though it can be used in 911 emergency situations we probably will see it being used mostly it's in every day you know everyday activities that happened at a school in staff need assistance

[00:43:00]
thank you and thank you Dr Blakey I also just wanted to both respond to and build on a little bit of a member Peterson's comments because I agree and you use the term Rock and Hard Place I think it's a false choice and I think if we're going to be true to the goals and guardrails that we approved then it's incumbent upon us as Leaders to demand a solution that's aligned to those goals and guardrails there are trade-offs and all of these budgetary decisions and I'd be interested in seeing what are the trade-offs if you have eight million dollars and you're going to invest it towards a goal of improving communication or improving safety or improving response time or whatever the goal maybe what are alternative ways in which we could spend that 7 million dollars 7 1/2 over 7 million acknowledging all of the contextual factors within our system the limitations on staff the size of our campuses all of these other factors I think I would much rather entertain proposals related to training staff

[00:44:00]
on how to respond how to support each other how to really and truly Foster School environments that are focused on Save and supportive climates so that we're not having these problems that were addressing so it's much more of a proactive strategy I think than a reactive strategy and acknowledging that yes proactivity and reactivity or both part of the bigger picture but I think from from where I said I'm I'm honestly know because I'd like to understand a little bit more about trade-offs that are made and what is the real goal of of this so I just wanted to thank you for putting that on the table but also just acknowledge that remember Jackson you had a couple more questions it was a contract question actually so this this is a five-year contract and I'm wondering kind of based on some of these questions and ideas that have come up is there a like a termination Clause within the contract that if after three years we have determined this just

[00:45:00]
is not working or is is is is causing we were getting all sorts of clones I don't know is there a termination Clause that if the schools decided just doesn't work we don't have to pay 7 and 5 million dollars for member Jackson yes there is there's a termination clause for cause and a termination clause for convenience they do have timeline and also if there's any breach of contract they do have a period i

[00:46:00]
play kindergarten and you know how kindergarteners are how many false alarms do you think you would have at that level I'm sure that you have that data yeah it's less than 5% and again less than 5% most of those are going to be that staff alert day-to-day meaning you're letting a principal know to come down to that room okay and then to go back to member Jackson's so tell me what the reasons to get out of the contract or cause so what would be caused so calls could be different things as far as not meeting you know not the system itself is not working as required not working as well as APS thinks it should be working so the contract

[00:47:00]
they pay we pay for the equipment when it comes in there's an annual maintenance agreement and then based on Appropriations or we also have a termination for convenience that they chose not to renew that contract for the next year so it can be Appropriations it can be anything with the equipment not working as planned but usually if there's a breach in the contract also there is a period of time for them to fix the bridge okay thank you okay I just have a couple of comments I just when I was the director of Schoolhouse and was working with School nurses across the state I know that this was a huge issue around that medical emergency and depending on where the nurse is when that emergency is occurring and it's not

[00:48:00]
almost need you need a button you need to be able to get people to to you especially if in our district where I mean would be great with 7 million maybe we could get a school nurse in every school which could be really helpful that we'd have one that's not having to go from school to school or sharing schools but the health assistant sometimes is the person that's left behind who is there who's having to respond to a medical emergency and it just depends on the complexity of it also the reality for our district is just the complexity of the medical conditions that APS is having to address with the kids that we serve with disabilities I remember the nurses often saying that are nursing complexity and APS is what you would find and like a piece Nick you because we do have kids that are suctioned that are on

[00:49:00]
that are that are doing all kinds of different things and so sometimes there are medical emergencies that arise with just those children and it's hard to get to them quickly and it's not I don't think it's you know I agree you know that it would be great in a perfect world that you know small community that somehow it can work but I think of the complexity of the size of some of our schools especially our high schools where it's all laid out in a really you know big complex way I wish we had seven million dollars to pay for more Hands-On stuff you know that could pay for all of the pieces that we need to support oh I don't know you know whether it's the social workers more peer-to-peer workers things that could help us with you know just climate and culture I would guess and Mr olds you had mentioned that you've got

[00:50:00]
4,000 sites is that what you said three of the top 10 in the country that you know the largest districts but really it's anything from a small one site District all the way up to our largest it's almost 400 schools what I was thinking is that it could also help us study the Gap right in terms of places and I'm hoping that the district would want to take a look at that because those places where we have like an overabundance of emergency calls or things that really are higher at a greater Peak than others you know hopefully it sounds like you collect a lot of data so it would be able to tell us that and maybe that would help us as a board also to know how to direct resources to a particular area part of the state or part of the city where maybe there's there's an urgent or emergent need that is different right that we would probably have to do I would love to see us be able to like work

[00:51:00]
ourselves out of this right I mean I think it's like could be a first step maybe collecting the data giving us some ideas of things that we could layer differently but if we start to layer it differently and we're seeing that a school has a low response with it or not really a utilization of it that also could tell us something there as well that maybe that particular school really doesn't need this level of of this layer maybe that layer doesn't work for that particular school it might be not indicated for all of our schools but just for some of the schools so I'm interested in how you collect that data report that data and have school boards utilize that data to to sort of make some funding decisions differently as they're moving through absolutely it's very common now that this data which you know when someone closest at alert after that alert happens was it a medical physical altercation we're starting to hear of DS collation right they want it

[00:52:00]
what does a special reason for de-escalation runners so we are now having that a lot of people report that data to the board and and whatever fashion your process will allow but to your point it does also identify Trends and some of those are positive some of those are negative if it's a hey wow we have a lot of Runners at this school between these hours and they're always getting offensive busy area we can already be proactive in making sure we have someone on site we don't create new incidents right that's very important when I think someone mentioned is their new task we're putting on our principles we're not creating new incidents we're giving you a faster and more efficient way to manage the incidents that are already happened right so now as those things are happening you can start supporting your staff so now if there is something where you're going why is it taking that many medical insurance do we need to put in additional Health person in that cluster schools or in that school directly this is all the data that you will now have and one last month mentioned you know I will say this

[00:53:00]
your district is a very good job in the contract negotiation with that termination for convenience you know ultimately that is not something we normally do but it was very important for you guys to say hey if this doesn't work for our district if it doesn't work for our public we want to weigh out of it and that means the cost is not 7 million it's only one years worth of stuff it's only 2 years this is not a three-year minimum this is a one year that your District didn't negotiate into that contract but it sounds like if the data is built into that that could be really useful to the district and to the board for some decision-making and ways that we could potentially utilize our resources in a much more effective way to also add the additional layers of support that maybe are coming up for specific schools are and if it's not being utilized in a school it's not you know it doesn't seem like it would be indicated for that particular school so I'm just curious about that as we move forward do you have another question board member Jackson yes okay one more contract question and first of all

[00:54:00]
kudos to you guys I'm so thrilled that you negotiated that so I'm going to assume that you've also negotiated this but I just wanted to ask the question let's just say for some reason this it doesn't work like they did the button gets pressed and and you know we push this through and and it just doesn't work have you negotiated that the company would indemnify or warranty the district or any of the consequences that of us were like relying on this system in the negotiations because liability causes for system like this are very complicated and very difficult and there was a lot of back and forth there are some indemnification included in that but there are also limitations I believe we negotiated a higher rate

[00:55:00]
of liability on the insurance that is normally asked for I believe we asked for an additional 5 million and if for some reason their insurance wasn't in place they would also have a clause to cover that for the first 5 million of also job you guys any other discussion board president I just wanted to quickly in regards to your comments to pay for this cannot be used on personnel and then because of that this does give us the ability of what you were asking about in The Limited Personnel we do have how can we leverage funds that we can't use for personnel to be able to use data to

[00:56:00]
show us where we can put personnel and so that is you know kind of a way that we can work to utilize restricted funds in a way that will leverage what we can do with the Personnel funds on the other side of it so our hope is to really dig into the data to find things such as counselors nurses all of the things that we're looking at and where we can make sure that we're utilizing our staff in the most efficient way with limited resources that makes sense I'm looking at that because you clearly outlined that it would be Esser for you to looks like Esther's years one and two and then three four and five was Capital but definitely our Capital funds are also critical for us for lots of other reasons but I appreciate the clarification thank you any other discussion

[00:57:00]
Dr Bowman were you on the cusp of saying something just look like you wanted to say something I was going to pick up your phone so I will entertain a motion on this my motion to prove let me get rid of my note this expenditure for wearable crisis alert system probably it's going to be no I just think that we can use this money to really improve school safety I just think we can use it in a different way that was a partition

[00:58:00]
Barbara Peterson yes yes Serena Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes Yolanda Monterey Cordova yes okay we'll move on to our next item which is Item B an update on the district's investment program for the third quarter of FY 2023 this is a discussion and Mr Mark Turnbull executive director of accounting is coming up to the table here with the friend good evening

[00:59:00]
Kaiser for almost 5 years now it's nice to be in front of you and we've been hard at work and I want to be in front of you personally just because of what's going on in the markets and to to report number one hopefully it was very very safe number two we are earning a lot more money because interest rates are much higher and number three the portfolio was positioned very well to make those adjustments and do that so that's what we want to do is have an agile portfolio that's able to move when you have a presentation in your books I'm going to jump forward I'm not sure the page number for you but it's the one that talks about historical rates so let's move I'm going to break down so on this page it talks about what's happening to rate and where this is important for you is you have a lot of money our goal with your money is to make sure that we're optimizing the balance number one always keeping it safe and number to providing for all the payments and cash that you need and the number three optimizing in investment so you're allowed to do to achieve a market rate of

[01:00:00]
so back in a year ago you were earning about 5 actually you're in less than that you're running 2 and that was because that's where interest rates were and you're a lot of your money was in the bank at Wells Fargo and we did have a sum of an invested in your certain dedicated Reserve funds and some operating funds today the interest rates are for 69 says up for 400% I mean 4% and that impact is significant for the portfolio the next page shows you the rate changes in the keys that they're moving all over the place and they have always moved over the place I've been in the market since 1982 I started 18% so what we're trying to do for the district is to make sure that we have strategies and balance in all those buckets to be able to achieve the earnings you can to make sure you're making as much as you can while still keeping the city in place I got a question from

[01:01:00]
mark on because they've changed so much is there something different that we should do and there really isn't I don't like to change strategy when just because rates are moving I like to have a good strong strategy going into it and the way that we balance your strategies we have a cash component or liquidity component to each of your funds and then we have an investment component so we we met earlier today and what will probably do is just Twix a little bit and add a little bit more to the investment component always meeting that liquidity needs because the other thing that happens when a rates go up is the value of your bonds go down so we never want to have to sell your boss to provide for liquidity so that's the kind of push and pull that we're working on to make sure that those are balanced and real comfortable with how your position the main components that we did and I think the biggest work that I recently did was we did talk to your bank transfers from Wells Fargo to principal principal and Wells both had a pretty low depository rates so we talked to your

[01:02:00]
providers over there and moved a large amount of money from being in a bank deposit which was convenient right now with the top of the big deposits into a money market fund and a government only money market fund which is allowed under your directives and your procedures a money market fund represents invest in treasuries agencies and repository so again very secure pulled assets and it's also allowed to be more efficient and moving the money around so they're in their daily liquid so tomorrow he could pull out as much as you needed so that move you up from like a 1% on that component up to almost 4% immediately so that impact came in so the next page show the diversification of the portfolio this is a Crossing capital projects is crossed your service and your operating and self-insurance you have a total of about 370 million in that cash component which comprises of the money market fund and the state LG IP State LG

[01:03:00]
your overall book earnings yield today is at 4:10 and again that is up from almost 0.28 last year which is significant and I expected to come down so this is we have not been this high for 15 years so it again the portfolio was positioned very well to adapt and there's really nothing that we're going to push to change that we're going to take the benefits of that through this interest rate cycle the when you go back one page the operating fund are strategy and that is to take excess balances you're not needing for daily cash and invest it out a year right before Christmas a little bit up to about 7 5 5

[01:04:00]
you had earned $62,000 and because of that rate you're up to 3.655% in the money market funds your maximum by directives is 50% you have 17% in treasuries you have 14% in US Agencies and 20% of the state treasurer's LG IP pool which is also invested in treasuries and agencies and money markets and they do have some Bank deposits and their Bank deposits are 100% collateralized the next report shows the structure so as I mentioned at the outfit we look at liquidity balance is an investment components for each

[01:05:00]
the ones that you have and make sure that those are balanced and we're actually put triggers in our in our system so that we're watching the minimum balance is on the liquidity so I'll see it right with Mark when your balance and start to come down for cash if you could blow 100 million in your operating funds I'll know about it I'll go home some different than what we talked about why are your lower and that allows us to make any adjustments that we need to do I don't expect you to go that low we have a good history on the portfolio and then the self-insurance so everything is very stable and the key for you as the board is looking at the maturity structure of your portfolio and your maturity is only about 30 days I mean 3 months so it's short so you're protected within the market will probably move that out just a little bit when we make investments but we still keep you well right around 6 months the next page is a compliance page which

[01:06:00]
ties to your directives and looks at what should I just repeated what the what the investment components are so everything looks scary I do have a correction I have your money market fund in my compliance report under your bank deposit money market funds so I'll be correcting that for your fiscal year end I just got that when I was sitting down that's a coating on my system that I didn't catch and the actual maturities the longest maturity at time of purchase you had was in the reserve fund that was just about four years that was done a while ago so that's it if there's any questions or I'm just really excited and wanted to be in front of you to share with you that the portfolios so very well that you're very protected on what you have and GPA continues to work diligently here in New Mexico we work with the state treasurer's office in here so it's always a privilege to be with you I just we're actually with bank

[01:07:00]
any any discussion or comments good to hear that we're in Albuquerque so can you just like in a quick sentence just summarize what your recommendations are my recommendations is we're going to continue to focus on the overall funds and if there's an opportunity to invest in short treasury security and then you said we're at 47% for Money Mart because your balance is move and when you get any closer to do that by your direct

[01:08:00]
so my question kind of relates to the issue that was happening like with Silicon Valley Bank right and correct me if I'm wrong but part of the reason that they wouldn't under was because they had so much invested in treasury bonds is that correct they had so much invested long and treasury bonds so they had invested out in the five and ten year area okay and they have locked in 2% when rates for 5:00 so they have gone out and use the yield curve to invest and then he took the money from the deposits and either invested or they left the money and when they left the money they left at 2 so and they were paying on the deposits point five so then as interest

[01:09:00]
is on the short money like I showed you the short money started going up to 4% everybody said well and we did that too why are you only paying me for 1% when I should be getting 4% cuz we should be getting what the market is paying and then they said and then people started taking their money to the money market funds or to other places that they could get 4% and they had to get the money and the only way they could get the money was to sell those bonds at losses and they took over $20 billion dollars in losses and that started a role on all these Banks we still have one more bank account under a lot of pressure Republic but a lot of those deposits were not collateralized either a lot of these Venture Capital companies and and they don't know what they were thinking that they put their money in there and there was no collateralization behind it at all so it's a it was it was scary the government stepped in and protected all depositors on that but the banks are either being bought out the FDIC will come in and buy the have people buy their eggs

[01:10:00]
but that's basically what we're here they were managing their cash flow okay but so so for our instance we do not have long-term long-term treasury bonds we have short because your longest is is shorter than 5 years you can invest that to five years in your reserve Fund in my opinion that's not long but that is that would be the longest and that is for a dedicated Debt Service Reserve fund that is a long fund so when we manage your operating funds are managed short because they're shortening so we tie the investment structure to what the needs are your capital projects are kind of in between that because those are two three year projects that you're spending down so we take the purpose of the phone and the needs and then match the security and then you did mention that one of the funds were was 100% collateral collateralized that some of the money that we invest with the state and then you said something about it is

[01:11:00]
100 collateralized is the state has Bank deposits in their local government investment pool so the state treasurer's office manages a local government pool that you're part of and within those Investments they use Bank deposits and those Bank deposits are 100% collateralized for disclosure I oversee that fun so I know exactly what's in there okay so I think I just with the kind of the volatility in your seen things going on at the bank I just wanted to just have a conversation that our money is safe we are we're we have a strategy as to how it's being invested and we're not going to have to go to the federal government to have insurance money and you own the federal government you owned by the federal government thank you

[01:12:00]
crazy like 10510 % collateralization for any money we have in our checking our checking account fantastic thank you any other comments question mark thank you so much always learn so much item for discussion is I don't see update on the fiscal year 2023 budget and pre-planning for fiscal year 2024 already okay thank you

[01:13:00]
going out of my stuff here Madam chair members of the board as you mentioned I'm here to give an update on the fiscal year 2320 233-2024 so in this presentation we will have an introduction by our Chief Financial Officer in Apodaca and then we will discuss where we are in our own process for this year and then we'll show up on our enrollment will go over preliminary projected revenue and expenses or if we will show where we intend to use that additional funding that we received and we will display how the budgets are aligned to the goals and will end with a budget narrative given by Renee with that I will turn it over to the CFO

[01:14:00]
for the introduction to our FY 24 budget okay thank you madam chair board members Dr Bowman thank you for the opportunity to discuss the upcoming 2324 operating budget for APS I just want to just reiterate that this is discussion only and we'll be coming back for approval next month period because we have to start somewhere we have to get to a point where we can basically start the engine and we and our budget is our best estimate its

[01:15:00]
best projection how we ensure to to align with the Board of Education goals honor the guard rails and support student outcomes additionally as you are aware we come with budget adjustments all throughout the year so yes it is definitely a living document with a starting point with adjustments every single month I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Montoya or her presentation thanks for that so if you go to the next slide please the next one next okay so here this is the one we show every presentation it's just a year round calendar and really with our own calendar we're always working in multiple years so right now we are finishing up and projecting what

[01:16:00]
will end in FY 23 where building the budget for halfway 24 and of course we're looking towards how our budget will look and if my 25 once the answer but funds are gone so in our year on calendar you'll see that we attended Peds spring budget workshop and it was very nice seeing some of you at that workshop and we've worked on what we are showing you here today and so we have compiled the data next slide we have compiled the data and checked everything thoroughly to ensure that all pass legislation is included in our budget the budget analyst have each uploaded the operational budgets for which they are responsible for into Lawson which is the aps current enterprise resource planning system and we will soon

[01:17:00]
upload the capital and Grant budgets we will then convert that upload to obms accepted cost accounts and once converted the budget will will then be uploaded until BMS so we will present the budget for board approval on May 24th 2023 and once approved we will post into OBS for p e d approval then once we have approved have received approval then we can post the budgets into Lawson's on July 1st to clarify that when I say we've uploaded the budgets I'm referring to the date that has been entered into our system so it's entered but we will not post until

[01:18:00]
we want the funds to be available so that's the difference between the upload and the posting next so this again is just a reminder that our enrollment does continue to decline but Although our enrollment has continued to decrease and we are funded on our enrollment we have had an increase in our Revenue this is due to the public education department increasing the unit value in order for us to facilitate the changes that the state has implemented through legislation next so will begin with our resources for FY 23 the s e g was 800.6 million and we had to revert 13.2 million that was because not

[01:19:00]
lullaby schools participated in the Extended Learning Time program because at the time they were budgeting giving us extra money for those that decided to go in do the eltp so let me see we budgeted 15.9 million in other Revenue which includes the mill Levy and federal and state and direct funding and then for fy20 for the scg is projected to be 903.16% unit value increase and we don't foresee having to reverse this year so there's nothing in that box and then our revenue is projected to be 18.3 million in other Revenue so and this is mostly going to be due to the indirect cost funds that we will rent anticipate receiving from the

[01:20:00]
playing expenses of the SR funds so that brings our resources to 9 2 1. 4 9 5

[01:21:00]
into departments and 77.6 million for district white costs with a projected deficit of 6.2 million so we are starting at 1:24 in better shape than we did FY 23 next thank you this light shows projected resources of 921.4 million expenditures of 927.6 million giving us that deficit of 6.2 million and we have multiple plans for how we can cover this we usually or we may have a unit value increased like we did this year and that comes in January

[01:22:00]
which will more than likely cover that but if that does not occur we can use an extended Esser funds as our second option or we can use any savings through vacancies or other unused funds to cover that and of course if that still didn't come to pass we have a fourth option in that our last resort is to use some of our emergency funds or what we sometimes refer to our cash balance or fun balance next so I wanted to show a comparison of are adjusted budget kind of was saying that it's a living document and kind of show from where we started with 23 budget and where we projected to end with the 23 budget so in the First Column that's at 5:23 how we begin

[01:23:00]
that 10.3 million deficit the second column is where we project to end up by 23 and this includes that adjusted unit value increase which brought our resources from 803 to 8 2 1. 1 4 4

[01:24:00]
we had to do a lot of legislative increases right so the first one is celery increases that it takes up 40.2% of that 100 million the 1140 instructional hours will take an additional 13 million the EA's going to 25000 per year is will take an additional 8.495% will cost 6.1 million Subs increase of 3.7 million differentials another 3.7 million or utilities costs have risen and we are projecting that they will be an additional 2.8 million

[01:25:00]
and of course that's also to cover the additional extra days and then we had an increase of 2.7 and instructional materials the principal responsibility Factor will cost an additional 1.7 million the Fine Arts Factor 1.1 million and then we budgeted $500,004 compliance and feminine hygiene products of another 500,000 which brought that to 1 0 0. 1 9 5

[01:26:00]
with with our templates you know our budget so that the principles could give us this information and so these are the results of all the compiled information for the elementary schools they aligned most of next slide for the elementary schools they align most of their operational money towards goal one in the amount of 73.5 million they aligned 44.7 million to go for 41 1.1 million to go to 25.527% went to go 1:22 to go for 21% to go 3

[01:27:00]
13% goal I mean 21% go to and 13% to go 3 next the middle schools align most of their operational funds towards goal to in the amount of 26.026 million about 26.26 million followed by 20.1 million to go for 12.4 million gold 3 and 3.6 million gold one next percentage wise it looks like this 37 of the funds went to go to 229 to go for 18% to go 3 and 5 to go one next

[01:28:00]
moving on to the Kate schools and they align most of their operational funds towards goal to also in the amount of 6.4 million closely followed by goal 1 at 6.3 million 3.3 million to go for and 2.9 Million To Go 3 and next percentage wise that came out to 32% to go one and an equal 32 percent to go to I thought that was interesting and then these other two are both 16% to go for closely followed by 15% to go 3 next the high schools online most of their funding to items related to go three in the amount of

[01:29:00]
82.5 million followed by 47.4 million a line to go for and a half a million to go to I don't know if that was just that was interesting but then next percentage wise that was 57 percent to go three 37% to go to and a little under 1% to the go to next so we thought we'd see what it looked like overall so all schools combined they aligned 115.4 million of the funds to go for closely followed by gold three at 1 1 3. 3 5 2

[01:30:00]
text and percentage-wise that came out to be 28 percent of the budget is the line to go for 27 of the budget is aligned to go three 20% is aligned to go one and 18% goal to so now I have completed the numbers portion of the presentation and will turn it back over to renette to give us some context to these numbers thank you thank you thank you for all your work on this and your department this information that we presented to you courses operational is about 90% salary period

[01:31:00]
are the salaries so the salaries that this one time I went over include teachers EA administrators custodians police we also have funding in there for substitute for some professional development for supplies for equipment and then most important for all the district expenses such as utility and internet because we got to make sure and keep the district going there is other funding and we will be reporting to you when we come for the final approval of this funding is related to title one another funding and a lot of that type of information on that funny and I'm going to share

[01:32:00]
information that we are receiving a so like for goal one we have received information on high-quality instructional materials that will be supported such as foundations also some 9 to 12 Ela materials and supplemental novels there is funding for I don't know how to pronounce this but I think it's Haggerty phonics that's correct and also professional development for One support specialist who will be providing training on letters that accompany the foundation kids also professional learning opportunities for adoption process of standards of high quality instructional material related back to the Haggerty

[01:33:00]
when is professional development that is in both in English and in Spanish and it is for pre-k to 3rd graders there's also funding for support specialist instructional support specialist literacy support Specialists and there is also training in the science of reading and effective early literacy strategies additionally we have obtained some information on implementing structured literacy with both printed and online materials a support for some reading resource teacher and also online training for able to see that that funding will help support one as far as we have high quality instructional materials in math materials

[01:34:00]
Minneapolis manipulative kits we have a professional development for i-Ready also for elementary math support specialist continuing with the PD for math there's PD for illustrative map IXL math also professional learning communities with MC square out of New Mexico State University and also secondary math support specialist additionally there is online curricula related to i-Ready and resource teachers for gold 3 we have obtained some information of computer science teacher support specialist also new curriculum for advanced placement in order to fulfill 3 we have to make sure that there's

[01:35:00]
opportunity for all the students to take the classes that we want them to take advantage of so we have to make sure that there are classes in a p in the language in classes to be able to get the certificate so that is very important to have those to support both three in Gulfport we have received some information on professional development in Selden strategy mathematical mindset we also have funding for Behavioral support Specialists professional learning on scl and aim coaching and classrooms on classroom management and positive behavior support of development of scl Standards online to collaboration for academic emotional learning

[01:36:00]
also curriculum and training for non-violent Crisis Intervention a social emotional support social communication support Behavioral Management specialist and we do have money for monthly parent training online training for EA's so that is all related to go for also we wanted to make sure that the guard rails were honored so we have some examples of that on guardrail number three that the superintendent will not allow crickets online and you saw some of that in the adoption of the STL that came earlier and also the adoption of the Mask also the superintendent will not exclude parents and legal guardian student and Community there

[01:37:00]
the community meetings that you all were involved in and we were also there also there was strategic plan community meeting and there is instructional council meeting or the superintendent will not Implement programs and procedures without staff voice again the instructional councils are very important for that also all budgets have an email to teachers and that was part of the negotiated agreement so we are working very hard to ensure that our funding is aligning with the gold honoring the guard rails and most important me for student outcomes so as I said at the beginning this is you know our our discussion our discussion so you can kind of see what we are doing what we're putting together for the final presentation in May so we can stand for

[01:38:00]
discussion for your comments for your feedback for your recommendation all right thank you so much for all that information because how you guys have had a lot of conversations a lot of data a lot of information coming your way so I'll just open it up for discussion board member Peterson's you want to start to have a question you look like you're ready let's see when when is I'm curious what percentage of the Department of budget includes personal that are actually School Bass like your nurses considered part of the department budget or are they part of the school budget we actually we budgeted it all to the department but in the presentation we have pulled out the portions that go directly to the schools and include that in the school budget

[01:39:00]
so it's kind of like a compilation of them the two but yes the way we have it shown here we pull out all the Departments staff and put them in that are directly related to school and include that in the the school number okay so the department budget really is going to people who are not directly in schools it's it's yeah the department is just the part that's not directly in schools correct and I think you answered it around 90% you know I know there's been a middle school task force that's been studying Middle School this year and really looking at what we need to do to make middle schools more appropriate and effective for first students there do you know

[01:40:00]
Urban much cross pollination between that conversation and what's happening with the budget for middle schools I'm not sure I could speak to that myself but I don't know if any of the associates would be able to speak a little bit more on that thanks Eugene Peterson we started back in October with the middle of January we have not brought those recommendations for work yet we are working on a presentation that we will share with budgetary so that we can look at that after we've worked with ATF and the principals

[01:41:00]
what those suggestions might be as we going to move forward with that work is there any way to pull that work together before we do the final budget approval I think that's I think that's possible I think one of the things that we found in the budget discussion or the discussion with the task force was not necessarily Financial so much a lot of those realigning how the school's operated around how they operate within the school itself already so a lot of the work that the principles are doing now in the middle schools is really taking a look at their budgets and how they're lining it to the goals and making sure that that answers some of the task force forces request right so those those principles are very aware of like you know making sure that those things fit into place thank you for that I look forward to having a presentation

[01:42:00]
Gulfport I think for making sure we're really appropriate with the students let's see I know you mentioned a number of programs looking at social emotional well-being is there a specific designation that's focused on restorative practices because I think a lot of us have concern that that we haven't really started a real implementation plan I mean leadership may have but it hasn't really come to us and so it's concerning the information that I have currently I cannot tie that together but I will definitely follow up with that to be able to report that on our final presentation okay thank you and

[01:43:00]
high school I know there's nothing designated for the first goal or we couldn't see it but high schools do receive newcomers that have very limited backgrounds and literacy and so I don't know that I need a real answer right now I just wanted to highlight that hopefully there is some acknowledgment that there's still a role in literacy development at the high school level and that there needs to be continuous ongoing support for students that haven't gotten quite where they need to be for Success so that's that's the final thing as well as I hope we can get a copy of the presentation I really appreciate

[01:44:00]
so I think that the excellent presentation by the way thank you so much the one thing that kind of popped out to me was I noticed Miss Apodaca when you were discussing some of the funding that was going to support goal number 3 I didn't hear mention or maybe I missed it of like CTE programs and specifically towards industry certification I heard a lot of going to April I agree and you're in your analysis of it was spot on but that is the two pronged goal and so I'm just wondering was it was it just not pulled out for this presentation or are we finding that the high schools are not actually allocating to CT we are still in the process of gathering data and and I

[01:45:00]
that we are still actively putting this together okay and I will make sure that the city is the address okay yeah I mean it's part of the goal so it's and that's not necessarily something towards you but again like a general statement that goal is out there so our Administration and and schools need to remember that and then I think for goal number for again you were listening several programs and this is where I will defer to board member console us because she has more expertise in this but what I did notice is that seem to be a lot of different programs which I don't know the benefit or the benefit of those but we don't have a specific evidence based in a line tool designated yet

[01:46:00]
so I guess I'm wondering when that aligned tool is going to come and I don't think that's a you question but shouldn't be spending on goal for a line to the tool that we eventually get for goal for texting and a ask for that has come to Bridget steering committee so it's definitely on our radar I think the superintendent to talk about us probably having to go to a request for proposal so that's why he didn't really want to elaborate a lot to not take the process but yes it is on our radar there's already going to see that very very soon and then just the third thing is you mentioned that

[01:47:00]
call the you said all the budgets were sent to teachers sorry the budgets were sent to All the teachers is that what you said yes I was contacted by the by the Union early and they said that within a negotiated agreement that that was one of the things that the teachers wanted to see each school budget so we asked the principles to ensure to send that out to be in compliance with the agreement okay so we're being very transparent about how our money is being spent and where everything is going okay that's that's wonderful to know thank you thank you thank you and I just want to Echo my appreciation and kudos to all for the presentation but also the frequency of the presentation is the fact that we're having these every month and that they're increasingly developing on each other it's just tremendously helpful so many thanks for that

[01:48:00]
books that are final conversation in May on the 24th is much less stressful than last year so I really appreciate all the work that you've put into it for that I did have I'll start with the question that sort of builds off member Jackson's question around goal for was just noting that when you had the add up of all of the schools it was 28 or 115 million going to go for as the highest which seems high when there's not yet a clearly articulated strategy for how we would increase the percent of students who demonstrate the skills mindsets in habits most aligned to life success and so I wonder what's going on there I think frequently in education in schools we treat everything else as seal so extracurriculars feel free trips you know anything else I just would want to to fly that I think some of the programs that you mentioned in terms similarly

[01:49:00]
can be piece meal without a broader strategy for understanding how we're going to really work on the social emotional competencies and really embedded into the academic development as well so I think that's just a flag for us and administration to keep our eyes on I don't think it's necessarily any change required from a budget perspective but that one did raise my eyebrows that's not a question that was a comment the second because the second is the trend does not seem sustainable to continue to have expenditures that

[01:50:00]
one thing that would be helpful and I think very in line with the economics training as well would be to see a 5-year forecast and so I just would ask is that feasible possible and it doesn't have to be anytime soon can certainly be after we approve the budget and after we you know consider potential other changes that we want to make based on what's happening with ERS as well but I do think seeing a five of your budget that includes the big Revenue drivers which is obviously Personnel but broken out you know salaries and benefits and whatnot as some of the models that genomics is shared and so the question is like does that make sense from your perspective based on what you've learned and what's the both feasibility and the time frame for when your shop might be able to get to a point of presenting your budgets or five your forecasts so annually we try to have the budget like document which does do the five year forecast and all that we in the past have sub

[01:51:00]
asbo for the meritorious award and but a couple of years passed without the book so this year we have worked on compiling 3 years of data so that we can be ready to roll that out again this next year so we should probably be expecting to see that starting in October November of 2024 we will have the budget book which does have a 544 of what you guys may have seen the executive summary that we presented that one year so we will be doing that board member Gonzalez I agree in in the studies that we have gone through to through economics tonight

[01:52:00]
very big on how they teach to be able to do the forecasting so I agree with you that's something that we have been discussing so I agree that's something that we are starting to implement into our process period thank you and if I may board member Gonzalez one of the things this conversation has come up over the years one of the challenges is that when how does our finance department get a solid estimate when the state gives us a one year budget and so much of our funding comes from the state so the expenditures I believe they can get fairly solid on but then you know when the state when they kind of change things around and raise salaries and stuff like that it makes it pretty tricky to kind of move out five years into the future but I know they're working on it yes and to that point when we do do the forecast

[01:53:00]
set alarm for 5 years we do have we do assume that the revenues pretty much stay flat or are going on on the same Trend but we can forecast our expenditures pretty well and we just kind of assumed that that's going to cover it somewhat well I mean with the continued decline in an enrollment also presumably in places in pre-k buns should we expand on the really thinking of that we know those that big substantial additional funding from this is 247 million that we have is going away at the end of this next year and we do have some ft on there not many that we're going to have to pull back and

[01:54:00]
they're expenses that we're going to continue having to support the operational knowing that our declined is still going down so we have been thinking about all that keeps us up at night I believe that so to build on that line of questioning regarding forecast like it's been at least 20 years more than that there's been a decline in our state budget going to education and so does that has that in the past been part of your forecast as well I mean we never what we can always count on is that raises are fully funded and and there's got to be some method to that Madness

[01:55:00]
is that also included in some way yes we have to consider everything right so and we run multiple scenarios as to what if this goes down what if that goes up one thing that we do know enrollment is going to be going down and it seems to be a trend Nationwide we meet with a genomics and they you know they have monthly meetings where every all the districts get together and kind of speak to what's happening in their districts and and this is a trend that's happening Nationwide it's not right you know just us so we know that this will probably continue to happen so we know that there's so there's certain things that we we know as backs and other things that were kind of either have to keep flat you know when we're doing our projections and and then we kind of you know look at it and doesn't seem right you know we just have to run all those different stereos

[01:56:00]
I mean if I don't know if you've ever seen the scg but even the funding from the state all the different and why we say projected here on our Revenue cuz we don't even know that that for sure is our Revenue we haven't received our final 9:10 B5 from ped so what we've done is we've taken all the little parts that they've given us you know the 0.5 of this has gone up 2. 5 5

[01:57:00]
yes you do you work your card and you're always prepared did I understand correctly that in in in previous years you've you've you mentioned an award for budgeting of 5 years old is that correct yes so in in Prior years we have submitted budgets are our budget in the budget book form to as well for for the support and they have received the award it has not occurred for the last few years I believe and so that's why it was so difficult we were trying to get it submitted this year for the FY 23 budget but along with all our other work and everything we just could not get it done so many things happen but we're close to at least getting

[01:58:00]
next year's budget comes we can put input that and be cuz there is a deadline for that and I think it is in October that we're supposed to submit that and so hopefully this year will be able to get that in and get back on track with putting that well I think it speaks highly of the department right because that's been in that's been the ammo until recent hiccups so thank you one more question and it has to do in in your listing of reading programs and I am not an elementary school teacher butt butt butt in speaking with teachers and and you know when I'm invited into elementary schools and I hear conversations that's what his prompted this question

[01:59:00]
I'm not familiar with programs that serve special education children who have been identified with dyslexia and so I don't know if if or other needs right but but it occurred to me as you were listening that we need to be aware of how we are addressing our special education kiddos in addition to the newcomers Insurance to us

[02:00:00]
to write to clarify or to help clarify so thank you very much probably and so I'm going to start out right away with with go for and I see all these programs and the school's using this program and the school's going to use this program and you know it's a mismatch of all kinds of different programs and since every school is different one program might work better for one school then it might for another school but I'm just I would just like some clarification about how that's just going to work and how it's going to really you know if we don't have that tool yet how are we going to find out if all those different programs are really going to align with the tool that ends up getting chosen so I know

[02:01:00]
so you already heard it and I think you've heard this as well from Member Peterson is when we're looking at you know literacy at middle schools and also at high schools we need to make sure that those needs are met for those children that didn't receive it for whatever reason at the elementary level so I don't know how we can check on that to make sure that there are those programs at the middle and the high school level for those children that didn't get what they needed for whatever reason so we could do that that'd be great this is just a question maybe I don't know who would have the answer to it but when you're looking at you know we have this much money that's in this pot and this much money is in this pot what do you see that looks different from last year to this year I would say that

[02:02:00]
the work that's been done in the goals in the guard rails where people are talking the same language you know everyone is talking the same language and and having that understanding that at the student outcomes come first and in order to support the students we have to meet the goals so I think it's really setting the tone for the district that everyone is speaking the same thing regardless if its operational or title one or we all have that mindfulness I just wondered if it looked at you know or they can put more money into this program that they did last year I mean I just wonder what that what that looks like you know and and you're probably correct there might have been some of that discussion as they're talking you know at the school level and unfortunately

[02:03:00]
but I would probably imagine the same also and we have to do this so we have to put this money here and so then I know that 28 percent want to go for etcetera etcetera and so then there was about was at like 7% that was in other and other I don't remember what the number with the number was yeah for all schools 7% went to other okay and so what is I mean I'm sure it was a thing so it definitely was a myriad of things it really since this is our first year and we really haven't had training or like you know a starting point is to what to to consider all this some people didn't think anything should go to other cuz they could somehow tie it into one of these goals right where others felt like maybe a custodian

[02:04:00]
didn't fit into any of these or some are saying yes it does because it helps you know a good place helps them to learn better so it was kind of you know depending on what the mindset was of the individual that was building the budget so I think that's why you're seeing some of that in other because even though probably a lot of that money that's another could really have gone to one of these goals but without the training as of this point you know if they didn't know exactly how to relate it back to one of these they just put it in another cuz I'm wondering would like science that's not exactly one of our one of our goals or they thought about music and art and they thought maybe that doesn't fit in so I'm just that would just be interesting yeah that would be and that's where I would think it would go but I'm just what that's for some people would put it but everybody might not

[02:05:00]
might not do that so that that would just be interesting to me to see what they decided was other and so I know that you did say that we're in a better better shape this year as compared to last year and so why do you think that is it just because we have a smaller deficit to deal with I mean what what reason did you have for that we have more money well I I do feel that the the state really LFC and everybody has been working together and last year they had I mean I don't think this is all of it but last year they did ask me for all my data and how I calculated it and everything especially with the raises and so I gave them that day and then you know I wanted feedback too if I'm calculating this wrong and budgeting too much in some area that's not

[02:06:00]
going to be used I want to know also but they never came back to me stating any errors in my work but I think they may have learned from from looking at that data because this year for most cases we were budgeted fairly closely to what the cost was going to be the only one where we really saw underfunding was the easiest to 25000 that one was the area where we were most underfunded and I believe that it may have been because they didn't realize that all of our ears are licensed and so far is District every single EA will now be at 25,000 whereas I think they probably thought of it as a portion right that they saw our ease and thought probably 70% are going to be our licensed in the other ones are not so we'll give them enough for that

[02:07:00]
I don't know exactly but I would say that that might have been the case period I wanted to to respond to the previous question then also to this one so I just to underscore what our budget folks are doing here they did they took the goals and you know as you know they were recently approved and we try to communicate that out but you point out a very accurate concerned so from a data perspective you know what does it actually mean to say that these dollars are attached to this particular goal and you're kind of pointing out like what is that is it is it really go one is it go for is it other and I think what you have right now is we've done the best that we could kind of getting this really fast time frame and gotten folks used to the idea of saying hey you need to attach your dollars to a particular goal

[02:08:00]
but we are there is another body of work that we are going to have to undertake which is to come to a collective understanding of what that attaching means and then training and communicating that with all of our staff and all of the like everyone who touches that budget so that they understand what it actually means and then also share that with you all so that we all can speak the same language with respect to the the the allocations because it might be that the other category should be really big if we chose a very narrow definition of what is truly attached to a particular goal or it might go to 0. 0 0 5

[02:09:00]
dissemination that we're going to have to go through so this is one of those things next year a comparison of the percentages that we did right this year compared to the ones that we're going to be able to do next year is probably it's not going to be an apple Snapples because we are going to be a lot better and more precise with that so yeah just wanted to share that piece so that you'll remember to do that next year it was the subject of a number many hours and intense conversations and yes it's not going away lots of things that teachers do in the classroom are very much related to a literal and the untrained eye

[02:10:00]
one may come in and say why in the world are you doing that and if you take the time to actually talk to the practitioner that's doing it there is a very viable and appropriate answer to that so I think in developing the budget it really reflects that too that Educators know that for instance doing a science experiment may not look like it's tied to literacy or a math goal but very much is because out of that you're going to end up with calculations and writing up the report of what happened in all of those things and so I think that there is a very legitimate pushing that sometimes takes the dialogue with with like that so that is not to say that

[02:11:00]
there shouldn't be a standard but how we developed the standards and guidelines should really be based on practice and that discussion of what impacts children culturally appropriate material may look like it's the extra out there where is in fact it's very essential to to one of the other goals so I think it's going to be a real Dynamic process and I appreciate the fact that it's not just a simple straightforward calculation and I mean I think that we're going to always want to have the other like we don't want there to be like 0% in there too but I don't know what we would think was the right number what's the right percentage to have another I have absolutely no idea I don't think they're probably as one either but it's 7% is that too much now is it going to be you know I don't know I would lean towards doing

[02:12:00]
something like getting a really precise understanding of what the connections mean and then seeing what the other percentage looks like and then try to collectively try to increase the amount that's allocated to The Chosen goals so so not necessarily particular level but looking to reduce the amount of other over time understanding it's not going to ever go to zero but at least it shows that we are spending more of our dollars towards the direction of the board has decided to go yeah thank you for all your hard work I appreciate you okay and you know and I was just going to add that what I would have been imagined that happened if I was like principal or I was at school site and I look at the goals you try to say like which is the one that I fit into the best right so I'm not surprised that there's that's the first glance that they do was like oh I'm high school so go three

[02:13:00]
is really mine this is belongs to us at high school and yes we're the only goal really out of all of these probably goes across all of them is poor because four does give everybody an opportunity and it should be across the the mines I mean across the board on a K12 piece that we're trying to improve you know the skills the mindsets the habits that are aligned to life success so I would think the schools would think I'm going to have a portion of that for sure and so and if you take all that it's going to add up and that's going to be where some put some money in there so it went up you know when a higher that way but I think is you know the the part that is difficult and this is on us is the board is board member to me just said is that we don't have a lot of clarity on that on that bowl because we still don't have a tool we don't have we don't have some articulated interims for it so it's really been hard and

[02:14:00]
I think it's our first stabbed and everybody's taking their best shot at it but I'm not surprised that it was high because I think it's the one place where every school probably felt I have to have I have to have some skin in the game on that on that goal go for it cuz it's the one that is definitely you know we I would imagine they're probably all thinking we probably have two goals we should be addressing tools our main goal and the other goal so that's good but I also just want to Circle back because I think stop it you said something really important the beginning is that our budget is also made up on the operational side 90% of it is staff so even on that SEL side it's it's a it's a it's a it's a staff person somewhere that's a sign that has been given some sort of I guess a value if you will around to the work that they're doing and it's assigned to that

[02:15:00]
and probably was it a vision or a thought from that the local level is like well they're not teaching math they're not teaching English you know they're not doing those pieces but they're doing maybe some of the others things that are connected to what brings the students together art music counselors nurses in all of the other pieces that were attached to that so in that particular side of it that we had what was budgeted there it's probably but it would be interesting to see what's the percentage or what are the types of staff that are attached to that because I think that will really help us also understand so what are the trade-offs I guess are you will it's like where where they're putting that stuff to account for the work that's all so supporting students around that piece and you're right I mean board member pointing out it's probably all the extra curricular

[02:16:00]
you know those pieces that are attached to that but I think if we have well-rounded schools right I mean I think the goal is that we're going to have well-rounded schools and if they're all operating from that you know that whole child perspective to once we do have a tool and we're doing that because that SEL side of it also belongs in goal one go to and go through I mean there's a portion of that that's all so it's also should be brought into to the work that's being done as we teach Ela math and career Readiness so I just want to play that but I just wanted to say thank you too I know you know having watched budget development over the years this is been really helpful and what I really just want to say and express

[02:17:00]
play gratitude for the flexibility to women have brought to this process because you have you have really engaged in this process in the conversation and really have stepped up if you will to wanting to to help us to realize and visualize a budget that really makes sense around these buckets and things that we're trying to do so I just I just really appreciate all the hard work that you can imagine the conversations you guys are having I would love to be a fly on the wall sometimes because I had to imagine that it's like oh my God we're either on target oh my God what are we going to do so I hope that we've created you know a sense of reassurance to from us because I think you need that from the board as well that I acknowledge that you're moving in this great Direction that's giving us a sense of like okay we we understand where we're going and it's I really

[02:18:00]
appreciate that you have wanted to walk this walk with us so thank you so much all right so thank you I think we're moving on when was the last one all right so our next finance committee meeting will be held on Wednesday May 24th 2023 at 5 p.m. in the John Milly community board room Dallas King educational complex and all the way at www.aps.edu so we're adjourned for this portion of the meeting and we are now going to go into part two I know it's always so much fun all right so so we're at the special Board of Education meeting and I want to call this meeting to order so can we have a roll call for the special board meeting agenda on Twitter

[02:19:00]
Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson Dominguez Jackson all right so now I have to remind the board members that if we've got some consenting items so before we make that motion just want I need a motion that if there's any changes that we need on this let's make sure we have those I will move that we adopt the April 26th 2023

[02:20:00]
did you have a second yes Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes yes yes but you Jackson yes okay so now we're going to the consent agenda and this is consideration for approval of the items approved by the finance committee so this is where we're going to move items I'm looking at it it would be items three five 14 and didn't we just have to take them off I always get confused no I think we took them because we took them off and voted on them separately so during the finance committee so I so on this we're just
