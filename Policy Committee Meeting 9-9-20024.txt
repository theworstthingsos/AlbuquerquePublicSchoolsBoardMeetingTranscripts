phone number to Minges we are streaming thank you good afternoon everyone I'd like to call this meeting to order Dr Albright may I have a roll call please Janella story Courtney Jackson Tennessee consider adoption of the September 9th 2024

[00:01:00]
I moved to approve the policy committee agenda for September 9th I will a secondary Johnson's here in no

[00:02:00]
number of 2023 the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education adopted its governance manual which incorporates the bull the boards goals and guardrails and its delegation and governance policies since its adoption the manual has been updated three times once to include language regarding the superintendent's evaluation another time to designate the board president as a contact for legal counsel and a third time to correct an Omission stating that the board vice president cancel for the president in case of absence the committee has now been asked to consider further amendments to the government's manuals specifically regarding the role of committees and committee chairpersons this is the first three for the Post Office the governor's manual will be posted for 30 days on the aps Board of Education

[00:03:00]
website for public comment it will then go before the committee for a second read and possible action and I believe that's scheduled for November and also like to add that I think there are two objectives for the policy meeting tonight one there's an immediate and then there's a long-term the immediate is to clarify the role and responsibilities of committees and committee chairs and under that object of we also have an opportunity to learn how we go about creating policy language while abiding by the many laws and rules involved in this process we navigate New Mexico laws and statutes APS staff policies and procedures and our own governments needs and we are a volunteer award we are not a paid or professional board several of our

[00:04:00]
Amber's work full time and so we must strive to create a system that accommodates full-time workers who have a desire to serve as Volunteers in support of our public schools and so this last Point Segways into a larger objective and that is to create a governance manual that and a new board member number turkey community that promotes transparency ongoing orientation or onboarding for new board members and Leadership capacity building and so to build that handbook I would like to ask a Committee Member to keep a running list of those items that may pop up tonight as distinguishable from policy that are more about process or procedures I will keep

[00:05:00]
running list is here next to me but I always think it's best if there are more than there's more than one person keeping track so on that note let's get started with the discussion and with the understanding that this is a teaching at a learning moment for board members and the viewing public let's try to refrain from the esoteric language of education is and abbreviations and mostly let's show Grace for one another as we go through this process and so with that will begin with sections of and that's been the proposed change is for it to read

[00:06:00]
roles and responsibilities are there any comments or discussion about questions about the changes that have been proposed I can start a little wonky for me so I would propose committees are open for membership throughout the year but serving members and committee chairs are elected at the first meeting of the year which also might provide a little bit of redundancy to 1 G because it talks about Board elections but that was just one suggestion I have this portion could you repeat that please

[00:07:00]
suggestion was committees are open for membership throughout the year but serving members and committee chairs are elected at the first meeting of the year and then again 1G talks about I think it is another point that talks about electing committee chairs so they might be there so could you clarify but serving members so you make the distinction I think it's good to make the distinction of able to go on the committee even though we're all able to show up to the Committee hearing or meetings and were able to put in questions there should be a distinction between who is able to actually have a voice on those committees so there isn't confusion

[00:08:00]
play members store if I can add to that I guess and I have some questions about this too and especially the at the first board meeting of the year the Edition I get my first question was what problem is this trying to solve the way it's written if it's at the first board meeting of the year and thereafter throughout the year then doesn't that mean always and if we want to make it clearer I would suggest something similar to what board member astorga suggested which would be committee membership is open to all members and our first appointed during but not limited to the first business meeting of the year so I guess my first question though to you share Dominguez is what problem were you trying to solve by adding this

[00:09:00]
play policy manual it was a suggestion that came to me and I accepted the suggestion just to open discussion I think it goes to the point of voting right and so do we want I mean I thought it was clear that committee were open for membership to all members but to be a voting member you had to self-select at the start of that when elections were held for committee chairs so I mean I mean it's a good discussion point do do we

[00:10:00]
want to to be Gatekeepers well I think I think the other issue is that the way that this is written is that again if you're trying to solve the problem of people understanding that they have the option to join a committee that's one thing but the 4hj the continents with 4hj in the manual in which it's the board president who actually has the responsibility to assign committee members so I guess we can't really understand how to write this until we understand what the problem is we're trying to solve so was was the problem that members didn't feel like they had the ability to join a committee or was the problem that there was confusion about who can

[00:11:00]
vote on a committee that's how I that's how I interpreted the question and the suggestion period is the number to of the committee is there is there a Committee Member who made that suggestion that can be elucidate a little bit it wasn't me so let's let's talk about that why is it so important that I mean we started with a committee of the whole and and we moved away from that so is it important that if I think the issue here from my perspective is one of voting having voting rights on the committee and that you in order to have

[00:12:00]
add those voting rights you have to weigh in at the first meeting of the year to commit to the committee does that make sense to others board member Astoria yeah I was just reading the book and I don't know if you are reading it for everybody so we know what we're talking about it says this and it would limit when committee what if someone's interested or obligations change I suggest changing it to committee they're open for the membership all board members and our first appointed during but not limited to the first business meeting of the year but I think for me that kind of provides a little bit of background to the confusion

[00:13:00]
because we do elect those people at the beginning of the year so if we leave it open there really is no way for us to change who are on those committees except for the next year so I think that might be some misunderstanding there or who can and cannot be sitting on the committee we can all attend them but the clarifying rule of who has the same thing and I and I think when really crucial thing to point out about that is committee members are not actually elected we don't have anything that says that they are elected all committee members are appointed and they're appointed through the role of the word president so we need to be sure that we're careful about not saying committee elections because we don't go through a committee election process in January we go through anomaly like a self

[00:14:00]
we we we we we we we we we need and then I believe looking at or Age 3 JT the board President appoints board members to serve on board committees unless specified otherwise I'm bored policies so it's it's important to point out it's not elections it's self-selection and then appointment now that being said who's to say that we all don't say that we want to sit on the finance committee and we all get appointed to the finance committee but the point of committees are open for membership to all board members historically when we first went through this process with the governing manual was because there was concerned that some people would be left out of the process but everybody is allowed to attend and everybody is

[00:15:00]
how to submit questions it's just a matter of who is actually sitting on that committee has the way I took that question is who has the right to vote but it's only the members of the committee correct and so what I see this question asking is how can we amplify that well I mean that's and that's it to my understanding is then we need to make it clear that if you want to the this is an important committee if you want to vote you need to sign on at that very first meeting you need to be clear that you need to make your wishes known that you

[00:16:00]
meeting of the year is that correct so in that I'm sorry I'm sorry remember a story about remember to marito feel free to jump in but if that's the case then the language that should be there as a suggestion would be committee membership is open to all members and our first appointed during but not limited to the first business meeting of the year you say that one more time committee membership is open to all members and our first appointed during but not limited to the first business meeting of the year so but not limited to because then

[00:17:00]
that suggests that at any moment you can ask somebody on to a committee okay yeah I mean it like it if we use the most recent years and example let's see it might even be the policy committee the policy committee at first was chair Dominguez board members and board member to morito but a month later I was appointed to the policy committee so I wasn't appointed Into Summer but I was appointed throughout the year thank you for sure and then so helps to to also clarify if let's say for some reason I can't fulfill my responsibility it allows me to hold off as well but there was also something that was said that I think we need to be really important really careful about this section is about all board committees this is not a discussion simply on policy committee all of

[00:18:00]
all of these amendments will always will also pertain to finance and to audit so I think we need to be really careful about focusing our lens solely on how this language pertains to the policy committee would I would like clarified however is voting voting rights being clear that I don't you know the reason I answered agreed and suggestion accepted what I took from this question was a desire to I think it's about voting and so

[00:19:00]
I think that's what I would like clarified here so if you don't if you don't make your wishes known at that first meeting are you not allowed to vote goes back to one see right or is it one day actually the board will consider voting on items by the committee discussion but they still have to say at those board meetings and also how people vote is is outlined in Robert's Rules

[00:20:00]
it's outlined in parliamentary procedure this is this section is not about voting this section is about admission to a committee or appointment to a committee I don't know who won I didn't know what the problem was I I guess I didn't even understand why there was an Amendment added to it I thought it made sense that it was committees are open for membership to all board members period so I didn't understand why why it had to be so specific

[00:21:00]
yeah and without that person's voice I don't know all I can do is is assumed that you know maybe there was again new board members may have a misunderstanding about whether or not they were allowed on these committees after the initial meeting that we go through this process again if board Services is listening that's just something the kids added to the discussion report at the beginning just to clarification that board that committee membership is open to all members

[00:22:00]
any parliamentary procedure to Robert's Rules Committee members have voting rights but you know to board members circus point it's merely to recommend policies to the board it's ultimately the entire board that is making the decision on any of this it's just recommending Powers it's not necessarily voting to approve certain policies so a suggestion that I might have is leave it at committees are open for membership to all board members period and then when you go and look at what is currently gee

[00:23:00]
what is currently G I would suggest using the language that we have in the are similar to what we have in the archived board committee procedure document that that says what does it say right now during its first board meeting of the year I would suggest saying at the first business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs in e in GG so because they're each each one is addressing different issues he is addressing membership

[00:24:00]
so instead of saying during its first meeting of the year the board will elect by the electric chairs by majority vote to the audit finance and policy committee or any standing committee of the board creates simply say at the first business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs period and then what that address is by simply saying standing committee chairs is it allows for the document to be fluid because we still have not gone through a committee diet well we have gone through we've started it but we're not we have not gone through a committee diet we we did a general clearing out but we as a board have not had that discussion on which committees were going to keep in which committees obviously we're going to keep financing audit but we have a board have not had

[00:25:00]
discussion so to eliminate the the need to come back and address this I would simply say it in G at the first business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs so we've jumped to G are we are we I just want to make sure that we are finished with Einstein about loading if we wanted to add and this is just throw out a pointed or something about that so that it's clarified that again serving members on the committee right so anybody can have interest in it as it says committees are open for membership 12 board members

[00:26:00]
but we just had a discussion about how the committee members are appointed so much I'm glad you brought that up because I think the the word the verb appointed implies that you're not self-selected is that what I'm hearing from you well that's what it is right where we can share interest in it but we're ultimately go back to the confusion of the question of Elections and we're not being elected to sit on a board or actually appointed I think that's important to put in there and you can raise it in any other way that you might find more comfortable but let's make that point so I'm reading the New Mexico School Board association's School Board manual I saw this terminology appointment but

[00:27:00]
as I continued reading I noticed that it threw me for a loop because an appointment is made by in our case by the president but it was it was clarified later in the manual that appointments can also be votes voted on by the board so I don't want the impression that I don't think it's wise to put that kind of power in one person to appoint members of the committee I don't think that's a good word to use so you know this year if we weren't appointed we self-selected we voice an interest and it was more fluid

[00:28:00]
then then and an appointment implies and so I want to steer clear of that that word but the language of the documents says a point board members to serve on board committees which documentary hours have abused any sort of authority to make appointments

[00:29:00]
and I have a real problem I'll tell you with the language about having to be elected to serve on national state and local boards that is severely inhibiting the participation of board members to participate in regards to our community outreach and engagement responsibilities so okay so I'll address that when we get to that point as a whole as a document for years as given authority to the board chair to do that and if we're going to substantially change how the board delegates that Authority then not needs to be a discussion of the entire

[00:30:00]
right now we are only revisiting the documents that were sent to us for four hours that is something that needs to be addressed if we're going to revisit in November correct correct but at the moment and yes these are tied these two sections are tied there will be implications for the rest of the manual but right now I'd like to finish up with this section e committee's committee membership is open to

[00:31:00]
call board members because that to me that feels more democratic and as it should be if you want to serve on a committee you should be able to to do so without being appointed correct I'm hearing that that is exactly how we do business now my suggestion was to end it at committees are open for membership to all board members period and then at the January meeting when the board chair or board president is as we go through that discussion she could just give a reminder that all members are open to the Committees you have the ability to self select sorry my dog is barking

[00:32:00]
oh thank you can you hear me yes go ahead tomorrow I think as a new board member in the whole process of the election that thorough and whether it's through this manual or whether to the government's menu is at least for me as a new board member it was trying to understand the process when in the midst of it sometimes your when you first come in you're trying to learn everything but it's not it's it's all so this area of now you're you're running for position now you got to do all these other roles and do everything but and even now it's one of trying to decide when do we get the insight into these elections and fully understand what these do mean as a new board member

[00:33:00]
I don't know if that's if I'm bringing up something new but I'm just trying to also as a new board member when you come in the votes taken and then you're just trying to figure out positions and doing what you need to but and sometimes just as we did now with two new board members in the executive committee it's it's learn as you go so I don't know I'm just throwing that out there as more of an understanding to how new board members will gather that information and able to make the decision they need to as the election process proceeds thank you for your perspective appreciate that so board member if we leave this

[00:34:00]
as committees are open for membership to all board members is that how what is not clear about that I think this to all board members with clarification that the understanding of the new board members this process is what is it called the process is just that these positions take on the roles and the importance of them yes and then you know because it is it's a part of really looking at time and you're looking at your your own schedule and how these all work out but

[00:35:00]
I'm just saying that because of an as an as a new board member the moment that happened we were really trying to understand the process and it just felt like okay you're going to get to know that you're going to get to know that but at the same time it was one of I wish there was like a little bit of time from the time you get sworn into a time to know if this is what you're going to do and this meeting prepare for it and look at everything but it was it was really hard to understand just the process of when you get sworn in and then you have the board meeting and it's it's all this energy that's at Peak and it leaves us in a position to really what okay we're going to do this now and we're going to move into this yeah and I just feel that more needs to go into training of new board members Tom

[00:36:00]
because I understand where you're coming from us and your board member and how it's a lot in the first business meeting right so wondering if there's any clarification if that's something that is statue that we have to have elections on that first meeting of the year or maybe we can do it like the second meeting of the year or something like that to give new board members more time to adapt to their role I don't know if anybody has information Council and in the room so I thinking he's going to bless us with his knowledge here in a sec and that is I think that is also a suggestion of Council of great City Schools is to have the elections maybe up the second business meeting and not necessarily at the first business meeting but what I'm also hearing is that the board orientation process needs to be

[00:37:00]
clarified and maybe made more thorough and so the good news about that is we have a year to work on that board orientation process and by that point all of us will be much more invested and understanding in sosg and the rules of the board and what we do so I think that that's something that we can we can work on I don't necessarily think it's going to be a policy committee that works on a board orientation that's something that we can leave to an entire board discussion but maybe again board service says if we could take notes on improving the board orientation process and we can put that down

[00:38:00]
for the orientation as well as probably when we have the orientation with potential candidates like their is some work that we could do as far as the information meetings that are set up about people and their interest in running for office Mr Melendez the question was is it required that the election for officers and committee chairs take place at the first meeting of the year when new members are sworn in is that required by law you're on mute short answer is no and the reason is that there are

[00:39:00]
officers serving in their position at the first meeting of the board new members of the board are sworn in and at that point you could have him vote as you have done or at the next meeting as a group the board can vote for the chair of the board it is not required to happen all at once it is a great suggestion to have an orientation free first meeting thank you for that clarification and and thank you to add I think we had a good

[00:40:00]
add orientation or onboarding system this year but we were lacking this piece and so just to be only because when we use the word all you know all and but then it's also one of these things where as as it's written it's also stating that all of us are on board of this decision making process and we're completely aware of what needs to happen but it's counted to that for new board members but thank you for checking that out I appreciate that board member before you mute yourself could you we had a question earlier about was

[00:41:00]
what were you were you concerned about the membership aspect or the the ability to join the conversation during the committee meetings I just think many times and this is only coming from a new board member and sometimes and sitting there you're trying to figure out just the process of your proceeding and moving along and so and possibly yes we going in there was the finance and then the policy committee and then there's the appointments of the president vice president and the secretary but really understanding even the amount of time that goes into that and if you choose to do that that's where you're trying to decide what is that require

[00:42:00]
now asking the question of somebody who did run for vice president and president about the time allotted especially for those who are new because I can tell you sitting on national boards this is a lot different this is a lot different than because it's it's more in there's a lot of work that needs to be done there's information that that needs to be obtained so it's it's it's it's it's just one of these things of being a little bit more aware and I'm sure if we did the onboarding training a little more with asking new board members their back their background as they come in so they fully understand that this with these rolls what kind of rolls are undertaking and I remember to the question that Courtney said about the governing versus your legislative duties so sometimes those things are clouded and so with our back knowledge you're trying to understand okay can I use

[00:43:00]
do I have to understand this process but I think if we looked at the terms of more education wise and how this works that would be very helpful thank you I'm getting all this down for handbook and also for future future back to the original language committees are open for membership to all board members can we move on period any questions about FFC suggest we just go back to the top of the document and go through it

[00:44:00]
okay sure because like jumping is a little bit of a challenge OK Google

[00:45:00]
okay well I again don't understand why this is in here the role of the superintendent is actually not to support the work of the chair of the committee if you look at 3B in the governance manual specifically States what the role of the superintendent is we also have in four queue the specific superintendent issues board members must remain mindful that District Personnel are the responsibility of the superintendent not the board the superintendent must listen to such concerns review the matter and notify the board of the resolution to the extent the policy allows so I think we already

[00:46:00]
have language in there that determines what the support of role of the superintendent is and so I don't again don't understand why this is being inserted into this document is anyone else as a first-time board member it's nice just to clarify in one spot right this is the rules and responsibilities so a lot of times we want we wonder like what role does the District staff have in it so I think it's just like a clean sentence to add as clarifying but I do also understand board member Jackson's point that it's already some

[00:47:00]
I think the intent was rules and responsibilities and that's kind of just lay everything out because if it's the first time reading it you're not going to know to go back and forth to see where those other points are hopefully that makes sense thank you thank you for that that perspective I would have to agree because you got to remember to we're not the only well many times as you go through this that's trying to make it to where it flows properly and also recognizing that yes as a board member that has been on their particular seat for a while they would understand where those pieces are but just as a new board member you're reading it here

[00:48:00]
or your there's a lot going on when you come on so if it's easy to read something that says oh okay we see this we understand it and easier to find it's very helpful I also want to go back to something that you said that the role of a superintendent is not to support the work of the chair or the committee can you what would you what would be a better sentence that if you feel like that is not the role the superintendent in this area well I guess let me let me clarify I think the role of the superintendent as a whole is listed in policy 3B there's a whole policy that determines exactly what the role is so I I guess I don't understand why we why there's a

[00:49:00]
prior to arriving at this one that perfectly outlines what the superintendent's role is so you know for example in recommending policy for board adoption the superintendent will identify when the board is required to adopt policy and you know that section 3B number I mean is the superintendent's rule three instead of the sentence that says superintendent is to blah blah blah can we just say that the superintendent throw is outlined in 3B yeah just inserted that

[00:50:00]
if we do that then we have to be consistent throughout the entire governance manual where we're going to have to go back in sight and if we take that that last issue with committee appointments then we're going to have to go back and cite that that's actually in for HJ or 4-H 3j so I kind of what I'm hearing the the concern of why we're having this discussion in the first place is that orientation to

[00:51:00]
committee rules and to the governance manual in particular needs to have a greater depth and breadth because it's kind of sounding like the pieces aren't being connected throughout the governance manual yeah appreciate the more of like the contract language type expertise that you have in the room we might have to change if we change some of these things so thank you for that but yeah I think that is part of it right that's part of the conversation is that we still don't fully have a true understanding and I think that's one of the major reasons why I did want a retreat was because this could be a space where we do go over this and if we have different interpretations of the governance manual we can talk about it there so yeah I think I think that's kind of part of

[00:52:00]
and these discussions so thanks for pointing that out and it definitely seems like it and and let me just State as well I probably spent just on this document 6 hours going back and forth trying to see where they were redundancies trying to see where they were conflicts so I'm Not tooting my own horn but I had to put in a lot of work to make sure that this document was consistent and so we I am happy to sit down with anybody to go through this and to say you know what's your question oh it's in it's in this section you know why do I think there's a redundancy oh because I found it over here why do I think there's a conflict because I found it over here but I had to put in work to understand

[00:53:00]
everything lined up so I'm happy to trust me I love this stuff so I'm happy to sit down with anybody I think what gave rise to this particular sentence was when we were trying to get this meeting together and there were there was confusion about who who who who do I go to I thought I was had to go to the board office staff but when we met with superintendent Durand it was she who clarified that she wants to be more point guard here and that we should be conversing with with her about a desire to move forward with a

[00:54:00]
committee meeting and if you look at 3 B3 there is there's nothing that makes it clear that within the within the roles and responsibilities of being a on a committee or being a committee chair that you have to that you should meet with the superintendent and so I think that's what this language is trying to to address is to make it clear that you go to the superintendent to request that meeting so if that's the case if this is trying to address process and that can be put into a how to manual that I believe

[00:55:00]
board chair Dominguez I believe you're you're working on right like the question is is when do I go meet with the superintendent that doesn't necessarily have to be in the policy that can be separated out into a how do I share a meeting how to guide right I mean it it seems like we're trying to insert into policy things that should be processed or procedure this is Ronaldo thank you Courtney for stating that and that's what needs to be done in the onboard training so that clarification right there helps us to understand these different Departments of policy process and how these all work that is vital to not only addressing some of these needs but

[00:56:00]
helps us as new and incoming board members understand the parts of and and just like you said the other night the governance versus the legislature the educational policies versus the governance you know I think just a basic 101 on the the simple parts and how they work would also help us to define the work and whether we are going about it the right way and that's why I think with even the training and all of that that will alleviate some of these conversations and that's all so as Janelle stated with the retreat how do we help answer these questions but at the same time make a better on board training for the next and incoming new board members that

[00:57:00]
then it helps us to understand that there is that voice there was no way we could have those conversations especially as a new board member you're just sitting there following the process but you're also wondering do I have a question where is this coming from and how does this work so I think once we start doing that it's going to alleviate these roles and these questions to wear probably even improve the jobs are doing so anyway I just want to put that out there thank you I think you make a great point I mean it again I'm just generalizing but it seems like a lot of these changes that we are attempting to address tonight more go to the the onboarding process the orientation process and and something that we're actually trying to get from a training or a retreat not necessarily something that we're trying to insert into

[00:58:00]
into our governance manual so it makes me wonder if it would make more sense to table this discussion until we've had the board retreat and the board training so that maybe those those key questions that that you have can be addressed there the policy manual or sorry the governance manual can remain as is until we address it in November just a suggestion and I currently know that right now with board member Dominguez there are some issues that she is seeing and and I know right now with not having a policy meeting as also put into question you know some of the processes that are in place but I think that you also have to remember that board member domain

[00:59:00]
this is not new like we are and so there's certain areas of concern that she really wants to bring up and I think that that those concerns are are vital as a new and incoming board I do wish that we did have better training so we could sit at this table honestly and do the work that needs to happen and I think the more we wait the more it's one of just it's also to take the word that we're going to do that because I don't want to delay just because we're trying to do what we need to do but I'm also trying to remember that board member Dominguez is has been here before and I don't want to delay it to where because I don't know what I'm doing but I would hope that with those who are on this committee we just let us who are new people know

[01:00:00]
okay this is how it works this is what because it's great the conversations we're having now with all the background knowledge has been very helpful so I just want to insert that I'd like to continue because I think this is good conversation and I do want to go back to 3B superintendents roll number three and I'm going to read it out loud in recommending policy for board adoption the superintendent will identify when the board is required to adopt policy or has statutory decision-making Authority that cannot be delegated to the superintendent and this the use of policy here I mean it does the superintendent have say on the on our government's manual

[01:01:00]
are you asking well I mean so I'm asking if according to 3 B 3 in recommending policy and this actually I'm bringing this up because board member astorga made the comment I think it was at Wednesday's meeting that we use this term policy and it's not it's it's it's it's it's it's this overarching word we use it as an umbrella term but really we're talking about we have several kinds of policies we have a government's policy we have educational policy that is Administrative have educational policy that is part of board policy

[01:02:00]
we are goals in the guard rails and so just I'm just going to drop that in everybody's here that that requires clarification and because we're talking currently about board governance and board committees I don't think it hurts to to clarify what the superintendents with regard to the governance manual and committees and committee chairs but nobody else is so I think a couple things that we really need to be

[01:03:00]
be careful about is you said that there are a bunch of policies but the board policies are the policies that are in the governance manual there's four of them there's goals there's guardrails there's delegation and there's governing those are the board policies and that process is done via do not come Focus governance Community engagement and Outreach and that's done with the entirety of the board making those policies which are those four policies any District policies that would be administrative or operational those are brought forth by the superintendent and that is done through the process that they have listed as an administrative pursuit or administrative policy

[01:04:00]
in PB 1 there's an entire document that talks about how and when superintendent Blakey brings forth policies to the board that are outside of our purview that are listed in the governance manual I needed to clarify because you said that we have educational policies we have administrative policies the only policies that we have are the are the set of four policies that are in our government's manual that's the preview of the board we don't have operational policies we don't have administrative policies okay so the question goes back to why we went to the superintendent to get this committee meeting set because in

[01:05:00]
there was nothing that I could find that made it clear that we that the committee chair or the committee had to go to to have a conversation with the superintendent and I think if that is the case then I think it needs to be here in the governance manual it is

[01:06:00]
I mean is the very first okay it's in 4k under board agendas the committee chair and superintendent or designee will start committee meeting agendas 4K 2 you you yes correct I think it's too hard you go to the superintendent and Dr Blakey on Spotify you go to the superintendent to set the committee agenda but again you have to be really does not just have to do with policy this has to do

[01:07:00]
was finance an audit all of the agendas so of course your meeting with the superintendent because all of this work has to flow from the superintendent if we're looking at Finance the finance chair Crystal couldn't possibly know all of the intricacies so it has you have to meet with the superintendent in order to set an agenda Madam chair on board member Jackson that I think that is how we were interpreting it is the the agenda items being created with the chair and the superintendent as like a good examples this particular meeting I think was just confusion based on the conversation about the November board meeting to review the governance manual and then

[01:08:00]
it just got some crosswires on if we were talking about the November meeting or calling a meeting prior to November for this particular meeting but normally the superintendent and the chair or the superintendent's designee set the agenda for committee meetings and I guess that was the yes that was a confusion we just went direct I was going directly to board staff assuming they were designated but you know what the speaks to is if I'm committee chair and I'm looking I'm going to go to this section to get guidance and and if there needs to be some redundancy a limited amount it's not it's not so bad to put

[01:09:00]
to read that bored chairs will meet with the superintendent to to support the work of the committee and the chair and I don't think it it it's one line I don't think it hurts and I want to go back to a point that I made earlier we are a volunteer board and with limited time and it's great that you know most people don't have six hours to go or an hour to go searching for this I think it's our responsibility to create a governance manual that is accessible to full-time working volunteers

[01:10:00]
to be elected to this position we put ourselves up we asked to be elected that means that we are required then to do the work if if you if we didn't want to do the work then we shouldn't have put ourselves up for election believe me I have a ton of other things that I can be doing but I am dedicated to my elected position as a board member so I take the time I find the time to make sure that I understand my governance manual and that I understand my role when I don't understand my role I reach out to other people who maybe understand it better that being said in I you have committee chairs will discuss agendas with the superintendent that is exactly

[01:11:00]
read a place where I've already said it's already listed in 4k but you could you could insert the language that's in 4k over to I you say the committee chair and superintendent or designee will set committee meeting agendas so you don't need to have a line that says the superintendent's rule is to support the work of the chair because you have it in I already did you repeat the the previous sentence so in I as you have it right now it says committee chairs plus one rotating Committee Member will discuss agendas with the superintendent and prepare agendas with the superintendent selected staff with the assistant of staff I would take all of that out and just put in

[01:12:00]
the committee chair and superintendent or designee will set committee meeting agendas that's directly from 4K to and that will go in I committing Committee Member and superintendent or does it need will set committee meeting agendas it's it's from 4228 because I think that's a perfect opportunity for Learning and just to go back to work tomorrow is like what are we doing how am I going to do this next year if I do want to become a committee chair I think that's a good place

[01:13:00]
to have a new member to kind of just model or mentor on what committee chairs do so I would suggest leaving that part in number tell morito yeah I agree I agree that you know I think that many times that we've come together in a meeting and we start talking and dialoguing come to find out that it's somewhere else and so it's just that clarification and I thank you Courtney for clarifying that but I also know that we just need to be a little more aware that figuring out where these things sits is all part of the process and I'm glad we're having these conversations

[01:14:00]
so as we move forward we just need to remember that we all are trying to get on the same page and I just want to recognize that thank you thank you so I hear we're going to keep what will borrow the language from 4K to insert it into I but I hear a desire to keep plus one rotating Committee Member and it speaks to the larger objective that I pointed out when we were introducing this this meeting or the purpose of this meeting and that is for leadership capacity building especially for very busy people so I'd like to go back to F just right above page

[01:15:00]
all meetings are open to the public and all meeting materials will be posted publicly 72 hours before the meeting all members are invited to submit questions how many days before is it 14 days is it 10 days could someone remind us well so again I think that that's I think we have a redundancy again the 72 hours before the meeting is redundant to open meetings at section 10 Dash 151 s which requires 72 hours so I don't think it's necessary that it's in the document and as far as the number of days we I believe that is in the board Services procedures

[01:16:00]
so it is also stated in our facilitators guide where there's a 2-week timeline so again I would be concerned about being overly prescriptive but I don't remember the exact date or number of time number of days so I'm going to weigh in as a someone who again is I know it's I know that we are aware of what the open meetings act says but new members and the public who have access to this I don't think we should have to go searching this is just a courtesy to have

[01:17:00]
this kind of information readily available but I'll listen to I would like to hear from other board members the only thing I would say before the governance manual needs to be brought enough that it can flow from year to year if there is a specific time that is something that can be in a process in a procedure or in a how to manual if the need to know that it's 72 hours has to be specifically now because for whatever reason that can be in a how-to guide that that can be separate but we're we need to professionalize this board a little bit we were not in the business of

[01:18:00]
does leadership building we are in the business of improving student outcomes and our responsibility is to know our manuals to know the statutes that that pertain to read the open meetings act that is two pages unless you want to go into the discussions where they give all sorts of different circumstances it's our job to know this stuff our job is to know it so that we can be more efficient so that we can improve student outcomes so does 72 hours need to be in there whatever but we have a job to do and we should do it you actually brought up a point that I was going to bring up

[01:19:00]
where it says all members are invited to submit questions if we are talking about s o f g and our time tracking I would change that language and and put something a little bit more like we're not invited we have to period so if we're going to leave that in I would say we're required not invited because then that can leave some room for different interpretations but yeah and then the number of days I would again just ask staff I'm not I don't have I looked for that number two and I don't have that exact number but I did want to make sure that that language if we're keeping it was ASG correct I love that all members are required to submit questions prior to the meeting and I don't know that we need to insert number of days because it might be

[01:20:00]
it might be different for a board meeting versus a policy meeting versus a finance meeting versus an audit meeting like I don't know if the committee if the staff has different requirements it is I think that's something that can be addressed in a board Services procedure and not necessarily here in the document so can we can we move on yes I would like to move on yes so we want to review is it important to to note that the board will elect chairs by majority vote to the

[01:21:00]
I thought we already discussed this one that it was going to be what we kind of we at first we said during a disturbing the first meeting that we were just going to leave it as standing committees but then with the discussion that art brought forth this is possibly the place that we could change it to during the second business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs period yeah I agree with that statement I do too

[01:22:00]
what about H committee chairs plus one rotating Committee Member will set we've covered this period and once I so in setting committee meetings there's a term calendaring that we learned at our meeting with the superintendent a calendaring committee so is there a meeting at the start of the Year where the policy committee or the audit committee or find all these committees set a calendar for the rest of the year

[01:23:00]
and what's the process for that so we can write it down I'm not sure because I haven't been superintendent during that cycle but I think I recall a meeting where the board all decided which in January what day of the week old of the meetings were going to be on and then we kind of calendar it from there I don't know if Dr Albright might know more specifics of how that's done she is a more experienced tonight yes you're absolutely right

[01:24:00]
superintendent Blakey the board decides which day of the week which day of the month and how often the Committees will meet after chairs have been selected it's part of the request asked during the election process so is that what we're referring to an H would you say yes that the committee chairs will set regular committee meeting dates with the superintendent does or designate and we don't need or staff right or or do we do not so if you put it's not what I'm getting at that's with that the committee or staff so committee chairs plus one rotating Committee Member will set

[01:25:00]
regular committee meeting dates with the superintendent or designees do we end up there I think it happens as a board altogether because if each one were to do it separately we could have conflicting times of what you know if the policy chair decided they wanted to do it Tuesday at 5:00 and then separately the finance chair did the same thing we would all be so it's usually done as a as a whole the board fights which days and months and how often but it's usually done as a whole board conversationally committee

[01:26:00]
is that the committee chair says I would like to have them on Tuesday mornings you know at 7:30 and then they kind of the board but the purpose is at the board figures out those dates as a full board so that it's not like piecemeal in different committee meetings when are we going to meet because there's overlap of some of the committee members and of the staff to be able to have all the meetings as well so it's usually a conversation that is done with the preference of when the chair would like to meet but then everybody kind of works around which days and times to take is that correct Dr Albright yes and in the past we've gathered that information in the board Services office and then it's brought to a board meeting for the whole board to agree on those dates and times but it can also be a discussion within immediate itself

[01:27:00]
a committee meeting Dr Albright know I'm sorry within a board meeting so that the entire board is part of that process so that the overlap doctor Blake he was just mentioning doesn't occur and art can I put you on the spot again isn't there is there a open meetings act resolution that requires that the since like something the president has to sign that says when when we're having when all of our dates are required to submit a document signed by the President says these are the dates that we will meet with notice

[01:28:00]
that would be when the document would be signed by the board president so so I do it so is it more services secondary to help the board as a whole make this decision controls and I will say if you said we will meet the first Monday of every month and there was a decision to meet at an additional meeting as long as you are in compliance with the open meetings

[01:29:00]
they have a meeting at all am I clear you cut out for a minute with the you said if the if there's a committee of four and they decide to meet outside of those established times it still considered a meeting on the 15th Tuesday on a different date than you set down in your original calendar it's a matter of just of notifying estate so if you if if committee say we're going to meet every other month and then a committee says no

[01:30:00]
no not really we need to meet outside of that then as long as you make it public you're okay yes my my experience is that a number of smaller school districts meet once a month and in January they say we will meet on the first Tuesday of every month during this year and they will send out the first Tuesday of every month for the meeting and they will get more and if you have four members and you say this is

[01:31:00]
the first is just to there is a resolution that the board once once the times have been decided there is a resolution that the board president has to sign and and submit so if the board votes president will sign the resolution of on which the board voted on yes yes yes yes yes okay and then second clarification so if there is a committee of four and that committee meets with three and the fourth can't be there or didn't know about it then does that constitute a meeting that notice should have been given

[01:32:00]
this is yes it's like the board says we are going to meet you give public notice you have to have a quorum however there has to be a quorum so if there are four members are a quorum or four members constitute the committee you say we're going to meet you give notice only three board members show up you still have given notice to the public that there will be a meeting today

[01:33:00]
a committee specific that's more of a board issue not necessarily a committee issue I understanding of the prior discussion was that the board as a whole will select the dates upon which committees will need so then H can be removed because that's a whole obligation

[01:34:00]
committees and so if it's a board action then it should be in a different section and I think it's already discussed in 4k so I don't know that age needs to be inserted except that there are other other meetings in my correct to set the agenda for like how do agendas get set for like this meeting for committee meetings

[01:35:00]
typically like the finance committee in the audit committee the staff that is connected to that committee sets the agenda usually the of items that have to be passed through the board for that month and then they draft the agenda and we get all the documents and then we meet with the chair of the committee to review the agenda before we send it out to the rest of the committee the board okay so this this age should actually read committee chairs plus one rotating Committee Member will set agendas with the superintendent or designees does that make sense in terms of what you just described

[01:36:00]
I that okay yes committee dates are set by the whole board period agendas we've already discussed and we're taking the language from 4K and inserting it majority of the committee wanted to keep plus one Committee Member I I think that that actually makes things a lot harder and has some unintended consequences but I will save that argument for November I do want to just get clarification clarification for the staff about the plus one is it that they have to have another person or may have another person primarily for financial a lot of those are really strict deadlines if the committee chair doesn't have somebody for that meeting does

[01:37:00]
set the agenda until we have one more board member at that meeting right so how can we plus one rotating Committee Member if available I mean I think it's important to have the language there again for leadership capacity building but I definitely want to address the concern that you're crazy so maybe something along the lines of and an interesting interested rotating Committee Member may be present something like that okay call Seattle

[01:38:00]
or is that fine and add to me I don't know I mean right now I don't know if there's anything that prevents the chair from bringing another person with them it could save as the board Committee Member astorga just said we can order it and that way or it can be part of the handbook that you know best practices to ask another board member to join you and setting the agenda for committee meeting cuz it sounds like there's like a best practice kind of handbook it seems to me that this is more of a best practice that could go into a handbook simply because we're trying to create a manual that generates efficiency

[01:39:00]
and I'm worried about unintended consequences of requiring a rotating board member specifically to what superintendent Blakey just said but also you know specifically the discussion that we've also had about committees are open for membership to all board members there's there's nothing that that precludes any board member from participating it's it's our elected responsibility to participate so there's nothing that precludes anybody at this point so for a to address the concerns of I'd like to learn and learn about committees it's it's more of a best practices more of a process instead of necessary policy in my opinion

[01:40:00]
I would I guess my My Scene here is we need to keep this as streamlined as possible simple as possible and that if there are any particulars that are important to this board that those get put into a how-to guide does and I'm only saying this cuz I took on Audits and being a new board member it was very helpful that the staff went ahead and drop those agendas until I learned the process and and then it was one of understanding okay this all happens before we do this and do that

[01:41:00]
but in the beginning I was just glad they did it and they put it together and so that was very helpful for me as somebody who is new to this whole thing and so it's one of coming in to recognize and this is just asking for help when you need it and that the board you know the staff and those who are working for us so those members who are helping us that it's very helpful too when you can have those decisions that need to be made they got you through it that's all I need to say we also have mentors you know if to to speak to the leadership building we have we have mentors that are meant to help with all of that as well I'd like to speak to the issue of efficiency

[01:42:00]
capacity building is about so that so that you have somebody in the wings ready to step into a role and not enough suffer the confusion board member don't worry I just pointed out and someone who can just not skip a beat and and frankly several but I think we're ready to move forward are you satisfied with the discussion that we've had on this topic already oh yes I'm ready to go to the next item okay great I think there was a we've already covered I for K2 is going to get inserted here

[01:43:00]
is my understanding is that correct yes so that leaves I think we're we're done J has been I hear somebody national state and local Boards of board member and spoke to leadership

[01:44:00]
they're serving board members were elected by the board at large and if I remember correctly that was the case with with the previous board so yes conversation incredibly broad it seems like an attempt to limit board participation I'm not sure what problem this is trying to solve I'm also concerned with how it actually aligns with our sosg

[01:45:00]
Community engagement and Outreach principles in that we are actually required to participate in community organizations I guess another question is which boards this is so General it serves on national state and local boards all general what if what if I get put on to what if I get asked to participate in a national board do I have to get permission of this board in order to participate or pee which is our community engagement policy talks about the need for us to go out and have to wait engagement and also

[01:46:00]
bee I believe that the the I can't find the exact one right now but I believe that the board president has the authority to set participation so again I don't understand what the point of this Edition is because it seems like it's an attempt to limit limit word participation I'm only saying this just based on what number one is that when elected and sitting on an executive board for a particular

[01:47:00]
see the New Mexico SB and also the all the Council of greatest City Schools it's great that the president would nominate and put you on there but the thing is many times with the board we have no idea what's going on on that level and what you're voting on so when we then go to a meeting where you're not present and we sit there then all of a sudden everybody's questioning us about what you voted on and what you what whatever action you tell so that leaves us in a predicament because we're sitting there I have no idea because nobody told us about it and so that leaves us in a predicament when it comes to explaining any actions any vote taken and maybe if Danielle will put in her presence report that this is what we voted on this is what we did that there is some sort of communication because it seemed

[01:48:00]
unilateral when those things are done without us even knowing so whether that's a clarify within this particular section here is also asking that we as a board are completely aware of some of these because there's votes taken and those votes reflect us as a board so my thing is how do we as a board become a little more clear and what these outside organizations in actions that are being taken place because we're the ones that get questioned because of the relationships we have with other other school boards and then they come back on us friends

[01:49:00]
more of a clarification of communication on whoever sits on different boards I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with the specific point of the boardwalk members by majority vote to serve a national state and local boards but I do want to get back to your point about communication and I think we can talk about it but I also share the concern that board member Jackson has because it's so vague that even if I am on a board and my personal life that's a national state board it assumes that I would still have to come to the aps board and be approved to sit on that board so I would like to clean up the language a little bit on that and specify what words were talking about and what that process looks like and then I'll just let go back to board member Jackson cuz I know that you want to see something too yeah so I think two things to to address the issue so which I think you just said remember store

[01:50:00]
this this particular line the board will elect members by majority vote blah blah blah that's actually not the role of this that has nothing to do with committees right so this this line shouldn't if it's something that's important to the whole board it shouldn't even be it shouldn't be in committees because this is talking about elections to National State local board so it shouldn't be here period secondly I agree that we do need to communicate back and just in defense of myself every single time I have gone to a as a representative of APs I have put together a feedback of what what was discussed and it went out in the Attic glances so my communication has been there why I did something I would align with APS

[01:51:00]
play represented the the vision and values of our board and our community I've done that that being said again this is the communication issue and I and I think a lot of what's happening is there's a feeling that there isn't communication and from what I understand there is a committee that is formed right now that is that's tasked with working on communication issues what needs to be communicated to the board how do we get information back from the board how do we get information from the community how do we share it with with not only with the community but with the board there's a committee that is supposed to be working on this policy so we can take this this concerned about how how is representation on outside boards brought back that can be shared through a communication

[01:52:00]
send documents that that policy that that committee puts together so again this line doesn't need to be in here because this doesn't pertain to committees and I'll just jump forward and say the second line where it says APS board members who serve on the aforementioned boards will have any votes cast reflect of the aps Board of Education we already have agreed to that in our board guard real number four so again that doesn't need to be stated because we're guard real number four says no board member will represent through their words or actions the voice of the entire board on matters at the board has not publicly adopted so if I'm a member of the board and I'm going to send a message and I'm talking about student outcomes Focus governance

[01:53:00]
totally within the realm of what our APS board is is focusing on so again my suggestion is to remove both both of those lines put some of that information into a communication document and specifically Council of great City Schools there are documents say that it is actually the board president who is the representative or their designated so I am serving as the designee of the board president thank you board member Jackson and I agree that this belongs this does not belong under the committee section but there needs to be a section where we address this because I think again in the name of democratizing the the process

[01:54:00]
there was a time when the board as a whole selected and it was you know it's done very collaboratively we all voice an interest in various I don't know how to refer to these some help from staff they are are they are they ATMs board Partnerships what's the terminology here with the symphony New Mexico document that lists everything and lists the requirements I believe

[01:55:00]
so yes we'll remember section just going to print out the language we use is the board members participation in organization that's very simple thank you for the fancy Inn in organizations I don't know that we get any more specific with that but okay so are we in agreement that this does not belong in in the section yes yes I agree I'm going to have to excuse myself I'm in Oregon right now I have to get to an event so I do apologize so I need to leave thank you for making it you're welcome thank you everyone

[01:56:00]
Section 3 well which will be section two or number two once removed number two above the board president or a majority of the board May appoint additional committees outside the purview of committee chairs including ad hoc committees made up a board members Etc I'm not going to read the rest of that because the only Edition was outside the purview of committee chairs and that is put there so that the board president is not crosswise with committee chairs and their work discussion on that hey Google

[01:57:00]
I just said I don't have any comments on that one I guess I don't I'm not totally clear on what this language is attempting again what what problem it's trying to solve like how how how how how is how is appointments how could that be crosswise I guess I don't understand that but I think it refers directly to what happened to the policy committee back in January whereby there was a suggestion that the policy committee and this was a coaching suggesting suggestion that the policy committee to be phased out and and that it would become we would deal with policy in ad hoc

[01:58:00]
what was an ad hoc approach and and so that proceeded to derail the efforts to to have a policy committee meeting when we wanted to talk about these things the items on the agenda yes so the problem that's similar to the committee right so there's policy work like the policy diet for example that's being done outside of policy committee meetings then that's okay basically is like so it doesn't get crossed in because I think there was a misunderstanding of while he's from my part why is it not being part of the policy committee so this just brings in language where it kind of shares some of that where there can be an Committee created or some other type of

[01:59:00]
whatever Committee created to do some of that work if that makes sense to you we did you know and I have to say we we it was a bumpy transition I'll just say that into this year's work I think it was a missed opportunity frankly the the policy diet at hot committee work it was a missed opportunity to onboard and to teach about sosg to the new board members and so I think that's what we have to have in our in the Forefront of our minds when we're going through this or at least that's what's in the four of my models because we do have elections often every two years

[02:00:00]
and how we preserve the institutional knowledge that gained in 4 years and pass it on is is what I'm trying to address here so I see Ashley's beautiful face could you could you help me I think I still need some clarification so one of the things I want to drive a recommendation coaching recommendation there is definitely a coaching recommendation that the board consider a committee diet process which is something that the word has the board chair previous to now so back in

[02:01:00]
2023 the board chair as an individual decided at what committees what should be sunset and then conversations were had with those committees and they decide they decided that those committees would stay or they would go that was not at any point there was never coaching that said this committee should stay or this committee should go I want to be clear on that because as a coach I do not decide or tell you all what decisions you should make I only help guide you to make the decisions that are going to work best for this board with regard to the policy dot was it was conducted by previous board it was Ford president

[02:02:00]
when she was a policy committee chair Daniel Gonzalez and then Barbara Peterson who is former board member the two of them came together and they did the overall they they facilitated the committee diet but it was still a process that the board over saw and just with the work of any committee committee is exist to facilitate the work of the whole world and so if there is work that the board feels that the entire Board needs to be part of that probably should not be work that is delegated to committee it should be work that the board as a whole and goes as a group and so that's so first of all that's just one thing that I want to make sure that everyone is clear on does anyone have questions about that process before I move forward okay so then the next is

[02:03:00]
I have made I have made it a point to try to extend invitations from the beginning of this board being this new board being assembled opportunities for individuals to have one-on-one conversations with me opportunities to have questions answered opportunities to to get one-on-one coaching I've made myself available for board meetings if that is not working then I am absolutely open to other opportunities or other ways may work better for the word having those one-on-one options or having those small group meetings I know that we try to do one of those and it didn't really work out as well but we could definitely try that again that is the desire

[02:04:00]
thank you Ashley I do want to clarify though that there was a suggestion in January at the January 2024 meeting that I was part of there was a suggestion that that the policy committee would eventually be phased out and that the work would be a suggestion that it would be done through at home period and as a result we were shuttered after the March the March policy meeting so I want to get back to the language here and that is that if we have committees

[02:05:00]
then they should be allowed to work to do the work that they are assigned to do and that's the that's the point of the board president May appoint additional committees outside the purview of the existing standing committee committees and committee chairs and I think it's important to clarify that because of what happened in January I'm sorry to the board but I really don't I mean this is this is here for discussion from committee members and so I'd like to I heard from board member Jackson and board member astorga and are we

[02:06:00]
I mean I I I I I I I don't understand I don't think that that language needs to be there I understand that you do and remember Astoria I'm waiting that she wants to have it there as well I think that this is a discussion that needs to move to the full board if we cannot find agreement on this but again going to save my argument for later okay I'd like to move on and move into 4.000 the board will create an adult and this shows educational or governance policy for Albuquerque Public

[02:07:00]
schools we've added educational or governance policy and later we added the board May develop review and revise any governance policy established by The Boardroom majority of members the board may also suspend or revoke any policy established by the board that is not specifically prescribed by federal or state statute through a majority vote of board members is there any discussion about the clarifications so I definitely need clarification and this might be a request to meet with Miss Martinez actually other than discussing it here but I'm having a hard time with the difference between educational policies and then

[02:08:00]
cardboard policies so I know our board policies are golden rules right that's what the board has created but there's this gap between information of on our website on our roles and responsibilities that says we create policy and then when I bring up creating policy as a board member that is said that I don't do that that our policy analyst does that right so I still need some clarification on what my role is as a board member when it comes to policy and what is an educational policy so that's just kind of like a tidbit that hopefully I can meet with Miss Martinez and go over that just for myself but also the second part is I really want to be clear to the public on what our role is when it comes to policy and that our policies are the goals and guard rails so that does mean changing some of the language right because it does say we are the ones creating that policy and what educational those educational policies are

[02:09:00]
another request that I had and this is just a good time to bring it up so I'm going to bring it up is I really am hoping that the RFI committee is working on a way to understand school policies like local school policies and District policy and if there's any way for us to align them because I know that some schools have reached out saying that they have certain policies that may not be aligned with our district policy when it comes to restorative justice things like that so I'm hoping that there's some type of RFI happening to kind of figure that out but also what is my role as a board member to go to those community members who are bringing that to my attention and let them know what is or what is not happening so I have a lot of questions about what that is so thank you for for bringing that up and hopefully I can meet with stuff soon to figure that out because

[02:10:00]
I'm hoping that it's not just you that benefits from that conversation I think it would benefit all of us to hear it's good to hear from new members to see where the gaps are to see what we need to do whether it's in a handbook or in the governance manual right so I appreciate your your comments and yeah if you do have those private conversations suggest that they bring they come to the to the board as a whole I'd like to move on because this this way you won't be surprised I don't think that educational and governance and governance actually need to be in this spot because it is already redundant to what we have in 41 and 43 and the fact that

[02:11:00]
it does already state that we have to create an adopt in relation to applicable laws and regulations so again simply inserting words doesn't necessarily bring Clarity because the clarity is already well-defined in other areas of the document so my suggestion is to actually remove the words educational or governance and then in the third line down governance leave it the way it was because also if you look at number one in 4J it very clearly lays out which policies we we are adopting and that is those are required by law or those that are inappropriate exercise of the boards oversight

[02:12:00]
30 as defined by the boards adopted goals and guardrails so I think actually for the sake of clarity I think adding educational adding those three words actually makes it less clear and I think we just needed to leave it as is and then just as a comment to member of surga not only will to anybody who's listening like not only talked to to Miss Martinez but seriously take AJ and Ashley up on their offer I always walk away from talking to to both of them with with with with more of an insight and I think if you can talk to them about what the difference is and then talk again and then talk again because really sometimes it does take a while to wrap your head about what this is we're doing especially because the word policy is so nebulous

[02:13:00]
I really think that that those continued conversations really will help so my suggestion is to remove those three words thank you for that so I'm going to noted and I think this is a good discussion point I want to go and I have the same question to create an adult District policy well what is that mean right governance educational so I think it's a conversation worth pursuing thank you both so I'd like to move on to

[02:14:00]
the whole notion of first meeting and slash readings second meeting slash readings when we are considering an adopting proposed new policies or policy amendments and I'm going to ask I'm going to jump from accordingly number one the board limits its adoption ETC number two existing we got rid of educational policies existing policies that do not meet one of these criteria and now I'm I'm down to to ensure that policies the paragraph just before first meeting to ensure that policies are well examined before final action the board will adhere to the following meeting sequ

[02:15:00]
new policies or policy amendments the or here is critical so any adopting new policies or policies we don't have any edits in this section know I understand we're going to talk about what these mean though because we have failed to comply with the section we passed in the action report I pointed out that there have been three three three either New Orleans new policies or amendments to our governance manual and we have skipped the 30 days Public public comment period and so I think

[02:16:00]
it's important to note in this committee policy committee meeting that that can't continue we let's see let me find my action reports since its adoption the manual has been updated three times once to include language regarding the superintendent's evaluation another time to designate the board president as a contact for legal counsel and a third time to correct an Omission stating that the boards vice president can sign for the president in case of an absence the letter is probably the most minor but the first two are critical and we need I'm just making this a public statement we need to abide by this we're going to this time around but it does concern me

[02:17:00]
that in the transition into new officers and new chairs this got overlooked and so that's my comment and my reminder to all that we need to abide by by this policy by our policy so I'm going to jump to 4K board agendas and this is the last section the board president the executive committee and the superintendent or designate regular and special meeting agendas actually let me I skipped over one right under board agendas board meetings will comply with the New Mexico open meetings act and it's listed there and the open meetings act res

[02:18:00]
definition of the board for public notification of meetings the meeting schedule and agendas are posted on the aps website at aps.edu the aps dot edu was added I think just out of courtesy I think one of in the Q&A somebody suggested that we didn't need to to add this I responded that I think it was there in the original and it seems like a courtesy at the moment it seems to serve a good purpose but there are heftier ideas to to address but remember I think it's fine having the website

[02:19:00]
the second one for the board president and the executive committee I appreciate having that there too just because I am on the executive committee and it's I mean we do approve the agendas but we don't always set them so and we do have conversations about the what's going to be on the agenda so it's nice just to be included since it's kind of already happening just to be particular about language the board president comma the executive committee and the superintendent or designee will set regular and special meeting agendas that's actually in conflict with 4-H because 4-H says that the president and the superintendent set the agenda and the vice president and the secretary assist and so I actually don't think that the phrase the

[02:20:00]
what kind of committee needs to be there because those that agenda setting procedure or designation is listed in 4-H and it's actually throughout the documents that it's actually the president and the superintendent who set the agenda but it's the the executive committee assists so again you know contract language if you're going to if you're going to change it in one section that means you have to go back and change it in the other but I do also believe that that's statutory is to who sets the agenda and I believe it's the word president and the superintendent so my point is I don't think executive committee needs to be in there having children of clarification that website

[02:21:00]
aps.edu isn't an addition it just comes up as like the blue underline Link in the formatting so it was never taken off and then we added it's just the when you put in a website it defaults to being blue which is the same color as the changes the other thing that I noted in this section is that it looks like it looks like it got defaulted to Little Bees so 4K 1B where the committee chair and superintendent or designee will set committee meeting agendas looks like that got deleted for some reason it shouldn't be deleted it should be put back to number two because we've actually used that language we just inserted it into the committee meeting agenda section so that part that says where is Little B

[02:22:00]
the president vice president and secretary and again in the name of onboarding this is the purpose of this language

[02:23:00]
to give to give executive committee members an opportunity to be part of an administrator part of a process but how does this does this violate Omni the open meetings act in anyway just for clarification the executive committee currently approves the agenda so all of the agendas that are created do you go to the executive committee for approval before it goes to the full board that's the current process of where the executive committee is in the agendas and then Mr Melendez do you know the answer

[02:24:00]
if having the executive committee set the agenda if that is in conflict with the open meetings act you're a mute sorry having three members of a seven-member board meeting is not in violation of the open meetings act thank you and I want to go back for some clarification to what superintendent Blakey just said the executive committee approves the agenda is that correct I guess what I'm after here is having them be part of the conversation will the current you know the current process is that the agendas are set

[02:25:00]
and I am it's sent to them and they could add or delete based off of what were the agenda is because of sosg it's really you know Limited in a positive way the agenda items being added are the progress monitoring calendar essentially and then usually there's anything that is legally that we need to go through is added to those agendas and then you know for committee meetings such as finance and audit those are pretty much drafted by staff and presented to the committee chair so for the regular agenda regular board meetings the agendas usually are set with progress monitoring and then any agenda items that board members have either brought to the president or to the

[02:26:00]
for the executive committee has information to add then that is how that is currently modified in the current process for the role of the president the superintendent and the executive committee at all know that is how it happens sometimes do have conversations in executive committee meetings of if there's anything that we want to add or not so it's I don't know I'll leave that one up to you and I will say I believe well so again this is this is about being just being part of the conversation

[02:27:00]
that that happened with the superintendent around agendas just being in the room so to speak and and getting a feel for well to address leadership capacity transparency not feeling so siloed and out of the loop which is a concern that has come up over and over again so Madam I believe there's not like a necessarily a formal meeting to sit down and create those agendas they're really I believe the executive committee meets separately the superintendent isn't in those meetings when they kind of talked about if there's topics that they need to add and such and then they let us know based on their conversations if we need to add anything to the agenda other than the progress

[02:28:00]
monitoring or the you know legal things that we have to add so in my you know couple months experience in the agendas there is mostly its staff going to the president and saying these are things that we need to be put on the agenda for you know compliance and progress monitoring so it sounds like again from a document perspective that there are the language in the document does allow for participation from the executive committee elsewhere and so to be specific about board agendas and using the term set I would still remove the executive committee from that strike that from there because the setting of the agenda is particular the assisting is

[02:29:00]
outlines in 4-H sink is there one more thank you thank you for that Thursday before the meeting to request items to be removed from the consent agenda and place on the action agenda for discussion etc etc but the only

[02:30:00]
the only concern I have about that is with the addition of which I'm fine with if you want to leave business day business is not listed in for m in 4 M number 7 all it says is board members will have up to four days but in this iteration it says for business days so again we need to be consistent and I think I might have put that in there because I try to address something on the consent agenda and was reminded that it was for business days so I think it's a good clarification so then leave that clarification there but make a note that it needs to be here or M7

[02:31:00]
okay we're going back her board member Jackson's suggestion to did we miss something yeah we missed so yeah where is New Mexico statute requires a board of education have finance and audit committees the board May establish additional standing committees then there's two separate editions the first sorry I'm sorry it says the aps Board of Education recognizing that statutory obligation to develop educational policies for the school district includes the policy committee as one of its standing committees my notes on this were we do not need to formally recognized we don't need to make a formal record in recognition

[02:32:00]
it's currently listed in 43 policy-making is done with the full board and through sosg and through our community outreach and engagement it's already it's also already listed in 4i 2B also given that we have not gone through the formal committee diet process why would we add this in now how does this pass the committee diet questions so essentially I think that that whole line needs to be struck as a formal recognition because it is listed elsewhere as policy it was so in the original document that said board members may serve on the following committees where it listed Finance policy and audit so I don't know why we wouldn't just leave the original document that had them listed for now

[02:33:00]
I think it's important to be intentional and I think this goes back to the conversation that we had earlier about policy committee kind of being put off so I think this is intentionally put there to make sure that we know that we have three policies right I mean we have three committees and since we are bored that quote on quote sets policy or creates policy or whatever you want to call it it's important to have all three of those committees present so just like we have finance and audit committee here even though it's not a statue I feel like the importance as APS board members to talk about policy and be vigilant about what policies are being put out just as important at least to me in that sense I don't know if board member of the thing is you have different thoughts I agree completely with that

[02:34:00]
intentionality is I think is has been missing so I like the wording but I guess I just don't understand if the original so I'm looking at my original document where it's for eye for eye right now says New Mexico statute requires that Boards of Education have a finance and audit subcommittee the board May establish additional standing committees period Then if you go down to number two it lists what are committees are it says Finance policy audit so I guess I don't understand the need for a formal recognition in the sentence above when financing is actually listed addition to that

[02:35:00]
committees we just took them out of that section and Incorporated them into G we could incorporate them up here at the I mean comma policy committee the original but that might not work because then because we're not required to have a policy

[02:36:00]
well I think I think there is a statutory I found it and I don't hold on we're not required to have a policy committee 22 Dash 5 Dash 4 cents that we have a duty to create policy it doesn't say we have a duty to have a policy committee so all I'm going to say is seems cleaner the way it was but bring this back up into our November meeting but I do feel like it's I do like the way it says that we have a policy committee because we're obligated to develop educational policies if we end up changing

[02:37:00]
mean that somehow or having a more clarity on our role when it comes to developing policies then I'd be willing to change that but right now as like I said in every document that you read and especially to the public that is our role so I like having that in there and also being intentional like because this is part of our role as board members we have a policy committee that is that reflects that so I'd be I'd be willing to say this conversation if that's something that we need to do like take it take it to the court in November yes yes run in the conversation so yeah I think it's important to take it to the public and get some input and continue the conversation okay any recovered at all

[02:38:00]
no the next sentence says the board recognizes the government's manual as a living policy document requiring continuous review and revision to accommodate the board's needs and its implementation of student outcomes Focus governance again my notes on this is I think that this is unnecessary language and it's strangely seems to come straight from the CBA I would suggest that even if this is something that we think it's important it doesn't belong in this section this is more CBA I'm sorry collective bargaining agreement this is not committee work this is board work the government's manual is board work so it shouldn't be in this committee section and yes it is something that we we as a full board feel is important as we

[02:39:00]
address the governance manual and maybe that's something that we look at and adding to a different section when we discussed this in November that you know maybe we add a requirement that the government is manual is reviewed once a year during our annual self-evaluation but I but this particular sentence shouldn't be in the committee section I agree that we can move this sentence somewhere else and where did you suggest or did you suggest moving it into another person I think I mean just an early suggestion and I would have to review it but in 4D under board responsibilities know it says that we added as a number 7 for example

[02:40:00]
under the board will monitor student outcomes Focus governance sorry student not can focus goals and guardrails the board will adhere to the board guard rails the board will review the board governance manual once a year possibly number 7 I think it was here because this was about I mean the board the governance manual is policy it is a living document and because it's relatively it's in its infancy I would argue that was the thinking but this is the committee section and and we need to really stay away from making the committee section particular about policy this is not about

[02:41:00]
what policy committee this is about Finance audit and policy committee it's about all three and so if you have a sentence in there that is very focused on just one of those committees it's it's not adhering to okay I hear what you're saying okay any other sections think what I would request if Jessica can you read back to us all of the Amendments that you think that we talked about yes and I will ask for the committee's support on a couple of the items where we left things a little ambiguous but I

[02:42:00]
start from the top guessing that we approve the name change from board committees to board committees and committee chairs roles and responsibilities yes yes the change on paragraph two for the superintendent's rule is addressed in 3B that will be struck correct correct third paragraph down we are keeping the addition of the aps Board of Education recognizing its statutory obligation to develop education policies for the school district includes the policy committee as one of its standing committees in 43 that we can look at as we go into November the addition of the board recognizes the governance manual as a living policy document will come out

[02:43:00]
correct okay I'm going to move down to e and here's where things get fun all right are open for membership to all board members and I'm sorry period members period thank you

[02:44:00]
I'm moving on to app all meetings are open to the public and all meetings materials will be posted 72 hours before the meeting all members are required to submit questions prior to the meeting and we are taking out the X number of days are we also removing 72 hours since that's in Omaha okay do we well I struggle with that because I'd like to have a discussion leave it in and just open to discussion I'd like to hear more from other from new committee members open to discussion in November meeting

[02:45:00]
during the first business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs period I think that's when we change that said during the second business meeting of the year the board will elect standing committee chairs period okay sorry I have that as a second part of that sentence plus interested rotating committee members will or may attend meetings to set committee dates with the superintendent or designate well nothing I like the way you said it plus

[02:46:00]
read that again please committee chairs plus one interested rotating Committee Member May attend meetings with the superintendent to set agendas I think the names in the wrong place period committee meeting dates are set by the board as a hole so I thought that we struck age

[02:47:00]
and then went to I that was the committee chairs plus one rotating whatever that language was will discuss agendas with the superintendent thank you right now we'll discuss agendas with the superintendent and designate plus one interested right but they don't need to be there so just be cautious so just to clarify

[02:48:00]
committee chairs plus one interested rotating Committee Member may discuss agendas do we want to clarify that to make sure we're not saying the committee chair May yeah committee chair in the superintendent am I have to be too sentences the committee chair may have a rotating member attendance period

[02:49:00]
we are striking F we are striking to which is the board members will elect by majority number three becomes number two we are keeping the language that says outside the purview of committee chairs under forceful or governance and governance editions because it's stipulated in one I thought we were moving this well I thought we were going to pursue more discussion about this from a broader from Chicago that was my

[02:50:00]
I'm going down to under accordingly number two we are striking the educational that's a strike of a strike so just ignore that there is no educational language and number two I'm going down to 4K number one we are striking the executive committee I thought I thought we were because we were being particular about the language where it says the board president and the superintendent sets given the fact that the problem that was trying to be solved from your statement was that the executive committee needed to participate in in the

[02:51:00]
they do so it doesn't need to be stated here because this is a very particular agenda setting studying is the is the terminology they assist they participate they don't set and that language is determined in somewhere else I mean part of the original language right what I'm saying is that the executive committee does not set the agenda they assist they participate in the language says set okay but I mean I don't think I don't think it's it's about expanding

[02:52:00]
go ahead yeah so we also got a little bit of clarification too because the superintendent said that there is not a specific meeting that is happening where the agenda items are being put for reviewer conversation it's the staff bringing it to the board president and then the executive committee also has some discussion around it at times but we also as executive committee have to approve the agenda so there is really no need to put that there because there's not an actual procedure where there's a conversation or a meeting happening and please correct me if I'm wrong and there is somewhere in the governance manual I can't remember the exact number that does speak to the executive committee meeting to discuss it's in another section where it talks about the role of the executive committee 4838 4-H

[02:53:00]
all right I have a question on B we had struck the committee chair and superintendent or designee will set meeting meeting agendas and I my note here is to move this back to number two but which number two or where it's little B right now like in sorry in the amended documents it's one little B in the original document it's actually number two so it just needs to move back to number two so what number one number two so that would make the next one that says consent agenda number three it's three yeah they all go back to their original numbers for yes is any item listed on a gender maybe removed etcetera etcetera

[02:54:00]
and 4 become 5 we are keeping that edition let's see yeah we're leaving it up to 4% and then this will go on the first read for review in November and you also need to know that 4M or M number 7 will need to have business God bless you so I just want to check in on chair committee and processes chair yeah chair and committee processes procedures board orientation needs to address the election of officers and committees

[02:55:00]
the specific said we need to address legislation versus government governance duties how to set a committee date going to the superintendent and then I've got number four is for I 1f I'll figure that out later for I was all meetings are open to the public and I'll meet the materials will be posted publicly I have a couple other items that I want to do is a critical January calendaring

[02:56:00]
for the board and and committee meetings just explaining that process and something that came out of another meeting suggesting monthly meetings and then being able to cancel them if necessary clarifying I think we need to clarify Omaha open meetings act with regard to committee's and then best practices that I wanted to add and you had onboarding there too and some of those trainings butt

[02:57:00]
what was also brought up is the information on for candidates that wanted to become board members I want to just to flag that because I think that's important for candidates to know about sfg the governance manual and all of that that has to go on as a board member so I think that's important the other thing that board member tell Marie to really stressed was wanting to know more about processes and procedures as a board member during those first couple of months for new board members so that's something that's important another thing that I think would really benefit especially the new board members is a governance manual study session just to go over all of these things so that could be just something apart that we can suggest for a board members and I don't know if either one of you said those the RFI committee the request for information committee

[02:58:00]
that's crucial yes I can I can put that email as well yeah understanding school policy versus District policy I put that that came up under RFI I don't know I don't know how my suggestions to see how school policies and District policies were aligned and making sure that we're all following the same model within policy rest with your however you want to call it but making sure that we're all on the same page and what that process looks like if there's any right I don't know if there is okay anything else

[02:59:00]
I just wanted to acknowledge and appreciate your willingness to want to provide more of this like community and like I want to say community organizing type of lens into big governance manual right because I feel like it's very you can be seen as very corporate but we want to make sure that it's something that's understandable to the public right because we are in the public eye so I really appreciate you wanting to share your leadership and make sure that those things are put into the government's manual and I think it's important for me at least it helps me understand how things are moving forward and then also remember Jack remember Jackson again I always tell you you have a great expertise in language and these the contractual things so I think

[03:00:00]
is this a good conversation and I look forward to having more policy committee meetings thank you yes thank you thank you all for enduring this much needed but long enough long committee meeting but I know I need this is going to happen because there's lots of good conversation happening I think and so I'm going to move on to item four the chair report the ad hoc committee assigned to complete the board's policy review will complete its work by October 1st and I wrote a reminder please to who is on the ad hoc of the policy diet

[03:01:00]
Heather and Courtney during this review the committee will review the board policies that were scored at 5:00 on a range of 1 to 10 I think it was or 0 to 10 so these policies that your the ad hoc committee is reviewing scored five or higher they recommend that the board either keep these policies archive them or assign them to the administration or modify them the policies in need of modification will be revised to align them with the boards statutory obligations and student outcomes Focus governance at the November policy committee meeting we will continue to review the government's manual and discuss the ad-hocs works policy committee meeting will be

[03:02:00]
November 4th at 5:00 p.m. virtually watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that we are adjourned thank you for your hard work
