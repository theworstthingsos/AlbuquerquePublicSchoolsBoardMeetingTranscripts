[00:07:00]
I actually like school I want Nana summer because it's the time to spend with your family and have camps there is more to life than just school I think students would appreciate longer summer my second issue is the time difference the middle school and Elementary my brother will be going to middle school soon my school starts at 7:30 and ends at 2:30 middle school starts at 9:15 and ends at 4:15 and total that's three and a half extra hours I won't be able to see my brother why can't the times because I said together finally I'd like to say thank you for the school lunch and breakfast but it would be nice to have some strawberry sometimes okay bye thank you and great job okay our next speakers in the room John breweries

[00:08:00]
one second okay OK Google on behalf of a majority of folks who quite honestly are scared to speak out on the issue my concern is about just playing the progress pride flag at Double Eagle Elementary School while I value inclusivity diversity in education I believe the introducing specific flag at an elementary school level is not suitable

[00:09:00]
Sports young students why must be segregate into groups in the name of inclusivity and why should we brand safety and require an affirm only specific groups in the in the name of safety this flag was rebranded by the district at the safe space flag which is not what it is Elementary's children are impressionable their understanding of social cultural and sexual issues is still developing introducing symbols with nuanced meaning beyond their comprehension simply might cause confusion or just Comfort we cannot promote lgbtq acceptance while neglecting the other students straight students I have questions specifically for APS on the issue why was that specific lgbtq transplant chosen as the safe space flag I want to know specifically do teachers require training to display the flag and if so are they compensated for the training where is

[00:10:00]
play representation for the other students straight families and when will that flag be displayed additionally information and disclosures on this email that I will forward to my representative from district 7 Mrs Jackson there was a poll completed and published by Southwest public policy Institute yesterday to 624 the state's most new Mexican parents are worried about the transgender ideology pushed in the schools a pamphlet by constitutional attorney Mike Yoder understanding Federal and anti-discrimination laws and how to protect your kids in the schools is also attached to an email that's all I have I appreciate the time like I said this entire email with supporting documentation will be emails thank you thank you thank you sir our next year is Anastasia Thorogood Cordova Cordova sorry you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you good evening my name is

[00:11:00]
I am the mother of a first grader I was already high schools 2010 valedictorian and I wasn't an employee of a PS from August of 2021 until November of 2023 I come here tonight to advocate for Career and Technical education and APS The Current financial systems for CTE teachers are ineffective and are not providing the timely support needed for teachers to provide the high-quality education that the families of Albuquerque have been promised this school year APS change how CT programs are funded CTE Educators were notified in Spring of 2023 that they needed to fill out the Federal Grant in order to get funding these applications are not user-friendly and there is no training available for new or existing CTE teachers on how to write these grants I was fortunate that I had older co-workers who trained me on their own time off the clock if you will allow me to share the following numbers my program 18,000 dollars for use in 2023 20/24 school year 10,000 was to go to grocery 7

[00:12:00]
2023 semester CTE classes across District were still waiting for access to these federal funds this was also when I received the food safety program that my students had been promised access to at the beginning of the school year my perspective is that of a culinary teacher but I witnessed similar issues across district and across classes in CTE I was in attendance at the public town meeting and I heard that the elementary school kids want specials specials lead to CTE classes the specials electives in CT classes in APS are in danger because they write on The Souls of the teacher and when their souls are broken like mine was we are asked to leave because we didn't know longer serve the funk that we were asking to we want to serve the kids this is programs and specials very so much across the district because they depend so much on the individual teachers personal energy and personal resources for funding and getting these programs off the

[00:13:00]
the Board needs to re-evaluate specials electives and CTE programs and build a plan for better support and funding if board plans on keeping its promise to those elementary school kids that were at the public town hall meeting I was there they want specials at elementary school and I know those high school kids want their programs to and I just got to say I know my kids are heartbroken but I had to leave to save myself and my family and I was going to say if you were wrapping up that's okay this is Courtney are you okay okay thank you our next speaker is Dr Chinelo 2 minutes

[00:14:00]
and I know that not too long ago there was a two or three of you are taking you off at your office please take within your souls and your hearts if you remember I asked you a great decision once said in the Pocket Edition to be castrated mutilated and suicidal with sexual perverted explicit books and its gender in New York City on October 12th 2014

[00:16:00]
our last speaker is on Zoom Mr Berlin Coker Mr Coker are you there yes okay you have two minutes I don't believe I had the opportunity to do so special our family so very proud to have you on the board as well I'm here to voicemail disappointment at the decision for the new superintendent failure of APs that experience with in the system is becoming more and more of a red flag rather than a preferred background we just really need outside perspectives and real solutions and these things are worth almost all of her responses in the public forums and I don't really have high hopes for the new superintendent to be able to deliver on the form they really need it at APS however having an APS superintendent be a product of cronyism and acrylic

[00:17:00]
a lot of experience of but what is the makeup of the board itself all of you here are not the same board members that we had even like 8 years ago it's completely new and I do have high hopes that we can start actually putting in some reform I've been coming to these meetings for years not so much anymore but I do intend to start showing up to these a lot more I'm currently working on a couple of policy packages that I would love to have a lot of your collaboration on as well as generally working on educational reform here at 8 p.m. and I do want to go a lot of the concerns about special education because even just with me and my little brother we are having a lot of issues with transportation and things that are federally regulated are not being followed

[00:18:00]
so please any of you guys is also an open invitation to reach out to me so we can start collaborating because I do want to head full force into this new 2024 school year in a collaborative spirit thank you thank you sir that concludes our public forum I'd like to thank you that's okay and I'd like to thank all of our public forum guest next on our agenda is our student outcomes focused governance discussions we will start with 5.1 which is approval of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation for year two quarter one student outcomes focused governance is a framework designed to drive the board's ability to function most effectively to deliver on

[00:19:00]
are collective promise to improve student outcomes this what we're about to do is the process of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing behaviors with those most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes board members have been asked to individually complete a self-evaluation form for our board actions from the last quarter before we proceed do any board members have questions about the process 8 thank you I will now give an opportunity for us to review the results for each of the six competencies of the sfg self-evaluation and then pause for questions and comments discussion before you proceed at the end of the review we will have a brief conversation about

[00:20:00]
we feel is possible so setting a new goal for the end of our next quarter so we're going to go ahead and start with vision and goals and previously we had scored a 10 on that one which was approaching student outcomes focused governance I will open it up and see how folks feel we're waiting now if we score the additional 25 points or not additional 15 points how do we reached the same thing no additional points does anyone think we earn additional points so we will stick with our current score which is 10 points for vision and goals

[00:21:00]
remember Dominguez would you like to say why you don't think we are getting to the green the meeting student outcomes Focus I think the most significant reason is you know we have we need annual targets and and we're working on it we're getting there but we're not there yet and I also have some concerns about how we measured until after tonight I don't think all interim goals the third criteria says or student

[00:22:00]
outcomes are not inputs or adult outputs again I think prior to hearing the report tonight I have some concerns about Gulf War I think we got it I got a yes on the next criteria the board included students parents staff and community members in the gold development process I put a no down for all board goals last from 3 to 5 years last from 1 to 3 years and and I want to clarify that my concerns about gold for I have expressed period so I think the point is that we don't have we have

[00:23:00]
School ending points for each year leading up to the ending dates and the superintendent has not provided interim goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending date so remember that because you in your comments that were working on it I'm not aware of us working on it I don't know how that's happening does anyone know how we're working on setting the annual targets I think that was a question that was posed and a response was will work on it it's the responses we could establish yeah so it's the future thing I don't think we have actively worked on it yet so how can we make this happen Super Nintendo Elder how can we make we need both annual Target School ending points and then we also need interim goal ending points well we have the

[00:24:00]
interim goal we've got a 3-year goal for each of these interim goals now and annual ones annual targets or each of them come up with I mean that's sure and would it be realistic to have that completed and adopted by the board prior to the adopted by the board party but the completion of the analysis in the cool setting by so we'll do this again for January February March so April is when we do our next evaluation is that right so can that be ready for board meeting

[00:25:00]
play so I'm getting lots of thumbs up so you know honestly the percentage difference is are relatively small so I think you know and the bigger number I think having an annual on this is nice but I think we're just doing it to fit a format does the really the change over time that's going to be more important so we can put numbers in and we'll try to make him as precise and his thoughtful as we can so we'll make it by your next meeting sure right so for the purpose of the minutes it will reflect that will have the drafts for consideration and adoption prior to an Excel evaluation which will be in April okay next is values and guardrails we had previously ranked a five which has Us in the kind of peach yellow oranges approaching student outcomes Focus column we're looking to get to the 10 poyntz of meeting student outcomes Focus I'd love to hear from another

[00:26:00]
and if so why or if not why not I think that we are so close to getting to the green but we're not quite there yet and so I still awarded us five points the reason being that similar to the goals we do not have yearly we don't have yearly ending points for the guard rails so similar request for that to maybe as we have ending points from goals we could have ending points for guardrails before the April self-evaluation but one thing that I would like to point out that that has changed from before last time we did this to now is that we do have a theory of action that has been adopted into our board governance manual and so

[00:27:00]
what is I think that the only thing that I could see that was holding us up is just the the annual targets and as soon as we have those then I feel confident that in April we can at that point is there anyone who disagrees with that assessment did the theories of action refer because it says to drive the school systems overall strategic Direction in that's also answered in the Q&A strategic plan right yes and then the theory of action is in the Strategic plan is the same theory of action that's in the government's annual so just superintendent Elder to clarify since that interim guard rails are less data oriented is that also something that we would be able to see and approve before April

[00:28:00]
there is a growing discussion inside our group it's easy on the goals we can set a beginning point and we can send an endpoint and I got a straight line and we just pick some points along the way and those your interim points we may not hit him we may see them we don't know what's going to happen but those are goals guard rails by nature of being more data difficult are going to be a little harder and can we do it we can meet the format probably but I would like to say we need to have a more substantive discussion about the value and what they might tell us what they might not tell us so perhaps you maybe about that I would suggest that Dr Blakey and Dr Bowman

[00:29:00]
and his team have a grip on why is the numbers in the guard rails are more difficult to quantify for us so is there another member of the board who would want to be a part of this conversation between Dr Bowman myself to discuss the process possibility issues with targets okay next up is monitoring and accountability for which we had previously scored a 0 which is in the red not student outcomes Focus call him so is there anyone who'd like to speak to their rating for monitoring and accountability and

[00:30:00]
the community engagement calendar is only two years okay and

[00:31:00]
does the monitoring calendar the one that's online goes through 2028 but the community engagement and Outreach calendar that we added just as that that last column that only goes through 2 years okay and we've got all goals and all guard rails on the monitoring calendar I went back and looked after I don't I don't see guardrail on there so I don't know if that is I think that's a question for the administration is guardrail 5 monitoring schedules so it sort of got scheduled in but the problem is the date we have open is prior to the administration of the survey so if we use the open date we're going to come in and tell you what we're going to survey and you won't see any actual data until next April

[00:32:00]
so we are still sort of in negotiations on how maybe we can move this all sort of came out today so and as late as this afternoon we were scrabbling we have dates for looking at but we may have to move something else to fit it in but yeah we don't do the survey Administration until May so by when do we think we'll know by when do we think we'll have it on the calendar oh probably by the end of this week in the calendar the only Open dates are like July 3rd and I don't think they're all Rush on July 3rd so we'll just have to move one of the others figured out there is an open day but it doesn't fit that particular one really well so we'll have to move something else into the open date and replace the other one so for the purpose of the minutes by the end of this week will have it on the calendar

[00:33:00]
play put that on the cabinet agenda and we'll knock that out on Friday next up is communication and collaboration which we had previously scored a one which has Us in the orange category or orange column approaching student outcomes Focus so open the floor to see if anyone thinks that we move into the green column meeting student outcomes Focus for the five points and maybe a board member who hasn't spoken but I can say that we have been keeping our time tracking and we're still learning and that's now my new job so I want to continue to learn to be better at that but as we mentioned before we still have less than 10% of our meeting times that are focused on Google monitoring so that's why I put us

[00:34:00]
and I saw the head nod remember sorry benavidez as well on that one so is there a consensus that we're still at 1:00 I think we went out sorry you're correct thank you we will earn a one okay can you unity and Trust we are currently out of 0.00

[00:35:00]
pages and we agree that the board has committees their role is only to advise you know we don't I don't think we need all unless anybody wants to disagree with me please do but I'd like to give us the one on that so I think that we meet them all attendance at all regularly bored readings has been 80% over the previous three months I think we've met that the board is adopted a policy procedure regarding that superintendent information provided to one is provided all we did it off the policy that was in the governance manual which was November policy committee meeting and then December board meeting so I think we get the orange the one point and then could you clarify though what does it mean president Doug

[00:36:00]
reviews all policies governing board operating procedures at least once during every length of time equal to the board members terminal office well that's how we have restructured the policy committee to focus on that so we went through the policy review and started the policy diet to take out all of the policies that we don't need to be reviewing so that we can have a clear slate of policies that we do need to be reviewing and we'll be getting that we decided once we have a new superintendent in place and starting going forward after they can complete the policy diet so that clarifies I mean I I wrote no because we haven't reviewed all the policies I'm fine with that I don't know how others feel I feel like we put the plan in place to do that if I could jump so the way that I read it it's the board operating procedures that's our governor

[00:37:00]
we absolutely have reviewed those you're correct so we reviewed them we adopted them in November with November policy December December 4th so we've absolutely done that I mean I think we've solidly I would agree with member benavidez we have solidly moved into the one we are not into the into the meeting mainly because our ethics and conflict of interest statement is not as it doesn't have the specificity that is some of the specificity that's requested so that's something that maybe we need to think about but we're definitely definitely in the one so the policy diet the lingering that's a separate yeah

[00:38:00]
Thank you period remember Jackson if you could just say one more sentence about what specifics we left out of our conflict of interest policy oh okay well so I'm looking now at the third column there was something in there no more on the conflict of interest rate during the most recent self-evaluation ethical boundaries is that like if we all agree today yeah and have honored it

[00:39:00]
did anyone have any have an interpretation or different interpretation of the final one on green I am changing my mind I think we can get into the 3:00 next up is continuous Improvement for which we had previously rated a zero so open it up to anyone who has a point of view on where we are right now and why not anyone just any of the board members

[00:40:00]
I think we're getting close to getting one however I don't think that we are quite yet to the point we have not tracked our average average annual cost of Staff time invested in governance so that one section is holding us back from getting to one so it looks like we are zero there now are we also trying to accomplish to get to one will also need to accomplish the paragraph underneath I think we actually we did do that because we have right right so as long as you do it again as long as you do it again which I mean I think it was it was fantastic so I think we did meet that paragraph We

[00:41:00]
haven't tracked our average annual cost okay so this gives us a total of 19 196 quarter and so I'd like to hear from members of the board what you believe is possible by our next self-evaluation in the next quarter I believe it's possible to get to at least 10% of our time tracker to be set on Google home how many points

[00:42:00]
communication and collaboration

[00:43:00]
December and December we're meeting heavy months so they were a little out of the ordinary I think there are five and such I think it may be possible to get the green and others feelings we are at 3:00 and we can add two more if we're in the blue I think we can do that we have something to shoot for you

[00:44:00]
which means that we are not giving operational advice or instructions to staff members and additionally really making sure that the last one the the progress monitoring or annually the most recent score was 80 or higher that pertains to our discussions during progress monitoring that we're really asking specific questions and participating do you think we can do it okay continuous Improvement we are out of 0 so we can get to one if we track staff time and we can get to three

[00:45:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:46:00]
is 37 points according to the work identified on our adopted implementation timeline so this time I'll entertain a motion and consideration of our quarterly self evaluation and since I think I'm the only one with the script I'll just share with you with emotions should say for whoever wants to say it you can see it if you pass it wonderful I'm motion to accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 3794 of 19 points on the student outcomes Focus governance self evaluation instruments I will second this is Courtney all right thank you so we have a motion from Member Astoria and a second from Member Jackson

[00:47:00]
is there any discussion tomorrow 4.1 4.2 and 4.3 focusing on skills habits and mindsets for Life success are presenters are superintendent Scott Helder doctor Antonio Gonzalez Chief academic officer Dr Richard Bowman Chief Information and strategy officer Sherry jet associate superintendent for school climate and supports and Chanel Saluda chief of schools

[00:48:00]
okay before we hear our presentation we as the board need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete does anyone have evidence that the elements of an effective monitoring report are not present so these elements are number one the goal does the report clearly show which specific goal or interim goal and interim goal is being monitored do you want me to go one by one or should we go through all four okay two of the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods does it clearly show the target reporting periods so this is a baseline first report for us so we can't but it does have the first data point so yes the interpretation does it clearly show the superintendent's understanding of system performance relative to the goal

[00:49:00]
supporting documentation that evidences the superintendent's understanding of system performance if the school system is not at Target or the superintendent's understanding of system performance indicates that implementation is not on track then does the monitoring report clearly describe systemic root causes strategic responses and any needed next steps so is there evidence in a plan I think yes yes yes yes yes okay excellent says my script since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will turn the floor to the superintendent for the presentation thank you madam president members of the board we appreciate you having us here again this month to do our latest progress monitoring report a couple things I want to say before

[00:50:00]
a year ago when you guys were beginning this process dividing goals this was one that had the most I guess tension both on the board and amongst the staff because where we believe we had a general idea of what social emotional learning was and that we felt there were places inside the district that were effectively offering social emotional learning we recognize that it was not something that was uniform or really easily defined across the board and people have different thoughts and different Visions we had no way of measuring it it was incredibly complex ass so I just wanted to take a moment and thank all the people that work to get us to where we are today we're not anywhere near final

[00:51:00]
but I am incredibly proud I think Miss jet Mr Bowman Miss West Dr Segura and Dr Gonzalez and all the people like Dr Muir all those people that are out there doing this work really long themselves wholeheartedly into it and out of that which I thought was going to potentially be rather chaotic and I was sleep and had a lot of heartburn we actually have developed something that is concise I'm sure you'll let us know but I'm telling you from where we were less than six months ago to actually done this and quite frankly have done it with such a large group of people participating in it unheard of numbers in terms of surveying inside of the district I really think these

[00:52:00]
people should be recognized and thanked I thank you cuz you guys did a fantastic job and so I'm glad to be here with you tonight so with that and you also received a really Nifty precursor to it and don't expect this all the time but we didn't provide this specifically because we wanted to make sure that everyone understood exactly what it was we were trying to do and had the necessary definitions had the necessary language and just a general understanding we've all kind of on the same page because this was tricky and when we debated this last year I kind of think we walked out of it and people also said yeah I know what I think it is and now we at least have some more common understanding of what we're trying to do and how we're trying to do it so I hope you read that I found it very helpful just to set myself up for tonight I'm not going to read it to you also

[00:53:00]
desperate to have me sit here and talk for hours on end but I'll spare you so we'll move into the actual monitoring report and the document you're speaking to is the separate narrative there was not a sculpture a belonging care this was provided earlier with along with the monitoring reports tonight you've also been provided with the new graphic and I'm going to let Dr Bowman confuse you about it and then I'll explain what he said so we have a challenge here so but it's it's it's it's going to be good so so as you know go for specifically to increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills mindsets and habits most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness from 25.5 % in 2023 to 35.5

[00:54:00]
set in 2028 as measured by an evidence-based and aligned tool so let's look at our interim goals the interim goal 4.1 specifically looks at 5th graders who demonstrate the skills mindsets and habits most aligned to life success perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness and this will increase from 32.1 percent in 2023 to 38.1 per cent in 2026 your first chart here just shows you that beginning data point Little Red Dot there there we go if you move on to page 2 what you now see is all four topics okay so self-regulation social awareness

[00:55:00]
66.9 perseverance 60.1 and self-efficacy at 49.4% leading to a total of 32.1% how did that happen you ask well let's go to your graphic and we're going to let Dr Bowman teach you what he means go ahead Dr Bowman but thank you for the opportunity to explain this what the simple explanation is that the goal is percentage of students who demonstrates the skills like success and then there are four there are four examples perseverance self-regulation self

[00:56:00]
and social awareness and so because of that word and we took that to mean that that a student has to demonstrate all of those for okay so if you look individually perhaps do we have here individually say self-regulation there were 73.8% that demonstrated in self-regulation there were no 49.4 per cent and self-efficacy but since you had to demonstrate a student had to demonstrate strength in all of them the number of the percentage of students that demonstrated all of them was only 32% so if you look a little lower in the report where there's the red bars and the gray bars at the bottom you can see how you know 32.1 percent of the 5th graders met the overall

[00:57:00]
Google you have an additional 23.6% who had it in three of the four is a little feedback that helps there's an additional 18.3% that had in two topics 14.1 made it in one of the topics and then finally 11.7 demonstrated strengths in none of those four areas so that is how the the four individual goals kind of blend together to get that overall that we want to hit which is all of our students in all of these areas and we're starting at 32.1% for the school and we're going to try to get to 38 point one percent in 2026 for Android

[00:58:00]
that lays out and thank you he did it well he was not the explanation he gave me the first time so he has practiced and improved so I'm happy to report I had a quite able student yes you certainly worked it out on me so it was a lot of crayons so you did get to work your way through the chart I hope unlike me you're able to read it I'm going to have to take my glasses off and squint really hard but he broke down everything that's going on down at the bottom of that chart so you got the reds are the all four topics and then three two one is it builds up to none of it for

[00:59:00]
what is going well okay and I'm going to tell you we're going to save some time tonight because similar to last times monitoring report on this first time through as we read each interim the what's going well what needs to be improved and what is next are all pretty much locked up so I won't have to read all of it but what's going well well quite frankly we had a successful initial survey Administration with 83.8% of APs 5th graders participating the demographics of the participating students mirror The District student demographics indicating we have a representative sample individual School survey results have been presented to principles with an opportunity to construct meaning and next steps including connections to their school base 90 day plan the online survey platform is a sophisticated tool to help to segregate results recognize areas of Celebration and growth

[01:00:00]
pinpoint areas of concern principles also have access to an online Playbook through the survey platform which includes over 700 research-based lessons and strategies aligned to APS skills habits and mindsets and other social emotional topics APS has existing school programs and structures that offer opportunities to embed skills habits and mindsets for example except identify and move or aim SEL curriculums what's not going well well based on survey results 5th graders report lower scores in the area of self-efficacy currently APS does not have the universal approach to restore to practice there is a need to stop addressing social emotional development in isolation instead it needs to be included in the daily classroom experience

[01:01:00]
and finally District departments need to develop a universal understanding of social-emotional development and how they can support schools in its implementation which course leads us to our next steps so we are reviewing the survey participation rates we're trying to address and identify root causes for low participation and identify and share best practices for survey Administration across APS we're choosing to focus on self-efficacy with an intentional focus on self-efficacy and its intersection of daily classroom curriculum especially standards based instruction and other social emotional topics we can see games that will meet in gold and impact comes across the goals 5th grade survey data has been presented to elementary school principals in presented to other relevant stakeholders prior to the next survey Administration with the

[01:02:00]
what is on developing next steps on individual School sites and currently the equity office is being refocused to focus on restorative practices professional development and support are being developed to help administrators and teachers understand how to integrate skills habits and mindsets into the academic curriculum a department design team has been created to develop a coherent strategy and practices allowing academic and social support departments to meet to hear about each other's work and identify spaces to collaborate finally based on the work of guardrail 3 and the conditions that will create for classrooms across the district we are now working toward embedding APS skills habits in mindsets in existing academic routines instructions movie on 101st grade students and we are trying to move

[01:03:00]
percentage from 18% in 2023 to 24% in 2026 so again your first draft shows you that beginning point where we started this year next page again you see the same breakdown by each of the four topics again self-regulation is highest social awareness and perseverance and finally self-efficacy so you see your numbers again you can go to the bottom and review each of the columns and see how students in each of the subgroups did 4321 on the top extra topics so the only difference I said what is going well period

[01:04:00]
considering middle schoolers or some times the most difficult to to survey and to get stuff back from so I really want to commend our middle schools they did an excellent job of taking this seriously and trying to get the kids information in again so it's not going well we see the survey participation rate drop there's also an overall decrease in favorable responses in all skills habits in mindsets but especially in perseverance and self-efficacy and then on the survey results 8th graders report lower scores in the area of South efficacy and then again we know what other things we need to do there I think it's important that we're going to again focus on South Boston

[01:05:00]
I will keep trying to figure out ways that we can sort of slide these into curriculum so that it is a part of their daily classroom experience our final interim goal focused on 10th graders the goal was to move the percentages from 17.1 percent in 2023 to 23.1% in 2026 first draft explanatory you seen it for data point that change over time going into graph to get the breakdown again very very similar obviously self-regulation the kids feel pretty good about across the board social awareness is there a second highest perseverance system at the casino

[01:06:00]
look at how do you do in each of the four areas now of course it doesn't break it down to any which of the four it just says 4321 you can kind of guess based on the percentages but what would have the most so what's going well again we surveyed over half APS 10th graders and we got 52.65% and those of you that have been around for the 2 years have seen similar survey attempts come in under that so even though High School didn't come up with the largest numbers that came up with the really representative number and again the demographics of the District student demographics so we do have a representative sample which is really nice to see all three of these surveys were shared with the principles and professional development they were provided time to review these scores there was a

[01:07:00]
guided conversation on kind of what they meant they had opportunities to work with their peers to sort of compare and see who was doing what and then to really talk about okay what's next how could we impact self-efficacy what can we do so that was a lot of opportunity for them and again but it's not going well we've kind of going on on that clearly the focus on self-efficacy I do think in terms of the what we're going to do next most of it is the same and you come down to the last bullet and maybe even the last two because they're talking about ways to work with curriculum and instruction on ways to enhance the standards of mathematical practice as a way to see skills habits in mindsets come to life in the curriculum as well as house can be used to strengthen our early warning systems

[01:08:00]
Keller High School level so how do these data points really change the work that we're already involved in and how do they support that work that is our report at this point I will open up for questions and I brought people who really going to answer your questions really well you're really going to do it well thank you so much appreciation for the successful initiation of this successful implementation of a survey and the first go with this so acknowledging that this is all new work starting from scratch just really is impressive and so do you want to express appreciation to you and your team for that as well as Dr Bowman and the supper team for the comprehensive and thorough explanation of the data appreciate that

[01:09:00]
as well and then also just appreciation for the memo I think that background document was very helpful to give us more information as we're getting into this again cuz it's cuz it's new so I'm going to read the script how it's supposed to go and then I'm going to kind of go Rogue okay so we will now open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or tactical in nature via email before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see our questions during the meeting now must be of strategic nature meaning that we will ask questions to help us understand how the reality of our students is aligning with our vision so where I'm going to go a little rogue is I'm going to allow Technical and tactical considering how new this whole concept is for us the measurement is new everything is new for the administration as well as for the board and we're also still

[01:10:00]
learning our progress monitoring particularly with our new board members but also I know what those veteran members as well so I'm going to go ahead and open the floor to Technical and tactical questions I hope folks brought their guidance coaching documents from SSG around effective question asking so that you can see the types of questions that are Technical and tactical Technical and tactical in nature so we'll go there first and then we'll go ahead and make a pivot to be more strategic so I just want to allow space for the technical questions and tactical the floor is open to that maybe we can is the I need to refer to sorry hold on

[01:11:00]
I mentioned in my questions which I submitted that I noticed a decrease in student participation from 5th to 10:00 is do you see a other specific schools or areas of the city that have more have more difficulty about specific schools or areas but I'm looking for that does anyone know for sure you're really not supposed to ask about specific results on school it's really supposed to be overall what I would say is that pattern is

[01:12:00]
typical on most surveys that we give out there's simply put and this is going to sound a little strange about elementary kids are happy to do with teacher tells them to do right and they want to get it back and their parents are concerned about getting it back and let's make sure it happens and that just sort of Fades a little bit as they they get old frankly was not a little happy that the middle schoolers did better than the high schoolers you know because oftentimes it's the middle schoolers that are the ones who lose the paper forget to do it don't see the point or absent so I think that's part of what happened was just the nature of the age of that would be a strategic question if you're going to ask a future performance around what can you do to change it or what strategies if you want to know who's struggling right

[01:13:00]
in terms of the survey participation rate and then following up and I will say that because it was our first Administration we did hold our survey window open

[01:14:00]
longer than we had intended to so that we could get some of that follow-up and we don't intend to do that again but it was much appreciated that the associates were following up with the school principals to make sure it's getting done thank you that was a great pivot to a strategic question I will go ahead and stick with strategic questions and I'm going to just go down the line from my left to my right to give everyone an opportunity to ask a strategic question and then if there are members who have additional questions will go back through all right member benefits nothing for me thank you thank you remember our store I just have you might have mentioned this but when it comes to the 5th graders and South Africa see are you starting that program to help them sooner and greens or is it starting in 5th grade so we I'm kind of thinking through making sure I understand

[01:15:00]
I think we would want to start it sooner for sure I think as young as Kinder even our Pre-K students can understand the concept of self-advocacy even if we're not maybe even using that vocabulary word yeah although no reason that we wouldn't you know when a it really is about how the adult approaches a situation to help the student understand like you did really well on putting your toys away how do you feel after putting your toys away right it's as simple as a prop like that to help the child self-reflect because that's when we get to recognize oh that feels good to do the right thing feels good to get my work done so you know really starting at the younger ages but definitely the older the students get the more capacity they'll have for recognizing that thank you my only concern was if we're focusing on 50th and 10th we don't want to just

[01:16:00]
focus on the data but so I appreciate that thank you it was a rationale for picking those grades we were trying to look at transitional grades but night felt too close to 8:00 to just turn around so we fit the 8th with the two that are easy and then 10th was okay it's not 9:00 it's closed so we were trying to look transitional spots one of the things I really liked about when we talked about this and I've heard Ms Chad and her team a lot of people talk about this you know how much you feel self-advocacy would help you feel perseverance is when you learn to do things when you finish the standard space and you complete it and the teacher says you did this you did this word you have the skills now I showed you how you did it that's how you build it it's not having a little special lesson on the side and say now we all feel good right right so we're all right thank you for that question

[01:17:00]
also want to point out that these are the interim goals that we're speaking about which is the the 5th and the overall goal though is all so I am certain that they're working through all the grade levels but just these are just those cut points remember kids with disabilities in our soft I mean the sophomore I mean 5th grade we were at 28.8% of the treatments of information for our kids with disabilities in fifth grade and then up to in 10th Grade it was at 58.158% based on the survey what did how was the information retrieved for children with disabilities and fifth

[01:18:00]
versus the 8th and 10th grade I don't know whether or not it was on computer what where did you guys use the process of their their individual IEPs and retrieving that information based on surveys that's my question thank you for the question so because this is a survey and not a formal assessment any and all accommodations are allowed whether they're in the IEP or not so for example if a student needed the survey to be read to them out loud a teacher could do that the teacher could do the survey with the whole class at the same time there could be an educational system and helping students he may need it extra time all of the things and so I would certainly say that the IEP and the necessary accommodations were taken into account and then beyond that because it isn't I

[01:19:00]
it's for fun right it's like taking a quiz to see what your future is going to be I don't know you know like those fun quizzes you know so that it's not the formal assessment that we have to follow all the rules on my other one is what would you attribute to the higher percentage in 5th grade versus tenth grade the higher percentage Yeah it was that the 28.8 percent versus the 15.8 percent in 10th grade for the total yeah yes I attribute that to you know it's so much of it is conjecture right now will be honest I think there are so many different factors that would go into why all of these numbers would be different whether they just be aged development social determinants I think that's the next step

[01:20:00]
and what we're doing is that root cause analysis so we can really begin to understand what that is attributed to I would be very nervous to begin to make those guesses thank you thank you do you remember Jackson okay I asked a lot of questions beforehand so I really appreciate the the depth that you brought back to us and and honestly kind of made it hard for me to have a question to ask today because you answered most of the questions but I also know that it's really important for our self-evaluation tool and for our progress monitoring tool that every single board member asks a question so here's what Dr Bowman actually helped me with this question because I didn't understand it until I had this Andy graph okay

[01:21:00]
I could not figure out how these numbers were coming about how we were getting to I'm just going to go with Google just the overall goal for the how we were getting to 25.5% to me that didn't seem aggressive enough so my question is would you again could you explain why we are focusing only on self-efficacy and how why there is a focus on self-efficacy and how that Focus will increase our overall percentage yes for sure so when we look at self-efficacy and this is very much a theory of action Theory I think being the operative word there the self-efficacy really becomes the culmination

[01:22:00]
of the skills habits and mindsets that we're looking at so and to superintendent Elders point when we look at mastery-based education standards based education Mastery is one of the most important vehicles through which we experience self-efficacy when I can demonstrate that I can do something really well it feels good and it feels good to get that recognition and the more we feel that the more we want it I believe it's a very human need right to experience that so I think you know when we pick up perseverance for example and particularly looking at it in terms of the the standards the mathematical standards of practice perseverance is specifically listed a student needs to learn to persevere through problem solving particularly in mathematics so when they are experiencing that and learning the perseverance the end goal will be self-efficacy I

[01:23:00]
I want to I think clarify we won't only focus on self-advocacy but we will make a really direct push but all of the skills habits and mindsets have a place in the conversation and working on it and even though we didn't present it here and I don't want to complicate things I might get in trouble I don't know we did measure other things in our survey I'm not supposed to say it at me I'm sorry and so we are looking at a variety of other elements impact our school this work is really deep and complicated and I think to begin to make sense of it we feel really strongly that we had to pick one thing like we're not going to solve the problem we're going to solve a problem and in the meantime we're going to really work hard because I did see the question about how can you make sure the other areas don't go down while you're focusing on self-efficacy I am placing my bets

[01:24:00]
but they won't that if we focus on self-efficacy those areas will continue to go up so and then so specifically so I'm going to Pivot over here to Dr Bowman since like a specific Statistics question I think this is statistics right my daughter's trying to decide if she's going to take statistic I can't even say it so from a mathematical formulation if self-advocacy if the percentage of 40.1 percent goes up it causes the 25.5 in the center to also yes thank you for the question remember Jackson that is highly likely to happen I could also explain several ways that it wouldn't but the probabilities are absolutely correct but if that's how I can see goes up at 25.5% is going to go so long as the other three factors

[01:25:00]
correct and also so long that you know again and self-efficacy is not is not does not correspond with a a loss in one of the other areas or a particular student and if I may do you think that's part of the theory of action is that we will see those areas improve if we can really talk about self-advocacy and how you achieve self-advocacy a couple other questions were spurred based on your explanation of the chart but I will hold that to make sure everybody has a chance thank you remember I'm looking at

[01:26:00]
call 4.1 but really this applies to all I started off thinking that the increase from 32.1% in 2023 to 38.1% in 2026 what doesn't matter what I think how do we know this is a these increases are realistic and ambitious enough that they will challenge the district what what evidence is there of that thing so that is a fantastic question the answer I would have to say is we actually don't know

[01:27:00]
because it's a new assessment we haven't given it before I think that we need to try and if we blow 38% out of the water of students that are demonstrating success in all four of these areas simultaneously that then we're going to have a conversation here about maybe we said it higher recalibrate but I think it would be fantastic if every single one of our children reports strengths in each of those areas but but yeah they aren't right now posts you know it just don't know I think we tried to pick numbers that we felt were potentially reachable and like we said if they were too low it's because we didn't know and

[01:28:00]
readjust I don't think you know that this whole concept that they have to hit all four is really pretty limiting because especially when you're talking about young people and it's a one-day point in time test right I was in Middle School principal for 6 years and there's a lot of hormones that run around the middle schools and jump on the kids and get them to have interesting emotional states you just don't know how they're going to feel that day and they may feel good about I feel pretty good about myself regulation but I haven't been able to speak up for myself and weeks and I'm struggling it's but then six months from there that same kid may just feel like top of the world and Pagan eggs all four we did talk about the concept of do we want to keep that at and and just have all four

[01:29:00]
or is there a thought that maybe a kid hitting three out of the four is it getting pretty good shape but we kept it as we wrote it and that's where I think the percentages we were cautious with is in line with the idea they have to hit all four at a given point in time and if I can put a number on to that so that 6% increase would be 4,000 more students approximately 6% in the 6% increase is 4,000 students we need 4000 more kids across the district to tag all four to get that 6% it's a lot in her mind we get all four

[01:30:00]
what an accomplishment that would be well and in the reality is this week we haven't tried this before this is the first time we've ever done this and that's why I'm so pleased that we're here and having the conversation because we couldn't have had this conversation even 6 months ago that they really have done an amazing yeoman's job of getting this just to hear and then we'll see how far we get and I know with all the talk of the smart goals I will just say within the conversations we've had some of these numbers can be viewed as fairly like heartbreaking and we would want 100% of the kids to be here and I'm sorry I don't I don't want that to get lost in terms of this conversation about Lincoln 6% or 4000 or whatever it's we want all of them and that's really what we're aiming at and this is how we're measuring it but the goal is all of them but the

[01:31:00]
kids to have when they complete their APS experience so my question is the what is coming next mentions that currently the equity office is being refocused on restorative practices so what strategies do you use to establish this Universal approach to restorative justice and what budget implications might there be thank you for that question president Gonzalez so that position has actually been vacant for quite some time and so the first step has been to address that so we can really clearly put together a strategic plan with them however having said that there are you know restorative work has been

[01:32:00]
our district for quite some time and I I would say with confidence that any school we went to they would be able to talk about their restorative work to some degree in the school so building on that what we know is in place building on what we have in our handbook as well in terms of strategies there's a whole page that an adult can use to approach a situation and then getting really specific about what the right approach is for our district as far as the budget that is a piece we're looking at how do we continue that work I mean we do have the equity office and that's for the work belongs the equity office really is the school climate office if I were going to rename it back because I want all of those pieces

[01:33:00]
baby included in the school climate with the equity piece the restorative work you know our procedures for if there's discrimination or harassment like all of these things are really critical as well as our classroom culture training which is work we're doing to help really establish a strong classroom climate where students can and learn so I don't feel like that was a very specific answer for that you know I have my apologies I think it's a work in progress I don't like to make excuses but that is the reality of where we are and it's a critical component to move the work forward and creating our cultural belonging safety thank you for the answer I think it was complete it wasn't clear to me that the office being refocused indicated that there was an FTE being filmed and you answered my follow-up question as well which is why is this an equity thing as restorative justice is not a kids of color discipline is not a kids of color things so I have

[01:34:00]
acknowledging the importance of both School climate and belonging for all kids so we will go ahead and go back down the line again for strategic questions if you have one go ahead and share it if not you can pass you don't have a strategic question but can I ask a question yes okay so obviously self-efficacy is an area where we need to improve we've already discussed that but I'm just curious and this is a very broad question are we at all concerned about any negative impact that might that we might see through the students with the surveys and you know what they are getting from taking surveys and what message they're receiving from that in terms of self-efficacy if they ever feel like we have to do this over and over and does that mean that we are not learning or don't have the capacity to learn what we need to so thank you for the question remember benavidez they they take the survey twice a year so their next Administration is coming up in March and

[01:35:00]
to be honest I haven't thought of it that way you know so I really appreciate the question I wouldn't want the survey to have that impact on the contrary if we're doing our job right as the grown-ups and we help them see that they are developing these skills and able to answer the questions more often in the affirmative they'll feel even more self-advocacy but I think that is a really critical point and I will definitely be taking it into consideration as we move forward thank you and I'm not sure if you need different from our kids who take these standardized assessments and struggle period I just think trying to talk about how they're feeling it creates a different vibe and it shows the kids were interested in them in ways that I don't think a normal list the

[01:36:00]
assessment is different from a skills habit and mindset because we're talking about our kids and it's directly about them and what they're feeling and it really gives them an outlet so I wonder if maybe some kids will have a problem with it but I have a lot of kids might say wow suddenly you're asking about me and I haven't felt asked about in a long time number again I'm just one it was mentioned I think it was in the next steps but I could be wrong but there is collaboration between counseling department and CT Department I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about that looks like yes absolutely thank you for the question so we I think CTE is another I don't even think that's actually what we call it her and connected learning thank you I apologize so career and connected learning has always been an element of our counseling department we have

[01:37:00]
a career counselor career in college counselor in every one of our Comprehensive High Schools so the conversations are really about how do we strengthen that counseling program particularly in light of the direction that that programming is going I know they've done a lot of work this isn't exactly my area but they've done work in terms of aligning to economic need in New Mexico so it's really professional development I would say for those career in College counselors in terms of what are the pathways that are in the schools what are the opportunities in the district and how is that going to lead to success in the state really with an emphasis too on let's go home let's keep our our students are our kids here in New Mexico so I can add something to it so thank you for that answer so how does that help us with those Partnerships how do we

[01:38:00]
but I just I guess it was last semester attending a curriculum board meeting where the career connectedness was being highlighted for the curriculum assistance and I'm thinking of some of the materials that were demonstrated to them high interest videos that are the audiences for the students beginning to think about who in our community is modeling this particular industry that we can bring in and beginning to have those conversations about well how does perseverance play a part in your success if you're going into the film industry for example if you're going into agriculture talk about perseverance

[01:39:00]
alright so again and to superintendent Elders point the real value is that these conversations are bubbling to the surface where we have a platform to talk about things such as perseverance such as self-advocacy in the context of learning and growing up frankly thank you just a point that I think is really important to the conversation is the way that the survey has bred a culture of common language and common expectation in regards to this work at a very fundamental level we're using common terminology self-efficacy perseverance social awareness et cetera and this is an enabling the organization to be able to engage in professional development in a way that is Target

[01:40:00]
play intentional so for example to member Benavides previous question Mischief provided a dynamic professional development experience on this very topic with the data drill down to the school with each of our principles so that they are able to begin planning how they incorporate this work into their own work of continuous Improvement in a way that is targeted not separate from the Core Curriculum but worked into the curriculum this is not an initiative is the work and the PD that Mischief provided was really targeted at how is this integrated into the way we do business the way we operate the way we teach it's not a pull out where we go talk about SEL if it's not a pull out so let's go work on restorative practices this is intentional work where we each have a very

[01:41:00]
meaningful contribution to the way we operate in this work so the piece around common language I think is just really critical to get along those lines and Madam president and secretary historica I think also when we look at career connected learning within the school we always think about high school and so we are highly focused in that with like career pathway opportunities for kids and then building it down into the middle and elementary school for that awareness but I think something that when we look at that within our schools and how this can improve the results of this survey when we see kids going to school they have that and they have that sense of purpose and belonging within a career pathway also coupled with opportunities to experience successful outcomes in their focus of Interest whether it be

[01:42:00]
you know metal work or Automotive or no nursing whatever that may be then they start experiencing those opportunities for success and that engages them even more so I think there is a strong tie specifically at the high school but as we continue to bridge down into middle and elementary for that awareness so that the kids can feel like I cannot miss school today because I have to get to this class I wish they felt that way about you knowing math but it's it's their career connected learning classes and their specials and all the things that you know they find success and not to say our kids don't find success in math and Ela but I think it's those pieces that we're going to see in in return in the survey thank you thank you remember don't worry too yes we were talking about setting up our

[01:43:00]
aligning these goals to our life successes again my question will go into the lines of our children with disabilities and specifically asking transition plans now you know from 9 to 10:00 how do you propose maybe in the future that we could align these goals to those to a present transition plan so ultimately this work will part of our integrated system of support as we roll out a larger plan which I didn't want to muddy the water with quite yet but a Student Success system that will look at many many factors that influence A Student Success so we're starting the work with our ews work in the district which we've been doing for a while and we've gotten really

[01:44:00]
serious again sort of post-pandemic on our feet back under us in terms of looking at attendance behavior and course performance so the ABCs of early warning but what the platform of Panorama will allow us to do eventually is to take those components and also lay it next to you how the students are doing on these surveys also to create intervention plans also to track goals it's a very expensive system so that in the long run the adult advocates for that student will have access to a lot of information that will help them really be a stronger advocate in those transition plans president as we get more sophisticated in this work

[01:45:00]
I would love to see the scenario where some of this language find its way into IEP plans and transition plans as we work with our special Educators as we work with our sponsor teachers our headteachers to really see another layer of sophisticated support and intentionality in the way we support the individual student in their IEP thank you great remember Jackson how many questions do I get right now okay I'll ask this one because this is this was actually spurred by something that board member benavidez said what guardrails are in place for this test to assure against cheating the test and and can I let me like set this up and I'm not

[01:46:00]
in my opinion I'm just setting this up I remember in 10th Grade I really wanted to be a doctor right and they gave us an adult Cowboy cheerleader but I really wanted to be a doctor right and they gave that that test where it's like what what's your aptitude and I remember going down the test me like well yes I love science yes I love people yet like I aligned my answers so that oh my gosh I should be a doctor so my question is if kids start to learn that we are measuring their self efficacy or their perseverance I'm curious how this test does the Panorama guard rails against intentionally being like yeah myself because he's going up yes so so thank you for that question board member Jack Johnson's

[01:47:00]
questions whenever you're you're trying to get information from someone and you you do kind of have to rely on people answering honestly how they feel I will say that when I was a it's supposed to not supposed to use my own examples but you know when I was a student if an adult really tried to tell me to write something down on a particular assessment I probably wouldn't have listened to probably would have pushed me the other way and if it was coming from myself it would be fine I mean if they want to say that she is great and that they'll be a little bit longing and they feel like all of those good things you kind of have to take them at their work I do think that unlike many other assessments that this particular one is is low is very low stakes for the students and so some of the other things that we be concerned about with with more standard

[01:48:00]
assessments aren't as much of a concern with this one so long story short you have to trust people that when you ask their opinion on things that they give you your opinion board member Jackson I think maybe a guardrail I don't know if that's quite alright I don't know if it's strong enough to be a guardrail I suppose but it is again in the adults shifting their mindsets and I think the way they interact with the students and so the the place where they're surveying is safe to tell the truth to be vulnerable right because the survey does require some vulnerability and the question you know asked student to be reflective truthful are you nice to people when was the last time you were nice like that's kind of hard you know I took the survey myself and I was like oh I could probably

[01:49:00]
that's part of the school climate shift we'd like to see where we are having these ongoing conversations with students in a safe productive way so they they don't feel like they have to game the system if you will they're watching right now I'm sure those 5th graders how is I'm referring to go 4.1 but it applies to 4. 2 2

[01:50:00]
what are we going to do or next steps and I believe this is in reference to the to both the equity office The Narrative book on Equity office and Reserve practices and I was trying to revise this but I didn't have time because I was so intrigued by Gaming anyway so please bear with me how will the how will the district measure accountability for both equity and restorative practices and restorative practices be measured while honoring guardrail number five

[01:51:00]
how will the district measure accountability for both your plans on on you know combining equity and restorative practices we have got to get a person first we have to develop a plan that's that's doable so that's been open like she said for quite some time and we're not

[01:52:00]
play in the we had a great charging restorative practice program before the person was there but we had somebody that was working on it but now we don't so we're going to bring that person in and we're going to say look this is the way we want to go we actually have some data to think about how restorative practice can support this goal and and really start talking about those sort of practices and when we come into play so it's actually going to be different but I really think to say how are you going to measure people is a little trickier right now when we don't even really know what they're doing because we're right now it's sort of happening in the other and there's people look there's a really into this and they try very very hard to do a good job with it they're very studious there's others that seem to expect us to leave them by the hand and we just don't have a body yet so I'll just get a body

[01:53:00]
and there's somebody that can do the job then we'll hire as long as they can pass the background check so I'll ask for feedback from our coach around how that question so we will go back through and just open to any additional strategic questions are there more meaning we will ask questions to help us understand how the reality for our students is

[01:54:00]
maybe we can if something else comes up we can send a follow-up question is not working for this productive conversation now we must vote on whether or not we will accept the monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory

[01:55:00]
conversation with the superintendent and we have a deeper understanding about how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them at this point I will entertain a motion for the acceptance of this monitoring report I moved to accept the progress monitoring report for goal for I will second which is there any discussion or deliberations thank you again to the team that was very helpful and informative and mildly funny at points

[01:56:00]
we will be moving next to consideration and approval of the consent agenda which is item 6 on the agenda but items 6.1 through 6.13 make up the consent agenda so is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda items 6.1 through 6.13 I move to approve the consent agenda items 6.1 to 6.86 points 13 this is Courtney I will have a motion from sorry ok

[01:57:00]
financial officer and Rosalinda Montoya executive director of budget and strategic planning as well as Jessica Martinez our policy analyst and Dr Escobedo plans to share his screen during his presentation which I guess we'll be coming on Madam president members of the board superintendent Elder I'm here to give the budget update so we are going to start next please so in this presentation we're going to first cover the fy2 to this school year we'll go over what we've spent year to date or in cumbered today and what we still have to spend in the next in the next 5 months we'll have the legislative update which is going to be

[01:58:00]
given by Jessica Martinez and Dr Escobedo and some inflationary factors that will be given by stiffel and then I will go over the FY 2500 timeline give you an s or update and give you an update on some changes on our process to our budget presentations next so this slide is our 24 operation budget versus actuals so this First Column that was our budget of operational funds the 923.5 million we've spent here today as of 1 31/24 415.9 million we've encumbered 441.3 million and we still have 66.3 million to spend

[01:59:00]
from February to June and last year we spent 99% of the budget and we plan that we will spend 90.99% this year as well and any remaining balance which was just the 1% we usually help with our fun balance to increase fund balance so we have a policy in place that requires us to keep at least 5% fund balance we try to keep it a little bit higher just because we have a lot of like receivables that cross from one year to the other and we also want to make sure that we have enough to pay our first payroll because we don't get our first draw on the till late in

[02:00:00]
so next and next I will give it hand it over to Jessica Martinez and Dr Escobedo from our government Affairs office who will give the legislative update as you know our policy requires that we report certain items to the board and one of these items is the legislative update Jessica of the budget as it passed the House of Representatives last week the Senate is looking at making some changes to the overall budget and we are not yet sure how that's going to impact Public Schools the public education department did maintain the unit value and did not increase it so our unit value will stay at 6,241.67

[02:01:00]
per unit we're looking at receiving about 6% more in funding for a total of more than $964 million the budget does not fully fund our insurance leaving us about 2.7 million dollars short the budget calls for a 2% salary increase for all employees and leaves an additional 2% to be distributed on an average basis additionally there's a 60 million dollars in the budget to expand cage 12 plus and another 20 million dollars to push for educational performance like CTE and Community Schools the budget also includes additional funds to ensure Universal meals for all students and I will pass it over to my colleague doctor presidential million dollars to begin a tribal education trust fund and 60 million dollars for Career Technical education and career

[02:02:00]
exploration projects there's another 8 million dollars below the line to fund expanded Community Schools initiatives and there was a push to have new minimum salaries of $30,000 for full-time employees but that bill has not moved because of the costs associated with it finally there is a provision in the budget that states that the PED shall not approve the budget of any school district that provides fewer instructional hours to students next year than it did in the 20223 school year so this provides a policy and funding issue for the district and how to deal with the top schools who have hours of 12888 which is 148 more hours than statutory requirements which is a cost of 24 million dollars so we are communicating our shortfalls and concerns as the budget moves forward and we stand for

[02:03:00]
do you want to do legislative questions or keep going with the budget presentation keep going okay thank you Jack Dr Escovedo Madam president board members superintendent altar or the aps budget policy and as we get ready for next fiscal year we're looking at inflation and have reached out to our partners at steeple I want to introduce to you Brad thanks he's on virtually oh yes I see him and he's going to provide some information on the market and inflation conditions thank you so much good evening period

[02:04:00]
from time to time in conjunction with your financial advisor at RBC this update asked us to come to you this evening to provide a little bit of update not only on what we're seeing as far as inflation in the market but also to provide you some economic updates and financial Market updates to you I'm going to go ahead and share my screen if that's all right looks like I'm disabled from doing that if someone could allow that that would be helpful otherwise I'll just speak to it you should be allowed now okay great thank you for that so we have a few things will be talking briefly about here this evening talking about the current interest rate

[02:05:00]
response a lot of times the movement and the interest rates to the inflation and the board in the Federal Open Market Committee making some of those changes will look at some bond issue the supply of bonds in the market some inflationary history and then an interest rate forecast to finish things off for for this evening as I mentioned and I think as we're all aware of inflation has been high now for a couple of years coming off of some of the covid and pandemic Supply restrictions and inability to get materials and items across the world and the global footprint is over the last couple years after the rise in those rates to what we sold

[02:06:00]
at its peak in an in 2020 to about a year ago in the winter and the prior year to that in 2021 we started to see some decrease in decline in in the in the inflation however it's still an elevated levels and the FED is keeping rates high for now so looking at the page here in the top right hand I'll direct you to that chart and table I've got a few items to show you here with that inflation and with the elevated interest rates for seeing quite a bit of volatility in the financial markets investor concerns about what what's going to happen in the future whether or not the FED can navigate a soft Landing so to speak meaning maintaining the higher interest rate levels in order to combat

[02:07:00]
play should I get it get it down so in that top right-hand chart you'll see the red and the in the yellow areas those are the last two years in the 1816 denote weeks within 2022 and 2023 that exceeded a high measure of volatility in that week and we measure that with 15 base basis point movement so basis point is is 0.01 of a percent so 15 basis points we're talking about movement of of 0.155 that municipality

[02:08:00]
Easter eggs and APS has access to are actually still well within our averages if you look at the bottom left of this page I do have a chart here that shows a 20-year history of where interest rates have been in each gray bar if you look at that bottom left chart the Graybar represents the low point of interest rates over the last 20 years and the high point of interest rates over the last 20 years and then that the reason it moves from left to right in multiple bars is going out to a 30-year borrowing so each individual is the solid black line in the middle

[02:09:00]
MMD is Municipal Market data and that is our Benchmark for the tax exempt Municipal market so that is what we call the gold standard a AAA type credit that that price is there in the middle so you'll still you see that the rates are still about three percent for tax-exempt borrowers in fulls like APS so all in all still low cost to borrowing not not what you're seeing like in the residential mortgage rates pushing above 7% so still low cost of capital for school districts another way we measure kind of the health of the financial markets and specifically in the municipal Market it is through the supply and demand of new Bond

[02:10:00]
that means that school districts and cities and counties or issuing Bonds in order to fund their projects so that's a good indicator of of economic growth of the need for that money coming in from investors and so we're still seeing good output as you may have heard we just recently had some numbers and we started off the year with positive job creation and all these old is leading me to some inflation called

[02:11:00]
they're also leading to some inflationary pressures through the demand for products that leads me to this next slide CPI or the Consumer Price Index this is the most commonly used measure of inflation the FED is one of their key measurements as well and CPI looks at a what we call a basket of goods it looks at them every month and it looks at them excuse me every year on a year-over-year basis and a month of a month basis and when you look at the change in those prices from year to year and month to month that's how we measure inflation so the bottom is the historical inflation at the right hand side of that we had a

[02:12:00]
Peak again that was starting about December of 2021 going through last winter as well and you'll see that that was the highest inflation percentage that we had over the last 20 years and it's come down pretty sharply since but we're not all the way there yet so currently inflation is measured it's been hovering between 3 to 4 percent the FED wants to get to 2% so while inflation has come down which is again measuring the the increase in your cost of goods it's still elevated when you think about your budget or when you think about large-scale construction projects so how far does the Dollar go it's getting

[02:13:00]
to a better spot but we still see elevated inflation at this time we expect interest rates to stay up for the time being with maybe some slight decreases coming this summer and that should correspond to a decrease in inflation at that time you know one more comment here while we're on this inflation slide you know we work completely with with psfa to help a lot of our school districts access some money from the state and they do a good job of keeping track of some of the construction company cost of capital or I'm sorry for the cost of construction for some of their approvals here

[02:14:00]
last year and you may have heard this but almost all the schools are now about 800 9800 per square foot for construction or or even higher sometimes exceeding $1,000 per square foot so we don't think and we don't expect the prices the current prices to come down we think the prices were they are are here to stay we hope that they don't continue to rise even more so and we're seeing that through some of the inflation numbers but I also here to tell you you shouldn't expect a big deep breath in prices as well just moving to slide 7 here in the top right-hand chart I'll direct you to the interest rate forecast

[02:15:00]
what are predictions for where interest rates are going and then this table also looks at not not just our Economist number but looking at the full Market participants as well so you'll see the FED fundraise is currently at 5. 5 8

[02:16:00]
tensions the wars going on in the Middle East some of the conflicts that continue to be going on the Ukraine Russia War as well depending on what happens with those if there's escalations of course that can lead to further uncertainty more volatility and maybe even some more inflationary pressure you know when moving to that next section number two when is the Fed going to start to reduce interest rates it's a big part of it it's important for them to stay aggressive at this time they're still really good GDP growth at economic growth jobs growth and some of the cost of

[02:17:00]
play some upward pressure on inflation that they want to keep rates high for now and then lastly just some of the technicals this has to do more with maybe the bond Supply that we were talking about and and getting rid of the inverted yield curve meaning that short-term interest rates right now are higher than some of the midterm interest rates we have this presentation with DACA I'm going to skip over a couple of these last slides I've talked to about it here in my narrative speaking to you can certainly review this and more depth if you need a little bedtime reading material

[02:18:00]
thanks for your time we will go ahead and pause and wait for the end to field any questions thank you thank you Brad so we'll go back to and can you bring her next one thank you thank you thank you so next is our timeline for FY 2205 operational budget and so of course the important thing that's going on now is the largest

[02:19:00]
session which will go through February 15th and I'm giving this presentation to you tonight and then we'll move on to continue our budget steering committee meetings and in those meetings we have you know we make sure that we are watching these legislative outcomes and see how it's going to affect the budget and see you know if we're going to have to do any movement in what we have to possibly get rid of or what we prioritize this as being definitely need to be and then we're going to be sending out the budget call templates and that's like the budgets to all the schools on February 15th so we send it up to the principles and then they start they have a couple weeks to to start working their budgets and seeing how they want to use their funding and on February 20th through the 23rd we have a workshop for those

[02:20:00]
where they can ask us any questions regarding their budget templates and how they work that and then on March 1st we will send out those templates to departments and may of course is when we compiled the proposed budget and that is compiling Capital grants and unrestricted funds or are operational funds and then on May 29th we will be bringing that budget to you for your final approval then we will send that to p e d which is due to them on May 31st and then they do their technical review in ones we get that we can upload the budget to be used in July then next

[02:21:00]
I will just give a quick update to rsr funds I'm glad to say that we have expensed or encumbered at least 87% to date as of 13124 of the 242 million dollars that the federal government gave us to help us get through covid and you know we have the other allocations is 100% and some of these that have higher numbers like that 16.5 they're all accounted for and planned for it's just a matter of getting them encumbered and some of them is like summer school or things that happen closer to the end of the year but we're very happy that we've done a great job everyone's been doing a great job on getting those funds spent

[02:22:00]
the next slide is just the according to sfog superintendent school boards and budgets each year the school board relies on the superintendent to draft a budget and you guys can read all this but we just want to make sure that that you know that we are taking this into account when we build our budget we definitely want to accomplish the vision that the community wants students to know when we are taken to account the goals while on the values of the community guard rails and we just want to make sure that we demonstrate the alignment of the goals while honoring the guard rails and we will begin this process of demonstration of alignment in the upcoming months and so one change is going to happen last year you saw just

[02:23:00]
me and renette presenting every month on mostly the operational budget and this year we really want to have a more holistic look at all the funds not just the unrestricted funds and so we plan to have you know collaborative presentations like what you saw today where we bring in the experts from the each each part that I at the end pull together and present to you so on March 6th we will be having Capital Food Services transportation and special education giving their budget presentations on April 3rd we will have title one student family and community supports and Language and Cultural equity and on May 1st we will have curriculum and instruction and Career Technical education budget presentation

[02:24:00]
and then of course on May 29th I will be back to present the budget to be approved for the FY 25 budget year and with that we stand for questions great thank you for your presentations in terms of order of operations I think I'd like to start with just any questions on the market and inflation update so if not we can let Mr angst go are there questions on the market inflation update no okay thank you mister angst you are free to leave the meeting and then the same with our legislative update start there so that Dr Escobedo and Miss Martinez can similarly have some time back are there questions on the legislative update I have a question about lots of concern in the district about

[02:25:00]
schools and where they stand any news Madame President member Dominguez I can share a little bit about that we are seeing funding and let me go back to my notes here cuz I know we touched on this a little bit but we are seeing below the line funding of 2 million dollars meaning that that is not recurring right in addition to what's already budgeted for them let's see 60 million dollars in the budget to expand K-12 plus and another 20 to push for CTE and Community Schools so I know that Community Schools is a pretty high priority for the legislators they're aware of the benefits of that program OK Google

[02:26:00]
I can't really give you much more information and I apologize for that the budget is sitting in Senate Finance waiting for some movement so we're crossing our fingers that we get some updates tomorrow or Friday thank you and wellness Martinez did go over numbers and her presentation we do have a document in our email that lays those out as well in case folks didn't catch him any other questions on legislative update I do remember Jackson sorry and can you just confirm I heard I heard some shortfalls so I just want to confirm these numbers did I hear that there's a potential 2.7 million I was trying to write as fast as I can I heard 2.7 million short what is that for for insurance for insurance okay and then I heard 24 million shortfall it was

[02:27:00]
after the PED shall not so it had to it must have been it was like a policy and probably referring to the top so there's a 24 million shortfall for top schools and it has to do with language that they put in house last year about saying we can't reduce instructional hours that the state identified as needing most rigorous intervention they funded interventions for two of them refunded the third and they only did it for one year and so we picked up those interventions for all three schools

[02:28:00]
okay so things were a little sketchy and then the extra money came in and we thought we were really promoting the model the tops model we really like the concept of adult professional development time the genius hour all the elements of tops that are driven by having a longer work day and the longer school day so we had the extra money is availability to expanded our program as a pilot to see if the state might look at this and say this is a valuable model maybe this is how we should schools maybe I look at elements of this and when you speak to members of the LFC and when you speak to individual legislators they really like the model they really like the model but they're not paying for the model and since it was Esther funded we argue this was simply a grant funded project it's not operationally so we're working on that

[02:29:00]
we're working on what what exactly happened if you really really want to get to the nitty gritty please feel free to call Dr Segura she has a treaty on this that you will just love but it gets very complex because we start getting into how they count instructional time whether parent teacher conferences get to be included in these days they don't how professional development is no longer embedded so just gets very expensive very quick so that's what we're on it we're certainly okay so are there any more shortfall numbers that I missed you so I had a question on the you said 6% increase the

[02:30:00]
send salaries plus the other stuff eltp fixed costs Bible education what makes up that 6% I guess that's my question because I'm actually going to looks ready yes Madam president doesn't include the seller increases of 2% and then 2% average they also added a few other elements to the scg as they always do so it would what we were arguing as a state or was that we would like an unencumbered pot of money that we can utilize in a way that would allow us to do something to benefit kids so for newborn members but you need to understand is that yes they gave us a lot of new money last year and they spent it all they put they said well for example this is a goofy one but they passed the

[02:31:00]
so we had to put 3 million dollars worth of feminine hygiene products out across the district and that's in the scg so that's money of that that spent I can't do any other than that and every program that they put in that's how they fund it will just that's in the scg instructional materials that's in the scg we need new technology okay well by the time we got through our 100 million dollars 94.95

[02:32:00]
right and then I heard I think please clarify that the 30,000 yearly income for educational assistance did not pass it has not thank you I would say the 2% is contingent on funding and then negotiation that's a real real explain a little bit more about the tribal trust fund and what's the benefits are for I can't speak in depth about that matter what I can tell you is this I know that representative lente has presented that legislation in order to create a tribal trust fund there had not been one previously

[02:33:00]
I know that he has that that bill in Senate Ed today or tomorrow so we'll know more soon all right any more questions on the legislative update all right Dr Esco Martinez thank you very much we will go now to questions on the overall budget update period versus actual that is a spender lose amount that we have the 666

[02:34:00]
there has been times where the state will pull back money from districts we haven't seen that in the past while I've been here since 3 years so so we figure whatever we have left it's usually like 1% and we've been able to add it to it and pull it up we use that fun balance to help us balance our budget when there's a deficit so if like if that 2.7 million deficit still stays there after we do everything we can we will eat into that fun balance but we have to stay within that 5% or higher at all times thank you and I think there was a distinction you made during the sa I'm sorry I said where you clarified versus plans to spend so I'm assuming the same is here where we

[02:35:00]
you see that there's a balance of 66 million it doesn't mean it's just money that's left it's just not encumbered but there is a plan for it to be spent exactly we we plan usually like 1% of this would be about 9 million dollars so we plan on spending all of that all 66 is what we hope for but we've seen a trend of leaving about 1 on the tables so and it adds up quickly I mean when you have 142 schools and 40 plastic Apartments everyone leaves small amounts but it all adds up to to it no one usually leaves you know big huge lots of money on the table okay I think it's got another question on the budget presentation overall yes and I think this is appropriate to to the presentation

[02:36:00]
so what changes have happened to the budget that have created limitations or have limited access to culinary arts CTE programs because today it's not the first time I've heard this concerned limitations to the program to limitations to the money that they need to to run the program limitations to the phone I think that is understanding the

[02:37:00]
so we have processes within the district that have internal controls separation of Duty are checks and balances so I think understanding those processes for the Department to be able to get those orders through is what we're working with the Department to help them understand it and see how we can assist them make sure they get through the purchasing procurement process and have there been recent changes or no yes yes you may have heard we had a little bit of an issue over there in that department when I first came on that is required some significant changes to how procurement is done over there and we've been working very closely with the state in the federal government to make sure that those processes are followed

[02:38:00]
so there may be some people that are adjusting to the new reality there are more safety checks than they were before and you can't just go get what you think you need you have to follow certain guidelines inside the programming that the district has established so yes it is changed it is a tighter process I don't think I don't necessarily know like for example with the public speaker meant today but will certainly look into it but it's I don't think teachers are there was a time I was hard to get that money and maybe maybe there's still some roadblocks that we need to clear will look into it but I think part of that is there are new processes and they're more stringent and they're more steps in their work before or obvious reasons

[02:39:00]
willing to meet with departments one-on-one and we have done that and we plan to do that we've set up you know meetings with them to actually do working meetings and say you know what is what is the process and what are you having struggling with to get through quickly and we hope to have like other departments help other departments to if we see that one department is is getting through the process fairly easy and quickly make them with somebody that's struggling and maybe they can

[02:40:00]
ideas as to how to help each other to to really learn like when it was saying you know the training is really important and a lot of times we have a lot of turnover in our in our areas and so there's somebody new and they almost have to start all over learning the process again right and then as superintendent Elders said it has become more stringent and we're there's certain areas that have become highly scrutinized and you know more steps have been put in place but it's nothing that we can't get through it's just a matter of training so I think as we work with the Department that it's not really a barrier it just takes a little bit longer than the operational funds where you don't really have any restrictions and you can just do stuff the other ones require a little more steps and

[02:41:00]
working really hard to work with anybody to help get those barriers kind of put aside and be able to see that it's really not that hard to process it just takes more steps thank you remember Jackson yes I have two questions if that's my first is so I notice on this flight that you mentioned that February 15th we will send out the budget calls for the schools so my question is based on the fact that we are you know budget has to be aligned to the goals budget has to be aligned to student outcomes student base budgeting how is this process going to be different than last year than last year will we are always improving on how to align the goals and the guard rails to the spend and I think you're going to see that in the presentations

[02:42:00]
as you see each area really focusing on a lining their funds with to the golden guards rails when we send out the templates they do have well one thing that we changed is last year in the template we just had a section where they kind of aligned each line item to a goal and guardrail but it was kind of you know it was our first time and so we really didn't have firm definitions as to what we meant and some people think they can align a little bit to each goal and so this year we actually we were sending out a survey kind of tool where it's not really a survey but it's a tool that we send out to them and they asked more details questions and makes them think a little bit more about how they're doing it and so we're actually having

[02:43:00]
the associates go over the questions right now before we send that out to make sure that it addresses and it's understandable the way we you know because sometimes the lingo Finance is a little different than the lingo from the school side so we want to make sure we have them look at it and they're doing that right now so that we can send those out and make sure that the that it seems a little more aligned so we're trying different things hopefully it's going to show better percentages I mean I don't know if it's better or not but I think it'd be more clear as to what we're asking them and do you think kind of extrapolating from that to the information that then comes to the board would like would it be possible for us to see even things like with the per student spend is as it relates to student outcomes like to a particular student outcome or

[02:44:00]
what the the the the spend is per school as it relates to the student out to the particular student outcome goals that is what each of these cuz each template is per school so we could do that I think last year we did it globally because I think that would be a lot of slides but we could do that if you want it for each school I mean I'm just wondering if like I mean if we really are trying to adhere to student based budgeting right where the the budget has to align to to the goals then how are we going to ensure that that's happening well we're doing that through these this process and and I believe that we even last year we got a lot of information from each school but you know we do that internally

[02:45:00]
on our side making sure that and then when we present I mean we try not to make it as cumbersome and long and we felt that it was you know the compilation of it all was kind of good enough but we're open to any suggestions and we're always wanting to do I think it may not be necessarily through the budget process or through the call but I think what might be helpful if I can build on member Jackson's question is like a scatter plot that where you could see school by outcomes or school bye bye performance against each goal like that genomics Scatter Plots for example to work with the yes and that's one thing that we kind of

[02:46:00]
I wanted to show you by having you know multiple departments and do presentations is kind of how collaborative we all have to be with all the departments in order to build a budget so there's a lot of information and I will definitely reach out to them and see what they can help us with with once we have the once we've gotten the the data back from everyone we can help them I mean I could probably put it in myself but we're in the middle of doing other budget items that are kind of more important to get the money to the to the Departments but what I'm trying to say they've developed a system by which we can perhaps more carefully aligned at the percentage of dollars spent specifically with fde towards each goal all right we already produced for each School

[02:47:00]
the amount of spend per student so that's a separate item and it incorporates all the things such as the federal dollars at risk dollars I heard the unit value today but that's not really the unit value because it hasn't factored in everything else it gets factored into it I'm happy to help these guys consider some of this stuff but we're not going to do it during budget season I don't have time so we'll have to kind of figure out what it is exactly looking for we certainly familiar with the genomics even if I don't know the Scatter Plots you referring to but that's worked down the road and we'll see what we can produce out of that and it'll take some time with Mr West and Dr Bowman

[02:48:00]
okay so my second question is kind of this is going back to the shortfall the question that I had about the shortfalls have you started to think about because there might potentially be a shortfall what programs might not be funded President we have been already starting and have some Vermont looking at basically what do we need for the basic school for the standard school to just open the lights to just have it open we're looking at that cost and then we're looking at some of the programs that we've been fun that we know how to come over and then we also look at some of the priorities from the past like the Fine Arts initiative and the next

[02:49:00]
so we've been looking at like I said what do we need to just be in business what do we know has to come over as an initiative that is going to continue what has to come over from Esser and to be able to make those adjustments so we do have all of those numbers however because it's not finalized yet we're still crunching numbers to be able to see we need to see what our final challenge is to see if we can tap into that be able to utilize it and still adhere to the 5% and then start thinking of strategy is going forward knowing that that so as you're making those decisions what is your what's your

[02:50:00]
Northstar to make that decision as to what is considered a stay and what is considered a bow it's definitely working with cabinet with the associates looking at the goals looking at the guardrail for instance one of them is Panorama Panorama was funded with Esther funds we know that has to come over we know that that's part of today you talk about it associated with the goals in the car rentals that's one of ours because we know we have to do that so we are actually I know the numbers sounds scary here 15 and 20 million this is really pretty close I mean Rosalinda and I and then Tammy before that we had years old and we thought we were going to be 50 billion short so there was a first year the pandemic oh yeah that was scary scary scary scary scary scary they're

[02:51:00]
they always take the most conservative most safe most fiscally responsible answers and then we start looking under the sofa cushions and we find some money here and there and you know we had a breakthrough today of 3 million that was that's really handy so we will get there and I do think what we also understands we have to make some adjustments okay so we the not use panorama there's maybe the paper tutoring okay we've had it for a year we really like the concept of the tutoring I'm just throwing this out there it was paid for by Usher maybe it doesn't come over and so we take a 9000 dollars savings there until we can afford it and then we'll figure it out the main goal is to do it the way that maintains the schools and they'll always be the first they're always the first thing we fund that's the biggest thing that came out of this this Eros research was that the way we do it by the time

[02:52:00]
help me find the schools were pretty tapped out of money so it's going to be looking at some programs trying to maintain FTE in a way and then start looking at where we can maybe move FTE and and shift cost so that the students are impacted the North Star is always what we do is best for kids and you've also given us his goals and guardrails that now have to be contributed considered like she's Panorama we can't do go for without it are there other questions on the budget presentation so I have a question for the board so we have in front of us the dates for which we will receive presentations and the information that will receive with May 29th being the day that will receive the operational

[02:53:00]
what else do you think you might need in order to approve the budget and acknowledging also that we do we did just pass the new budget policy in which we asked that question bored what do you need in order to fulfill your fiduciary responsibility as board members and approve the budget and so I think we put what we need in that budget policy but we do have members who aren't here and this is a new way of doing things so I just want to make sure that we're setting up our budget team up for success and that we can come into that May 29th meeting having had most of our questions answered having received most of the information that we need so this isn't a question that you have to answer right now unless you have something really top of mind but please think about that and if there is something that you think you might need in order to move forward if you can just relay that question through Miss King but I will open is there anything top of mine that you think you might need

[02:54:00]
does that type of thing feel realistic for you to be able to produce without

[02:55:00]
extra load yeah that's the other we have some of this when I think about the budget because in the budgets we have like past actual and then we have projections going forward so that is showing the past Trends and then showing what we think it's going to look like in the future so we have that type of data and I guess that's I guess my question is I can't help it it was prompted by board member Jackson's question and it's not so much that I want to see specific schools but there are some schools that are going to have

[02:56:00]
more needs address if we're going to make significant changes in gold one for example and even go to so I guess it's related to how we address those needs and how we see that in in the budget report if that makes sense so this may not be something that we can answer right now so I think we have some trend lines in terms of actuals and also projections so maybe we can think about what might be helpful but is not a heavy lift for now and then also the question is open to others if there is something that you think is going to be important that you need to be able to prove the budget if you could relay that question through Miss King and then my last thing is just put it

[02:57:00]
play helpful to have the materials further in advance when we get our other materials cuz I do think a lot of the questions that we had tonight or were pretty basic clarifying questions that we could have submitted over email and save some time I know what the legislative calendar in particular obviously were dependent upon them and when they vote but even just having the whatever we can more in advance I think would help okay so we with that will move on and agenda items 8 and 9 were removed during the adoption of the agenda so we are at the end so the next Board of Education meeting will be February 21st at 5 p.m. at the Alice in Bruce King educational complex at 6400 uptown
