Tamara Romero you have two minutes for family because we love the community aspect of this school my son is established and he loves his friends and teachers there I'm asking you to please keep our best bell schedule the same as we have this year which is 805 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. we do not use buses not just the big yellow ones but also the ones for special ed and homeless families none of those come to us we are 100% best free our community has changed schedules too many times this will be the fourth time that it has changed and it's very difficult for students staff and parents to adjust every year we do not want to have to leave our community because the district is on changes that don't apply to us it's not just student turnover that we will have if the schedule is not consistent but good stuff as well this

[00:06:00]
change the dynamic of our beautiful diverse and caring school that we currently have thank you for your time thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Marcy May following Marcy will be Nicholas Porter Marcia have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you so much for a time in the way that they are changed and what was what we saw happen over at a Trico Heritage High School prom was pornography I don't care what you are but what we saw is adult entertainment Bing brought into a high school public setting that was supposed to be fun I don't know if you saw the the faces of some of those children but they were really uncomfortable

[00:07:00]
because they had somebody twerking now I don't care like I said I don't care what persuasion you are that has no place and then we find out that this guy has been doing this and our Public Schools then we wonder why our children cannot learn as I said pornography changes a child and if you give a teenager pornography he will get addicted she will get addicted and then if you give them a chance to see pornography or math book or history or literature they will go for the pornography we are hardwired for that and you were presenting this information and these ideas the children and you know that it is addictive they know the people that are promoting this they know that it is destructive and his children I know because when I was 3 years old I had pornography in my

[00:08:00]
I was never the same and I was never the same after I first saw that and I was never the same after I was molested please what this crap out of our schools our children do not deserve it they deserve to be protected and that is your job thank you for next speaker is Porter followed by Samantha painter Mr Porter you have two minutes once you begin speaking member of the board and superintendent thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is Nick Porter and I'm a parent of two children Elementary School I also spent 15 years teaching before the stress got too great for me to continue I say this so that you know that I have great respect for the staff that is special in many ways as

[00:09:00]
how do you spell Casey says every student at Inez is known safe empowered and inspired it is a Vibrant Community but also one which is stretched very thin Administration staff and parents work together to keep in is the welcoming and productive school that it is Inez is one of very few schools in the district which is not served by busing again no buses transport students to and from Ines Ines is the title one school a top school and a community school as a community school not served by busing I kindly ask that you board president members and superintendent allow us to retain the current bell schedule for the next school year there's no need to change what is working for this already thinly spread but Vibrant Community many students and parents have written letters to the school board and District leadership and received word back that busting is dictating

[00:10:00]
on the schedule we anticipate that many families and staff members will leave Inez if the proposed bell schedule goes into effect next year as busting is not a factor that Ines please use your power to do the right thing and allow this community to have the influence and on the decisions which affect it thank you thank you sir for next speakers Samantha painter followed by Daniela Steiner you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you for your time my name is Samantha I am a parent of two children who currently attendance Elementary with an involved community of families and has been a wonderful school for all of my children to attend I'm requesting that I need to be allowed to keep the current 2324 schedule for next year since it is what the parents want

[00:11:00]
is it is better for young children including my incoming kindergartener who learns best in the mornings since young students are already falling apart emotionally by the afternoon and you are now asking them to stay in school until after 4:00 p.m. since our bell schedule has changed every year for the past 3 years and since Inez does not use buses we do not affect the bus schedule APS values whole Child Learning which Fosters a sense of community and encourages interpersonal interpersonal skills problem-solving creativity goal setting and self-accountability constantly changing our schedules does not support the whole child or consider the well-being of our elementary students so I asked you to please let us keep our current bell schedule my name is Danielle Steiner I am the school nurse and

[00:12:00]
turn up two children who attend Inez Elementary I'm here to talk about the many changes in the bell schedule that has been opposed Upon Us in the last 3 years I know this is a title one community school that has a beautifully diverse student population and a heavily involved community of families it is a school of choice and many students transfer to school to the school all over APS I am requesting that Ines is allowed to keep their current bell schedule for the next school year and that the bell schedule changes get communities feedback and our Community Driven this will be the fourth year in a row that District leadership has cost us to change our bell schedule for very little explanation as to why why right now we are being told that it is due to Transportation Logistics our current bell schedule of 805 to 335 is so much better for many reasons it is better for families financially so they won't have to pay for both before or after care my family currently in If This Were to go through my family would have to pay

[00:13:00]
200.00 per month extra out of pocket it is also what staff and parents want it is better for young children who learn best in the morning young students who are already falling apart emotionally by 2:00 p.m. and you are now asking them to stay in school until 4:00 p.m. I see this as a school nurse and working along closely with my school counselor she has told me that it is also the case our bell schedule has changed every year for the past three years already and what seems to be most to APS leadership in my communication that I've had with them is that Inez does not use buses which is the main reason that I have been told every time I get feedback consistency and autonomy is better for attendance and engagement let us keep our current bell schedule a community school with engaged families who are traditionally happy with APS make a Community Choice thank you thank you ma'am or next speaker is on Zoom

[00:14:00]
you're Aldridge and we love it both of our children drive there and are known our family is included and welcomed and I would like to request that I know this is allowed to keep its current bell schedule for the past several weeks about this issue and every time I get the same form response that says it's about busting and that's the reason they can't change Art's schedule back to what it currently is but I know actually uses 0

[00:15:00]
is not an issue for us and because it's a community school I believe we should be allowed to have the autonomy to make a community decision this decision is better for families that's what families want it's better for students and it's what staff wants I would like that you listen to what the community wants and and give us the chance to make this decision for ourselves thank you thank you for next speakers in the room Dr Samuel period

[00:16:00]
special Albuquerque but now you all have heard that principal was fired in other employees on administratively due to parents who were rightfully Outreach but the sexualized performance of Atrisco Heritage Academy from as a result of the public outcry against this many medical doctors and other countries found there's no solid evidence supporting the medical transitioning of young people why aren't American clinicians paying attention sexual explicit age inappropriate pornographic books have been identified many districts across New Mexico schools young as 11 years old and high schools young ass 14 years old besides being in the library

[00:21:00]
high school students do not need to see a man rest in up in skimpy attire dancing provocatively and showing his genitalia the administrative and principal broke the law you have to be 18 years old to enter a strip club where they dance like this go back and watch the videos circulating the students were appalled and stunned the dance the dancer motivated the crowd this does not matter if the dance or was a transient female or male this behavior is not as unacceptable Behavior you cannot bring back those kids innocence it is gone their eyes can never not see that again yes thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room its Maria

[00:25:00]
the previous speakers have spoken to we've noticed has brought up a lot of misinformation misinformed information about lgbtq plus communities and other marginalized people I want to remind the board in the larger APS community that we have an obligation to ensure that schools are safe places for every single student and staff member regardless of their identity and due to the sensitivity of this event we need to make sure we are referring back to policies and procedures that APS has that have been reviewed by community and approved by the board we need to be mindful of our rhetoric surrounding this incident and realize that that has a real impact on students and staff of this district and also that any decisions that are made about this situation have a real impact on students and staff in this district there are people in this District who are working hard to make sure that our schools are safe and welcoming places particularly for lgbtq plus students that work often goes really on recognized we want to recognize that and honor that

[00:26:00]
make sure that we're following the policies and procedures of the sport thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Kelsey's snare Kelsey are you there OK Google and we do not use busing Inez has a diverse student population and involved community of families it is a school of choice and many students transferred to our school I am requesting that I was allowed to keep their current bell schedule for this 24/25 school year I have these reasons it is better for a families financially as they won't have to pay for both before and after child care since it is what staff and parents wants it is better for young children who learned in the morning since young students are already falling

[00:27:00]
emotionally by 2:00 and now we are asking them to stay in school until 4:00 are bell schedule has changed every year for the past 3 years already and since Ines doesn't use buses which is the reason for the change in the first place consistency and autonomy is better for attendance and engagement please let us keep our current bill schedule and let a community school with engaged families who are happy with APS make our Community Choice thank you thank you ma'am next speaker is in the room Miss Janet Sarah's can you have two minutes once you begin thank you ma'am good evening Madam president board members and superintendent this is my first time to come since all this new Arrangement so I'm very interesting I

[00:28:00]
proud member of the first graduating class of Del Norte High School 1966 I'm looking around the room and thinking most of you were not even alive much less a junior at a brand new school I do want to call attention to the fact that we are celebrating for the entire upcoming school year the 60th birthday or anniversary of Del Norte High School opening back when the corner of San Mateo and Montgomery there was a stop sign and part of Montgomery was still a dirt road and there was nothing out there except the silver dollar drive in and golf mart but Del Norte is the proud beneficiary of about 15,000 graduates and this coming school year we want to

[00:29:00]
call attention to graduates who are artists musicians public servants elected officials Educators attorneys medical anyway every possible kind of career and so I will be in touch especially with the three board members who represent the Del Norte cluster area and I happen to live in a house of Venus district and she's not here tonight but I so I just wanted to let you know that and then I want to speak to the power of volunteers I started volunteering at Del Norte in 2013 it's been a very interesting experience I've met a lot of interesting people and students and then the last thing I want to say just for this lady is is you do like APS allows Jesus clubs at Publix schools as long as the request came from a student we have a Jesus Club at Del Norte

[00:30:00]
at McKinley Middle School so I'm not sure how it all works but thank you for your time and service thank you sister is daily Schneider sorry and you have two minutes before you start our next speaker would be David James David Adams first of all thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is seidler I am Elementary School proud physical educator and third place winner in the logo Triathlon about 2 years ago a group of peaches got together to discuss and create our own professional development at that time we were required to attend professional developments that were created for general education classroom teachers so

[00:31:00]
we decided to create our own PD that focused on our curriculum and our questions we started with occasional workshops or sessions hosted at Inez elementary school thank you Michael as well as a few other APS schools and we met in the late afternoon or on weekends the next year we began working with the University of New Mexico physical education teacher education program they offered their facilities and their expertise again on Saturdays we then wrote and were awarded a grant for Outdoor Learning equipment I have the shirt on for Grant Award winners we have since created I'm sorry we were awarded a grant for Outdoor Learning equipment we have since created a check out system to share equipment for fishing license

[00:32:00]
did the lines with the New Mexico pet Outdoor Learning initiative after that we were invited to create an implement the district provide highly successful physical education Summit November 7th 2023 if you can't tell where a passionate group we are now so excited to see that the role groups include physical education and are getting recognized to have specific professional development or are you unique way of teaching and by the way it will be within the school hours I'm so excited about that you two minutes if you could record it to new ways of teaching our students thank you for your time and support thank you and our last speakers David do you have two minutes once you begin hello members of the board I'm David apparent now

[00:33:00]
josefina's district is well district 6 I wanted to comment about a discussion between board member Jackson and the administration that occurred during the last meeting you all had an excellent robust discussion regarding the guarantee of the use of high-quality instructional materials this is a topic of great importance to parents the administration indicated that high quality instructional materials may not be distributed but they will be guaranteed to meet the requirements of high-quality instructional materials while it's understood that board members may be discouraged from giving their opinion on this I'll just say from a parent's perspective we are absolutely over the moon to hear that but some questions remain how is the district going to provide transparency to the community or to the board that this guarantees being honored this sort of transparency is essential to build trust with the community I think most parents are on board with the materials that the district has approved we all have the various evaluation tools like Ed reports that org and it's easy for us to just District to prove materials because we know what they are

[00:34:00]
but What mechanisms are in place or what can be put in place to inform parents when curriculum is used that deviates from the district adopted materials is there some sort of documentation so that parents can be assured that deviating curriculum has been evaluated by the district for instance we have occurrences of a minority of classroom still implementing aspects of balanced literacy even though study after study is proving these these techniques don't work and they are in direct opposition to the states and District stated goals of utilizing curriculum aligned with the science of reading this seems to be in direct contradiction of the guaranteed for high-quality instructional materials parents are very encouraged and thankful for the direction and focus of the board and administration regarding the use of high-quality instructional materials but we need to have the confidence that the guarantee of a high-quality Equitable education for all students is being honored in all classrooms in the district that would be an ironclad guarantee in our kids deserve thank you thank you sir

[00:35:00]
board members that completes public forum thank you Mr Gonzales and thank you for coming tonight to share your perspectives and again as a reminder this is not a dialogue but an opportunity just for the board to hear from the community and so with that we will go ahead and move along to our next agenda item which is focused on student outcomes focused governance and as part of our commitment to student outcomes focused governance we will now monitor our progress against interim guardrail number two which is the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably and I will turn it over to secretary Astoria now to facilitate this discussion thank you president Gonzalez as the board president mentioned we are monitoring guardrail 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 tonight so before we begin the discussion we must confirm that the monitoring reports are complete so I did meet with Dr Blakey beforehand and I do

[00:36:00]
leave that the report meets all the criteria I did want to provide a side note though in the Powerpoints that you all received in the graphs there is only one point of reference because this is the first time that we are actually monitoring this guardrail so I know we're supposed to have more than one point but that is the reasoning that I decided to say that this is a complete monitoring report so with that I will open it up to see if there's anybody who thinks otherwise or if there's any discussion on confirming that the report is complete awesome so that's great since everyone agrees that the required elements are present Dr Blakey are you and your staff ready to discuss guardrail too yes we are so with that I will open the floor for a monitoring conversation with the board and any questions that we might have so if I may I

[00:37:00]
start with Ronaldo not at this moment I don't have a question and Secretary of surga is this for the whole monitoring report so I can question about 2.3 yes and this will be a discussion on the entire guardrail as you may know we are not doing a presentation right now because we did the presentation before Hannah asked the technical and Technical questions so we are moving straight into the discussion so anything for 2.1 2.2 or 2.3 thank you thank you for that clarification OK Google so in regards to interim guardrail to 3 my question is this given that we know that some schools report that they're being

[00:38:00]
I'm trying to understand how a reduction in unused funds is tied to equity instead of Simply using resources wisely thank you for president that question I do want to thank the aps budget and the grant department title one student Family Support special ed Human Resources curriculum construction language Indianapolis strategies for a Year's worth related to these interim a lot of departments and stuff really committed to this and the whole premise of

[00:39:00]
guardrail 2.3 is once the resources are allocated equitably we want to make sure they spend a that they spend them for the students that they were allocated for so in our intent is to monitor this to make sure that that's been is done this school year for those students because some of those students are going to move on they could graduate they could go to middle school they could possibly move from Albuquerque so we want to make sure they get that full Equitable resource allocation and it's been for them thank you thank you thank you

[00:40:00]
thorough report and responses to all of our questions I do have a question related to 2.155% of long-term sub so in other words I'm really just trying to connect this guardrail with the over with the overall guard rail around Equitable allocation of resources so what what information do we have that gives us confidence that reducing long-term Subs will make a difference for these students know that's a great question thank you for president what the leadership team looked at in developing this guardrail was Finding

[00:41:00]
find a way to drive and ensure Equitable allocation of certified staff and choosing to fold the long-term sub coverage there was an excellent question of the question in there that kind of ties into this with respect to the numerator and denominator what kind of figured that so what we were doing actually is twofold right we want to drive down the vacancy rate which is what we're doing and this ties into our programs that we have with Albuquerque teacher Residency program placing residents in these schools along with special education teacher training program so that's driving down the road and then all so it is certainly as well so having a certified I think that all research shows that the quality of a teacher is going to be

[00:42:00]
best indicator of how students perform and we have seen schools that do mirror enrollments of the Yazzie Martinez and African-American students at higher numbers that have higher vacancies in having a high-quality teacher in the classroom so second to that having a substitute that's a long-term substitute who is trained embedded from substitute Services is doesn't replace a teacher but certainly adds to the stability of the instruction that is in the classroom and the long-term substitutes all so are part of the professional development of the school they're there on a daily basis they collaborate with other teachers and so the more were able to address these schools that previous to discard real I have to say we didn't have

[00:43:00]
the system for filling substitutes in a very thoughtful as far as like a strategic way and this has really excuse me allowed us to focus on the schools that didn't that had students didn't have a teacher or they had a different teacher every day or they had somebody covering or they mixed with another class and so all of that we know disrupts the learning environment and would lead to negative outcomes for students and relative to the question in the Tactical technical questions previously for those two primary schools there were 540 to 222 I have additional questions

[00:44:00]
not on 2.50% the high turnover and I guess the second part to that is how often is our training updated for people in these new roles okay I'm going to talk a little bit about the training and and I might have to defer to HR on

[00:45:00]
but as far as the training we we have continuous training all year so we have virtual training we have face-to-face training and we also have a stop that goes out to the school that meets with secretaries or principles as needed to help them with their purchasing we also have a user guide that we've developed and we also have supports like I want to say 24/7 because my staff even answers after hours in emails for people can send any type of questions and get support immediately so we're very customer service oriented to support the schools to that response so I guess this is just

[00:46:00]
the direct response here cuz I hear what you're saying but what state it is that people in their new roles are not familiar with purchasing planning and deadlines so it sounds like we are doing the training do we know where the disconnect is coming between what's being taught and what's being followed through I think when a secretary or a principal gets into the role a long time they're not familiar with the finance part and understanding like and how to interact with the particulars of each type of required for each one because they do change so I think as they come into it they're having to learn that to be prepared for their their okay

[00:47:00]
and then I refer to you the principal support systems that is certainly a way to address kind of the training piece with respect to all aspects of being a principal in the principalship one of the things we're seeing throughout the organization is fairly significant throughout the organization and all positions were saying with a scheduled positions in this is supposed to covid with respect and I wasn't prepared to have on this particular item on the turnover rates the organization okay thank you so much thank you for being here this evening so my question is 2.22

[00:48:00]
and it's on page 5 of the report and so its strategic priority for create more flexibility in student teacher issues just a bit of context I did ask the question what flexibility exists for school teams to adjust class sizes and with this how would this be implemented and the answer was schools don't have much flexibility when it comes to this and so my question is what plans exist to begin the work with school teams and instructional councils to utilize the limited amount of flexibility we do have an adjusting class size and how will this impact student performance thank you I have some of our team from IRS here that really helped us with this so you don't mind I'd like to bring them up

[00:49:00]
so are part of our work with APS this year was to support two strands of work one was on a funding model redesign and the other side was supporting a what we called School design resource use strand of work in that we spent a lot of time with APS leadership and then transitioning into a middle school design team structure and it was through that Middle School design team structure where we were working with eight school teams and principals teachers from those teams where we were trying to understand what opportunities and flexibility is existed with things like classic time is differently in service of strategic priorities and part of that work was developing what we called models or prototypes of what those designs would look like through that work what the

[00:50:00]
there are some limited ways that school teams now can use resources differently such as having some supports to have smaller group sizes within their you know set of resources some opportunities to move staff across grade levels but given the resource levels in most schools there are not many opportunities to really Flex group size and class size in a way that might allow for much more intensive intervention supports and you know supports for students at different learning needs and so that's a big part of the recommendation came from that learning that we had with those middle school teams and obviously similar and different challenges may exist in Elementary and high school but that's where a lot of our first or into that challenge game okay so thank you it sounds like the work being done and we're trying to

[00:51:00]
2.1 under what is going well it's stated here that you provide each substitute a checklist for success and customize a substitute guide to ensure consistency want to know if you could give me an example of this checklist for special education teacher substitutes and then I don't know what this guy looks like I want to just say that sounds like a technical oh yes I do think that an example or the checklist itself or whatever could certainly be provided but I think the main point is what is the information you need at a strategic level to know if they're meeting the guard rail okay so pertaining

[00:52:00]
guardrail 2.1 and specifically to the special education substitutes what are we currently doing not only just to address the need but also providing the support we need to help not only increase our teacher coverage for special education but I know specifically that need is great if you could just give me an example of what currently you're doing for those special education steps and I have to both questions I can provide detailed information education training program and I can certainly provide that to you for that just sorry the administrative Lane so we don't need to see that it is more I think knowing that it exists

[00:53:00]
thank you I have a question before I move on to the rest of the board but I also want to just give a thank you to the board making my facilitation very easy with your smart questions so it's looking good my question is the answer to the question on the bottom of page two on the Q&A document reads in part we could look at using an at-risk index for those allocations that considers special education English Learners ability and socioeconomics which is essentially the group's identified by The OSI Martinez decision and this is in reference to the formulas used to allocate Librarians nurses and counselors so my question is considering that the guardrail is that

[00:54:00]
play superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated and equitably what is currently being done to explore the potential of allocating the staff positions based on need so in other words there might be a need to move a counselor or a librarian from a school with low numbers of Maya students to a school with larger numbers so just to repeat that question what is currently being done to explore the potential of allocating the staff positions based on me again I'm going to talk to have your address as we looked at our funding and the way that is allocated currently we were able to work with all the different departments and come up with a guide book for school budgeting and understand the current way that we are budgeting and start the conversation and start down the path of

[00:55:00]
weekend use what we learned from ERS to be able to develop a methodology to include those groups so like you said currently right now with Librarians its on Base strictly on enrollment and the way that we can change it is to include enrollment and then add factors for these for the student needs or characteristics as I didn't fight in the cold and guard rails and I might just add I think one of the big conversation that we had as a group was thinking about the trade-offs between increasing that sort of need based allocation and the impact it would have particularly on the smallest schools in terms of enrollment one big impact of that would likely be more personal stuff allocations so that you can free up some of those resources in order to create that need

[00:56:00]
that's been a big part of that modeling work has been how you can review those resources no more need driven may may may create challenges particularly in those schools that may end up with more partial staff and I think that's been a big reason why some of those decisions have sort of been more challenging to me just to clarify it so within the at-risk index model that you're using we currently do not have a section where we're I guess collecting data for my students specifically I just need clarification on that question before you had said that you can always Implement something that consists of arguing the Maya students within the at-risk index I wanted to clarify that's that's we're not currently

[00:57:00]
I think she's asking what you use to formulate the at-risk funds what factors do you use in coming up with that allocation thank you you can tell me if I'm wrong here but I believe it's English language Learners mobility and socioeconomic so that was a clarification just we do have those those are in the address formula but it's not native students with disabilities and index thank you I guess given that there is the settlement for Martinez Yazzie is there a point where we could get to collecting that data and actually looking at it relative to our

[00:58:00]
both expenditures and allocations for those particular student groups in addition to the groups that informed that Risk Index At Risk Index factors that we use are in control of the district deciding or what's the likelihood that we would do that in order to meet this guardrail it would make sense to do that I think that's a really good example of how we are or how we should be looking at changing our current practices to move forward so I don't think that the at-risk funding formula factors have been changed in ever since it was created so I do think that that offers a very good insight to how we start doing our practice different

[00:59:00]
in order to adjust to meet the needs of the students that we are trying to make the biggest impact on the US team as well and I think that's that's exactly the right opportunity to think about as we look at the interim guard rail metric around a resources going through a fair student funding formula adjusting the address formula weights themselves wouldn't necessarily change that is sort of just using a different formula that is more grounded in a updated understanding of student need or more comprehensive understanding of student if you deviate from the three factors that are currently being used in the hours of them but where would make a difference is if you if you look at page two of the report it does sort of metrics that are listed their one is the core interim around the percentage going through a fair student funding

[01:00:00]
characteristics and so revisiting how at risk allocations are currently done we're right now abortion is based on weights and a portion is given to all schools could result in that metric adjusting and so as we think about also what is the interim metric that we can know if we're achieving this goal of it of a more Equitable funding model in some ways that how much resources are going out on student characteristics can be a really powerful measured to look at as well thank you I have a clarification that I think it's going to be a technical question but it is birth from this conversation so I hope that's okay okay thank you so from what I understand if I am correct or tell me if I'm correct the district

[01:01:00]
has the ability to address the at-risk funding formula factors and has always had that ability yes okay the scg funding is just given to us we do not have the ability to adjust their yes okay and then the federal funding the title money that comes in is also given to us no ability to adjust you are allowed to ask the district is allowed to allocate those resources in the way that she said as long as you're including social and economic status as your driver okay is that specifically Title 1 funding okay but like title to and I think there's some other acronyms I can't remember but the title 1 funding is can be allocated based on District decisions there's some federal fresh holes but there's some discretion within those how much you allocate

[01:02:00]
okay and so given that we can supplement but not supplant the way the specifically time the title and I need supplement not the plan the way that we can address the student need is by adjusting the at-risk funding formula would be but the risk and Rosalinda correct me if I'm wrong I'm going to just look for her nodding yesterday is something we choose to do which is out of the sea so it's not like given to us as a pot of money we received the scg we pulled aside money that we use for at-risk dollars that then goes through this formula and goes back to the school for discretionary money on how they can use

[01:03:00]
MPD has some requirements around reporting how at risk is being used separate from their sort of main scg reporting but in general exactly what doctor Blake he said is it is District discretion to decide how to use at risk resources and how to allocate them in a sort of separate realm and obviously all the resources that a school gets sit together and a lot of the work that the budget team does is rating fun so School sort of don't have to do that are getting this out of dollars from here and this amount of dollars from there but Title One sits on top at risk is there and then all of this sort of Baseline resources that is mostly coming out of SG comprises the full picture of resources at school gets so there are schools that do not receive Title One money that do receive money thank you thank you for answering that question I just want to give up opportunity is there any more follow-up for

[01:04:00]
so now I'm going to go back to my very first question so this is in regards to interim 2.3 so I kind of asked about what the current situation is and So based on the fact that I've asked that kind of current situation my follow-up to that is we want to spend our money efficiently and not simply because it's their right so have you thought about a strategy looking forward that is going to incentivize schools that do spend their funds equitably versus those that do not

[01:05:00]
I might be a recommendation I would I would like to seek to understand in alignment to guardrail 2.3 based on the fact that okay now I'm going to have to kind of based on the fact that you are hoping to decrease the percentage of unspent funds have you thought about a future action you might take to incentivize that number

[01:06:00]
to incentivize efficient use of funds yes thank you we have some priorities that were looking at one of them is to give guidance in our monitoring report we give an example of what title one guidance is so it is like to spend a certain percentage by fall break doesn't percentage by winter break by Spring Break and of course by the deadline and other is the consolidation of federal and state programs into a central position for oversight that's happening in the reorganization of central office by having the all the funds together you're able to see that whole list of you to see how many phones each School

[01:07:00]
we get and where there's that opportunity for braiding of funds and another another another tool we have is the template that IRS helped us with with the budgeting office and it is another consolidation of having a tool for the schools to be able to build their budgets and they're able to see the whole View and see all the funds to be able to be strategic and make decisions for the decisions are closest to the school to the students and to the community thank you that last part is kind of what I was getting out so I appreciate that I was just going to add that during this time with yours there was a budget collab team that was put together to kind of go over and strategically look at how we

[01:08:00]
Muse funding and it is it's not just the budget team or anything like that it's a group of different in a principals and teachers and different different individuals and we're going to come continue that work we plan to continue that work to to continue to look at different ways that we can work to always improve the way we distribute the funds thank you thank you president Gonzalez do you have another question I do it is on guardrail 2.2 and it kind of builds off Secretary of sargas question around the formulas and thresholds for allocation of Staff but it is related specifically to slide 14 in the IRS update where you speak to the necessary conditions for moving towards student based budgeting and we have the green and the yellow and so I think secretary of state has questioned kind of addressed the final one

[01:09:00]
moving towards policies and resource flexibilities and that was I think a little bit of a member of the question as well so my question is what current strategies or actions are you taking to move toward the other necessary condition so the sufficient overall resource levels which I know that's some stuff that we can control and some we cannot but also most schools operating at a sufficient scale I think that really talks to the work that Rosalinda is doing with the budget group and being able to understand each resource and how flexible it is also understanding any policy or statue that is underneath it that affects it to be able to understand

[01:10:00]
kind of changes can be made with that so getting all the experts and all the people that actually oh no those programs and those funds and and being able to understand it to be able to identify where we can change it period

[01:11:00]
how do we look at what constitutes a sufficient size school and how can we look at I think a lot of work that we're looking at is not about closing schools but how we can increase the student experience for our students by being able to provide them a full service of services at schools and so the work going forward from my angle would answer that by saying to be more aggressive on the right size and how we can look at offering or students

[01:12:00]
an experience that is the same as an experience at a school that is fully funded because of the size of the school and I might just add not in terms of what the district is doing but in terms of what we've seen other systems in very similar places move toward I think exactly what you said from the perspective of understanding the challenges in student experience teacher experience and outcomes in some of those schools that are in that subscale enrollment threshold I think that allows you first to then understand what are the ways in which you can design schools at that enrollment threshold that really enable those experiences where might there be opportunities or need to sort of think about what reconfiguration looks like and then all the way up to what you know a closer and consolidation but there's several levers that we see systems move toward and sort of play with depending on the context in order to

[01:13:00]
what do you think about specifically the sort of the challenge with having a lot of resources currently in your small schools but not necessarily translating into those outcomes that you'd want to see and I think similarly again in terms of where we see other systems like you all shift towards I think the focus that we've heard and seen with special education and really thinking about both the service delivery model how you can move towards some of those more inclusive settings and start to enable more flexibility across those resources that's a huge way to sort of free up some of what those overall resource constraints look like in your contacts now so just to offer a little bit of that from National perspective and some of the conversations that we've been having with the folks thank you thank you know my second question is already answered with similar other stuff

[01:14:00]
not trying to get out of asking a question so this is a permanent to interim girl 2.1 sub coverage rate and referencing what's going on page 3 of the monitoring report and so of the sudden seven items listed and for example mentorships Financial incentives orientation recruitment marketing which had the most impact on increasing the rate from 599% so thank you that's a great question I will text part of that would respect to him previously on the Albuquerque teacher Residency program and our special education teacher training program to drive down the vacancy rates I have to reach back to Kelly Services back there to see which of these my guess is the sign on bonus

[01:15:00]
continuing to do and one of the things that I do wish to well as a three-page report there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes to crank out this and driving that difference from 59 per cent to to the high night so it's that's a big part of the work and it's not really reflective here but I do want to shout out to the HR recruiting team and HR operations team and Kelly Services on that and with respect to what is most effective I have Chris Davis with Kelly Services in basically what we found is a lot of what has been most successful is our mentorship program so

[01:16:00]
I have identified one of our key substitutes for named Jasmine and she's been one of our substitutes for about 3 years and she actually is working closely with the schools and our 70s and she's on site at many of the locations a couple days a week and really mentoring or substitutes on better classroom management looking at opportunities for special education how to manage that more effectively and and tactics as it relates to supporting not only the students and then they're also Bridging the between resources within the school to the substitutes because we found that a substitute shows up and that gets back to the checklist maybe they don't have the resources needed so Bridging the Gap between making sure that they're of the proper PD day that align with what he was saying earlier about making sure that they have all the resources necessary as a long-term

[01:17:00]
he filled those gaps until the HR team fills them with a full-time position so again I think the most impactful part of that is just the training but that true mentorship to have somebody side by side with some of these long-terms to really make them feel like they're part of the team and they're supported for sure and supported and and with respect to the kind of early part two and shouting out the recruiting team just this year they've been on 41 separate recruiting events and and so that's very impactful this year this year this year was the first year that we did for HBC use as well to kind of work on some of our diversity and inclusion as well so we're really exploring all Avenue and one of the things that Kelly Services and thank you

[01:18:00]
2.2 under the special education delivery models now when we're looking at long-term subs and also your checklist and all of those matters could you tell me as I'm trying to understand here when we're re-examining identification processes and special and service model structures and then also looking at inclusion and general education environments I know there's been just a little bit of topic on the requirements and how are fulfilling that for Ida especially for our high school and middle school students would you and you please refrain

[01:19:00]
help me to understand for our middle school and high school students the special education delivery models when we're looking at being more effective in inclusion base and general education environments what does that look like so good evening so over the last year we've been building a framework to support all students in the district

[01:20:00]
and really support staff as well in the inclusion model so we're using setting data and setting three so those are students that are out of the classroom more so let's say in high school they received 5 to 7 classes in a small specialized setting so small group so this year we've been designing what that could look like for our students looking at the data over the last 3 weeks we are now actually in the middle of our third cohort of school teams or administrators attended one day overview but bringing in the school teams specialist Administration to look at their own data their own service models how they're supporting students in their schools so this will continue on through the fall so it's not going to go away we just want them to create an action plan which will use to support them moving forward in this work so we'll continue looking at

[01:21:00]
data looking at student outcome data but really making sure that we provide students an opportunity to high quality instruction in the dentist setting as we look at how we're working with Kelly Services and substitutes we've done a lot of work and and with Tricia and redesigning how we support how we support students how are supporting school last year I believe Trisha we looked at how we were sending out Subs into schools so changing what was the yeah we changed it from more levels level 12 the community but internally to better prepare our substitutes several different workshops to make sure that we were providing that in

[01:22:00]
to better prepare them but also have them think differently about wow I would really love to take a job assignment helping a student with X Y and Z rather than just saying basic or severe so more training as it relates to going into it and from a recruiting perspective and working with each other and also there's a partnership certainly with the vacancy rate reduction on the special education teacher training program that we have actually doubled the capacity on that we had a partnership residents in the special education teacher training program at 5:00 1017

[01:23:00]
before I when I want to acknowledge just the team effort that we've seen throughout this meeting and I'm really thank you all for being here first of all to answer these questions but just all the work that you've done is there any other questions from any of the board members and I know board members I guess you just got here so I don't know if you okay okay Rose question around the high turnover rates with principals and secretaries listed as a root cause for not being spent I'm curious if you play out the root cause and you ask why why why why why why why why why is it that we have high turnover rates for principals and secretaries and in particular what do we know what current date what do we know about working conditions that are principals are facing that may contribute to the high turnover

[01:24:00]
and then what might we do to address those cuz as I look at next level of work I don't see anything about addressing why principles might be leading so part of that I can I can speak to in a separate report that was part of that ridiculous report but one of the things we are saying this as I mentioned up and down through the organization and we've seen an increase of participation rates as well but it is what I'm hearing and what we hear through we have a meeting and what has recently resonated with the last meeting that we had with them certainly has been just that the working conditions and all very hard and very

[01:25:00]
a spike in all the things that folks are balancing out there and certainly the 20% ish turnover rate is something we're seeing throughout the organization and then we have seen fairly significant other two things right there's there's wages and there's working conditions and and the wages certainly say for example 2018-19 level one teacher is making 36,000 a year and they're now making $54

[01:26:00]
talking about too that the principals have asked for more support from us and so I am trying to look at how can I organize ourselves to make sure that we are providing support to our principles in a very strategic way and a lot of the work I think that you'll see coming in the next few months will indicate how can we change how we operate to make sure that the principals don't feel isolated or lonely and that they feel supported and what can I do to make sure that they have that level of support and I would say it's

[01:27:00]
as Mr Target was Turkish in with saying sorry I just changed your name I think it is different for secretaries and principals I don't think that the principals are indicating it's a wage issue there they've had pretty significant salary increases over the past few years it's but for the it's more conditions and feeling isolated and lonely and bearing on a lot of stress the secretaries I think is more of a wage situation where sometimes they're working multiple jobs one pays more they kind of go towards that one or they move up throughout the organization from like an entry level clerk position at a school to you know the highest level that they can get to in the organization so some of them they haven't necessarily left the district in the secretary Arena it's that they move from that position

[01:28:00]
I'm into positions where they're able to make better wages usually I do want to give up I remember Dominguez an opportunity if you have any questions the question I have house to do with the part of the report that addressed

[01:29:00]
the stress that small schools or small enrollment schools have on our on the budget and we get to my questions or the I believe that's under 2.25% of these campuses on on our resources the district resources charter school funding or small schools

[01:30:00]
was targeted on our school and that is the date of that we are presenting okay so then let me ask a differently are there other small schools that tend to impact that are the stress on our on our budget allocation or distribution to schools and what is I know we are repurposing schools I guess how

[01:31:00]
what is the plan for the next steps for that but that's a future so maybe I might be wrong if your intention is but maybe asking what are the strategies to reduce the stress and small schools or allocations so so it's not necessarily just in general the small schools but we have a lot of alternative schools that may be looked at as small schools right and so and those are probably some of our highest cost to the budget or the highest effect on the budget is because if you see some of the the cost like it's usually I think our cost now is about 13,000 per student approximately across the board and in some of those alternative schools I'm thinking one in particular

[01:32:00]
to be in the range of like 36,000 so that does put a stress on the budget but of course you know we're trying to serve the needs that we have in our community so so we have to take it's kind of a balancing act you know is that is it worth putting those additional funds into some of these schools and if we're seeing good outcomes I don't see that as really is dressed because as long as that comes are good and we're helping those students and it's worth it but we are going to be looking at maybe possibly in some of the right sizing of the district one of the things is good for us to see which are the small schools that are costing a lot and have little outcomes right cuz it could be that because we're not the way we allocate some of the stuff we can't

[01:33:00]
allocate bully so that they have that great experience that a larger school would have of all the you know having a full-time librarian a full-time nurse all those things that give the student a better experience so it's not necessarily just looking at the small the size of the school but also the outcomes that the children are having someone that are having good outcomes how do I how do we ensure equity in that case

[01:34:00]
iPhone remember to make an appointment for superintendent that goes back to the whole intent of this project was to see how we could you know first of all is to look at our current resources and then look at what is possible and what resources have that flexibility whether it be at response or Title 1 funds or title three funds and trying to identify how can we introduce those other characteristics that help us on that whole we just for clarification about it but one thing I've been kind of stressing the team that I want to look at is how we so how we found our schools of choice most of them is different than what we presented we do with the

[01:35:00]
formulas of Staffing for the other schools and so how do we start to look at that as far as kind of a first step into making sure that we're using the money the most strategically and all of our schools I don't know if you've looked before but on our supper site you can look at how much per student funding is her school and you'll see on there that we have some schools of choice that are funded at a much higher level than the more traditional schools So within our own District of schools that we have control over I think there's opportunities for how we can best utilize funds that are kind of divided up to the school without using a formula right now I appreciate that that's exactly

[01:36:00]
there's a lot of questions about how we could do things and a lot of changes on my happen to remind if you are interested in reading some of the questions and answers that we submitted beforehand those are on the aps website and you can look at them there to get a better understanding for yourself but thank you board members for this productive conversation

[01:37:00]
that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision lines up with their vision for them so to accept we must answer yes to the following questions first does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal and I will open it up we'll do one question at a time so it does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goals yes yes yes yes so the first is a yes the second question is is their growth toward the vision yes

[01:38:00]
the last question is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision I'm so all three are yes so the board can accept the monitoring poor and we're confident that the data is accurate and the superintendent is working to improve student outcomes so president Gonzalez I will turn it back to you thank you secretary historica and so may I please have a motion to accept the progress monitoring reports for guardrail to interim guardrails 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 for Equitable allocation of resources I moved to accept the monitoring report for sorry for guardrail to an interview 2122 2.3 this is Courtney this is Juno thank you we have a motion from Member Jackson in a second from Secretary of roll call vote please

[01:39:00]
Crystal Tapia of a map Pasadena Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes Danielle Gonzales so the motion carries we have accepted the monitoring report for guardrail too so again I just want to Echo the appreciation to superintendent Blakey and the team and I did kind of want to get like a little dingy Bell for every time a new person came up but it just shows what a team effort this is and it's really great to see the progress that the team is making with that we will be on our agenda to our consent agenda which is agenda items six approval of the consent agenda which includes 6.1 through 6.11 is there emotion to accept the consent agenda that we accept the consent agenda including items 6.1 through 6 points 11:00 on the this is Heather and this is Crystal I will second to thank you we have

[01:40:00]
motion for member Benavides and a second from Member Topia Romero Miss King can we have a roll call vote please yes so the motion carries and we have accepted the consent agenda next up is agenda item 7 which is our discussion items we have two 7.1 is an update on the district's series 2024 General obligation bonds we have apologized Chief Financial Officer and Mark Turnbull the executive director of accounting I do want to state that we are trying to move away from presentations so we use actually using time and board meetings for presentations we have reviewed the presentation we've reviewed the PowerPoint and so I do want to just open it up to the board for any questions for our presenters no question

[01:41:00]
thank you for the very thorough materials and I hope you got some stepson we will move on to agenda items 7.2 which is the budget update we still have our Chief Financial Officer joined Now by Rosalinda Montoya the executive director of budget and strategic planning again we have had a chance to review the PowerPoint presentation so we will not be using time during the board meeting to present the PowerPoint slides there were a few questions submitted an advance from board members related to the budget and so I will now open it up to the rest or to the full board sorry open up the floor for additional questions and discussion related to the Budget prior to doing that I want to state that as you all know we have been going on a journey of presentations on the budget and how the budget is developed for the next school year and really working to align that to the goals and to the guardrails

[01:42:00]
and there's lots of change involved in new processes and so are deeply appreciative to the team for the work that you're doing this is all leading up towards the big date of May 29th which is when we will have the opportunity to vote on and approve the budget and so this is the last one this is almost the last opportunity this is the last opportunity yes to ask questions about the budget that you that will provide you board members with information that you may need in order to approve the budget so if you can take that lens of what information do I need is my community need does my constituents need in order to be a yes vote on the budget on May 29th as well as if you have any specific questions on the presentation so with all of that prologue I'll open the floor to questions great job president Gonzalez thank you and you

[01:43:00]
so it's on slide 31 it's in reference to the teachers leader Network that first expenditure and so my question is what strategy do you have and what data can you present that the from the district to ensure that the teacher the tln network resource allocation

[01:44:00]
listed on page 31 is one aligning to the goals that are listed next to it and two that it is ensuring a direct Improvement in student outcomes will have Joyce so that one up the the change that we made this year some of the work that we did to ensure that the work is aligned to the goals in the book study of the 4dx so I remember on the tln read the book and then their test was to create a wildly important goal or goals and critical actions aligned to

[01:45:00]
Pacific District goals so are e l a team Elementary is focusing on foundational skills because they believe that that's that's the thing that's lacking and if students got strong fun date foundational skills and using foundations in K through three then they would be more proficient readers from third grade on so that's one example some of the things that we're doing so they're they're worth is a line specifically to critical actions research base instructional strategies that will support teacher practices and student achievement even our like our science team has a math goal so they're working on incorporating math practices in their science activities and helping teachers with that so all of the professional development

[01:46:00]
has practices aligned to The Golden Girls and are these resources the the teachers leader Network all of these Specialists are they available district-wide or are they only deployed to areas of highest need they're available district-wide and there is a document that we provide with principles that shows some of our teams are have broken up the district into schools that they've worked with others are available to all schools it depends on the size of the team right now so social studies we have one person that is covering K through 12 but this person is like having three so do you think that this allocation is or this potential expenditure is

[01:47:00]
enough to support the goals to improve student outcomes we would always like to have more but it's the it's what can be afforded with the other items that we use title to funding for and so we but we do prioritize like our elementary team is 5 with and it has additionally one specialist just focusing on letters and early literacy our secondary Ela team is only a team of two are elementary math team is a team of five I believe we have three at the middle school so we have a little bit more focused on middle school math to go to okay if we can find out I don't have we haven't received the

[01:48:00]
exact allocation yet so our budget is built on a preliminary estimate of what will receive with carryover okay thank you actually haven't received our final final projections so if any changes do materialize that are of material we will bring that up on the final presentation thank you other questions from the board on the budget presentation I have a question

[01:49:00]
how does the teacher leader Network address ell students and I tried to get your attention period I think are two coming here there was a professional development was limited to what our team provided and now with the with high quality

[01:50:00]
Ontario adoption and professional development planning we have members from lce special ed Title 1 and even Equity invited to every planning meeting for professional development so we ensure that every student needs are being met in that professional development so while my team are not Specialists we bring in those Department Specialists we've made some huge gains in the amount of collaboration in the work that we are doing together it's pretty amazing to see all right I know it's still early any evidence yet and I recognizing that it's still 2 years for shifting and still early we're working with zapper to try to come up with ideas it's it's hard to measure

[01:51:00]
you're honestly that the TLs affect because they don't they're not within an Arm's Reach of students right so the the data that we do have is qualitative data and we have a lot of data from teachers that says this is changing my practice and that's from some of the math PD the grading pilot the foundations trainings we have teachers that have said the materials we bought Haggerty has changed their practice and that they're seeing it in their progress monitoring of Istation

[01:52:00]
okay so the question is it can you restate the question in a way that's related to the budget is is it a good do you believe at this point is that approach that shift impacting are actually did not take Financial Resources to do it really really

[01:53:00]
work together in the right people will be at the table and planning so was that that wasn't a physical cost but I do think that we are very physically responsible with our funds and make sure that that we target the the practices and resources that will best impact student outcomes and it sounds like a great potential investment line so thank you I did have a question related to the budget and it's important to the question that's on page 11 of the Q&A which is actually asks is it true that student enrollment is decreasing all Personnel costs are increasing and the answer essentially says yes because of salary increases and so my question really is this doesn't seem sustainable and so what will be done to address this trend and

[01:54:00]
we just heard from the IRS team and saw some of the potential strategies but I'm just curious will that be enough to address the trend lines that kind of look like that like what confidence that we have that will be able to address that what else might we be able to do something that the program side of district and also working with Finance is looking at any duplication of efforts I know dot so that's going to help us to ensure as we're looking at our friends going down that anything that might be a duplication Network programs you know if you're going to out of program then what do you have to scale back on or not

[01:55:00]
that we continuously work with Department yeah another kind of easy or low-hanging fruit to address that kind of thing as we do have a lot of vacant positions right so I think in some of the work in this looking at how Physicians can be used most effectively that once all that is stabilized then we can look at what positions are vacant that we may no longer need right that they have become obsolete or because we do have a few positions not many but a few that maybe have been vacant for a couple years so could we use them yes probably but if we've been working with them maybe they might be something to look at so there is a lot of different

[01:56:00]
approaches we can take to really address that to area we can't really some of it is we have to fund the FTE and the subs kind of what we were speaking about before and so because I have to budget as if all positions are filled right and so there's always some vacancy savings there so it's not necessarily that all of those positions are using some of the budget will have to use it for subs or another we can use it another ways thank you for that and that's reassuring although I think I still have concerns about that trend line and so just considering that our budget policy asks for projections not required immediately but I think it would be helpful to know like what is the five-year projection for what that line is going to look like of personnel costs

[01:57:00]
relative to revenue generated by student enrollment so whenever that is doable pretty but yes please thank you other questions on budget can I take it back off of So based on what president Gonzalez talking about our 5-year Trend I think if it's possible to even if we look at how many teachers are going to be retiring so they're usually at a higher level versus entry level and there's a difference there and hopefully that's going to offset some of our expenses just I'm just thinking out loud okay yes sir how many factors that you know will affect it so yes and no so the problem is that because of the way that were funded with the teacher experience as a factor

[01:58:00]
if you bring in more level one teachers it will then hurt you on the other side of what we call the T and E index of generating funds based on the level of teacher you have a nationally board certified teacher yeah they bring in a little bit more so yeah it's always a balancing act because you know some ways it can help but then other things so it's going to be a big task that the district has but I know that we'll be able to to address it and it certainly not needed in the context of being able to approve this year's budget so don't go crazy trying to produce that I'm like it does seem that it could be ugly and so just knowing how ugly or how bad over time and what is the likelihood of some of these various strategies to address and reverse that trend line yeah and I will

[01:59:00]
play it will look like but part of it is because we won't know exactly you know we have to assume that things are staying the same I can the in one of these pages I have all the 132 factors to the scg and so there's a lot of moving parts to it right so even though the enrollment is a part of it there are other factors that go into that so great any other questions on the budget so just it's just going to pick you up if she was just talking about then I'm done and this is and I don't mean to be provocative but I do so I have been sitting in this seat for two years and 5 months and I continue to hear that we are going to look at a duplication of efforts and I continue to hear that and I continue to hear that so I think

[02:00:00]
I'm looking for is an assurance Dr Blakey from you guys are we actually going to look at duplication of efforts and when are we going to be able to prove that that duplication has been looked at and it has been addressed to make not necessarily cuts to the budget but to make the budget more efficient sorry we've already started some of that work so I'll have to talk about it and president Jackson City Schools came to do a strategic support visit the beginning of March we are in receipt of recommendations along those very lines initial steps have already been done to consolidate efforts in the

[02:01:00]
Matrix support departments to get it exactly what you're talking about so for example there have been instances with Federal programs for example Title 1 title 2 title 3 Medicaid were these funds have been put inside departments does a department Focus has manifested as opposed to a district Focus so really looking at a district support plan for federal programs for example are put in a district setting and with an allocation process for District programs is in place not to say that the work was that was previously done wasn't well intended but perhaps it manifested silos so what we're doing now is we're taking that as an example and there's others and departmentalizing them and putting them in a district

[02:02:00]
play so that we are able to look strategically and say family engagement there's five different initiatives in five different departments with five different messages going out to schools whereas we take that initiative we look at a strategically we take the best out of the different pieces of work that have been happening and produce One support to schools along the initiative in this hypothetical example being family engagement long-winded long-winded answer to say that work has begun and his ongoing over the next several months at the direction of the superintendent and I do understand although I'll defer to Dr Blakey that there is that information is soon to be ready in terms of what the council did find and to your best

[02:03:00]
assurance that effort is reflected as best as possible in this current budget that will be presented to us for approval no no it would be it will be reflected in next year's budget next year's budget but you are assuring me right now on May 1st 2024 at 7:04 p.m. I am assuring you that this began on April 1st we would be able to show you a difference in what department budgets look like today and for next year's budget thank you any further questions on the budget I have a question but I think it's cool so I might just email it to you that's okay that's great and again

[02:04:00]
other tactical technical follow-up questions can be emailed and again recognizing that this is to enable the board to get all of the information that you need to be able to approve the budget on May 29th so were you leaning into ask a question okay just shuffling so thank you Miss Apollo and Miss Montoya for your responses and importantly for the work that you're doing on the budget and so that concludes our discussion items and we will move now to the president's report and so I want to Begin Again by expressing appreciation to the team for the report on the guardrail and the team effort that it was for real to but I also want to thank secretary for stepping in and facilitating the progress monitoring for garden Realty tonight so thank you for that and also to fellow board members for helping to monitor our

[02:05:00]
listen to help ensure that they are smart specific measure as an art and next up my next step to facilitate the next goal which is May 15th and its goal for is member Home Warehouse so she has the facilitation guide and is already has plans to meet with the staff on that so we're really excited to that because about that because we do know a lot of time and effort goes into producing these reports and we want to make sure both of that reflects the great work that's happening in the district but we have an opportunity for real dialogue and discussion towards improving student outcomes so I just want to thank the staff again for their efforts but also board members for your work to improve our question asking I also to that end up mention and share a member of this sort of referred to this little bit we've spent a lot of time together recently the staff along with the boards been two days together in a two-day training to learn more about

[02:06:00]
so we had an opportunity to talk about a whole host of things mindset culture question question question question question question asking effective progress monitoring and more and some of it was sometimes uncomfortable but it was good because we were challenging adult behaviors and challenging some of the mindsets that may have been getting in the way of improvement in student outcomes in the past so it's a really great opportunity and just very appreciative for everyone for making that time and for being there and all so more importantly for putting the work that practice to work on behalf of our students again I'll just reiterate on the budget so thank you to miss Apollo and Miss Montoya for preparing the budget not budget presentation and the budget not just this month but for every month from January leading up to this and leading up to the May 29th conversation and so board members again if you do have any questions about the budget or any concerns about the budget please submit

[02:07:00]
