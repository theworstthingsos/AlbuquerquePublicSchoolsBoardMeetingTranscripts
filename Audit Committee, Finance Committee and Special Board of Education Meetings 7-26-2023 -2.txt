==================================================

[00:00:00]
54321 thank you so the aps Board of Education audit committee met in executive session on July 26th 2023 to discuss limited Personnel matters in connection with activity fun audits the matters discussed in the executive session were limited to only those specified so our next item then for consideration is acceptance of the activity fun internal audit reports for the period April 1st 2023 through June 30th 2023 so if I could have a motion I moved between the activities of April 1st 2023 3:30 3023 I will second OK Google

[00:01:00]
yes that Elder yes Danielle Gonzales Jackson yes Barbara Peterson yes Heather Smith yes okay so the next audit committee meeting will be held on August 23rd 2023 at 5 p.m. in the John Milton Community boardroom of Alice and Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown and live streamed at aps.edu and with that we are adjourned and this meeting will be followed by a finance committee meeting do you want me to find for Danielle we'll get it later okay

[00:02:00]
if we need to sign into places not just one recruit to me I think it's all in one meeting I think I just like okay so I would like to call the finance committee meeting okay so our first item is going to be

[00:03:00]
but before we do that we are going to be removing item for a consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 for Life accidental death etcetera so we're going to be removing that will come back at a later time so with that Amendment if I could get a motion for adoption of agenda and approval of the June 28th meeting minutes I moved to approve or I move to adopt the July 26th 2023 finance committee meeting agenda with the removal of 4K and approve the June 28th 2023 finance committee committee meeting minutes

[00:04:00]
Cody Jackson yes okay so our first item is consideration for approval of the ward and scope of work for the superintendent to execute a memorandum of agreement with the New Mexico Department of Transportation and subsequent amendments to the Local Government Road fund Cooperative agreement and I'm not sure who's going to be talking about that it says Miss alarid but I'm here ok Google yeah this is the one we do every year we participate in the grant program with the New Mexico Department of Transportation and they match our money so it's a way that we can leverage our dollars and use theirs and I have the wrong hands and we're just coming to you to get approval to go ahead and participate again

[00:05:00]
and you see I think that we've been doing this since like 2013 so it's proved to be very effective for us and this one's going to be for Kit Carson any questions for approval of the qualifications of 16.874 million + tax submitted by Bradbury construction Sierra Vista Elementary School classroom Edition so miss

[00:06:00]
go ahead you are on mute you're on mute I think I'm sorry yes thank you madam chair and members of the board this is to get your approval to enter a contract with Bradbury Stamm to complete the first phase of the start of a rebuild of Sierra Vista Elementary School it's a classroom blog it's been in the drawer a while and unfortunately we only got one bitter and normally I'm a little skeptical of that but this actually came in about six dollars a square foot of a very successful relationship with Bradbury

[00:07:00]
484 a square foot so it would have been $439 right it would have been 450 is what we've been estimating and those are kind of where we've been coming in lately so this was nice pleasant surprise any questions 16 points

[00:08:00]
okay if we can have a roll call please take me to Erica yes Danielle Gonzales yes of Peterson yes yes okay so next is consideration for approval of Grant budget adjustments for the following funds thank you so much for Community Schools okay just anybody have any questions

[00:09:00]
yes Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes yes okay we will move on to consideration for approval of the June 23rd function transfer for Grant budgets and Miss Marion thank you madam chair members of the boards consideration for the month of June 2023 as mentioned before during June July and August we have a excitingly large volume of intervention transfer as we get ready to finalize close the books to last minute Corrections so you can expect pretty much the same volume in next month's presentation in addition to that I believe there was a question

[00:10:00]
in regards to the family income index Grant associated with this agenda item am I correct okay so the family income index funding is a state funding pilot for 3 years it was initially awarded for the purpose of providing student supports and services to school serving the highest concentration of students living in poverty the qualifying District designated to receive funds were based on those districts and States charter schools with a demonstrated significant population of homeless and migrant students and that are current location to homeless education programs and or public education Department's awards for calculated based

[00:11:00]
student account for each of these populations in the 1819 school year was homeless and migrants populations were determining factor in these Awards the funding is not exclusive to homeless and migrant student population in the first year the allowable uses of funding were very constrictive they were only allowed to use 1/3 on evidence-based structured literacy interventions that have been shown to improve reading and writing achievement of students another 1/3 on evidence-based mathematics instructions and interventions and the third third on on additional intervention like case management tutoring culturally relevant professional and curriculum development so again in the first year

[00:12:00]
to have been highly restricted for the information that was provided back to the legislators the language was changed based on my knowledge for the second year where this 30/30 requirement was nullified and was a little bit more easier for the schools to adopt and Implement initiatives in addition we also have program representation I believe online that can assist us if you have any other follow-up questions and this information was not sufficient so when is the pilot over and at 6:30 2023 okay well that's it I just think it was a good I thought it was this pilot is a formula

[00:13:00]
because it's formula based every 3 years let's say it will probably be calculated and reallocated but not exactly the same schools necessarily because it's it's formula-based again it's based on the type of students which schools have the number so whichever School qualifies probably most of them will require that's good okay that's a good thing so anybody have any questions before I ask mine I mean the only thing that I was like I'm looking at all of the you know Carissa funds that are on there in the arpa funds and so those are going to be going away and so I know you already know this and I'm just wondering like

[00:14:00]
the programs that we have and the stipends I think that we're giving for letters those are things that are going we are going to obviously want to continue and some of these other programs that we all want to continue so we're just going to have to find that money in operational then and so do you have any idea like how much it's going to be with things that we know are working really well for our kids how much money we're going to have to try to find an operational after this money is going next September yeah where are in the process and I will be going through this in the budget presentation good of how we're going to address all of this great wonderful okay I think that's that's it so we can have a motion I will move to prove the June 2023 intro function transfers for the grand budget

[00:15:00]
yes Danielle Gonzales yes all right so next will be consideration for approval of the June 23rd function transfers for all non categorical funds and Miss Hicks thank you it was the last month of the year I didn't see anything that piqued my interest

[00:16:00]
any questions if not we can have a motion only for approval of June 2023 function transfers for all non categorical funds I have a second roll call please yes yes yes okay next one is consideration for approval of budget adjustment increase of 623,291.87 for student transportation services fy22 in on expanded cash balances this one was kind of confusing to me so if you if it was confusing to me and maybe it's probably not going to be confusing to anybody else so no man it is confusing okay I was like okay okay so the way this works is that any cash

[00:17:00]
I want that we have in the transportation fund is swept by ped the current rule is 50% it used to be 100% now it's 50 we were advised by ped to budget zero cash transferring from rolling over from FY 23 to FY 24 we complied with that request however we had a 1.2 million dollar cash balance 50% goes to ped 629,000 we keep 629 so we cut them a check and we paid them but since we only we didn't roll over any cash this is also an increased to us of 62000 2 9 6

[00:18:00]
I'm the only one that's not going to understand it even though they explained it to me but I'm getting clearer okay so bottom line we were advised to do the wrong thing that's what I was told so it was like they told him to do something that was and that's this was what the correction was because they asked you to do something that you shouldn't have been asked to do so we all make mistakes and then we just go on but we have the 6209 thousand so that's good that's good so that's good so thank you so much any questions about that we're all clear I'm wondering why he's taking money from us but we can discuss that later okay anything else if not we can have emotions take this money I mean it's money we owe

[00:19:00]
then sweeping is an ongoing issue girl we're all parts of the budget but anyways so it only for approval of budget adjustment increase of 623,291.80 for student transportation services or FY 2224 anticipated Revenue

[00:20:00]
request to consideration for approval of Technology budget adjustment increase of 8,400 and anticipated Revenue this is a budget adjustment because the police to the American Sign Language charter school we are going to charge $8,400 for a package of IT services some of which are Hardware routers internet and some of which is Staff time out of the technology organization and so in order to recognize that revenue and put that money into Technologies budget so they can spend it requires an increase to the budget and your approval as well as problem

[00:21:00]
any questions about that okay if I can have a motion please I moved to approve a technology budget adjustment increases of 8,400 in anticipated revenue on 2nd okay roll call please take me to Erica yes Danielle Gonzales on to consideration for approval of gifts and donations of more than 5,000 to OK Google from the University

[00:22:00]
New Mexico and 50002 Manzano High School from the Monarch Legacy foundation so he's down for questions it's a gift you can't replace a gift grants and donations more than 5,000 of 7,971 high school and 5000 a month on a high school thank you hey Google out of service for May 1st 2023 so I think you are on sure

[00:23:00]
members of the board superintendent over again this is for consideration for approval of State approval of equipment taken out of service for May of 2023 so we're going we have a salvage Department of 690,142.16 and then that's coming directly from the schools that they have sent to salvage to be disposed of second item there's about to be salvaged of 1 million $990,882.95

[00:24:00]
provide a location thank you those items originally came from great I appreciate you doing that any questions at all it's a bunch I know where I think how many did you say we have like 40,000 I don't know it's a lot right now we're trying to do about 3000 a month that's what is presented here is about 3,000 assets were about 1.9 million dollars so it's going to take several months and then I know Mr Turnbull let me know how you

[00:25:00]
all like you use tip web and that's for inventory but then Lawson which is going to obviously change is used for the financial part of everything right but that may change in time to a different system but right now we have tip web and Lawson and that kind of the tip web is what helps you find the location is that correct we actually utilize Lawson is a book of records that is where the information comes from okay to the Salvage Warehouse we know exactly where it's at we need to then identify that asset in order to make the presentation to you okay so the weather it is our inventory system that we can watch our our assets and account for them

[00:26:00]
okay thank you for doing that if there aren't any questions and we can have a motion for approval I'll move that we approve the statement of I just switched to the right technology budget adjustments 331 is consideration for approval of statement of Portables to be taken out of service July 1st to the 31st 2023

[00:27:00]
no we're not at July 31st yet so that's an okay thing but go ahead it's generally how we present these people give him the the list from f-dnc to dispose of Portables that they deemed to be unusable and unfit so it's generally presented that way if you have anything else to work around in the 80s 6060

[00:28:00]
service for July 1st 3:30 1st 2023 okay I'll second if we could have a roll call please have email address okay our next will be consideration for approval of District purchases that equals or exceeds $250,000 for vehicles and dump truck so Madam chairman period

[00:29:00]
272,000 and with that I'm happy to answer any questions okay any questions I'm assuming they're replacing Vehicles right now if there aren't any questions 2005 for vehicles and a dump trucks yes yes yes yes okay next item is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals 60 equals 250,000 for

[00:30:00]
audio equipment and services for approval of the purchase of audio equipment services this would be utilizing a naspo New Mexico contract and the estimated purchase is 3.99 9003 million 950,000.00 and I'm happy to answer any questions about that okay just need a motion I will move to prove a district purchase or expenditure that equals 25000 for audio equipment and services second roll call please hey Google okay

[00:31:00]
next item is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 or reading intervention materials okay you're on Madam Madam chair members of the board superintendent Elder on behalf of APs procurement I'm requesting consideration for approval of the procurement of reading intervention materials this would be utilizing and a Cs and a Los Angeles United school district agreement and the estimated amount is 4.5 million over 4 years do you know what I mean I know you and thank you for all the background information and I know we've used this before the i-Ready and iStation do you have any idea what we've spent on it previously

[00:32:00]
so I already was purchased in 2021 22 school year by special ed they purchase limited number of licenses just for special ed students it was inadvertently turned on for an hour all students and so it's hard to compare the 71,000 they spend versus the I think total $534,000 that many we're going to spend this year for K5 we want to make sure that all students who are not proficient in Reading have access and so I believe that the pupil cost remains about the same okay wonderful any questions so is this material of these programs provide is a blended approach and so students have access to the online portal and the recommendation is that they are not online for more than 45 minutes

[00:33:00]
research shows that anything above and beyond 45 minutes does not give any added gains to students but if students need additional intervention teachers have the ability to download additional resources so that it will support targeted interventions with Concept students are struggling with and then this is this will allow them to help access the grade level content so this is not replacing on content and this is to ensure that students have access to most of it is in person with the teacher face to face right and it's not no more than three times a week 15 minutes a session online everything else this will not replace a teacher this is just giving teachers another tool and what it allows is that gives teachers the ability to really work in small groups and

[00:34:00]
differentiate and have students engaged productively while they're working in other small groups so a centered based activity so I appreciate the information you sent about it but when I read it I thought you know this sounds like something that a publisher would say about their own materials and I'm just kind of curious what feedback you get from practitioners about you know it makes the statement oh it's culturally relevant and linguistically sensitive whatever the verbiage is but I'm curious what kinds of actual report she get from teachers 3 using it with students what I will tell you is that last year when it was no longer available and we heard about it a lot from teachers they were very disappointed they they believe it is an effective tool for them to use and this isn't just elementary teachers that responded it was Middle School teacher

[00:35:00]
yours as well responded that why don't we have access to i-Ready and so as you saw we wanted to be thoughtful and make sure that we didn't just purchase something we already had because we already had it we wanted we really got our team of literacy experts in the district from multiple departments to make sure we were purchasing the most aligned and effective tools thank you and we could also talk to the Cheryl Wheeler the culturally relevant piece because that was a question as well as how do you go about insurance that these are culturally relevant materials I also wanted to just share too as the students are progressing through the content they're also informed of their progress along the way so it also gives another access point for the teachers to have those

[00:36:00]
conversations with the students both of the programs also offer a family component too so it also engages the family with the students progress as well as offering the families additional resources to support their children at home specifically with the culturally responsive content that is also one of the questions that we have so I read notes that they partner with Dr shiraki Holly to ensure that the content also includes the rings of culture they also have commissioned passages that represent the student population as well as added strategic scaffolds specifically to address the needs of our English language Learners they also work with the Council of great City Schools to really ensure that their framework is centered around with Ice Station they have a multi

[00:37:00]
play multi-dimensional learning design framework that includes a diversity equity and inclusion lens so the characters that the students are engaging with the within the programs are presented in a game of vacation mode so the those narratives are throughout their process so that the students are actually seeing themselves through the content a couple of the characters that they've shared is Celia Cruz and Tito Puente and so these materials are also assessed through another individual Dr Kathy escamilla so they reviewed the iStation books and they've come to you know a conclusion that the materials at the students are engaging in are culturally and linguistically responsive to me I appreciate that I have to say I'm always a bit skeptical when the curriculum

[00:38:00]
is coming from a vendor whose primary Mission has been assessment because I mean my my skepticism is that we start adapting or curriculum to assessment rather than adapting assessment to curriculum which is a more appropriate thread or Direction and so I I just hope not to say that this shouldn't be purchased but that I hope that we always do look at it with that level of skepticism of where where is the impetus for purchase on the best instruction and curriculum or is it based on matching the assessment that we're using I have I your input on that what I found when I looked at iStation or when we looked at PlayStation

[00:39:00]
who was integrated one wasn't driving the other that they were two products that work very well together the assessment piece and provides information to the personalization of the lessons and so to me we're just we're taking an assessment that that were mandated to use and adding a tool that would make that really is better in supporting informing teachers and hopefully those Publishers are really listening to the feedback that they get from teachers and students thank you she has some the same we always have the same kind of questions do you have any questions just a question about this is the purchase from curriculum Associates for i-Ready use utilizes an existing contract from La us

[00:40:00]
so LAUSD put out a competitive procurement and under New Mexico procurement code we can offer utilize those agreements it's often called a piggybacking agreement and it's we'll use different ones from different isd's around the country if they don't all or they're not all open or applicable to us but under this agreement it is available and we've used to utilize it in the past as well and does it does it allow for better pricing like what would be the point of piggybacking I guess it's just a procurement to use if someone is coming so the work has been done will look at the terms and conditions of the agreement sometimes we can negotiate better

[00:41:00]
can you sing sometimes we can negotiate better terms it just it just depends on the agreement itself so they will add that in there that any of the school districts that are part of the council you need a license contract so it helps us with the pricing to be more competitive and then just to confirm this is based on the science of reading correct there is no nonsense of reading in here there is no queuing Theory guided reading and I just real quick I have to give a shout out to my my High School Las Positas Heather pillman who is sitting in the back hello who is one of the vendors so hi nice to see you

[00:42:00]
okay member Gonzalez do you have any questions no okay and I just obviously will have I'd love to remember Peterson already said I always am just concerned about little kids being on a computer and when I read it was that's not what it was all about and it was very timed about how much time they were going to spend and that small groups and large groups that was all part of it so that that's not what it was and if teachers love it and their and the kids are getting something from it and that's what you're saying that's what matters and teaching the phonics and phonemic awareness and fluency and comprehension and vocabulary that remember Peterson and I did like for kids as well as thinking so

[00:43:00]
we remember doing that but I did love what she said about like adapting assessment to curriculum and not the other way around and I hope that that's what we're doing as you all know what I think and I'm pretty sure I can speak for a member Peterson it's like tests or not what we should base everything on as you really be about what they're learning so I appreciate all the background information that you did give us so thank you for that and with that if we can have a motion I will move to prove the district purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars for reading intervention material I will second okay I could roll call please thank you yes Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes okay so next is consideration for approval of the

[00:44:00]
2023 cash disbursements any questions if not we can have a motion I move or approval of June 2023 cash disbursements roll call please pay me later on yes Danielle Gonzales yes Robert Peterson yes yes yes okay is update on the FY 2024 budget I'm here to prevent an update to our budget so in this present next in this presentation I will give an overview of our budget

[00:45:00]
our website and budget book as well as the essence 2424 budgets are already in use and I wanted to recap out of the 2.2 billion dollar budget was dispersed by fun so our biggest portion of course is of the budget was $985 million dollars that are foundational dollars that support our schools and departments followed by 533 million dollars of capital funds and then our federal grants at 345 million most of which are funds that have contributed many benefits for us students and I will speak to that shortly so we continue to work with errs in phase one which is assessing our current

[00:46:00]
to define a vision for funding system to understand system conditions and identify opportunities for resource ship our next working group meeting is August 9th from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. and we will have and we have tentatively set another meeting for September 18th and next next is the working group members I just wanted to put this in there so that you could see that it does have a diverse group of individuals giving input into this project and then next before that I guess it has been brought I wanted to make note that it has been brought to our attention that the state is looking into changing the funding formula which could also make a difference in possible resource shifts so we're going to be keeping that in mind as we go through the project

[00:47:00]
but I don't know the exact timeline for this project at this time but we will be keeping an ear out for that and so on this one we continue to update our out facing web page so if you go to the aps website you can find our 24 budget breakdown kind of like the way that I just said her friend you'll find prior year budgets and you'll find our budget presentations and you also will find a fast facts including like the number of schools that we have are enrollment and other interesting facts so I just wanted to point that out cuz that's one of the things that we've been working on to increase transparency and then the other item that we continue to compile our budget and as soon as we have the actuals for FY 23 we can roll that information

[00:48:00]
24 budget book which we hope to submit for the meritorious budget Awards sponsored by asbo International which is the association of school business officials and then another thing that we're working on is our budget policy so I just wanted to make sure you guys knew we are working on that and so we're getting pretty close to having a good draft of that next oh and this little visual here is just something that you'll see on the website but next to begin I will the update I wanted to start with the sr2 funds or

[00:49:00]
Freelancers Elsie translation services Class Hero licenses summer literacy bilingual books summer school salaries and benefits and letters training completion payments we are still closing out these funds as the use of these funds expired 63023 but we have a liquidation window of up to 93023 and it looks like we were able to use all of these funds completely so that was good and this graphic that you're seeing now is kind of like just show it's a recap of the major areas of focus for our three funds or are funds and next this is just the funds update so of course arpa was the largest of

[00:50:00]
which was about $242 million and we are hoping that in the next few months you will really see the percentages go up in each of these buckets the graphic shows the amount spent at year-end for FY 23 in our next presentation we will include the spending today inclusive of what's Happening already in that white

[00:51:00]
that they desire to keep on moving on maybe like letters as you had mentioned and we will encourage them first to find other grant funding if it is allowable and the initiative has been identified to have benefited our students and then if they can't find funny through there we will have to figure out how we can support it with operational dollars and by doing that you know we'll have to probably see what what we prioritize so that's pretty much all I have for an update this month for questions any questions I'll just say I appreciate all of the work that you do and getting making this visually understandable for all of us and getting

[00:52:00]
information out and making sure that we're using every last cent in the best way we possibly can and I think this reflects it I will I know president Montoya Cordova shared a letter earlier this week or last week that there's discussion in the US House of Representatives to cut title funds by somewhere around 80% and I'm thinking that it probably won't come true but if it did it would be devastating to us and so any any conversation that we can have with any policy makers I think that our Congressional Delegation is pretty solidly and supportive title funding so I don't think that we have a lot of lobbying to do with them but it's something that maybe our government

[00:53:00]
give us a heads up about what what would be needed because it would be devastating it would be devastating to our community schools to reading intervention programs and to a lot of our professional development so but thank you for this I really appreciate the updates thank you okay so I'm just looking at the last page that particularly the safe operations of schools that shows that only 2% of the funds have been used at this point and this might not be a you question but where do we stand on that money I mean I know we just approved what was it 7 million dollars for the badges and all of that is it just not reflecting and here because it has is it not reflecting in here where do we stand

[00:54:00]
we only at 2% for safe operations of schools yeah that's a great question safe operations of school is kind of like the budget stabilization portion of this so This 58 million we have it earmarked for things that we need to use for our budget stabilization for this year so we plan to use all of that but we still alive period schools for three years so I have to take you back to the very beginning when the first to this all came in we were looking at a 40 million dollar deficit we really thought we were going to have to dip in to ask her to think about 38 million dollars well at that time we did some pretty

[00:55:00]
work and we ended up only using I think 17 million as I came over to us but it was not as much and so each year we've had this amount sitting there because we're afraid we're going to hit this weird cliff and everybody keeps us about the fiscal cliff the fiscal cliff and so we've been worried about it so that money is sat there then we got a little honestly because the way it's titled Dr Blakey for example is Bob is this safe operations this the physical safety is this the and some of it was some of the cleaning some of it was the the very beginning we have people walk around and hazmat suits going through the schools you know cleaning outbreaks and stuff that is sort of faded so now there's this black of money that we had aligned with some things that just didn't work it didn't happen the way it was projected to happen so some of that money has been sitting there we're trying to spend it we're making every airport the first year we needed

[00:56:00]
about I don't know how much was it went from 38 million to 19 million to 16 million I don't remember what the final amount was but we did stabilize the District budget so we didn't have to let people go in the middle of a pandemic and then we've used it that way as we've worked through but the initial cost was not what we had been been led to believe it might be so that's why there was a chunk so now we're at the end and we got that money left and and we're looking at other ways to spend it so you're right there's just some of it is already been earmarked for spending expenditures so some of that is meant it's just sitting in the mouth all of it has been here but we don't for the things that we don't actually have to do income versus so it's just we know where all that money is going to be going into

[00:57:00]
what items we hope to be able to accomplish with those funds this past year we use 20 million I'm sure it's not reflected in there yet but it'll you'll start to see this move quite a bit so I think already 20 million of that has already been used but what's happening also is there's been kind of movement from we wanted to make sure we spent all the cars so we also had to move anything any expenses some of the expenses that we had in our 3317 things around so we're always kind of a moving Target but everything is your marked and we do plan to spend it all and we will be giving more updates on that as like I said they haven't fully closed down the

[00:58:00]
Ariat so until we see how everything falls then we'll be able to move things and the FY 24 Bud will start to include those encumbrances which are not included here so you'll see those go up okay okay so you'll be able to give us some more kind of more details about where that money went to I know people asked us on the price you know some of it had already gone to retention initiatives and the budget stabilization I can start to show exactly have any questions thank you so much and I do I mean I appreciate

[00:59:00]
what you all are doing and how you're putting kids first and they're learning first when you putting this all together and if things are working we want to keep funding them if they're not then find something else that works and I appreciate that that's what you all are looking at student based budgeting and I appreciate that so thank you so much thank you and cute dog and and that's okay that have seen multiple years of budgets we picked up them and we kind of keep with that for the whole year so this week one would be good for this year's okay thank you so much okay all right so our next finance committee meeting will be held on August 23rd

[01:00:00]
audit committee meeting in the John Melanie Community boardroom of Alice and Bruce King at complex 6400 Uptown and live streamed at aps.edu and this meeting is adjourned and it will be followed by a special Board of Education meeting so whenever you're ready we'll go to the last video

[01:01:00]
