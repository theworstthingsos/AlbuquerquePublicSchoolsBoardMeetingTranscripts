[00:05:00]
representative from our service center is here to assist you thank you board member Benavides our first public forum speaker is Lisa Davis Lisa is on June good evening I just want to take a moment to speak I'm at the union hall right now as I meet with Academy staff and the union we are experiencing some distress as Educators But ultimately are concerned about our stakeholders there are massive changes being brought to our attention that the district is trying to move rather quickly on in regards to our school and how we operate our stakeholders at this time do not know of these changes

[00:06:00]
we have students who are expecting to attend in-person Academy classes in a matter of weeks they do not know that these classes will no longer be offered per Dr Chanel segura's orders the changes are unfolding rather quickly and affecting many people I just need help getting this message out I've never done this before but I'm a concerned educator who cares deeply about my community we serve a wide range of students across the entire State who will all be negatively affected by these changes we do have a newly appointed principal as well Julie Sanchez who is trying her best to communicate to us but is unable to do so because Dr Segura is not being transparent about these changes so I just asked that the board members be aware of this the goals and Broadway are not going to be met if these changes do you unfold

[00:07:00]
thank you our next speaker is Miss Janet Sayers you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking them High School 60 anniversary of opening in September of 1964 and we do have a full range of activities that we hope to do all school year but mainly to get to get people reconnected to their school and their neighborhood and businesses and and we just were very excited and actually I meant to start my comments by saying equally

[00:08:00]
observing of a moment of remembrance is Jerry Robertson there was an announcement in the sports page this morning that she passed away she was the football field coordinator at Wilson Stadium her husband buddy Robertson was the athletic director for APS for decades everybody in Albuquerque knows about Jerry and Betty Robertson so our condolences to the Robertson family and lastly I would just like to say that I'm hoping the board while the superintendent at the board in cooperation with the city and the county can start looking at the fields and playgrounds like its Elementary School Sanford Del Monte the fields that are separate from from

[00:09:00]
the school that there could something could be worked out where those fields and playgrounds could be used during the summer time or on weekends through some kind of security system some kind of monitoring that you just drive by them like in a day like today in 95Â° and it's so hot and they can't be used because of security but but they're independently you know they're not like you don't have to go through the school to get to them they're totally separate so I would just urge that the committee that you serve on with the city and the county could do that and I hope you all will participate in our High School 60th anniversary thank you thank you our next speaker is Dr Samoa you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:10:00]

play the under the this change anyone can stop and identify under these changes pretty much there's been showing proof that these guys are able to perform these women and they're taking over the women's sports of losing scholarships and stuff like that so that's why I need to say that you guys are able to thank you sir our next speaker is David Ames tree of 2 minutes in a few years ago she was just starting to learn how to read I wouldn't say she was struggling but she certainly wasn't right

[00:14:00]
process of learning and didn't want anything to do with practicing reading on our own the next year however and first grade something amazing happened her school made an intentional change to their reading curriculum they changed to a curriculum focused on Coronet language arts I'm guessing Dr Blakey can predict what happened next my daughter is reading accelerated at a frantic Pace she's now a rising 3rd grader she's reading at a greater than 99% tile compared to her period I was president at the top she gave recently at the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce where she in front of a large crowd of devoted and interested Community leaders discuss the importance of knowledge and increasing reading proficiency that's right and what could have easily been a surface level routine presentation we actually had a superintendent get in the Weeds on the knowledge Gap in education

[00:15:00]
curriculum changes the trajectory of young lives after listening to Dr Blakey I know that she knows us to certainly better than I ever could which is why I encourage this board to support Dr blakey's mission to infuse knowledge into the curriculum and to ensure that in alignment with the board's guard rail free the high quality curriculum are available and used in every school in every zip code yes it needs to be done in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner but we need to see the unequal distribution of high quality curriculum in this District my daughter was lucky enough to have access to curriculum based in Cornell College but doesn't every child deserve this actual thank you dot thank you sir our next speaker is Mary Ingham and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:16:00]
evening president board members superintendent in all we the people that are here my name is Maryam I'm running for County Commission District 2 in the southwest area I'm here to speak also and Title Nine and back when the dinosaurs were roaming the earth I was running track at Crown Point High School we had the first track meet for the whole state so Crown Point was running against schools and lots of Chinese schools but that was the first opportunity that girls in New Mexico time

[00:17:00]
I just think it's a great step backwards to to accept what's happening with the title nine and taking away educational as well as athletic opportunities for girls and women as well as the safety issues that have been brought up so really encourage you guys to to stand up for women thank you very much God bless you thank you Mr Stuart Ingram you have two minutes once you begin with my wife just said I know that we have have lived in times when women didn't have access to sports and to these kind of activities seeing what's happening in women's basketball right now and women's sports

[00:18:00]
I was watching TV the other night and it was four stations had women's sports on I just need to say my my daughter is a pretty accomplished volleyball player she plays probably for 25 years or 20 years now the only time she's been injured is when she's playing coed volleyball I just want to encourage you to stand up against this new Title Nine extension we can do that all you have to do is make that that anyway just would ask you to to avoid the tragedy that it would be if we accept transgender athletes playing in women's sports thank you thank you sir but prison is almost that concludes public forum thank you Mr Gonzales we will now move on to the student outcomes

[00:19:00]
Focus governance section of our agenda which is Section 5 the first item there is 5.1 which is discussion of revised interim goals and interim guard rails so this was intended to be a pretty comprehensive discussion of these revised interim goals and guardrails and discussion only so this is not something that the board has a vote on to approve but it is an opportunity for us to provide feedback to Dr Blakey and the administrative team around these interims over the last couple of days it became clear to me and she Administration that there were some emerging concerns and questions about the interims so what we're going to do tonight is we're going to talk only about the interim goals the newly proposed interim goals we are not going to talk about the interim guard rails and the reason for that is the concerns that have been raised are two pulled one is that the some there's a sense that

[00:20:00]
name of the proposed interim guardrails do not meet the approaching student outcomes focused dimension of the sosg rubric so I know that's like a gibberish to everybody in the room but let me just bear with me for a minute so later on in the agenda we will be evaluating ourselves against this rubric there is a dimension of the rubric on vision and goals vision and guardrail sorry where we're looking at essentially the quality of our interim guardrails two of the competencies that are in there are the guardrails need to both be measurable multiple times over the course of a year and need to be outputs or outcomes not in place so there is some concern that the proposed draft in her arms cannot be measured multiple times over a year and are potentially just inputs not put their outcomes so we've decided to pause the conversation on interim guard rails to allow for two things to happen one is for Dr Blakey and her administrative team

[00:21:00]
our coaches at the Council of great City Schools Ashley Paws and AJ crabel about these interims to make sure that they're meeting the competencies of the sosg framework the second reason for this pause is to allow board members additional opportunity to review the interim as well and I will say that we received these interarms as part of our meeting package well in advance and no board but only one board member submitted any question or any comment this was during the summer and many of us have been away away away from our email maybe away from board work and I we did not want to risk rushing these roads through because we the board weren't paying enough attention and so I just want to call upon the board to go back and look through these interim guardrails again with the fine tooth and take a look in particular your thoughts

[00:22:00]
about are they measurable multiple times a year are they outputs or outcomes okay and we we have concerns there are concerns about the interim I'm sorry about the guardrails 1 and 2 in particular but potentially other guardrails as well so if you can re-review those with that focus and if you have questions or concerns please email those questions or concerns to miss King Johanna King no later than end of day Friday July 19th so I know that is 2 days from now but we did have over two weeks with these already so we should have done this already and we didn't so bye if you have any questions by the end of the day on Friday please have those to Joanna that will give the administration opportunity to take that feedback and look at it in concert with feedback from the sog coaches and potentially make proposed revisions to the interim guardrails

[00:23:00]
the guard rails will come before us again for discussion in the August 7th meeting so this will not affect our progress Monitor and calendar but minimally and Dr Blakey will go over that minor change that we're going to need to make to the progress monitoring calendar as a result when we get to agenda item Five Points too so stay tuned for that minor change so we are still on schedule to review our goals and interim goals it's going to affect the potential review of the interims but not significantly and will approve that on the calendar I think so just one other thing I don't know that yay I said everything I need to say about that and I know it's like again a lot of educational and we are committed to doing it right and doing it well and we want to make sure that we provide ourselves the time

[00:24:00]
accountable to the timelines that we've set for ourselves and not hold the administration or Dr Blakely accountable for us not doing our job so we're going to provide the two extra days for that feedback again you're looking in particular at are they measurable multiple times during the year and are they outputs and outcomes you're sending feedback in questions to miss King by end of day Friday July 19th so with that I will turn it over to Dr Blakey to have the floor as our presenter for the discussion of revised interim goals thank you on board president Gonzalez and members of the board as you look at the revised interim goals and interim guardrails I do want to let you know that the team has worked a couple of months on improving and fine-tuning the interim goals and interim guardrails to make sure that we do have measures in place that will help us monitor the progress After we receive your feedback

[00:25:00]
we plan to present revised interim goals or interim Cardinals at the August 7th meeting but the interim goals that we came up with we want to move forward with I want to point some of the changes out that we made to the interim goals for goals one and two the interim goals we are measuring the two grades that precedes the grade that sided in the goal so for go one it would be first and second grade and for go to it will be 6 and 7th grade for goal 3 we will examine three areas that are cited in the goal for the interims and that will be looking at specifically the bilingual seal career Pathways and advanced placement classes and then for goal for the interim goals we divided into two groups 3rd through 5th grade and 6th through 12th grade to align with Panorama which is the evidence based tool that we

[00:26:00]
used to measure student skills habits and mindsets so that's an overall summary of the interim goals that we plan to use to monitor progress and I want to just let you know that just as I'm being evaluated based on these interim goals and interim guardrails so is the staff and so I think it was really important to the team to get them right and to feel like there was a good level of measurement because there's a lot of hard work and commitment into these interims as the staff knows that it's connected to their evaluations as well as mine and with that I stand for any comments or questions thank you doctor blakey's so the board had an opportunity as I stated before to ask questions about these in her rooms already and we didn't really get many questions I do want to open the floor to discussion with the acknowledgment again that we don't approve these These are the administration's interims because they are the experts we approve the goals and how they're going to measure getting to the goals is their responsibility so we can provide feedback

[00:27:00]
one of the things that many folks noticed this week last night is as it relates to our sosg framework when it comes to vision and goals there are specific dimensions for how we're measuring the effectiveness of these goals so they should be smart there should be no more than one I'm sorry no less than one no more than five so we have those and that's what we really need to be looking at to measure the effectiveness the content is not our purview we're not the superintendent so with all of that said are there questions or discussion about the interim newly-proposed interim goals remember Jackson kind of in light of

[00:28:00]
Madam president mentioned about being measured multiple times throughout the year I jumped ahead just a little bit and I'm looking at the progress monitoring calendar and just as a clarification let's just take like interim goal 1.1 it looks like in February it's it's measuring the end of your results but then again in like October I think whenever the next time it's being monitored it's all so measuring the end of your results and so I guess my question is is if it needs to be measured multiple times throughout the year how are you guys going to track the iStation like as an example for goal and from goal 1.1 how is it being measured multiple times

[00:29:00]
thank you for the question board member Jackson the way that it's written is the actual interim goal but the measurement is going to be where we are leading to that goal so it'll be a mid-year measurement leading to the end your goal does that so it's a multiple measure of the mid-year assessment that would be presented at the February meeting okay so I trust that you are fine but yes it is a measurement throughout the year and then just the way that it's written is it is still going to be measured three times a year yes so the the way that the interim goal is written is is stating that it's finalized at the end of basically the

[00:30:00]
but to get the multiple measures along the way we would be looking at the mid-year assessment as the data point to make sure that we have them throughout the year so I think last year there was a time where we had like the Moy data for i-Ready that is the midyear kind of how are we getting to that and your goal so it's the mid-year assessment for it for the interim goal we're on track to meet the interim pole okay thank you just wanted to verify so just to clarify this may be related to the word to the next so I think what number Jackson was calling out is the 5th Street Station we could change the semantics of it with

[00:31:00]
the language of the interim goal so we're progress monitoring the end of your results by seeing where we are at midpoint to see if we are on track we might just want to change it to just say interim go 1.1 and not put the description if the end of the year results makes it because we are progress monitoring the end of the year results but we're progress monitoring it made year to see if we're on track to take it right so it is just the work that you've done to make sure that we're measuring the right thing at the right point in time is reflected here and so we just need to make sure all the languages they're awesome yeah I would say that my suggestion what we could do to revise it is just to take out the description and just just like we have go one and just says early literacy yeah so it would just say interim go 1.12

[00:32:00]
so what is actually being measured at any point of time yeah are there any other questions related to the newly proposed interim goals not yet I'm sorry that's okay so this is discussion item only so it's our opportunity to raise concerns provide feedback on the goals and so now we do have until end of day Friday July 19th two days from now to provide feedback on the internet guard rails and then that will come before us for discussion on August 7th so because of these changes now we're going to move to agenda item 5.2 which is adoption of the revised progress monitoring calendar back over to Dr Blakey to walk us through the calendar and the proposed change that we need to make for the purpose of approval thank you Lord president Gonzalez members of the board what you'll see is the

[00:33:00]
progress monitoring calendar we do have a couple of changes to make on it the first change would be we are proposing September 4th interim guardrails 3.1 and 3.2 would be moved to September 18th to give staff enough time to put that measure together after the changes on August 7th so that would be the only change to the progress monitoring calendar and based on the previous discussion we will take out the descriptions of the interims and just leave the designated number of each of the interims to refer to and our First Progress monitoring according to calendar would be gold free for August 7th but since the interim goals are in changing we feel confident that we'll be able to proceed with progress monitoring on August 7th

[00:34:00]
great thank you and I will be facilitated by member Benavides on August 7th so we are excited about that so we had an opportunity to ask questions already and so I'd like to see if there is a motion and a second to accept the calendar with the proposed changes as described by Dr Blakey moving the content that's progress monitoring on September 4th to September 18th and then also just clearing up the language to refer only to the goal and interim goal numbers I'll move for approval the adoption of the revised progress monitoring calendar and revision of some of the verbiage listed on the interim goal thank you we have a motion is there a second Romero and a second from remembered Dominguez is there any additional discussion or questions

[00:35:00]
are you seeing that we will move to a vote Dr Albright Commander roll call vote please Ronaldo yes other benavidez Crystal Tapia Romero Dominguez Courtney Jackson yes then you'll always yes our next item is a discussion on board time use evaluation and our presenter is Vice President Ronaldo homework you have the phone thank you so if you can go ahead and pull up is those of you who know we have a great opportunity as a board to evaluate ourselves and so this particular segment is about time and in our board meeting and whether or not we're really focusing on the student outcome governance at the variables on whether or not

[00:36:00]
things are being efficient to where were really focused on the students so this breakdown that you're seeing up there is just a list of our meetings from it's a quarterly assessment so we're looking at April 2024 May 2024 and June and so when we look at these segments and we look at like under April 24th the first meeting is a April 3rd and in that number where you see 130 that's our designated total minutes for that particular board meeting and then once we get into that role of in April then we expanded into the next one of the 130 minutes into somg and so when we look at that particular meeting and what we discussed were any of those items specifically for so

[00:37:00]
Focus governance and in that particular meeting we have zero so then after that we go into the next column and that's other minutes out of the 128 I'm sorry out of the 130 so that other minutes could be voting it could be just other items that in particular that we designate as other and so that those minutes come out to 130 so then we do the breakdown for all those minutes to make and then eventually I mean in April so we didn't total those up to our total minutes of 289 for our total minutes of meetings and then 125 for our son of G and then the other extends to 1604 for the month of April so then we take that and we go into May and then we go into June and so in our main meeting what

[00:38:00]
does a little more significant in there it was our sosg minutes so in May 1st we have 64 out of the total of $130 in that particular board meeting and then 66 and others so it gave us to 49% so when you look at that we look into our regular board meeting for the 15th and then we go to our special board meeting of the 29th and sometimes when you look at these particulars for why we have zero in our somg could we do to that meeting in particular on our agenda did not address goal setting it did not address some monitoring or particularly for June we had no school so then those numbers were either 0 or we didn't have those topics covered within our board meeting so when we total for the month of June I mean of May

[00:39:00]
322 minutes for all board meetings in May and then sosg came out to 1:39 and then the other was 183 so then we did the same thing for June but the numbers didn't vary because we were out of school so that's where we didn't have any sosg items or discussions so that brought us down to zero so our quarterly total would come up to 666% of our evaluation and whether we're Meeting those goals when it comes to our board minutes meeting

[00:40:00]
28.5 or 6 I'm trying to remember those totals but so we'll use these minutes within our self-evaluation so we'll take this and we'll bring it into the cell phone self-evaluation conversation on whether we obtained and met our particular category to increase it and hopefully we'll get there as we move forward so that's my record of this I don't know anybody have any questions I don't see anybody the board I'm sorry while we are seeing if we have questions can someone who has access to the spreadsheet just put the formula in there to calculate wow that was like magically the formula showed up in our hotel is actually 39

[00:41:00]
I was trying to do the math in my head and I'm nowhere near as good as that or Excel okay so we were at 39% for the quarter of spending our time on sfg student outcomes Focus so are there questions for vice president to morito about how we did spend our time particular meetings what was counted what wasn't counted anything else really to our time use over the last quarter I have a question about how much coaching including how much time you spent to do this coaching I would probably say about an hour and a half of a 2.5 2 hours and 30 minutes and coaching and so just as a reminder we have a signed our

[00:42:00]
forward secretary is being responsible for time use tracking overall and so she is trained Secretary of Astoria and will then train and support board members as it is their responsibility to do the time use evaluation so next quarter when we measure our time use it will be one to remember none of us next quarter other questions about Chinese but I do want to point out that we did go up from 33% to 39% and given that it was June the 43 percent marks are hopeful yeah we are making progress we are talking about students so that's exciting and good and

[00:43:00]
especially when we have student presentations that come in that's very significant and I think if we look at how we can increase that that would be very helpful and within our goal monitoring Pieces Just those are pretty standard but I think that as we increase more student voices to do presentations or to come up and speak about what's going on in their schools I think we can increase those numbers I agree I hope so I know we can all right so this is a discussion item only and so if there's no additional discussion we'll go ahead and move on in the agenda to agenda item 5.4 which is to consider adoption of the aps Board of thank you never told us to consider an option of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self the valuation for year two quarter 3

[00:44:00]
student outcomes focused government governance is a framework designed to drive our ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes so this is the process that we're about to do for agenda item 5.4 of calibrating and recalibrating to make sure that we're aligned and realigning our governing behaviors with those that research shows is most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes board members were asked to individually complete the selfish self evaluation form for our board actions from the last quarter so we were asked all seven of us to look at April May and June and rate that against the sofa evaluation framework the majority of us have done this and have submitted our individual results for tonight's discussion and so I am going to go ahead and now go over that I will say that I was hopeful that we were going to all

[00:45:00]
but we actually didn't agree on anything so across all of the different competencies there's disagreement and across the discrepancies difference and across the totals there's difference also so we are going to go ahead and I'm sorry and dig into the details of the rubric to again calibrate and make sure that we're rating as we should before we get there I want to know that we did ask all board members to submit their rating by Friday July 12th and that was for two reasons to have everyone do it and also to be able to analyze those ratings so as of Saturday July 13th a day after the deadline I had only received scores from two board members board members were provided the July 12th deadline multiple times on April 3rd on June 14th and on July 5th so I was worried that I didn't have feedback from Everybody by the deadline despite

[00:46:00]
Google reminders and so I had a meeting with AJ kraebel we met this weekend to get his coaching on how to handle this I said well now I have to go and email every single board member and ask them to please submit again and he said don't do that so his coaching was that I should average the scores of the two members who did submit on time I did that and present to you that Consolidated score as the starting point for this discussion I'm going to share that in a second so you're going to write down this is the starting point score for our discussion Mr crabel also advised me to point out that only two board members followed our policy and thus I board members violated our own governing policy by not submitting their scores on time so the specific policies that were violated by five members of the board are for me which is board accountability reads the board will monitor its process and performance by regularly conducting formative

[00:47:00]
self-evaluations along with an annual summative self-evaluation within 45 days before the annual superintendent evaluation so it is his coaching that since five members missed that deadline we violated that policy so next time we won't get points for following all of our policy secondly the second policy that Mr cable advised that five members violated was the implementation timeline for sosg so when we accepted the sosg framework and process we voted as a board to approve a comprehensive implementation timeline because we voted that on a board it we voted on on that as a board at essentially becomes policy it's the equivalent of policy we voted on that time line and then we didn't follow it I have some note about us not acting with Integrity maybe it comes later in this yes okay so that's said

[00:48:00]
the average score of the members who did submit on time is 53 so that's where we're going to start with for our calibrating discussion 53 by Sunday evening I did have scores from three board three more board members so it's just two days late I'd already completed my analysis and already talked to our coach but I did a second review of the scores I integrated those additional three scores and so the total that we had at that point the average was 41 so when the new scores came in we went down and then I did receive scores from one more board member on Monday so I integrated that one as well and they went down further so the average of those six scores is 37 I also talked today to our sfg coach to get her score and to calibrate so we started at 53 more people provided their feedback we went down I talked to her coach she rated us

[00:49:00]
go to 53 so we've got discrepancies that we need to talk through and her coaching is that we need to agree amongst ourselves there may be different because of opinions or perceptions around whether we met a competency or not but we just need to agree so we know what to put into the tracker so I want to know that one of the reasons why there is a discrepancy of something that we've already spoken to some of the board members rated the interims that we had in our inbox as the interims that we were scoring for the purpose of this self-evaluation so we had new interims in our inbox and those are going to be our rooms going forward and so some members rated us against those new interims however those in her rooms were not in place in April May and June so we should have rated ourselves for the purpose of April May and June against the previous interims that we already had so there was some descriptions because we were just waiting the wrong documents so when we

[00:50:00]
the interim goals are approved as it or whatever our final as of today those will filter into our July August September quarterly rating and then when the interim guardrails are approved those will also filter into that quarterly reading but there was some discrepancy because we were just reading the wrong set of goals guard rails and interims so as a summary we committed to doing this work we as a board we committed to self-evaluation in policy and we as a board did not act with Integrity when we did not follow through on our commitment we violated our own policies when we did not follow through so this is not about finger pointing or blame it's not about who didn't do what or when or if there wasn't enough time but it is an opportunity for us to recommit ourselves to what we said we were going to do focus our time on student outcomes and measure how well we are doing by completing our

[00:51:00]
evaluation so going forward if the timeline if the deadlines don't work we need to know in advance if you don't have time to review the materials I need to know in advance if there is a deadline it does need to be submitted on time so that said it left us and kind of a clunky place to have this conversation for tonight and I'm sorry that it's going to take longer than I would have wanted to but if everyone can just pull up what was in the word packet which is the sosg framework and we will go through that and now my own okay so for vision and goals we have scores of 252525 10/10 and 25 so some people rated us as a 25 and some people rated us as a 10 so if you can go ahead and look at vision and goals and take a minute to read

[00:52:00]
through that again and let us know whether you think we're at 10 or 25 or something else and we'll have a conversation about that and will determine what is the score were collectively agreeing on for vision and goals I guess I have a question a point of clarification

[00:53:00]
and it was because on the one to fourth one where it says the board included students parents now I couldn't the parents because I know we had families the staff the community members and that was the part I couldn't fully say yes yeah that was the back in like October of 20

[00:54:00]
no it's just overall in the process of developing okay goals did we include the community parents and stuff so that's where I that's why I rated it lower but that part so do we so do folks think we should be at 25 I think we should be at 25 thank you thinks we should be lower than 25 well I mean we're still discussing this is just the goals and we do have we approved interim goals for the new gold we have so what was in effect for April May and June where the interim superintendent of Elder presented that we had already discussed in we don't approve but those were final so we'd already earned the credit in January February March they didn't change in April

[00:55:00]
I kind of feel like we still need to stay at 10:00 and and I guess it's kind of an overlap between the fact that yes we had interim goals goals and interim goals but when I look at that last section in 25 in the green section I have to wonder with the information that we have now whether or not the previous goals and interim goals actually did challenge the organization to challenge the organization and require changing an adult behaviors I guess I'm just not coupled with the fact that we all know that we do have new interim goals do they pertain to stop students

[00:56:00]
outfits or student in sorry I can't speak student outcomes or student outputs so I guess I'm still hesitant and feel like we might still be in the 10 session is the question of whether the goals and interim goals will or have challenged the organization and require a change in adult behaviors I mean I would think that still yes because it challenge us enough to have a new superintendent and new goals and reorganization of staff and a lot of change honestly to try to meet them but how do others feel about that one in particular do the interims that we have goals in a room that we had in place April through June would those have challenged the organization and required change and it'll behaviors I would hope so because they were accepted weren't they

[00:57:00]
and I think maybe there's some questions about whether we didn't know but I think we're in progress right and but I also want to point out that we had we had this contest and we had a school and a first grade teacher when most improved reading scores so I'm just going to give a shout out to that school and have some park because they work very hard at it so there's evidence is it has it taken route I see it as a positive change a move in the right

[00:58:00]
so I guess I don't see it as set in stone and I think we should celebrate when we get to a when we meet maybe knowing that we could lose that so we made it to 25% the only thing that was keeping us out of 25 with the annual targets yeah so I think because

[00:59:00]
25 points and we did that that sort of the measure of whether we earn the 25 and then I think member Dominguez is going forward we need to ensure that goals and guardrails continue to challenge the organization and continue to require change and it'll be years and I appreciate member Jackson for flagging that because it's easy to say yes these challenges of Staff but it's harder to measure may I add to that for me the Dilemma was hasn't trickled down I mean it's challenging us but hasn't trickled down on we did have children present from help me with this was it so we've had some evidence that we're getting we are challenging the system it's coming it's getting down

[01:00:00]
classroom yeah so that said member Jackson would you be comfortable with 25 yes okay so we'll do 25 points for vision and goals congratulations everyone we will move on now to values and guardrails so this one there was disagreement about whether we are in 5 or 10:00 so we had several members ranked us as a couple members rank us as a five now again I I wonder if the movie from 10 to 5:00 was because we were looking at the newly proposed in around and not the previous in a room which we had rated previously but I don't know so take a minute everyone please look at approaching student outcomes focus and meeting student outcomes focused relative to the guardrails that were in place for April May and June and

[01:01:00]
when do you think we are 5 or 10 for me I could easily move my score back from 5 to 10:00 because I made the same mistake on this one as I did in the previous score of thinking it had to be within those three months and I think that we should be at 10:00 because just reading what each step says all items in the approaching student outcomes Focus column we're not as well as the items in the meeting student not so focused you discussing the theories of action item the training on the 29th and 30th which is where I recall we agreed the Strategic plan was the theories is everyone comfortable with 10 points agree I have a question and I'm trying to make sense of my notes Here I had his remaining at 5 Points because we didn't have guard rails

[01:02:00]
and I'm not quite sure what I meant by this and I'm just going to go ahead and read it out loud the district is not yet devised tool to survey all Educators and staff if I don't need some urgency is that I think that's a guard rail or an interim road so we are 10 for values and guardrails all right moving on to monitoring accountability we had a difference of opinion as to whether we are 0 or 10 so 0 is not stupid

[01:03:00]
Focus for monitoring and accountability so go ahead and take a minute to read through the reddish pinkish orangish yellowish columns and then we can have a conversation about that I will note while you're doing that there were questions about the final competency under approaching superintendent is evaluated only on performance regarding the Bulls boards goals and guardrails we have an evaluated the superintendent and so there was a question of well did we not get this point we do get it because we have a policy in place that says that's how we evaluate the superintendent so the fact that we've had transition and she's only 16 days in the doesn't relate to it it is the fact that we have the policy in place so if anyone took points away for that that's the clarification on that one horse open for any other conversation around monitoring any accountability

[01:04:00]
I would agree I think I was confused about that last bullet point about the superintendent is evaluated but since we have the policy and I think based off our last just this time use evaluation that we just had we are firmly into the 10% for at least a quarter so I feel comfortable with 10 so I feel comfortable on that part but I have a question on the Zero category and and you would probably know better than what we would if we've adjusted to this where it says the board has not consistently demonstrated the ability to distinguish between customer service issues and owner service issues I don't know if we have

[01:05:00]
play master that with everyone just yet so that's that was my hesitation there and buy your tilt of your head OK Google had we demonstrated our ability to distinguish between customer service and owner service I think I mean I think so because it says has not consistently demonstrated and I think if anyone like slips they catch themselves and like know where to go next so I wouldn't say that it was 0 for consistently demonstrating the ability okay we're still slipping we're not perfect but

[01:06:00]
I also think that the retreat that was a big clarification for me as a new board member on that line and it was talked about and it was recited many times I just wanted to get you okay with him yeah okay communication and collaboration the scores the discrepancies are fine so one would be the yellow orange app

[01:07:00]
things to now comes focus and the folks who gave us a five I think we're in green meeting student outcomes focused so take a quick minute to review that and see if you think we deserve a 5:00 or 1:00 question mark and there were seven in January so does that mean for the entire year we will not advance that there were seven meetings in January cuz I remember we had a conversation about this there were a lot of meetings and then we went back

[01:08:00]
then I feel like I got overruled in January what did you say January how many times so we did say we have more than we had seven more than six meetings because we had to finance an audit which are required by law so they didn't count and then community outreach I think that's what the issue was yeah and then and then another one for 3 for February 3rd for March and April we got into 4:00

[01:09:00]
but in June we had one two three four five what time is okay that was part of the training

[01:10:00]
board meetings you're showing three meetings in May and two meetings in April so a total of two for 7:00 meetings for the quarter which averages to less than four for the quarter with more than 3 hours yeah none of them are more than 3 hours okay we didn't have more than five topics for discussion on any of those during April May and June and we limited our discussion and we didn't change the agenda so can I get some clarification cuz with you saying that like the January meeting doesn't isn't held against us because we're just looking at this quarter that's where I got confused with the first two because I thought we had to have those particular actions for this quarter but you're saying because we had an earlier in the year

[01:11:00]
so I don't know what I we have to approve this right this is a voting item too many documents up here yes okay so how about we go with the five and I get coaching and ask this question about the January meeting since it says the previous 12 months if we didn't need that for the whole year were doomed to stay in 0.00 on August 7th okay so we're going to give ourselves a five for now and seek clarification on whether we're actually 0 and if we're wrong we'll come back and fix it cuz we are into continuous Improvement all right we're going to move to Unity and trust is that okay to move on to Unity and trust her other questions yeah okay you need and Trust okay so we have 035

[01:12:00]
I don't want anything to take a look at the not student outcomes focused will actually take a look at all of them give me the Green Bay never mind the numbers

[01:13:00]
so I think we're at 3:00 p.m. on I rated as a fine but I brought that was a mistake and and I'd like to weigh in on unity and Trust about this portion of our evaluation and I just for the public sake you know I

[01:14:00]
recognize that we are in a moment of lots of transition but it is particularly important then that we pay attention to some details I am the policy chair and I don't feel like I'm being part of those scheduling conversations especially when I get emails that say okay we've scheduled a policy committee meeting and now we're canceling it whether it's intentional or not that feels dismissive and I'll leave it at that and I understand but at some point we need to slow down and be attentive to details that involved professional personal relationships they're still questions and concerns over the interpretation of our comp

[01:15:00]
Pinterest policy and we have no place to have conversations about these concerns that's a policy concern issue and I feel like a policy meeting needs to happen to discuss these topics I I know that we're worried about meeting time spent on student outcomes conversations and and some of these topics don't directly address now comes however they're important topics nonetheless other policy matters like defining the role of committee chairs I have also been pushed aside or soldiering on and pretending that tensions and concerns don't exist and we sold her on because we're afraid to lose points we don't address the concerns that many of us have

[01:16:00]
how about being left out of conversations and decisions again I'm aware that we're in transition but there are lots of spinning plates I'm thinking about I'm also thinking about the New Mexico School Board Association appointment and a vote that was made in the name of our board without any input from our board all that leads to a sense of unity and trust and we all know that what happens at the board level trickles down to cabinet and staff and all the way into the classroom to do our jobs well to be able to focus on student outcomes I'm asking these concerns period

[01:17:00]
productively with a unified voice so that is my ass tonight a retreat so that we can come together get to that next point at 5 all of that is not the focus for me and feel like we're being heard like our concerns are going to be addressed in a very concrete way so that we can move forward during a pretty darn exciting moment with our new superintendent her team and their Vision all of our Visions so that's my house thank you very much for a retreat and we'll discuss what we can do acknowledging all of the moving pieces and remember to because I would be happy to meet with you as well about these concerns particularly as it relates to policy conflict of interest in some of the other things that you mentioned so that I can make sure that we're

[01:18:00]
on the same page and addressing the issues that we need to address and those are on the list of our quarterly meeting when we get around to that it's all right thank you any other comments on unity and trust or the score on Unity interest which I believe we're agreeing is a we are approaching consensus that it's a three I'm seeing some head nodding so we're going to put a three here and move on to continuous Improvement is the most agreement most of us rated us to 0.1% rated us one so if we can take a look at continuous Improvement and see if anyone thinks that we deserve that one I will say that I don't think we're talking cost of Staff time yet which is why we haven't moved in there but if anyone thinks that we

[01:19:00]
want to acknowledge board member of Dominguez about unity and Trust not to go back to that but all of these are equally important and so thank you for what you said and I'm on board or whatever it is we decide to do it thank you all right so with that just to summarize vision and goals I have 25 values and guardrails 10:00

[01:20:00]
this gives us a total of 53 for the last quarter now we need to set our goal for the next quarter so I'd like to hear from members of the sport what you believe is possible for our next self-evaluation in the next quarter so the next time we do this will be reviewing July August and September that conversation will be happening in October so who would like to share their thoughts first on what you think our goal should be for July through September so we've already know we're going to lose sorry

[01:21:00]
I believe we're going to do that we were just waiting for the reorg to take place and know which staff or in which roles so now we can do that now we have a new person in charge of board Services also some so now it would fall to Dr Albright but I believe it's going to be possible I'm looking at this King because she told me it would be possible okay we're going to make it possible so we're gonna earn that one point thank you because I think we'll be able to check off all of meetings and continuous Improvement Health evaluation

[01:22:00]
add one training session on student outcomes Focus governance that's why I don't know we haven't scheduled anything we actually don't update the status and targets and are we supposed to update okay so provisionals we are currently at 25 to get to 25 start to get to 35

[01:23:00]
I think so okay so we're going to go ahead and say we're waiting for 35 provisioning goals for values and guardrails we gave ourselves a 10 which is meeting students to folks think we can get to the 15 Master will have new interim and we have adopted our own governance manuals yeah okay monitoring accountability right now right now we're at a 10:00 which is approaching we would like to get to meeting which would give us 20 were there on the time use we are not planning to monitor more than

[01:24:00]
per month for about will do every guardrail we have the Strategic plan that we are not we won't be there on the evaluation today instead of the objectives for communication and collaboration we're at 5:00 we would like to get to 10 this is about our public meetings the topics on our agendas the amount of policies we've adopted

[01:25:00]
no more than 2 hours for receiving materials at least 7 calendar days before the meeting today can we get to the five I think once we work out the clarification of just said I think we can but I think that it has to initially made me work through and we all have to memorize our goals and their status so honestly there is some concern that I have about us giving advice to the superintendent

[01:26:00]
operational advice and instruction to staff members I do know that is continuing to happen quite a bit so we would need to really focus on us not giving advice to the superintendent and not giving instruction to the staff many of us are still emailing staff and talking to staff and asking them to do things so if we can commit to that and really work on it we could get to the five but that's kind of a big sticking point for us so we want to set the five as the goal let's try continuous Improvement we think we can get to 3 okay so check me and then I'll need some Edition here our goal vision and goals is 35 values and guardrails is 1500 and accountability

[01:27:00]
10 communication and collaboration is 10 unless 5 and continuous Improvement 3 288 788 okay so that said I will entertain a motion and consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation and so this is what the motion needs to read the I moved to accept our quarterly self-evaluation score of 53 points on the student outcomes focused governance and the goal of 708 for the next evaluation so with someone like to make that motion I move that we accept emotion I'm sorry for evaluation score of 53 points on the student outcomes Focus Governor self evaluation instrument and work towards 78 for the next court

[01:28:00]
