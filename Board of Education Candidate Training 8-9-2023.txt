==================================================

[00:00:00]
21 I will Welcome to our candidate orientation presentation tonight my name is Yolanda Montoya Cordova and I am currently the board member for District 1 which covers the feeder schools of Rio Grande High School and Atrisco Heritage so it's in the predominantly in the South Valley we cover a little bit of the downtown area as well and I'll have my colleague introduced herself all of the southeast tights with redistricting only about half of Nob Hill now goes north of I-40 between

[00:01:00]
San Pedro all the way to or between Louisiana and Carlisle all the way to the Comanche and includes Mesa Del Sol so it is apparently geographically extensive as well as well populated neighborhood that's really interesting and she says that because now they include District 4 now includes Mesa Del Sol was before it was with district one so that got carved out of my district and got put into her district and then they we still Encompass Isleta Pueblo as well so a Native American Community that's all so supported by that district and Barbara and I are the board members that were tagged to do this tonight because we're the two that are actually not running for re-election so we have both been on the board I am going to be completing my sixth year with the board and I came on the board by way

[00:02:00]
different route because I was appointed initially and then I ran for a term so I'm completing my fourth the fourth year of the second term Barbara you can explain how many you've been on and I'm at the end of my second term which turned into 9 years rather than what would have been eight because of the change in election law when they when they align the nonpartisan races all into one bundle on the first November 1st Monday or Tuesday of November it extended my term by a little over 6 months so that being said there's you can see already there's a lot of time and I think expertise between the two of us in terms of the number of years that we've been here so we're going to go to a series of slides because we are recording this so individuals are watching us live stream who are not able to be here tonight

[00:03:00]
and it's also recorded So that individuals who were not able to either watch us be a live stream or couldn't be here in person will have the opportunity to to listen to the recording on their own and so I do also want to say that after we're done with the presentation we're going to be available for questions and answers so we'll we'll entertain those as best we can so if there's a question that you have that we've never heard of before will be sure to to get your name and some information and or will either probably even post it just so that everyone has an advantage to hearing their response to a particular question so it might be interesting to have people but at some point yes I think first we're going to go ahead and do the the presentation and then afterwards because we are live streaming it's too hard because they cannot

[00:04:00]
and so we're going to we're going to go from there so the presentation topics that we're going to cover tonight include student outcomes Focus governance and I think you're kind of seeing that with goals guard rails and all of that we're going to talk a little bit about what that means and why that's important to these board races the aps goals and guardrails the board member expectations so we'll give you an idea of what is required when you take that oath of office and all of the the work that's ahead of that responsibilities engagement and Outreach training on the resources that are available to board members once their elected so student outcomes Focus governance if you've been watching us a little bit with the board you'll know that this is something that is a new governance model that we've adopted recently and motto that goes with this student outcomes don't

[00:05:00]
change until adult behaviors change we've adopted this governance model which is it's a it's a research-based model that is that urban districts are are using it's from the Council of great City Schools which is a council that we're a part of the urban districts are mostly a part of that we do have our own Association but the Council of great City Schools supports large urban districts like us and believe it or not we're not a huge District comparatively speaking to other districts we fall actually somewhere in the middle there are districts that are way larger than us I think of Nevada with 200,000 students as one District so we're right in the middle we actually fall kind of like 35th everybody wants to say that APS is one of the largest districts in the country we're not we're actually just right in the middle of that

[00:06:00]
behaviors change or is that differently when placed in the context of governing patterns of behavior that are exhibited in the boardroom can reasonably be expected to be found parallel in the classroom and so that's where a board of directors aboard is important because the way that we conduct ourselves and the way that we work literally goes down into the classroom so we carry it tremendous amount of responsibility to make sure that we carry ourselves with a lot of of you know we have to be really careful words matter actions matter and so there's a lot of heightened anxiety sometimes that we can create and sometimes we can create Whirlwind where we don't need whirlwinds so part of the government's process is to to make sure that we're doing things with Fidelity and that we're all doing things that are making sense for the district so the student outcomes

[00:07:00]
Focus governance framework uses six research informed competencies that describe School Board behavior and and the degree to which they create the conditions for improvement in student outcomes so one of the things to remember that the only reason of school board exists is to improve student outcomes that's our job that's that's what a school board is all about so are our work is based in visions and values goals guard rails monitoring and accountability communication and collaboration unity and trust and continuous Improvement so those words of that last one continuous Improvement and unity and Trust when you join the board you're working as a team it's not individuals and we'll talk a little bit more as we get down to this so effective School Board governance framework and why we do this is obviously to improve student

[00:08:00]
princess I mentioned the only reason we exist is to improve student outcomes and I've already talked about this is to help school boards deep in their focus on student outcomes and that's what we've done so this is a timeline of the work that we've done to date on this so we started back last September where we had a formal adoption of the student outcomes Focus governance approach and model we actually have been undergoing training and coaching for this model and we're in alignment with other districts that we have a network of schools that have actually utilized this and have been very effective so we've made that commitment to doing that we engaged in some Community listening sessions in the fall of 2022 and I know some of you attended those I do see a person I do know who was there for sure but the community listening session was the first step for us

[00:09:00]
in gathering the input that we needed we represent a constituency and that constituent constituency is who we listen to to help us to guide the work that we're going to go into help us to guide the adoption of goals and guardrails so through those Community listening sessions we had several in the fall last year we distilled all that information and there was a lot of work that went into this process to get us to the adoption of the goals in the guard rails and you can see those in in the room that we have posted and these basically will become the five-year goals and guard rails that will be monitoring over the next five years so the superintendent the superintendency evaluation and it also becomes a way for us to be transparent with the community in terms of the progress we're making after the adoption of the goals and guardrails the superintendent and his staff had to adopt what we call

[00:10:00]
call interim goals in guardrails and those are the interim activities that they have for each of those goals and they're written in a year at a time so that's what we're monitoring towards so that we can see the work and the progress is being made to the overarching goal and they have some strategies that they talk about strategies they talk about the inputs if you will that they're going to actually put into place that will help us to move that needle although we have these all the goals and guardrails it's time bass so they're they're all considered what we call smart goals so that we can make sure that we're also getting to the progress that we wanted to get to after we did that we also adopted a monitoring calendar and if you go to the board page we've got a monitoring calendar that sets in motion for the board to take up conversation around each of these goals and guard rails and actually have a conversation with the district in terms of how are things going what's working well what's not working so well

[00:11:00]
that feedback and that continuous Improvement so that we can pivot if we need to Pivot but again this whole notion is not about gotcha governance or you know being a heavy it's really being in partnership with the district in the superintendent as their implementing those interim pieces that they're doing so that we can make sure that we're getting the progress that we want and also just being honest with ourselves when things are not working and if we need to Pivot how are we going to Pivot and what what would we do differently the next thing so we're our progress monitoring has already begun we had our first practice session last month we've got a guard rail that we're actually going to be monitoring at our next board meeting which is on the 16th so you can see us and listen to us in terms of how we're doing that it's all brand new so we're still kind of working our way through that and as a board who's under who's undergoing some coaching it's all so

[00:12:00]
helping us to change our behaviors as a board and the things that we need to be looking for in the way that we also need to conduct our governance so that we can support reaching those goals and guardrails we're getting ready for some Community engagement again so what I want to also stayed on this is the community engagement is an ongoing process it wasn't a one-and-done we did it it last fall to help us set emotion our goals and guard rails and to identify those will be going back out to the community to share here's our goals here's our guard rails getting some buy in for that and we're also going to be using it as an opportunity to get some input from the community about the characteristics and skills that they would like to see in a superintendent because we are about to embark on a superintendent search and then all the board evaluates itself quarterly so this isn't about just evaluating what's going on out here but it's also evaluating ourselves to make sure that

[00:13:00]
holding ourselves accountable to the things that we said we were going to do and how we're getting it done so we just conducted our last evaluation and you know we're working through this we're not we're not quite all done with the things that we need to do around this governance model but it's really good for us to see the progress that we have made because obviously we have we've got goals we've got guard rails we've got a progress monitoring calendar and we've already started to set that process in motion so the board goals identify what we are striving to achieve over the next five years to improve student outcomes and how we will get there is the Strategic plan the Strategic plan outlines the work the district will carry out over the next five years in order to achieve the goals so I want to make that distinction the board is only responsible at the goal level goals and guardrails the district is responsible for that

[00:14:00]
strategic plan that's their job and that's their work our job is to make sure that we're monitoring and that we're giving feedback and that were engaged in that process but we're not we're not the doers at that level that is part of the superintendent's job and the and the staff so the the Strategic plan has been complete completed we're really excited about that and so hopefully you all will have an opportunity to engage and see if things are going on as we're unveiling the new strategic plan the guardrails are the rules of the road so those are the things that ensures that the district reflects the value of the community and guardrails are really kind of difficult for us that was hard for me initially when I heard those because they're stated in things that we will not allow you know which seems really negative in terms of the way that they're stated so you can see our guard rails all posted up here and but these essentially are the values that the community

[00:15:00]
add this to hold so can we make sure that whatever resources or programming or things that were putting in place that we would honor those pieces that were really critically important and I'll talk about those this weekend to those two we get to the definition of each one and then the last part is just knowing how far we have gone and that's where the monitoring comes into place the interim goals and the interim guardrails are measures to help us know if we're on track and if we're you know we're in motion to set and to achieve our goals so the way the progress monitoring is coming on it's literally a report tells us if we're on track it's it's driven and it's telling us about activities that are in play and a real honest conversation about what's not going so well and what are some of the challenges or what is some of the things that we're going to do to either correct that or scrap it I mean because we could also change we might have to we might have to Pivot so

[00:16:00]
and that's where the board comes in because that partnership with the superintendent is really about how do we work as a team because the the board is actually made up of the seven Members Plus the superintendent and we're a team working towards student outcomes so APS schools representing the communities vision and you can see this is the first goal was around early literacy I'm not going to read it out loud those are all posted on the website and for those of you that are here in the room you can see it to you to the right of the room but we do have a goal around early literacy you know noticing that early literacy is really critical that's a base skill for for kids to have for children to have in order to to meet their academic goals and and have achievement the second one was around math proficiency and the third was

[00:17:00]
post secondary Readiness which is the one that kind of gets me really jazzed and excited as a person who was formerly with Workforce Solutions we heard a lot from the community about not only should our children be able to read and do math but they also need to have the skills ready to engage in a post-secondary career whether it's going off to college or it's engaging in a career just having those skills and then the fourth goal which is also really important and we heard a lot from the community on this are those skills habits and mindsets that set our students up for Life success and those are things such as perseverance being able to stick through things teamwork good communication we heard that over and over and over from the community of how important those life skills are the guard rails represent the communities values and we had values around wrap around support systems

[00:18:00]
acknowledging that we have a lot of students that are are experiencing an equity in some in some ways that there's there's support that's required for some of our students whether it's Health mental health additional academic supports a myriad of supports but how do we wrap that around and make sure that we have wrap around support systems throughout the district knowing that some of our students really are going to require those extra supports in order to be successful the second was around equity and making sure that we are allocating Resources with an equity lens looking again taking into account where high-risk areas are I need areas and how are we addressing those areas differently because we do we have to close that Gap knowing that we're we have a huge gap and how do we how do we use our resources so that we can address gaps across the city the thing that's really

[00:19:00]
exciting about being on the aps board is that we represent the entire city and although I'm a representative for the South Valley area I come through with this perspective also that the students that I'm representing are all of our students and I'm trying to put that lens and I've learned so much from our other communities in terms of how that might blend and could work for the constituents that I serve are that I represent but we represent all the community it's not just district one or District 4 it's all of our communities the third guard rails around high-quality curriculum and instruction making sure that we have the best curriculum and instruction that we can possibly have but also making sure that it's aligned with culturally and linguistically responsive and different and it's differentiated to meet the academic needs of all students the beauty of being

[00:20:00]
Mexico is where a very diverse State and very diverse community and I think that's what is kind of I think it's our Legacy I'm a product of APS and I'm a product of the South Valley I want to say that too I grew up and went to my schools in my community Kit Carson Ernie Pyle and Rio Grande High School and you know I I it was a great Community for me and I always felt that in my community I did have access to teachers and to staff that were all so representative of my community but there were also times when it was lacking and I understand that part as well and so with changes we need to make sure that we're all so continuing to put that on to see how we can have our students from across the city succeed the fourth guard rails around voice and engagement and of course

[00:21:00]
you know this is this the purpose of this one is that not excluding any voices on whether it's parents legal guardian students and Community organized not organized but Community organizations and other types of groups that have an interest and want to be engaged with us making sure that we're including that voice and engagement and that we actually are measuring ourselves in terms of how we're impacting that and actually improving that as we go along and then the fifth guard rail is around staff support and this is really important because in order for us to implement all of those things we need to listen to our staff there are we have for those of you for any of you are involved in like Workforce Development there's a teacher shortage out there there's an education shortage out there whether education shortage and I say that broadly because

[00:22:00]
whether it's bus drivers School nurses cafeteria workers educational assistance teachers the whole gamut there's a shortage and so we have to pay attention to the voice of our staff that we have right now we're a large employer but how do we also recruit and retain the staff that we have and also develop our staff so that they can be the best that they can possibly be so staff support is critical we cannot do any of this without without without our staff so as I mentioned earlier APS schools and guardrails are smart they're specific they're miserable their results focused and their time bound so we made a commitment to to putting a measure towards towards these things we were definitely what's the word that I want to use I think we were aspirational in our goals because all of

[00:23:00]
most definitely want to see the best for a district and so we put some very aspirational goals out there and we're going to we're going to try to stretch ourselves but it's also as I said at the beginning this is not about a gotcha governance but it's really just how can we if we start to put that out into the universe I'm kind of that person who believes if you stayed at sometimes it'll happens and we know there's nothing wrong with being aspirational and so I am looking forward to continuing to watch the board even as my term ends because I really am interested in the progress I believe that the district is going to be able to demonstrate and show as we go through the monitoring process so I'm going to turn it over now to board member Peterson who's going to talk about board member expectations and then we'll wrap after that and we'll have some questions and answers okay thank you I

[00:24:00]
when Yolanda and I spoke about this she said you know we can fill in anything that the other one lives out I don't think there's anything you got left out so I'm going to let the girls and guardrail stand on their own but I think so I'm going to talk about expectations responsibilities engagement and training and so Yolanda spoke about the aspirational part I'm going to talk a little bit more about the thing that may or may not scare you in in taking this on the expectations for and say one thing we are really lucky to be in a district this side because we are able to unlike many of the smaller districts around the state we are able to have support from

[00:25:00]
sitting in the back and they take care of an amazing amount of details and Workforce everything from calendars to you know getting the agendas published there is a myriad of laws and legal requirements and restrictions that are imposed on the board and it's all done in the spirit of access and accountability and so on but it really is a tremendous amount of work between minutes and postings and keeping track of all of the legal requirements as well as policy and making sure we're in alignment with State Statute and all of those kinds of things that were able to get a lot of support from

[00:26:00]
and I think it's important for people to understand that as you look at running we have two regular meetings a month starting at 5:00 on the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the month in addition we have a policy meeting we have a policy committee we have a finance committee audit committee there are special meetings that are designed lots of times to address a particular issue in depth and then they're at hot committees that take on extra tests usually done around anything from policy and governance issues to to Capital Investments so right sizing the district is one of those committees that we have going right now

[00:27:00]
or to realigning a particular way of how our governance is set up so we've set up a recently we just established a new committee to really take a deeper dive into our finance process for our finance committee making sure that we're you know are we doing more than we need you know how can we be more effective and efficient so part of the commitment from the student outcomes Focus governance model is all for us to become as effective and efficient as possible you know with an overarching goal is like can we get our meetings down and turns up number of hours having been a board member who's the attended a board meeting for at least I think we've had six six and a half hours meetings yeah so not impossible but we're working on making it more efficient

[00:28:00]
as board members that we understand for instance where the authorizer for somewhere around 35 charter schools and not only is there a lot of legality things that go into that but really understanding what our role is and is not an oversight of charter schools and what's involved another another thing is and hopefully this will happen at some point the community school we are engaged with the Albuquerque partnership around Community Schools and they play a really critical role with many many of our schools and so understanding the ins and outs of the way that the district Works internally

[00:29:00]
any number of other organizations governmental entities another example is we is with the tribal governments we have a large number of native students in our district and we have we have a legal obligation not just to them as students but also with the their home tribes and working in a way that really respects the the governmental authority of those tribes and and how we relate with that and providing an education for students is really critical I'll go to the next site so just say there's a lot of people you can count on the meeting at least once a week and so that that actually brings up one more thing is that

[00:30:00]
those are the things that we participate in as board members but there are also many many many many many many many Community organizations that are important for us to hear from and be engaged in and so part of our responsibility really is being that that Outreach and that link and tie to the community I think what Board of the said about representing the entire district is really important that is definitely who we are is board members we are not solely and advocate for own districts and at the same time we have a real obligation responsibility of the things that gets

[00:31:00]
repeated over and over again and I'm going back to the sides now yeah cuz there's going to be a section on engagement by the way is that as a board member you're a board member you have no Authority individual board members do not act as Lone Wolf policy makers that are only are only Authority is as part of the board now that doesn't mean that we don't have opinions knowledge

[00:32:00]
Google Earth supporting our public schools in supporting the students that attend them and supporting our employees that do that work everyday and day out and so I think those things are really important but none of us can walk up to the superintendent and say do this we cannot walk up to any any employee of the district and say do this we have our influence through the work that's done as the entire board and then the policy positions that are passed from that I think that's just one extra extra for some of us who have been around for a while we were not as familiar with social media it's not a tool that we're real comfortable with

[00:33:00]
but I think just like we tell our students be careful be careful whatever you put online will be there forever whatever you put online will can become it can be part of the general universe that you no longer have any control over and so I think that the importance of being professional at all times is is really essential whether it's in the grocery store whether it's had a neighborhood association meeting but it's sitting on the diet as a board member active members over the last six years I guess what I know that I'm not going to try to be back but you can't go to the grocery store anymore without somebody recognize not recognizing you so you go out and people will see you remember oh yeah you're that school board member and people will want to Corner you in a store or out in

[00:34:00]
I'd like to say you know I want to talk about such and such and such and such and it's really easy to get caught up in in that conversation but the other part is you know is Barbara is saying is we really are not we can't we're not like customer service agents I was one of the things that I've learned through the student outcomes Focus governance we will have to refer them right back to the district and say you know speak to your principal or you know call this number that's not our job I mean so and you will hear a myriad of complaints you know my air conditioner is not working and that's like the common one right now right or you know I really don't like this particular teacher and why can't I have my student enrolled in this class and you get a lot of that and it's really hard to just sometimes just say you know want to remind you that as a board member I really don't have the ability or I've had family not family members but just even community members can you help me

[00:35:00]
get my student registered in a school where it's closed enrollment and I really want to get them in that school and it's like I can't even get my own grandchildren and that's cool that's what I have to remind people is like my grandchildren had to wait in line just like everybody else so so that's the hardest part and I think when you first step into the into the board as you first year you know a little naive sometimes about what how that all really works but as I've gone through the years and you know now into my sixth year I have a lot you know I just have I've learned how to like just sort of navigate those questions when they do come up and those concerns in a way that one doesn't engage in them and like a negative conversation either I really want to engage in a way to to build unity and trust and you know sort of that confidence that let's get back to the district let's make sure that you can get your question answer because I have confidence that somebody is going to is going to

[00:36:00]
respond and I've had constituents I said you know if it's not working out then get back to me and let's see what happened but I need for you to try those first steps first I think empathy goes a long way and lots of times when people come with concerns sometimes all they want is in year to know that someone hears them but we are not in a position to take action we do have phone numbers and that's that's what that's what we can share is here's the student service phone number or I will forward it one of our other board Services folks is sitting in the back and Christy is a master of issues too because that is that is part of our role is to help people navigate through but it's not to navigate for them to give them some information sometimes the next thing

[00:37:00]
directions to avoid being placed in a conflict of interest now there are lots of State statutes but really spell out what conflict of interest is and it's very serious and you know if you if you own a paper Supply Company don't expect to get business from APS because that is a pretty straightforward conflict of interest I think we're working on and grappling is the board right now with what does it really mean because all of us anyone who runs through the board and as I look at this group of people I think it's probably true their issues that made you committed to this race committed to wanting to impact public education and so we all come from perspectives and with background knowledge and relationships

[00:38:00]
and so I think it goes back to when we are on the board really working at being transparent about what those beliefs are and philosophies and outlooks are experiences transparent about all of those things and just really trying to come back to we represent we are working for the good of all students and APS and put them in jail for next there are some very straightforward period and

[00:39:00]
that's really and truly are the three major responsibilities of being on the board now we've expanded it a little bit because of the work that we've done with the Council of great City Schools to really look at the goals and guardrails and interpreting that and being a partner with the administration and how that gets implemented and and what work goes on to accomplish those goals so that's sort of an expansion in the communicates with the community and again we do that in many many many many many many many many many many many many ways because I think that it's important to really hear about what are those greater concerns that are facing communities organizations

[00:40:00]
work in the community back during covid when so many families were so stressed it was and I represent the International District and the amount of community work and partnership that went on to really work at keeping families the float keeping kids connected it was a huge task and APS was not in a position to do it alone APS stepped up and did a lot but could not have succeeded Without Really building and strengthening relationships with the city and the county the different community school and Community organizations coalition

[00:41:00]
Roadrunner Food Bank Roadrunner a lot of those things and and as board members we weren't in a position to implement any of it you know it was not within our capability but what we could do was the line of communication and and making sure that the community and you that the district was absolutely committed to learning and addressing what the needs were and so I think that was really critical period for that we carry our own

[00:42:00]
ability insurance and so on and so forth but people just need to be aware of that we have the ability to be the capacity to Sue and to be sued in this when you assume this role all right now we'll go on to engagement and Outreach okay we are actually on the board right now working on a calendar so that the community really knows when when are the going to be formal points of contact you know when when will we go back we went out into the community gardens I think one of the most negative experiences that people feel from any institution APS included is so you can't even talk to us and then what what happens next you know it will listen to you and see you later until the next time we want to make a

[00:43:00]
I think there is a real commitment on the part of the board to alter that relationship and say this has to be an ongoing discussion that the golden guard rails are the the highlights but what happens in the meantime and in the process of of really implementing and growing is a district has to be an ongoing conversation that can't be one shot deal and so we are working on getting that calendar period

[00:44:00]
so much in my life as one as since I've become a board member I was a teacher for 35 years you do not sit as a teacher as a board member you can face a lot of time in front of emails phones and meetings of one sort or another so get your exercise plan under control and it's important it is and sometimes I think all of us because we don't have staff here's the other thing for you to understand is our board services staff is responsible for the board that means that they responsible for all of the legal obligations that we have they do as much as possible to to be the Clearing House for concerns that come to us and do an amazing job but they are not personal stuff we have no personal stuff

[00:45:00]
you are looking at it you're each of us on board member Jackson came in for the number to Dominguez came in so we have four of us here we have no staff we are it and and so that is a reality when you think about when you're thinking about can I really take this on it is it consideration not hopefully not a determinant but it is something to acknowledge it is time consuming and terms of the organizational skills that you'll have to develop I am like I used to work so I retired this year but I was working full-time well I was a board member and the hardest part for me was walking around with three phones because I had my personal phone I had my work phone and I had my APS phone because and I kept separate phones because everything was subject to Ira and so I

[00:46:00]
how to keep everything separated on purpose because I didn't want that to to come into into play but I cannot tell you I know the part staff I made them crazy because they were having to send emails to me at work for things that were scheduled just so I could try to keep three calendars as well cuz I was trying to keep my work calendar or my personal calendar and my APS calendar but just that it is time consuming in terms of just the organizational side of it since I left my job and now I'm just doing the board for the last four months that I've been retired it's been wonderful because I actually have been able to to catch up on that but I am still I'm easily looking at an email box right now for the course of over six years because you saved stuff too and you have to organize stuff cuz you're going to always

[00:47:00]
reference something back so you're always going back and you're looking at that but I easily have I want to say something like 30,000 emails in their floating around everywhere and then it becomes this you know the skill of like trying to find something when you need it thank God we have a good staff because when I need research or I need to find something they do help us find it but so there is a huge commitment in time in terms of just organizing yourself so we'll move on to the next one around training it just one more about that I think it's important to put it out there so that people don't have any questions of Snapchat and at the same time it is I mean really and I say this seriously it really is an honor to be able to do that it is I mean I spent 30 I have spent basically

[00:48:00]
my entire adult life with APS in one capacity or another and it's and why because I really care about the work that we do the work that we do and the people who do the work and making that all work and come together is absolutely critical for a community and so it is not a burden I mean it really is an honor to be able to do that but it does take time talk a little bit about training and we'll kind of play off each other on this so I want to start out by saying is that in order to be on the board you don't need to be an education expert that is not that's not what it's for we have the district is made up of educational experts there's we've got a wonderful senior cabinet we've got some amazing teachers that we've got some amazing talent within the district and they become your experts and those

[00:49:00]
what are people that you can work with my background is in social work so my background was in community organizing and Community Mental Health Juvenile Justice child welfare so I came from a lens from that perspective but I also came to this with the with a perspective of being a grandmother who has children who are part of the district and having raise children who have been part of a public school district and being a person who went through a public school district so so there's a lot of training there's a ton of training that is available to you and your email box gets flooded with tons of resources because our staff is so good at connecting us with every possible resource that you could need so if there's a topic you want to know about

[00:50:00]
is it going to be there in front of you somewhere and you'll find a way to sort of go down a rabbit hole do some additional research and and look at stuff you have to be a reader to be on the board because there's a ton of reading so being able to read discern information to kind of call through it to and also looking at information from like different various perspectives and also sort of discerning from that kind of a viewpoints of well because there's going to be a bazillion viewpoints on everything the thing that I've learned over time with the school board is there's no silver bullets out there there's pieces and best practices and there's you know but all of that together kind of comes together set the table and create opportunities for Success because I think there's so much diversity there's so much you need this to every school district and ours is certainly that and it's certainly that

[00:51:00]
for the different communities because not one Community is like another community and so you have to you have to be Discerning across that with all the information that you're receiving and be willing to read you have to spend a lot of time reading and so we do have the New Mexico School boards Association that were part of so this is the association for all of the districts across the state and where the largest District where the only Urban District really I mean in Las Cruces you know it's close but not quite there and so we you know we it's interesting it's a lot of fun actually because I I do enjoy listening to the smaller communities and some of the concerns that they have and how it's how it's done there sometimes APS is due to the you know the big elephant in the room because we're we're bigger than everybody and we get all the resources you know from their perspective we get more than everybody else but there's a lot of learning that takes

[00:52:00]
play I think in terms of being in partnership with other school board members across the state we're also members of the Council of great City Schools which I had mentioned at the beginning and that's where all the urban districts come together and there's a couple of large convenings there's a policy meeting and there's also a large just a practice convenient and then they have smaller meetings throughout the year that you can participate in that I have found really helpful they put out a ton of information to to help sort of catch us up on Urban issues and some of the some of the unique pieces around just being part of a large District don't want to talk anymore about your training that you've done for so one of the things that the board has done is in this is new and I think a really wonderful thing is really dedicating a portion of the budget for each

[00:53:00]
Beach Board member to be able to guarantee that they're getting the the training we live in a state where yes Albuquerque is the largest District by far we have over 30% of the highest needs special ed students in the state in the district because we live in an urban area with medical resources so many families come to Albuquerque we have in general over a quarter of the students in the state so we're large but we also that also means that we have a legislature that is made up of many many many many many legislators who are much smaller districts so our relationships with other school boards is really critical for the well-being and funding of public education in the state because he does not call the shots in Santa Fe

[00:54:00]
Albuquerque is really dependent on on what happens in the legislature for funding and policy in all sorts of ways and we've got to have strong relationships in Santa Fe so that when we go and say here at the needs it's not just the needs of APs it's really and truly the issues we're having with bus drivers and having sufficient bus drivers every single District in the city in the state is having those same concerns period the funding for salary and they think they do it correctly and I think they probably somehow honestly think they are the reality is it never comes out with our math and we are always short with what the state says we should be able to fund and that's not true

[00:55:00]
so as a board member it really is critical that we build those relationships because we rely on them to strengthen public education in the state and so the New Mexico School Board Association doesn't have some of the some of the in-depth training for instance that we're getting from Council of great City Schools but they play a really critical role in in our life is a district in New Mexico I was just going to add the newly elected APS board members will be required to attend on boarding in November and early December so this is something that we're all so instituting as part of our governance model so this will be an opportunity to get sort of like that whole big picture piece on some topics specially around budget the collective bargaining agreements procurement

[00:56:00]
the open meetings act and what that means and how we're governed under that as part of our requirements as a board and Technology because there's going to be we do utilize the the district's technology to support ourselves and just being able to to navigate through that and understanding that we did have budget right up there at the top and that's probably the most that's probably the most complex issue for the district and I know for me is the board member the finances are always the toughest when you see that first spreadsheet with expenditures and such you're just like your kind of like your eyes kind of glazed over and it seems it's very daunting sometimes so so budget is definitely a place where we need to pay close attention to to what that means and how it's all I'll put together but we're really excited about

[00:57:00]
this this new onboarding requirement because we think this will be a way for a special for new members to sort of like ask those questions right from the get-go also maybe start to align with like how am I going to get further coaching on a particular topic or identify those places that maybe you need some additional resources and information so when one of the word it's sort of interesting that the legislature is decided that we are the one group of elected officials that by Statute has to have training there's no other elected official in the state that by Statute has to fulfill in education requirement but so I can be sort of snarky about that but but the real issue is I mean I'm going into my 19 year of doing this and I really and truly feel like being a board member is very much like

[00:58:00]
no matter how much you do you will always see more of the needs to be done that you can't get to no matter how many hours you put in so the word to the wise be judicious and take care of yourself in the process but just know you will always have the sense of work undone because it's impossible to do it all that's number one and number two is there's always more to learn I mean I at this point now I've gone to virtually nine years worth of training and services of one sort or another and every time I go there's something where I go gosh that's a different way of understanding that or that's a different way than I understood before the most important thing as board members is first off being absolutely committed to

[00:59:00]
the role of public school and really and truly being committed to to the role that we play in society as Citizens as students are really and truly facing the future that we're leaving them and they've got to have the they have to be equipped to take on what's facing them and it's in our laps to make sure that we fulfill Our obligation to them that's that's number one that absolutely what a public school is for and then the second thing is just continuing to learn and talk to people and keeping your eyes open and knowing that there's always going to be more to learn and more perspective to listen to and think about what we've done the resources that you could learn some more

[01:00:00]
about the role of the board and some of the our meetings and what it means to be part of the Board of Education and actually we're we're done with our presentation I will add to I love what board member Peterson was saying in terms of like making time you know get your exercise plan in there and sort of be diligent but there's there's a there is a need to be you know to be diligent about yourself care through this process but also what's exciting about it is that you get to bet you get to develop a relationship with seven other people and I'm including that because the superintendent but it's it's really about that the relationships I felt like I really have had an opportunity to to learn so much about 7 other people over time you know I have a newer bored over the last two years I worked with another group of folks for the more previous

[01:01:00]
and there's there's some it's very meaningful because we all come into it with this great commitment and I have a lot of respect for individuals that run for this position because it is tremendously difficult as what I've learned I mean I came in somewhat naively thinking too you know I was like oh I'm going to change the world and and there was some naive in that when I first started but I've learned over time about you know how Complex public education has been for a bazillion years this is you know it has been difficult since its Inception I think it's never been perfect and for those of us that experienced a public education we know that there are things that we would love to see different we've seen changes I can look back now and I see oh well my daughter didn't quite experienced it that way neither did my stepchildren

[01:02:00]
and now I'm watching my grandchildren and they're not experiencing it the way that my daughter and my stepchildren experienced it so I have seen improvements over time and I'm I'm excited by that it always means that public education is in this continuous Improvement Loop just like my field of social work is in a continuous Improvement Loop medicine doctors were all in a continuous Improvement Loop and so I've appreciated the dialogue the the partnership and the relationships that I've been able to develop over time and quite frankly being able to see my community in a different way too has been certainly been one of the highest honors I've had so I really appreciated doing this so I want to thank everyone for being here tonight more people than I thought we're going to go ahead and close the the recording and or are we going to keep the recording going while we asked questions

[01:03:00]
yeah cuz it might be I don't know Johanna but your thoughts on that where we going to just go ahead we'll just go ahead and continue so if there are questions where yeah we just won't be able to see who's asking the question so if anyone has any specific questions for us we stand prepared to answers best as we can and then once we stop recording after the formal part I hope folks say so I can go shake some hands I want to meet some people that are in the audience no questions does the school board sometimes get involved in things that aren't these goals like lower levels versus different learning models for reading let's say is that strictly The District in the superintendent

[01:04:00]
it's presented to us our biggest role is improving budgets when it comes to purchasing things it's it is really and truly in the hands of the superintendent the the the the little slogan that goes along with this is when the movie now it's really hard because I mean I was reading specialist I have I have many many years invested in teaching kids to read and I have Professional Knowledge just like many teachers have Professional Knowledge about teaching reading and and so I personally I don't always bite my tongue when it comes

[01:05:00]
because I'm I'm committed I mean it's what I spent my professional life doing and so and I care about it and I and at the same time I can share that but no but I also know I have to let go of it because it's not my role it is not my job to implement I can I can talk I can share concerns I can do all of those things just like any other citizen can do that I mean we don't give up our freedom of speech when we become board members on the one hand but there is that Balancing Act of when do I need to step back and say this is in the hands of the administration period the opportunity

[01:06:00]
recommendations and and we look at that and we and we basically go through an approval process but as board members we cannot recommend a particular curriculum or a particular approach that's not our job that's really up to the experts so we you know we we listened intently we can give good recommendations and suggestions you know we're there but we don't say and thou shalt you use this or that that's not that's not our role I think the one thing that starts veering over into what it is our role is that within policy there are policies connected with curriculum adoption yeah and so our biggest role is to say yeah practitioners need to have a voice and and without practitioner

[01:07:00]
we are in trouble and making sure there's a policy for Community oversight and then put an opportunity to share concerns so we can we can stay there needs to be a policy in place that really addresses the kind of input that goes in but then we let go of it any other questions that was a great question okay another one on the board have there ever been like is it all you have to be extra are there any introverts on the board I'm looking at board member Dominguez I don't know what you consider yourself an introvert

[01:08:00]
you know I think this goes along with being professional is the way the way we behave as a profession is professional people who care about the job we're doing we are obligated to make sure that we are representing the district representing our beliefs in alignment it's very different from going to your party because if you ask me if I'm an introvert at a party I don't go to the party I mean I think the hardest part is because you are essentially a politician and you know you're out there and you're engaged in the community your face not be afraid to talk to engage in the community in those kinds of ways

[01:09:00]
I know when I first started I was a little bit it was hard I had a difficult time initially just like especially calling and you know asking folks to like support my campaign was really hard especially when you're asking for money I found that really difficult but then as I you know as I kept going through the process and got a little coaching along the way really helped me but there are things that I think are uncomfortable in terms of being a public official there's there's times when it does become uncomfortable but I think those are times too when you need to say do I need to take a step back do I need to go get a massage you know do I need to just like not look at my email and not worry about that because you do need to take care of yourself through this process because it's it's a lot of work okay well with that I'm just going to say thank you so much for taking time to be with us tonight we're going to stop

[01:10:00]
meet some of you while we're here
