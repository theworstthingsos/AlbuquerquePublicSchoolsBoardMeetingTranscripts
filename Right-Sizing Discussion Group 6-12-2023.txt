==================================================

[00:00:00]
2 1/2 have a roll call please Danielle Gonzales here Barbara Peterson Discussion Group in person at Dallas and Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard this meeting will be held and the John Milne Community boardroom and is open to the public and will be live streamed and videotape so our first item for consideration and is and action is adoption of the June 12th 2023 right size in Discussion Group agenda and approval of the March 27th 2023 right sizing discussion group meeting

[00:01:00]
so I will move for adoption of the June 12th 2023 right-sizing Discussion Group agenda and approval of the March 27th 2023 right-sizing discussion group meeting minutes and all second this is Yolanda okay Miss kangaroo call please Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson yes take me to Aragon yes okay item for our next time for discussion is the analysis of paralysis Elementary School Janet Khan School of integrated Fine Arts and Lawless elementary school and I think people have the the PowerPoint presentation so Miss Hicks you have the floor thank you Mr Gonzales can you go to slide 3 I believe thank you good afternoon in this presentation

[00:02:00]
we're going to talk about four things one is the savings cost savings and or budget savings from closing Lolly's Elementary School we're also going to touch on the right-sizing prevailing District strategy and then we're going to go through the cost benefit analysis of both Corrales and Janet Collins conversion from elementary schools to K-8 schools thank you next page please so on the savings from La Luz their budget for next year was 1.8 million dollars we are going to have 3.75 FTE follow the kids to MacArthur and that cost is 0.3 million it's three teachers a half of a nurse

[00:03:00]
and I'm sorry three teachers a quarter of a nurse and a half of a counselor are going to follow the kids to MacArthur so we're not going to save that money but the balance the difference is what we're going to say which is the 1.5 million they're really good news is that we were able to place all remaining staff at other vacant positions in the district that were already budgeted for okay on the least side we will receive between 103 103.000 and $128,000 in least revenue from the charter school this is not negotiable There Are Rules around this where it is based on enrollment and that money will be recorded in a capital fund that will not be an operational item we're also going to take the utilities and the maintenance and the Landscaping of la Luz Elementary

[00:04:00]
preschool APS will incur the cost but then we will turn around and build a charter school on actuals so it'll just be a wash and we're estimating the utilities to be about $40,000 maintenance will be done by 8 p.m. the Landscaping at the facility will be done by an APS contractor all other budgets for La Luz capital and grant funding will be redistributed to other schools and the activity funds budget will go to MacArthur so I think if anybody has any questions I think he'll be easier to just go school by school okay anybody have any questions on this one remember Peterson do you have anything to ask

[00:05:00]
that's pretty clear thank you you're welcome to stop for a minute and talking about are prevailing District strategy around right sizing so what we're trying to do overall is to recruit and retain students that's our that's our goal historical data shows that we lose about 30 kids from Corrales 30 kids from the district when they move from 5th grade to sixth grade from these two schools each student we lose means 11,000 to us and she said revenue on average so if we are able to retain these 60 kids from sixth grade to graduation that represents 4.6 million dollar increase to our

[00:06:00]
Revenue which is good news and then we will budget the corresponding expenses how many how many students do go to the theater

[00:07:00]
Miss Peterson what happens if the 60 are kids who actually leave the district right I understand that but certainly some of the Corrales students do go to the feeder schools that are destricted for them so my question is for those schools that would be receiving some of the Corrales students how will opening up the k8s that and I understand that we lose 60 students so they should be no impact on siebler bought

[00:08:00]
on Taylor this is what we're going to be talking about next meeting we are actually doing we're going to be bringing another proposal to you where Taylor which is the feed store for Corrales and we are making a suggestion based on the boundary change that will change the situation it's not going to be as it is right now so out of the in the 2122 school year out of the students that were at Corrales that school year 30 students left the district and 18 students went to Taylor so those would be those 18 students are the students that Taylor would be impacted by but in some of the conversation we've had in right sizing that also was reflected in the Taft Taylor Garfield discussion

[00:09:00]
okay thank you I just have a quick question I look forward to that conversation thank you so what's the current enrollment at Taylor right now let me look here's what makes you so confident that all 60 of those kids will go to Corrales for not budget for some sort of a margin of error for 58 or so kids or 555

[00:10:00]
a conservative projection based on the meetings with the community and the people who committed that they're going to be keeping the schools there and it's all so the 60 is split between Corrales and Janet Kahn right Sol Corrales would only have to maintain 30 students muscle menos okay right and to answer your question it was 315 students okay okay okay okay I mean I know Middle School is a time that you know for parents that's a lot of that causes a lot of concern for middle school so I think that's why that's part of kids leaving those kids that were going to go to a private school or Christian school or whatever or probably going to go anyway cuz that was that's a lot of times when that happens in middle school so so the only

[00:11:00]
the strategy is I know you said you'd budget to cover the corresponding expenses so there is no way or maybe there is that the scg revenue will ever be able to to cover all those expenses is that correct okay and I did see that you'll be talking about the school so I did I'm just thinking about you know kind of the same question that you know remember Gonzalez had had if you know 30 kids left the district from you know Corrales and then the other 30 from Janet Kahn those 18 and I know you probably didn't go exactly and asked those 18 that went to went to Taylor if they have a good question to ask

[00:12:00]
if they had or they could go back to Corrales would they would those 18 kids if there was you know if it was 6 7th and 8th grade with those kids go with their parents have them go back to Corrales we have not asked them that question okay it'd be interesting to be interesting to know that I think it's speak a little bit too what member Peterson's I just want to be clear on what are assumptions are behind the numbers because the assumptions will drive the numbers right so I wanted to make sure that we were clear that the additional revenue does not include anything to do with Pre-K and it also does not include any scg unit value increases Beyond FY 2524

[00:13:00]
the additional expenses include 7 additional regular Ed teachers one assistant principal 5 nurse 0.5 counselor 5.5 librarian Middle School that chair and testing coordinator increase in principal salary from elementary school to K-8 school and middle school differentials around activities intramurals Department chairs and team leads what the additional expenses do not include are again Pre-K special ed disability teachers specials employee salary increase

[00:14:00]
now the reason that I didn't include employee salary increases Beyond FY 24 was because it wouldn't be fair to include those expenses if I didn't include increases in Revenue to fund those salary increases and where where is it easy to reject salary increases it isn't so easy to predict the unit volume increase so I left them out of both sides if that makes sense and then the last assumption we wanted to be clear about is the numbers reflect or current budgeting methodology we haven't moved into the space yet of the students I mean this is do you have like any idea what those expenses like you know approximately what they could be for the you know this bed disability teachers and gift

[00:15:00]
basis but it's also really hard to determine how many special ed kids show up so I know what they are individually for example a special ed teacher is going to be 91,000 a special ed EA is going to be 37,000 okay a custodian will be 53,000.00 I understand about you know what you said you're excluding them but then you are including certain expensive expenses but not not not not not those that are kind of

[00:16:00]
in my opinion you know important and I understand that we don't know how many will you know special ed kids we have but we also don't know how many regular kids were going to have for sure so absolutely right but given the projections of enrollment I can project the number of regular Ed teachers I guess this is the difference okay if anybody thinks about anything after you're done processing go ahead OK Google the top line is our projection for total enrollment that will include elementary school as well as Middle School the second line is the cumulative number of middle school students that we are going to are projecting to retain in the district and that's where that 30 kids per year comes in

[00:17:00]
and then the third line is the cumulative number of total middle school so at the end of the day we are projecting to have 150 kids and 67th and 8th total the additional scg revenue is 11,000 per student and after 5 years we will see 3 million dollars in additional messages that we talked about in the assumptions that will drive 3.9 million dollars and we will see a difference between additional revenue and expenses of negative 9000 however if you look at the bottom line for 27 and 28 it is positive so once we break even from the losses in the first three years we will be looking at a break even on a recurring basis

[00:18:00]
I bet you're pretty confident that should continue okay okay any questions on these numbers the assumptions are largely the same except for the additional expenses include 9 teachers here versus 7 and the difference here is that it can we will have Middle School elective teachers will not that's one difference and then the other difference is that we've added professional development specific to magnet schools in in this particular cost benefit analysis for

[00:19:00]
anything on this one or processing so then okay so this is different because we are having the the elective teachers quicker here than at Corrales so once that once it becomes a true middle school then that will also add to the cost won't it if you're going to have at Corrales so at Corrales you'll see that school is picking to keep sixth grade as an Elderberry electives are only added in 7th and 8th grade as a middle school so they have an increase number of teachers needed because they are moving to the Middle School model in 6th grade so overall what we see is it Middle School is a more expensive model to run

[00:20:00]
they're changing teachers for electives so since Corrales is keeping one grade in elementary there is a little bit less of cost than what you'll see in Janet Khan because middle schools are more expensive to run so the cost for it for 7th and 8th grade only won't be as much as always for 6/7 and 8th grade but there will be once we they add seventh grade and 8th grade at Corrales and they'll be adding the electives then we'll start seeing that cost you'll see I think the projection of teachers are like today is less than Janet Khan because they're keeping sixth grade as a one-room Elementary model I have a quick question on Janet Khan because it's going to be a magnet school as well so is there any what's the word I'm trying to look for

[00:21:00]
would those students participate at different grade levels across the pieces in the Arts I mean so I mean you're always keeping kids separated but is there any I mean what's the benefit of having it that has a K-8 if the students are really not integrated I guess through the Arts programs or are they integrated throughout I mean I'm just I'm just curious about that board member you'll find a benefit to scale is what I'm thinking is like just the for the kids you know in this school you're seeing a little bit of increase in cost for one example is professional development and to be a magnet school their theme is integrated arts so we have to ensure that the school is providing the experience that that were marketing

[00:22:00]
and part of that also in a magnet school is to Showcase and have family engagement so there would be activities school-wide activities that they would be involved in K-8 so that would be one example and then also right now we're able to do some cost savings by having some elementary teachers actually teach some sixth grade courses so it will always be in the back of our minds to be efficient with the funds when implementing the school and it's going to take some time to kind of figure those things out but it'll be something that will be mindful of to ensure that we're using funds according and most efficiently okay thank you for that just I'm trying to think ahead and turn the experience for families right in the experience of Janet Khan K through 8 is because it is a magnet school

[00:23:00]
I'm hoping that there would be some like you said some benefit with some of the teachers and specialization especially being able to cut across all those grades and that's why you're seeing additional elected teachers music art and dance one to ensure that the student experiences enriched at this school all right okay primarily about funding for just Arts Workforce so I understand we're in the process of phase four I think of the Arts Fine Arts expansion which is funded currently by hb2 in the legislature but do we have funding for Phase 5 and what are the implications for continuing to expand Arts District wide but also being able to find the artwork force that we needed

[00:24:00]
currently will probably be speaking the funding and the next legislative session or the expansion because there was some in this one so we hope it continues to be thinking that would be like part of our legislative agenda for the next program is cutting in and out but I am listening so thank you like 8:00 this is the cost benefit financials for Janet Khan on the first line here I have the capacity

[00:25:00]
K-8 school at 600 they're total enrollment that we project for elementary and mid hits 5067 and then we will take another look at it in FY 28 accumulative number of middle school students retained in The District in this model the financials represent 75 but of course we will be aggressively recruiting for more and the cumulative number of total middle school students is 115 today dot so are you incrementally from student retention at 110% after 5 years is 2.3 million dollars are additional expenses are a little higher than

[00:26:00]
Corrales given the two elective teachers and the PD and that comes in at 3.8% for a difference of 1.4 so what's the highest enrollment that we've had at Janet Khan so we're currently at 3:31 or that's where we're at and we're hoping that middle school is going to take us up to the 5006 so as of right now the highest genetic Khan was in 2017 2018 and 473 students kindergarten through fifth grade 7th and 8th each year so I think that the team decided to be very conservative about the numbers to make sure that we're looking at kind of if things were to maintain really the

[00:27:00]
country of where it's happening now but remember we made it made it open yeah we made it open so to recruit more students from throughout the city so I know Mr Garcia is working with the administration that this shows the importance of getting the recruitment up as part of being a magnet school that makes it very different than a traditional neighborhood school that the enrollment is crucial to the sustainability of the school it's called the homo nose too because if we're recruiting from other places hopefully I mean close your ears Charter Schools but is that word pulling them back from the charters back into our schools because if we're taking them from the other middle schools it's like what's you know we're not doing anything so that's what I'm concerned about okay and

[00:28:00]
I mean that was just kind of like my question is if we are losing kids and then we're gaining them gaining them at Janet Kahn or Corrales where are we gaining them from where are we getting them from that is an important question to answer I think I think for Corrales what we do know is that they are several private schools in the area as well as charter schools in Corrales so we can pretty much see where the students are going I think that may be a different scenario and I don't know Mr Gracie I think that the Janet Khan recruiting efforts is looking at District wide to recruit students from outside the district back in where is the Corrales recruiting is more retaining the Corrales Community to be able to stay in the school

[00:29:00]
I think what's exciting about Janet Cohn is the beautiful facility that has just been completed I mean it's state-of-the-art and when you couple that with rigor and relevance and an interest in passion from students and staff our hope is that we create an epicenter for Fine Arts in the district I've been working with Gina rudzinski we're also looking at adding the Kennedy Center any given child program and teaching artists at this site so we can't guarantee that we're not going to recruit some APS Kids but our hope is to retain the ones that might otherwise leave in addition to find students who are outside of the district that have this interest and really provide that student experience in addition you know really creating the center epicenter of Fine Arts in our district having all of our Fine Arts professional developments K-8 at the school

[00:30:00]
only creating a community of artists and then also through any given child having actual teaching artists from the community come in and give lessons so we think it's going to take a little time to build this model but once we actually get to see students exhibit all that they learn it's going to be quick that it fills I think it was in 2018 maybe it was 2017 in the voice of the community survey that went out to families about options the Arts was very well-articulated as something that families were interested in so I think that using that data is what's kind of driven the need for the parents and students are looking for this and I think what Mr Garcia is also looking at is how we can help to address the 5th to sixth grade Cliff that we see in the district of students leaving from 5

[00:31:00]
6th grade Sol District wide with this model be something that the families would find that they would maybe they would have stayed it could impact maybe an elementary school but in middle school they were going to leave the district so this could help in retaining them in the district for Middle School by choosing to go to Janet Khan for the Kate but you know I'm a big fan of Fine Arts so they're my question I don't know if you can like answer this now I don't know if Miss Hicks can answer this so if you're looking at you know Lala loose and Corrales and Janet Khan and you know the changes and you know you did this cost benefit analysis had we left everything the way it was then we look at how it was and how it's going to be so we really are saving money or is it really going to end up

[00:32:00]
frosting more like just honest truth it really depends on the enrollment it really depends on if we can get the kids back and so there aren't that many kids that we need to to get back so if we get the kids back then it will end up costing us less with this change then had we left it how it was I could look into that a little bit deeper and get back to you okay I mean that's just very important for me to know to answer to the community because what is out there is okay to the enrollment right infrastructure to enrollment that's what you're trying to do so in almost everybody's head they are thinking

[00:33:00]
it's going to save money and I just want to be able to answer like if I could get that answer like quickly cuz I'm going to be reporting out like next week so if you could just let us know if it really is and what kind of I know you can't ever be definitive about what that number is but it would be important for us to be able to tell the community yes you know these this is really going to save us this much approximately this much money and if it's not it's better I mean people are very happy to spend money on children but they would rather have us tell them straight up what it is thank you I think you're bringing up a good point which we've talked about as a committee to is how do you balance the price of not doing anything and just letting him whether it's Financial or meeting the needs of the community right so how do we balance that this is what we're hearing from families

[00:34:00]
so how do we manage balancing providing options for the community with making sure that it's negated against the price of doing nothing to just maintain status quo so I think that each situation that we've talked about or really unique in ways to so you'll see in the closure of la Luz that's a very like efficient here's what we're going to do with on the property provide this to students to be able to utilize and then there's like how do we expand arts for the magnet school to grow so there's all these different so I think Miss Hicks and her team can get you like the concrete numbers against the price of not doing anything right I mean because when anybody would look at this and go well this is going to be costing us you know this was going to be costing us more I mean that's how that's how it looks which may not really be the case but that's when you just look

[00:35:00]
you know I like visualize a graph of the students leaving what that Cliff is every year of whether it's at the school or any school right that's how many that's how many students were leaving and it's going to go negative I think looking at the middle school as a cost any Middle School we pull that's at a certain number of students is going to show that it's costing more because it's it's the way that we're trying to find having those electives for students in the Middle School experience which is more expensive but on the as a district as a whole were able to use our leverage of some schools that are operating more efficiently to balance the schools that are under enrolled okay I'll look forward to seeing those numbers any other questions just a bit of a follow-up as it relates to Middle School overall

[00:36:00]
in the pipeline so we can make these we can plug the holes here and there but unless we're doing something holistically we're going to continue to leak kids at that point so I'm curious for an update on the Middle School task force and how that might fit into both the right sizing conversation but also the broader budgeting conversation and how we're thinking about you know anybody is it leading to any potential changes in the Middle School model how are we thinking about better serving those students just sort of have an update on the Middle School test scores for Middle School redesign looking specifically at

[00:37:00]
you know what are the reasons why our families are opting out at the middle school you know in in different mechanisms we have found they're afraid of just kind of that sense of safety they're going from a one-room classroom to a space where kids are having to then navigate an entire school and changing classes so Middle School in and of itself is a big transition we've looked at what does the transition time look like when we do a freshman jump start day for 9th graders to get into the school prior to everybody being in the school to get to meet their teachers and interact and do some team building activities with one another to walk their schedules so they know where their classes are to alleviate some of that anxiety we're looking at that for middle school as well having some family engagement nights to inform families what their feeder Middle School is has to offer and

[00:38:00]
looking specifically one of the recommendations is going to be like flexible scheduling so we have time for teachers to Coco collaborate on if they're in English and social studies they're doing more project-based learning competency-based learning so that it's not it doesn't just continue to to be what it has been in that kind of traditional setting giving schools that autonomy to be flexible in what that looks like to combine to do the project base and then we're all so we will be bringing forth our recommendations we've had a lot going on and so we were waiting for the time so I think it would be good to plan maybe at our next meeting to bring forth the Middle School redesign recommendations for discussion and then get feedback to take back to the committee if there's certain things that you all want us to work on

[00:39:00]
not included in those recommendations thank you I think one of the best practices in middle school that I think has been talked about in very much reflected in the budget that I think as a team we're going to have to decide if it's something we want to invest in with our middle school children is in teaming and there's a lot of research that shows that in middle school being part of a team and restructuring the school to be able to do that is really important to the Student Success in middle school and a few years ago we were requiring middle schools to be on a team and then we had a big like a family and then we that's nice way to the family and then we had a big budget Cliff of name the year 1718 and that was one of the inefficiencies budget wise but we've seen that in cutting that from middle school budgets it

[00:40:00]
really impacts the Middle School model of Effectiveness that we know needs to be done so looking at how we can adjust the budget for middle schools and maybe with Ronettes team in the new student based budgeting this might allow for that kind of opportunity for middle schools to put those best practices back in and so echoing what Dr Blakey just mentioned the family model which I know has been implemented at some point and then went away due to budget cuts because it does cost more money to have your core instructional core academic content teachers together with as pure of a student population group as possible and then you know but at that then we have different sizes of middle schools as well and that's that impacts things but I know that from my experience as a middle schooler we did have I was on the Trailblazer family and

[00:41:00]
we had our teachers and there were a lot of thematic projects that took place within each of the families and it was a good time for teachers than to have that collaboration time as well so that they can meet and discuss common students any type of behaviors interventions instructional planning would take place during that time and so with with the Middle School task force when we look at when we're losing students how do we put things in place another recommendation is prioritizing support support FTE so when we look at each Middle School we should be prioritizing them for a school counselor a school social worker a nurse community school coordinator like there's these pieces that if it's truly a place where we're wanting to invest our time and energy and resources then we need to do that and so that

[00:42:00]
it is also another recommendation of course it's just money but it's where are our priorities and how do we shift what we're doing to align better with engaging that specific population so I have it here on my notes to get back with the Middle School task force to be able to bring forth the recommendations to you all we have them written out so if it's not presenting them to add a meeting we can get Miss King to send them to you and then you guys can provide questions and input thank you because it'd be good to know I mean if you ask the question why why are we losing those kids like do we know why we're losing the kids a cat just be safe you have to be other things besides besides that and looking at what are our best practices what schools Across the Nation middle schools get they keep those kids from Elementary in their neighborhood School

[00:43:00]
what did they do do schools middle schools that keep the 6th graders more as elementary students like Corrales is going to are those kids those schools do they keep them I mean that would be interesting to ask that question I know there are other schools I know when my children went to you know didn't go to the traditional Public School in our neighborhood how they did it is they like slowly made him into real middle schoolers so it was like they had I think it was like their English and history teacher or something where the same like core it was the same person so they only ended up having basically two teachers so the science and math it was one teacher and then obviously to go to PE and things like that like does that work and with that help keep those middle schoolers in our schools and absolutely I mean I think transitions are difficult to begin with

[00:44:00]
fear of the unknown whether its safety or anything else just getting to know new situations and new adults new students coming together for the first time it is a time of of anxiety and as parents you know wanting to make sure that your child can navigate that so I think it's up to us to create those situations where we are providing that students can and families can enter the school and Associate themselves with it and learn about it and feel like they can be a part of our schools and that it's their exciting places to be where our teachers are excited to welcome them and and help them grow but I think we do need to create those conditions and those practices so that we can create a seamless transition versus the transition and we cross our fingers you know hopefully they have a good experience and if it costs money but it's

[00:45:00]
Reach for the Stars like let's look for what is going to highly impact our middle schools so that you know are our students and families are not opting out they're opting in and they're excited and so some of these things like I say it costs money but we need to start thinking about you know where are we where are we putting our dollars and and let's see if we do align it with our middle schools and creating robust exciting places for our kids then we're probably going to see outcomes in a few years and the doctor Segura do you all do you ask that question when they don't go to our APS schools is that question asked of them I know it's kind of hard once they're gone I think that is something that we have not

[00:46:00]
collected data on and maybe I'm wrong so if I'm incorrect please correct me those opportunities where kids they kind of choose to come back for registration I think there's missed opportunities where we can get the families at the end of the school year and the students to have those conversations to introduce and have the you know Middle School come and present to get the families and students aware and excited about where they're headed next so I think there are some missed opportunities not just an APS I think in many different places where you know middle school has has been that neglected piece and we're seeing the ramifications of that now but there are really great great teachers and things happening in our middle schools and we're not telling those stories enough and I think if we emphasize those and then like I said create those transitional opportunities for our students and families and teachers and staff

[00:47:00]
can you come together I think it will bridge that that level of fear of transition as well if we all are honest and we kind of look at our middle schools you know I look at John Adams looks like when I went to school in the 70s you know so it's like you know you find what you treasure and what's important and maybe we need to really think about that with our middle schoolers and I think in the most recent data we collected through the Strategic plan I think we heard very clearly that our students want more rigor and that they were kind of bored in some of their classes and so I think looking at that too in the Middle School level and how we can increase what is being asked of middle school students I think could also help in what we have heard from parents and from students I think the important thing is that we've heard from students that they want more in their classrooms and so

[00:48:00]
as we look at our Middle School classrooms I think as a district holding those classrooms accountable to what our students are asking for and making sure that the Middle School experience is not just fun but challenging to students and that they feel that I think would be a step in the right direction and recruiting and retaining our students write thank you so much this is this is Barbara I completely lost everyone for a little bit but I'm back on and I'm sorry I just the tail end of this conversation I'm really happy to hear about transitions because I think we're not intentional enough I mean I think about the number of chandelier students that are lost because they have the idea that they can't go to Wilson and I think if we did a lot more of that bridging so that they see the opportunities that will send

[00:49:00]
Ashford greatly diminished the number of students that we lie that we lose inside I do really appreciate that intentionality the one thing that I wanted to add is to caution against rigor doesn't just mean making it harder it really makes means making it more engaging and I think the more we work at listening to students for what they want and what they need and that means content not just not just expect that feeds their interests that opens up their curiosity so it's just I worry sometimes but rigor gets simplified and not enriched so thank you

[00:50:00]
okay I think that's it and we will move our next item for discussion is going to be the Johannes Early Childhood consolidation going to switch her emails up a little bit consolidation in general for 8 p.m. have a real high quality experience in pre-k that they're going to be more success

[00:51:00]
as they progressed through their the grade levels in elementary through secondary and that they're going to need less supports and intervention throughout that experience if we look at research from National Institute for Early Education research it states that they'll also have fewer instances or engagements with the justice system and have higher earnings as adults and so obviously we know we want that for every single one of our kids and then we also know that children who are coming from situations of poverty that they have the most to gain from these high quality Early Childhood experiences as well to help them be successful in school which then have the opportunity to strengthen their their Economic Security as well as their families and so as a district you know we look specifically at how

[00:52:00]
the ensure kindergarten Readiness as part of all of this right-sizing and looking at pre-k in general for APS how do we ensure that kindergartener kindergarten Readiness for every child is occurring in Albuquerque by age 5 universal access to Quality Pre-K providing robust comprehensive services to developmental preschool children providing wraparound services to those children and that is inclusive of collaborating with our Community Partners for before and after school and then recruiting retaining and preparing our Pre-K students when we look at that and how it fits into our goals and guardrails for the district we're looking for specifically at the percentage of third grade students which is our goal one and their levels of proficiency for reading for ELA

[00:53:00]
turn goal 1.1 which is the percentage of kindergarten students who are demonstrating Proficiency in the ELA summative assessment and guardrail 1 guardrails 1 and 2 not allowing the district to operate with an equitable distribution of school and or community-based wrap around and support systems as well as not allowing resources to be allocated in equitably looking at the Strategic plan one of our strategic priorities is responsive and coordinated coordinated systems so establishing clear District systems for managing resources and communicating and supporting schools and families in a way that authentically responds to our students needs that goes down to central office leaders aligning and designing a student-based budgeting process so that the schools can they can

[00:54:00]
find their Staffing allocations based upon student needs and not strictly on enrollment and then align district-wide expectations for programming within the design phase develop a recurring process and supportive guidance and tools to readily assess key factors and develop recommendation related to APS Financial sustainability due to student enrollment patterns building you said Etc and so when we look at the future of Early Childhood in APS we're looking at the repurposing of duranes Elementary in to An Early Childhood Center as a result of the closure of LA Zoo Elementary and the consolidation of pre-K and special Elementary as well as the inclusion of pre-K within the existing public education framework for the 2022 New Mexico Constitutional Amendment also AP

[00:55:00]
this early childhood is part of a comprehensive district-wide strategy is looking at leveraging federal funds for the repurposing of duranes Elementary into a universal Early Childhood Center as a pilot for possible future Early Childhood programmatic expansion we are looking at piloting this so we can create a model before we scale it I would now like to have the honor of introducing our new executive director of Early Childhood for APS Miss Allison gobblestone and then we also have with us Dr Melanie blea who oversees our special ed Pre-K programming and support so I'm going to turn it over to them and thank you both for being here and thank you so much Dr Sarah board members thank you for

[00:56:00]
I have to be here and part of this meeting this evening the next slide shows the representation of Early Childhood programs currently throughout the 4 Zanes so you can see that right there I think everybody got a large version a giant for nothing cuz it's kind of hard to see on a little tiny screen so you can see that we have Pre-K programs throughout the zones with there's more Pre-K programs in zones one and zone two and less Pre-K programs in Zone 3 and Zone 4 which is kind of what the information on the next slide shows the information on the next slide shows kind of how many New Mexico Pre-K classrooms we have throughout the district and how many developmental preschool classroom sites we have throughout the district there are approximately 10,403 and 4 year olds in Albuquerque Public Schools district Within

[00:57:00]
District boundaries that's how many 3 and 4 year olds have been identified in 2223 APS served around $2,163 and 4 year olds with the Mexico combined New Mexico Pre-K classrooms and developmental preschool classrooms so this is just to stop you real quick so I know these are ours these are our preschools but do you have or is there any way that you can find out like how many community-based programs are in each of the zones yes that's something I'm working on I am a lead director with the CNN Mentor director at work and so we are partnering I'm very much involved in partnering with the community based programs and the private best preschool programs and the City of Albuquerque programs so we are working on unifying our program so we can serve the most students as possible instead of competing with one another we want to work on uniting with one another okay

[00:58:00]
we got we have a database because their database is also a little bit incomplete because they are a new Department we did a Geo code from the from the day that they gave us preliminarily and it's about 365 that we know but Mrs don't come on and working with them comprehensively we'd like to bring to you what is actually a real manifestation of how many Community providers they are what we could see was about 3605 but we want to give you a proper kind of comprehensive Outlook and then validate that with a new Department of special education teachers are already in 68 of these community centers providing inkless

[00:59:00]
support so we already have existing relationships with at least 68 and that was only from this school year that doesn't include historically the relationships we've had whether students have qualified for special education or not okay you have any questions about this slide yes I have a question about long-term goals so this seems to imply there's a total Universe of students available that we could have and yet we also have the Pre-K which is which dictates the 50% should be in community-based settings so what given that like we could cut this 10,400 and a half but or we could establish goals over a certain number of years and I'm curious if you if you have goals like what do the enrollment Trends what could be enrollment Trends look like and yes we do have long-term goals because you

[01:00:00]
yes in the long-term goal so one of them so so starting with some short-term and Midterm goals given the universe of what we've got we've got and given the capacity of the community not just APS this is private providers this is a public providers everybody has to have hands on deck if we are going to be able to even have some kind of Dent into this kind of universe over the next five to 10 years and so in getting together a pilot of how we make it and not just a PS because I think if you look at the universe we're not even talking about 023 because that's part of that Universe we're not talking about before and after care

[01:01:00]
we have to absolutely look at what our partners are doing what they're capable of and in getting together a pilot and Miss Gabaldon will talk about the design committee that we'd like to bring all our prospective partners and the vested interests together so that we can have a technical discussion of what a center will look like and what the roads will be given the unfolding situation of the new Constitutional Amendment and does the rules get to be determined because this is it's it's it's it's it's it's kind of new territory here what kind of new territory down to the nearest apartment down to how many kids can be served and we had talked about

[01:02:00]
doing a session that's just going to be early childhood but hopefully we can have that later on after we have kind of call left with our partners and develop some kind of Matrix as to how we shall move forward because this is it's pretty difficult not even going into things like Staffing we have problems with Staffing with regular on DPC how are we going to create more stuff and all that so I don't know if you want to add on to that yes so I'm actively working with CNN and I was part of the committee that helps create the CNN alternative program for early childhood and so there is an alternative licensure Pathway to train more Early Childhood teachers and recruit more

[01:03:00]
play childhood teachers we're also working with CNN that a possibility for the duranes Hub is that it could be a practicum Center for Early Childhood teachers so the teachers could be doing their could have Mentor teachers at the site and be doing their practicums there at the site sorry I think an answer to your specific question about the goal I think that what Mr wooden was saying is that with we could very easily say okay so it's 10,000 so next year we're going to do 4000 in the next year 5000 but they really want to step back and meet with the providers and come up with the like Albuquerque goal for how many preschool students they're going to take in as a group rather than APS coming in and saying we're going to take 5,000 how are you guys going to give me the rest so instead the short-term and long-term goals are going to be made in collaboration with the Early Childhood Center committee that is in later in the and I don't know

[01:04:00]
I want to jump to that page what page is it did you get your question answers so we can just stick on this page so I'm not really I understand why we can't set goals yet and I agree that it makes sense to set the goals and collaboration with the Early Childhood community so that is good I do just sort of have an overall cart before the horse question is if we don't know what point on the horizon we're marching toward how do we get there so we can go into the rest of the details and continue on but I think in order for us as a collective board to make any decisions around financial investments particularly related to Duran's Capital changes I think we have to have a better sense of where we're headed so that's thank you for that because I think in addition to knowing where we're headed I need to understand where we are a side of just having the site because I understand the site here but there's a real distinction between us and a

[01:05:00]
so there has been historically yes there has been a big difference and e c e c d is has made some changes to education requirements of our private and Community providers such as all educational assistance need to be working towards an associate's degree and all teachers all teachers that are being funded by the New Mexico Pre-K Grant have to have at least a bachelor's degree that is for community and private school providers for school-based providers all teachers have to have a ped license of Early Childhood so that and that has and that's why that's what I said it's a part has been that we've always had to have that licensing requirement where the private school and Community sector programs have only had to be working towards a bachelor's degree but it's also in the practicality of how they're run right because

[01:06:00]
ours currently run what a school schedule there's no before and after some sites do have before and after school care it just depends I'm working on I'm working with her before and after school providers right now when I was the principal at Kirtland I was working with our on-site before and after school provider to get her license changed so that she could provide before and after school wrap around services for students starting at 4 years old because the before and after school license is for 5 to 12 years old and so we're working with ecd and understanding that school doesn't start at 5 years old anymore school starts at 4 years old for any of our sites that have Pre-K programs so that is something that we're working on traditionally the wraparound Services could only serve students from 5 to 12 years old because before five years old was considered like Child Care Program and there was different regulations that had to be followed in order to get that license so

[01:07:00]
and this is you know in alignment with board member Gonzalez's question so really is our vision to go to 3 and 4 so our vision right now our vision right now is to partner with our community programs and we're focusing on making the best 4 year old program that we have right so we're focusing on making the best for your program that we have to get our children ready and to be successful in kindergarten and throughout their educational career Without You Public Schools many of our community programs are wanting to focus on 3 year olds so we want to partner with them right and Albuquerque we don't have to be we don't have to be the one stop shop for everything right we need to partner with our community programs and we need to see what everybody's drinks are and it might be easier for such as the City of Albuquerque or Community programs to service those three or Head Start ydi to service the three year olds and for us to focus on the 4-year olds so I think that's something that

[01:08:00]
we really need to partner with that's why we want to develop this committee and really partner with our community to see what can we do as a community to service all of the students all the three and four year old students in Albuquerque I think if we start focusing on oh we want to do 3-year olds oh we want to do infant toddler oh we want to do before birth right we're cutting ourselves we're putting ourselves too thin right let's get really good for your Olds right and then we can decide what we want to do from there besides I'm sorry Dr Blair but we also of course serve our three and four and five year olds with special education students yes okay I don't know if member Peterson is on there or she we lost her maybe we lost her so again just to Circle back so the majority of our programs do not have before and after it's just strictly just a 4 year old program that runs a school schedule so

[01:09:00]
7:30 a.m. at 7:35 and and it ends right at 3:00 so our Pre-K programs are 6 1/2 hour instructional days and that is per the instructional requirement of the eccd in order to get the New Mexico so it seems to me like family said have chosen us for this I mean I'm thinking of just some of the families that I know I mean they're not ready for their 4 year old to be you know they're still close to the family so they're and there's capacity for them to like make sure they're just there for that six and a half hour day because they want to go somewhere you know they go either Grandma's house so they go

[01:10:00]
play songs but I'm curious about the number of families that we have here that are actually enrolling in something after that because they you know because school gets out and they still have to go somewhere else so have we surveyed our families so I think we are in the process of doing that I know from my experience as a school principal many of my Pre-K students got picked up by their family members at the end of the day we had probably about maybe 15 20% that went to an after school program like La Petite or you know Little Flower daycare that we that came and picked up students from our school school and took them to their site until 6 p.m. when Mom and Dad could pick them up afterwards so it's not as expensive if I mean speak a little bit on the short-term goal a lot of the short-term goals in early childhood specifically around special order inclusive practices but

[01:11:00]
I mean by that I think maybe to get to your point board member is that transportation for example right now we don't we're not there where we can transport students which can potentially be a barrier so when we look at inclusive practices it's not only can these students eat in the cafeteria with everybody else but can they ride the same bus because then that breaks down the barrier so a lot of it has to do with what can we do in special ed because that's a separate pot of funds we already do really well we pick students up from daycare how can we include Transportation or some other barriers moving forward to ensure that we can service and have a Quality quality A1 program for our 4 year old okay and also board members of Like doctor don't expose a little bit on the different Paradigm that's then now but this is the one the reason we showed you the the map was that if you look at the location of the existing programs it was based on an

[01:12:00]
ability kind of requirement which is now very different it was an eligibility requirement that was based mostly on income now we've done and when we get there in a few months and we really go deep into Early Childhood after we've we've had the committee with our partners and hopefully we shall present together with them at that time you shall see that the way the distribution of Early Childhood centers doesn't really reflect the population of available three and four year olds it's it's it's it's reflects where the eligibility profile matched with what was going on but most of the kids three and four year olds and Northwest and the Northeast and that's not where you find the center's right now and this is an issue that will

[01:13:00]
I have to be addressed by everybody not just APS for members I'm sorry I don't know if you can see Barbara Peterson has her hand up and Courtney Jackson has joined oh God okay question mark I'm curious since this is funded through ecd and we have to apply for funds through grants from them how are we sequencing that are we applying for a grant for funding for threes and fours just fours are we not sure the grand was due April 28th and we applied for Just 4 year olds we played for olds and we when I first came on as the senior director really childhood I surveyed some of our current Preschool teachers and our current

[01:14:00]
Google teachers are not open at this time to possibly serving 3 year olds and they are kind of terrified of changing diapers right and then you and their thought processes we want to teach Pre-K not necessarily we don't want to do daycare right and so I understand that and so that's that's one of the reasons why we didn't apply for the three and four year old Grant this year is because we really want to focus on that four year old population and really liked like Casino had pointed out we want to retain our teachers right I don't want to say oh now all of our programs are three and four year olds and scare some of our teachers off that we want to make sure that we retain and we have we want to make sure we have high quality 4 year old programs okay so our grant so our grant just so our grant is due every year every year the grant is due it's usually released like March 31st and then it's usually

[01:15:00]
set timer for the end of April and so as a planning committee on this early childhood planning committee in the planning process and cuz you can speak more to this but the planning process for the next year starts like in September where we sit down and we talk about what what next year we might apply for three reasons for us but for this year we're already funded just for 4 exactly exactly yes okay remember Peterson go ahead and just going to say I really appreciate the thoughtfulness of the steps were taking to get this in place there are lots of challenges and I think the you know just like with their others

[01:16:00]
schedule and so how we go about meeting the needs for these younger children also is going to be really critical to make sure they have affordable and safe places before and after school but I think I think we can do it I think we can find the partners to make it really successful so I you know somehow and some of the debate around this week I think we've lost sight sometimes of the fact that over and over again we hear that one of the huge obstacles for our students is the lack of preschool and the in a lot of the studies have been done the reason why so many that Foundation of language in enriching experiences so I just feel like we

[01:17:00]
how important it is to pursue this goal and I really appreciate the work that's being done and the inclusion of some people who who really understand what good early childhood programs are and really look forward to having that conversation continue so thank you thank you remember Jackson go ahead I didn't have any questions are and what the enrollment is what's the capacity okay we are currently funded for $1,365 students however

[01:18:00]
that number also includes the three charter schools that we are that are under under our umbrella for providing New Mexico Pre-K as well so our total enrollment could be that 12:12 that can be our total enrollment piece for New Mexico Pre-K okay here we go for Special Ed Sheeran developmental preschool we run two sessions a day two half-day sessions so the total capacity is 16 for a given teacher so for example if you look at Colette Park there's a number 10 there which means that we had room for an additional 10 students should they qualify however we had to open a second program at that site because of the need so I mean obviously with special ed if the need is there then we open up the classroom

[01:19:00]
we have to stop but there are four different locations on this map where we had to actually open up additional programs so even though there are vacancies do keep that in mind and so we're licensed for the capacity or it doesn't matter just whatever and the special outside it's it's whatever the IEP and it's also does not include social communication classrooms okay we do have several of those throughout the district and these are also funded through other special education classrooms funded on the special Federal side okay so I have stuff all over the place so you said the enrollment was for pre-k was 1,212 correct and then the enrollment for DPC was 4179 and then I kind of got whatever the IEP says

[01:20:00]
so when I'm looking at those numbers where did the number 2160 come from that APS served 2160 students so where did that number come from cuz those don't doesn't add up but that also includes the charter schools so they have that many of the three Charter Schools okay and so and maybe you will get me this later but so we serve 2163 and 4 year olds so you will be able to give an idea about how many of these students were served by private religious home Etc you'll be able to get the number of students that were served in a 3440

[01:21:00]
okay and then I know that you said that you may use CNM students at this that that's something in your thought process to bring them into this Development Center but if we have enrollment going down at CNM is that really even like something that might be practical I think it is I think it's practical because C&M Mentor Network is continuously looking for their students their continuously recruiting for sites to have to help Mentor their students for practicum additionally of Allison's part of the CNN cohort I'm part of the Hep with UNM and we do work on placing residents in Early Childhood Center and then with the residency funding that came through with the legislature that there is room for that to go as well okay

[01:22:00]
so I know excuse me I'm losing my voice so was APS was already fully funded fully awarded funds already for this year okay so for this past year did you have to revert any funds back to the state because of the vacancies and no we did not have to revert any funds back to the state we were able to use all of the funds okay and how were you able to do that so we were able to use funds and so the the funds are per student but they also go to the go to the school and the cost of running the Early Childhood Program so we were able to use our funds we should know I shouldn't specifically said that we didn't have to return any funds but we should know by the end of this month if we are going to return funds back to any funds back to because the the cost of the teachers salaries and everything not

[01:23:00]
everything has come through through fruition yet and so we may end up having to revert some funds back to eccd but we won't know that until the end of this month and typically about how much is it per vacancy what's the dollar number the dollar number per vacancy so that you may have to revert I mean if there is that number well it depends on because just because there was a vacancy we still had to provide a teacher right so we still had to pay for the teacher salary and we still had to pay for the EA salary and we still had to pay for all the supplies of the classroom and we still had to pay for all the materials of the classroom so I don't really think you could say I mean e c e c d says that we should be giving you know we should be allocating 200 dollars for materials and supplies per student but that but yeah it's not exactly it's not funded exactly we do receive a per student allocation from eccd but that money goes you know

[01:24:00]
it goes towards many things besides just each student so I mean this is just like what I understand is that when it comes to many of the when it comes to private providers that if they don't they're not allowed to expand if they don't have the numbers so is that different for APS that you can expand even though you have all these vacancies because that's not what happens in the private sector that's not necessarily true every single program private or School base we have to apply to open another classroom right and so we have to and not it's not really based on all of the vacancies but if you have the room to grow right and also the room of the community the population of the community there's many factors that go into saying we want to open another classroom right not just saying oh we have a wait list but that is one thing that we are working on

[01:25:00]
I think in the past with Early Childhood we didn't have unified communication with our private schools and our community programs so we weren't able to say hey APS still has vacancies at this site is your site full please refer them to us so that is something in my involvement with the Early Childhood directors Network through CNM is really working on getting unified waiting lists so that we can we can work together so if we don't if we are full at Dennis Chavez but there is a you know Community Provider by Dennis Chavez that still has 10 spots open we can refer to that Community provider so that is something that we are really working on is that UniFi unification of communication between all of these programs so that we don't have vacancies in the future

[01:26:00]
the definition of vacancies especially with DPC and how this is related to IEP so it might not look like a vacancy but there's certain spots they have to keep depending on prospective IEP so she can go ahead so then it basically is that a lot of this is not awarded on the numbers it might be awarded based on anticipation of these students having an IEP so it's in anticipation well I just I want to make be very clear that the DPC part that's federal funds so that's completely separate and those that money comes with the students IEP and and just like a shoe you want it you know a growing student or growing kid with the shoes you want them to have room to grow we want vacancies if we don't have vacancies we have a problem at the students are qualifying so I'll give you another example hodgin down here has 10 seats so that's

[01:27:00]
is there DPC setting that's correct they had room to grow and have 10 students qualify for an IEP however in their SCS classroom which isn't here they were at 150% capacity so when we don't have room to grow we we do run into problems and it does it's hinder our ability to service our students so you want a good number of vacancies and also just keep in mind that each DPC program has the capacity for 16 students so you're you're looking at I think everywhere except for maybe one school that's one teacher with with Google room and you can kind of imagine if you have multiple classes that's two to three students in each class so it it may look really on the specialist side but that's really almost ideal for where you want it and Dr Blair the DPC program is different in enrollment for timing is it that they can enroll throughout the you have a vacancy throughout the school year

[01:28:00]
special ed vacancies have to be kept open throughout the year because students can qualify at any time throughout the year through childline and in New Mexico Pre-K students they need to return for by September 1st they have to turn 4 by September 4th 1st in order to be enrolled in New Mexico Pre-K right okay but still what I what I understand is when it comes to this Pre-K grant that every child is funded at 7000 per child but it has increased it has increased what is it now 3300 per student we received in and is that for this year this upcoming year does 10,300 per Pre-K student so we were awarded 14 million 500,000 for next school year and so that 14 million how many students do you need them so we were funded for

[01:29:00]
365 students and that includes the students that are at the charter school so you're just funded for 1,365 so that's the number that you gave that you gave earlier including inclusive of the charter schools so that is we are able to serve those students right now in the preschools that we currently have okay so then my question is if we can already serve these students and then the there's a private providers why do we need to really create an early childhood site at Duran's knowing that in the whole entire North Valley there are about you know there's probably 5000 that live in the entire North Valley that are under five that means probably about 100 of them or

[01:30:00]
exactly that way but we're going to say there's about a hundred now of those half of them according to the Early Childhood act they have to go to a different you know they have to go to a different school private provider religious Etc so we are talking about spending money for maybe 50 Children out of school so board member Miller are gone as we go through the presentation for Joanna specifically due to the closure of la Luz moving to MacArthur and consolidating those programs because of the because of la Luz MacArthur cochini we have Consolidated programs to Joanna's which then involves even though we're not adding more as a district we're consolidating programs in the North Valley particularly the involves the need to look at Duran's as rebuilding it for

[01:31:00]
play Early Childhood site with the current classrooms we have in the North Valley when in Zone 3 if you see on the vacancy we only have one vacancy open for pre-K in Zone 3 which is primarily the northwest side and the North Valley so Los Ranchos is the only School currently that had room for one student in that area so as we go through the proposal it's to look at how we can retrofit duranes to for the consolidation of the current programs that are at Darkness you want to go over there okay just tell me a little bit say it again so I can get those numbers in my head so I think

[01:32:00]
Alex on you had the number of programs that we're moving to the Dallas the already going to be there yes so this next school year we will have four DPC programs at duranes to New Mexico Pre-K and one Zuni immersion pre-k program at Duran's okay and that's just the DPC that's not just the regular Pre-K so you're talking about just the DPC right now or you're talking about both four of the classes would be DPC so they're doubling have okays and then what other schools that was 12:00 so I'm just trying to put all those numbers correct together and just try to figure you know figure that figure that out it just seems that we're trying to do

[01:33:00]
do something where we don't that we have vacancies that we can't I just don't know how you think we're going to draw these children currently in currently at Joanna's their pre-k program they had one New Mexico pre-k program this year and it was full as you can see in the Zone 3 here that was at MacArthur and we're moving it to duranes right and so that was already full and so the students that would have been rolled at MacArthur for pre-k will now be enrolling in that second classroom at Durant's and then we have the four DPC classes because there was already two DPC classes at Durant's and the two from La Luz are moving to duranes so we're not adding any more classes we're just moving we're kind of shuffling

[01:34:00]
and moving programs from one site to another to consolidate and the duty program and the Zuni yes thank you and the Zuni immersion program that program is being funded by Indian education so on can you tell me I'm assuming that there's like waitlist because I know people that try to get their kids into a certain school and they had to preschool and had to go somewhere they had to go somewhere else like I know that so can you tell me what the wait list look like so I can tell you that we have compiled this is the first year that APS has been able to compile all of the wait list from every single school so before all of the clerks went on summer break we asked them to send Early Childhood Department their wait list and we do have a document that has every single schools wait list I think there was only maybe three that we didn't hear from but all of the school

[01:35:00]
all the other school sites we have their wait list and one document so we can go and and we've linked their wait list this one document so yes we can go back and see which schools are still open and which schools are filling up so that we can go into the into the Pre-K registration queue and we can let parents know that a school that they may have requested is full but these other schools have space and so that's how we're hoping to fill up those vacancies this year is by having because this is the first time all schools have been required to turn their weightless in or their registration list into one site so you can you can pass that information on to onto the board yes definitely to see that so you anticipate that you will end up having hundreds in that they're just not they're not no matter what you say they are not there and our population

[01:36:00]
Albuquerque is just going down and it has from last year from 2020 to 21 from 21 to 22 I anticipate the same thing is going to happen this summer as well to fill in New Mexico Pre-K sight at duranes we only need 15 New Mexico Pre-K students because several of our spots are allocated for inclusion right several of our spots we partnered with special education and several of so not every single classroom in APS can go to the full 20 is not funny because we do the inclusion so to fund a second classroom at Doris we only need 15 students so I understand there's not 100 of students we know waiting to be enrolled but I'm pretty positive there's at least 15 because somewhere in here I saw that 300 it's going to accommodate up to 300 students so I'm just assuming if you wanted to accom

[01:37:00]
play 300 students that you're going to build it that way and then you're going to have it not be at anywhere near capacity the same as what Durant is right now so board member Peggy Miller Oregon so in terms of and this is why we need to move to the design function form is determined by function and you're right in terms of what we design and what we build a building for is determined by the need out there by the technical need and so in moving forward and starting to lay down all these parameters given that going down the next few years we're going to have a much bigger Universe in terms of available kids who will be eligible based on the

[01:38:00]
new rules for Early Childhood not just for us but for early providers for all the other providers we have to anticipate that we need to design something and build something to be ready and not let students I mean your District as you know was part of this where for a while we didn't build schools because and we waited and waited until schools were 120 140 % about capacity before we were just catching up in your District in spite of the downside in population so this is the same kind of philosophy we are doing using Duran as a pilot but also this being precipitated with the downsizing and maximizing efficiency in terms of how we use our existing Facilities Salem

[01:39:00]
build some nice affordable housing that we know we need desperately get some developers to go in there and do do something that will help house some of our people that can't find affordable housing so then some of the other questions I I have is how much will this we have an election coming up and as some of you already know that we had some special elections and some of the districts and their military and some of these I mean it just didn't and we want to make sure that ours does so we need to be thinking about that when we're trying to spend money where we have less population and we have less children so we have to keep that in mind how much do you and I know you can't give me

[01:40:00]
total figure because I know things go up and down supply chain the cost of Labor how much do you think it will cost to build this Early Childhood Center so going back this is let me start off with how this is anticipated to be funded this is an opportunity using Federal SF funds that if we don't tie them down by the end of by the Fall we're going to lose them so it's an opportunity to leverage federal funds that way we don't have to go and really charge our what is essentially a pilot but at the same time it is an opportunity that if we don't do this with the S5 phones we're going to lose them and in terms of what you're talking about the refurb

[01:41:00]
meaning of this particular school we have we already have an approval of 3 million in Essa to design and start construction not only of the Early Childhood Center but the reverberation of what we've done with right size and because as kids move from Uranus K through five they're going to move to coaching and the other neighboring school next to it so we need to add classrooms and and make sure that they have Equity at those two schools and Mark Arthur in absorbing absorbing the almost 100 kids that were over at Lowe's will need a little bit of work in terms of refurbishing so we have been approved for free

[01:42:00]
what's the meaning of construction and we are also in the process of being approved for up to 30 million to do the construction of not only duranes but the refurbishment of these are the three schools so when I'm just thinking about everything that our schools need right now and HVAC that don't work safety concerns that we have I mean just so many things that are schools need right now this is an allowable expense for us I'm assuming that it is an allowable expense but is it an expense that we should take on instead of some of the other things that are really important to the community

[01:43:00]
we have maximized Estefan's I think it's up to 70° and all these other needs this was an opportunity given with an essay to improve not only classrooms equity and early childhood that was within us so we expanded our leveraging of existing SF funds while they're still available so we're trying to do all those other things too well I mean I mean we all know about you know the laws of learning and that's what we should be like really focusing you know honestly focusing on making sure our kids get the enrichment that they need and that get caught up as much as they can rather than doing something like this and I will just kind of

[01:44:00]
back to I think it was I think it was in no I'm not going to find it when you were talking about I think it was the goal 1.1 I think Dr Segura you were talking about right and if I knew the interim goal and of course I'm not going to find it now okay so you're talking about the percentage of kindergarten students identified in the USA Martinez who demonstrate grade level proficiency so that was you know put out here that is talking about getting our kids where they need to be this is not talking building this is not talking about this interim goal and what this goal to me says is it says you know

[01:45:00]
make things make kindergarten better which is something that I've always been for and that we haven't done we tried you know kindergarten Readiness they're not ready they're not ready to read we tried that with all day kindergarten so something happened and we're not making kindergarten be what it's supposed to be and that's where our focus should be making sure they have the best academic outcomes a possibly can and I know that you did say Miss Gallant that you're not moving toward three year olds and but then I keep hearing this you know birth you know starting at Birth which scares me scares me to death and I mean that is just all of that is concerning because we're looking at how did head start work out that's everything that they were supposed to be doing so you want to do something that hasn't really it just hasn't worked so we have to do something to make what we

[01:46:00]
I have just better make the preschool that we have make it better make kindergarten better you don't have to build a school and spend millions of dollars to try to make that learning that teaching and learning in the classroom better and that's just that's just what I think and that's what people out there saying and I'm we have not got to hear from our early childhood providers I don't want them here I mean we don't want to close a bunch of businesses down so I've spoken to our several of our early childhood providers and ecec D had a session where we got to work together on the grant as the community so I sat down and I asked our community providers what is preventing you from adding another Pre-K classroom and they said space they said we can't we can't we are having trouble finding space and there was one Community provider who said

[01:47:00]
Allison I'm thinking about changing my warming kitchen into a classroom so I can get more kids in here right so then that's what they told me their personal challenges because e c e c d does not fund buildings they did not find space and so that was the biggest they told me that that was their biggest challenge was finding the space to expand their programs and we can just say that all of these 365 I think that was the number that I heard providers right I think that was the number that they're just going to be they're all okay with this and that they think their business is going to be just fine I think if we work in conjunction with them instead of instead of competing with them I think if we work in conjunction with them and show them look at their so many children out there that need to be served we are only serving a very small percentage of those and if we can work together and get a functional system to where

[01:48:00]
it can be referring to each other I think we can serve more children and I also agree with you on board member Mueller Aragon we need to have high quality child Early Childhood programs and that is definitely a focus of ours is having high quality Early Childhood programs but I also think having high quality facilities helps us have high quality Early Childhood programs so I think that's something to consider too when we're talking about this taranis consolidation and I think I'm just for clarification on the discussion on Durant is we're talking about the proposal for Durant is to consolidate the current programs that we have in the area to maximize what we've been doing with right sizing so this particular proposal that we're discussing tonight is looking at how we consolidate this the programs that we currently have in best utilize the space that we have for example with moving how can we cons

[01:49:00]
play Joanna's which already has a lot of Early Childhood can we consolidate all of the classrooms there and when we talked about yassi Martinez specifically we're talking about how can we maximize the DPC classrooms that we have in that space and the Zuni immersion program that we have and make sure that they're not in classrooms that are makeshift Early Childhood spaces but maximize by leveraging these funds that we have at the time to leverage them to create the space at Duran's as a consolidation site for Early Childhood for this particular proposal because I'm mostly speaking to that is just wondering looking at all these schools are those classrooms equipped for three year olds or four year olds I mean are they truly is infrastructure for that group of children anyway I mean I'm just thinking about some at schools I've taught at and they don't look like and good learning still

[01:50:00]
I don't think it's all about exactly what that classroom looks like but I'm just wondering how many of those classrooms really are equipped to house three and four year olds and that may be money would be well used to make sure those classrooms that we already have are up-to-date and build the way they should be for 3 and 4 year olds and understanding your question that's actually exactly what we're going to try and do with Duran's make sure that all the classrooms and it's not just classroom its equipment its playground so with this new Constitutional Amendment that is requirements that require which is which is why the Early Childhood providers are kind of a lot of people are actually struggling to provide spaces they won't give you money just for any old space

[01:51:00]
specific requirements of what those spaces will look like what the playground will look like what the teachers need to get paid what equipment you need to have and this is what our initiative on this is all about Madam as a point of order I know I started off the questions with the when we were on the enrollment part just question about goals but looking ahead it does look like a lot of the answers to the questions that we are peppering the group with are coming up so I'm wondering if just in terms of process we could just go back to the presentation and then do the questions after that you can go on to the next page or next flight number just so you are aware okay go ahead excuse me is another point of order I just have a question about committee members versus not committee members are not committee members allowed to ask questions I was under the impression that

[01:52:00]
the word designated as committee so I we designated committee and it's only the committee members that is the word Discussion Group they can send their questions to us so that's how it is yes I'm sorry remember Dominguez that's fine I'll send you my question I also agree we just need to go through the thing because I think we've missed the the presentation which really was telling us the gist of why this consolidation and this pilot and what it's going to look like because it is also a new it's a new time in terms of New Mexico with regard to early childhood and I mean that was the point of ecd and the work that they're doing so and I know that other school districts are also engaged this at a national level so I think I also would like to hear the rest of the presentation and we can go from there okay thank you

[01:53:00]
proposed site is to repurpose duranes Elementary School and retrofitted to it into an Early Childhood Center that may accommodate up to 300 students this may include what we call a keto Parts wraparound services and the design of which has been funded with SF funds call GT Elementary as related to this will receive a new class from block to include 5 new classrooms of which three will be generally educational educational facilities including Administration cafeteria Kitchen menu and classrooms next page please

[01:54:00]
so early childhood facility needs a similar but not concurrent and that's what I mean is Peggy Miller Aragon was alluding to earlier not concurrent with existing kindergarten standards which exists and formed the basis of what is there at our existing Elementary School sites which is why we need to recalibrate and redesign what we're talking about for Early Childhood Early Childhood needs more intensive than the first to 12th grade just in terms of design in terms of space in terms of specialty as a result as you just reminding the committee the reporting of love and with existing students being observed

[01:55:00]
mostly into MacArthur and duranes MacArthur for the K5 students to run it for the Early Childhood students and also as a result of right-sizing the loose and MacArthur and duranes will have seven classrooms for the 2023 2024 years in terms of early childhood and so and then again going back coach Eddie Reginald Chavez the loose and MacArthur will be Consolidated at Duran is all the Early Childhood so next page and this just talks about loose Elementary in terms of what it meant in terms of to developmental preschool programs and then

[01:56:00]
play Mexico Pre-K classrooms and the extra programs of Zuni program that is Gabaldon alluded to and then basically what will happen eventually with the K through 5 a duranes will be moved to cochiti elementary school Reginald Chavez Elementary Schools next page please and Miss gobble so this brings us to determining what the space will actually look like a little bit about why the the groups that are there in the design community so we have we're putting together an APS early childhood

[01:57:00]
input from everybody right to make sure that what we are designing is beneficial for not just APS but for the community at large and so I'm on this committee we have a City of Albuquerque Early Childhood representative Bernalillo County early childhood representative UNM CNM to private community child provider Representatives a representative from ydi APS curriculum instruction APS special education APS Indian education and then APS facilities design and construction and then the aps Capital master plan we want this to be an extensive committee that really looks at what we're doing alright we want what we're doing to be successful and we want what we're doing to be embraced by the community at large so next page please

[01:58:00]
yes just like we did with the loose and we did with the other schools early in the right sizing we recommending to go through an administrative School attendance area change recommendation for duranes Reginald Chavez and cochiti so basically absorb all the Duran is K through 12 K through 5 sorry into Regional Travis and cold today and this so basically this change is going to affect a composition of the improvements not only in retrofitting not only a Duran and the next three pages we talked about what the numbers are

[01:59:00]
so you can see currently doing this is 191 students in the attendance boundary Regional chargers at 2:38 call Julius 232 and in the proposed attendance area Reginald Chavez will have 285 Call of Duty will have 3706 next page please and you can also see the percentages in which in terms of projections that we project will be in terms of attendance so you can see the current attendance is Elementary School page the current temperature outside

[02:00:00]
so these will be the proposed attendance area changes for Reginald Chavez Elementary and cochiti Elementary which will absorb the existing duranes Elementary School attendance area we have worked with the communities is the Bell who is not here anymore but we have been working with the communities to not only anticipate this but a lot of the community already go to these two schools they already go to Courtney and certain clusters of houses that are Jason to each School the changes are not going to be that dramatic because kids already go to the school store and then next page please

[02:01:00]
you can see no changes in the feeder schools except there will be a small area over here in terms of Washington Middle School so we we've tried to make this as least disruptive as possible when Mr Bell was working with the community one of the things that they had said was they wanted to make sure that the feeder pattern stayed the same so the students who would go to Reginald Chavez originally we had them jumping back over to Taylor and Valley and when she was working with the community they asked to stay with the feeder patterns so they would go to Reginald Chavez Washington and Albuquerque High as to stay in the theater period

[02:02:00]
you know Community comments that said they want to stay at Washington and if that could be made official and so that has been proposed in this and there is an area on the prior map of Joanna's and Coach D that actually a lot of students do transfer to coach City because they can actually walk to cochiti but they have to ride the bus when they go to Grandma's so that group of students would be able to not transfer and just attendee and be able to walk so next page so last page is just Links of Early Childhood additional materials on the research basically that talks about the LFC committee

[02:03:00]
finding SB 230 analysis and also the partnering of APS and cabq on Pre-K that existing right now a summary of the Constitutional Amendment that has changed the landscape and commentary on New Mexico first to guarantee a right to early childhood education and we we we we we we we we we thought these would be good information background just for the committee for the board to have in terms of what are the things that we are looking at as we are going forward and making these decisions and recommendations and you will get these electronically so that you can access them and with that question so

[02:04:00]
I mean what I'm hearing is that it sounds because what I also remember hearing from the community distinctly hearing from the community is not having our Pre-K with our regular school setting because there was the sphere of having our little 4 year olds in a setting where there was other kids going all the way to fifth grade so it sounds like we're creating this Hub which is an opportunity for us to really get really good at this really demonstrate it but it sounds like it's also an opportunity for the teachers that are in that setting to also have a network and there's there's this way to to also you know do the professional development do all those things and get to that point of high-quality what is this mean for us to be in this kind of a setting I really like that you're looking at a community where there's already

[02:05:00]
some Pre-K programs and we're going to consolidate that because part of the right sizing pieces pushing the K5 out but pulling in the the Pre-K into a spot and I do like that whole notion because it's we're using our Sr funds to also address all of these schools and all of this area so that we could figure out how this all comes together what I also appreciate is the committee that you've put together because we don't have the answers in terms of what that designs going to look like what does it mean for the private providers as a partner with us and this because it could be part of it I don't know what that's going to look like and it's like you're asking us to take this plunge with you and to take this risk with you I've heard that other districts have created these hubs and this is kind of what's Happening nationally and this is this is aps's step into that

[02:06:00]
killer Arena and I appreciate the thought that's gone until like we're going to start from this point and we're saying I also am concerned about like what's our vision and how we can get there cuz I remember the first time we had this committee meeting it was like we're going to open up here and up there and I hope you and we were all like what's the Hub and you know what are we doing so this gives us the opportunity how long so so we're going to start this and we're going to get all of our I'm assuming as the new director you'll come in you're going to set some goals and some things that you want to see and that will be reported out to us is that also going to be part of the designing and the strategy for like the next hubs as we move forward is that what is to inform us because this is going to cost us money to do that correct I mean it's going to cost us our funds to do that so that's my first question in the second question is some of this is all so being driven for us by ACDC who's making a

[02:07:00]
we need you to be engaged with us as a partner am I correct on that and what's the ask that ecec has of us so the ask beyond what we are already doing with AC so eccd would like APS to partner with them and grow our Early Childhood Program so we can serve more of the population that the community providers are unable to serve because of their space restrictions okay and so and and you as a director using this Hub what what would your timeline look like in terms of strategy and what do you thinking with coming forward to the board in terms of what we're going to because this is initial investment but definitely in terms of the technical timeline as we talk you know we would bring this design a proposal to the board

[02:08:00]
and I think June or July and then that will take around because it's a different kind of committee we have to get together and be on the timeline of the private providers and our other but that's for the big Vision okay you know we don't want to jump to the big Vision before we do that I mean I understand that part that we're using this as a way to sort of build out our vision going forward I'm just trying to get an idea of like when do we anticipate having this big vision for it because let me I'm going to talk out loud here because the reality is here is if we didn't do this we just have we're still need to consolidate these schools so we're just trying to figure out in the meantime can we make the best of what we're

[02:09:00]
I'm going to do with a building that we have at dudonis so that we can consolidate because we're going to take them out of their other schools that they're at and we're really literally going to move families to this to this Hub and and try out a hub period

[02:10:00]
Bulls we identified that need to be right sized they still need to be right size so this is a proposal for Durant is Right sizing thank you I don't have any other questions I have the Presidential Court of us started by sort of pointing back to some of the comments that we've received that there is a preference for students 4 year olds to be with in early childhood setting and its entirety so I think that perspective was represented by some of the Early Childhood providers I think to the contrary I think there are a lot of parents who would like their younger children to be in the same setting as their older children that was my situation and that's why my kids didn't go to Alvarado because they didn't have a Pre-K spot for us and so I get my question is as we're building these hubs we are all going to maintain pre-K in the other schools so yes okay so this is not a one-size-fits-all it's having just like we were talking about earlier options for families for K-12 this is options for families

[02:11:00]
my second question I don't know what the numbers are the aps Early Childhood Center design committee so looking at the committee I want to Echo the congrats and the appreciation for establishing a committee to make an informed these decisions I'm a little concerned around the number and proportion that are government officials so if I count there's 10 people who are related to APS City of Albuquerque Bernalillo County UNMC cetera and only three that are essentially non-government or real people so I'm curious if is there an opportunity to add more of that whether it's from n n a e y c or the child care Association or something else it just it feels a little bit scared towards government Franklin definitely I think we definitely could add more representatives from the community based programs and I could be talking and I can talk to providers who might want to be on the

[02:12:00]
the providers that my first question was can we expand it so there's like anime YC would represent because of collectively that early childhood Community I don't know that they're the right group but maybe someone from the child care Association I just think that Beyond actual providers who have a vested interest that they're ought to be a more Community voice represented so maybe parent organizations or something else so and then the second was how will you choose the two private slash Community Early Childhood provider Representatives so those Representatives have already been chosen one of those Representatives was nominated by board member Peterson she nominated one of the representatives the representative is from here and then the other representative from the private community

[02:13:00]
play childhood is another provider from explora is is also opening up a child care center and so the Explorer has expressed an interest in being part of our committee as well answer my questions for now thank you and I don't know if you remember Peterson I think she might be gone Peterson really no particular questions the Constitutional amendment to support preschools and

[02:14:00]
I think the community has spoken loud and clear that we need more options for good quality preschool so I am excited by the possibilities of moving forward of I think many districts around the country are working on figuring out the best design basing it on the best science knowledge of early childhood development that we have and it seems like we've got a good representation to move forward with that so thank you for the work that's getting done okay so then a question that I have is I know this is a pilot how long

[02:15:00]
send it to your pilot I have your pilot board member Mueller Aragon I don't know that this is a pilot with a time frame per se I think this is a pilot to to get it right before we even consider scaling out to other zones potentially and so I think when we maybe it's you know it's the wrong word to use pilot but it's not something that we're looking to establish and then it goes away more of a demonstration site prototype prototype there you go I like that that might be a different a different word to use so what would how would you know it was successful is it going to be driven by numbers like you have as many kids and that makes it successful

[02:16:00]
what would success look like I think this is going to provide us with a really interesting and exciting opportunity to try to HUB all of the educational you know components as well as the play and and all of that as well as the wraparound services so that it's all in one place and that they're working collaboratively as a complete wrap-around for Early Childhood Pre-K and you know that could be look differently than if some of our other just have Pre-K classrooms may not have some of those wraparound services that were looking to embed within the building so that it's right there to help support that program to grow we're funded in public numbers so yes and is important but I think this is an opportunity for us to

[02:17:00]
it right and and then look at our other programs you know look at Best Practices look at what you know we could do to create a model hub for Pre-K and what does that then look like going into kindergarten and how are we launching our kids into kindergarten by getting it right and looking at those wraparounds within the Hub okay so then I'm sure I'm not understanding you correctly so you think one of the important parts of this Hub would make sure that all those wraparound services are there so then are we saying that right now in the preschools in the schools they don't have the rapper on services that they need no not necessarily just not possibly to the magnitude that we you know could have in this model and I think you know will look at

[02:18:00]
last also by kindergarten Readiness and the outcome of students you know we can look comparatively at the different Pre-K sites to say you know did this work is this working I mean my hope is that all of our Pre-K classes are getting our kids kindergarten ready not just a hub and that there are wraparound services in our schools but our schools are serving maybe those wraparound services are serving all of the kids versus a focused level of student and they're not maybe part time at the school site and part-time at another School site so I think there's different things that we can look at and I'm just hope I think that we've made it very clear that our vision is to get all of our Pre-K Kids kindergarten ready so that they can be successful as they move forward in all the other grade levels I mean I would want

[02:19:00]
to know what kindergarten ready means because Kindergarten now is what first grade used to be and so what does that what does that mean looking at our early childhood observation tool as one metric and then also our kindergarten observation tool as another metric and then them going into the interim assessment that we that you know the state requires us to to do and looking at that date and saying where are gaps what are we seeing is it you know a student a specific learning Gap is it something that we're just missing that we need to relook at so I think there's multiple things but I think those are in my brain and are thinking about the Early Childhood observation tool the kindergarten observation tool and then there's there's the Early Learning guidelines which you know all of our program which is basically a standards for

[02:20:00]
Pre-K for all a Pre-K programs and for special ed there's the Early Childhood outcome assessment as well so when you look at all of these things and try and get them that gives you a pretty good sense of student progress okay and so how long do you think it would take to see this cuz it didn't work for all day kindergarten and yet we still didn't do the right thing and make kindergarten better and so now we're going to try something else to try to get them ready for kindergarten so then if that doesn't work when they're four then we're going to say we're going to have to have a 3 year old program to get them ready for preschool because that's what we keep on doing we keep on not making things better we keep doing the same thing and just adding another grade and adding more time and not figuring out what are we

[02:21:00]
doing alright yes I agree we have got to get it better across the board and every grade level and that is what I believe I'm committed to and I know that everyone at this table in our district is committed to making it better looking at what is working what are the strategies that you know some of these other states who are seeing some of those turnarounds what are they doing and what is a research showing does work and if we're not implementing some of those things why and and how do we get things to be like I said across the board you know a kindergarten classroom shouldn't really look much differently than one from another side of town we need to have some continuity of instruction of expectations of supports for our kids but we do I mean I think I'm looking you know just staring at this

[02:22:00]
are student outcomes don't change until adult Behavior changes and we have been through a pandemic and I'm saying we can't we can't use that as an excuse we have got to get going and like Dr Blakey stated our kids are hungry they're ready they're excited and they want to learn and it's up to us as adults to get it right and so I'm again I am looking at you know research how do we create strong foundations of literacy and numeracy with our kids starting in those Pre-K classes but it can't just be that there has to be the fun and the play and the interactions and the social emotional development coupled with that and so across the board I think we have a lot of very committed individuals who are ready to do this work and put things in place for for all of our kids I truly believe that maybe I'm too much of an optimist know it's good to be if we just do things

[02:23:00]
differently and do it right that's what we have to do the fact is there this isn't mandated so they have to go to kindergarten they don't have to go to preschool and I'm not for mandating anything like that cuz I think that's up to parents to decide that but we may have some of the children who really could use it you know could really use preschool that aren't going to come and how are we going to honestly know that those children that really need to are the ones that are there I think that is something we definitely need to look into but when I look back I remember the day that our kids moved on to kindergarten because it was like we didn't have to make another house payment so much money and I feel like even culturally as a family and like I'm

[02:24:00]
I'm speaking from from my experience I had my mom and Anna who wanted to take the kids teach them read to him do all this stuff some families their choices to leave the kids with Nana and that is is what they're able to do and that's what they want to do what's that so you know I think there's there's different reasons why I think we're you know I look at and they are you know excited and interested to see where how are we you know where are the kids going and how do we get families to invest in us not just APS but in early childhood in general you know because it does provide a strong foundation for our kids but we do have to get it right and I think that's just obviously you know that is just that is my concern yes that is taught

[02:25:00]
play my concern because I saw what happened I just saw what happened with kindergarten yeah more doesn't mean better I agree adding more hours and these kids will be in school the same amount of time as a kindergartener which I think is cruel in my opinion it's awful horrible thing to do to a 4-year-old and just because they have more time doesn't mean that that more time is going to equate to them being ready for kindergarten yeah and obviously you know we don't have the choice and how much time as a district but I think you do have our commitment to you know to get it right and to look and if something's not working to not be afraid to Pivot and to change and give more attention where there's where it's needed and so is transportation going to be provided because we always know that's an impediment at this time transportation is not provided for preschool students

[02:26:00]
okay the exception is stuffed with a nice with IEP it's not funded so for transportation remember we don't provide any operational funds to run our transportation department it's all on state reimbursement in the state doesn't reimburse for preschool students saying so we would have to fund it out of our operational that's a possibility then it would be a possibility if we were able to provide the resources internally to outfit the buses to to transport the students because they have to be in seats and we would have to hire drivers and then for this Early Childhood Center is it basically just going to be for that neighborhood so if you work downtown and you might want your child to go there Transportation with obviously be difficult

[02:27:00]
The Early Childhood centers are not bound by neighborhood addresses so they could if anybody is which is also kind of a nice location for Duran's because it is right off of the freeway so if somebody was working downtown and they found that was a convenience we have that right now even with the neighborhood sites you don't have to go to kindergarten when you go to preschool somewhere and a lot of families choose Pre-K specifically for being closer to a work site than a house and we see that a lot in our Pre-K classrooms right I mean I think that's what a lot of people do is like wherever if it's closer to work or it's on the way to work that's where they that's where they drop off so then basically I think I'll be my last question I have some other questions that got sent in a few weeks ago so if you all can answer those and then the ones that I did

[02:28:00]
is tonight and then do at I didn't see this but it said your consolidating Early Childhood classrooms from cochiti Regional Travelers and MacArthur will be Consolidated at Duran's does Regional Travis and MacArthur have Early Childhood classroom right now so they were not on that list or I'm missed him he has an Early Childhood Program once and what is listed on here okay and that's what I just made that like assumption because I was like well they're not on this list so it has to be from so I understand the only ones that were listening were the ones that have vacancies right not all of that 566 I think that's it

[02:29:00]
I just wanted to express appreciation to Dr Segura for your optimism cuz I agree I think this is a tremendously exciting opportunity for our community not just our school district but our entire community and in addition to this optimism we have Decades of Prior practice to model off of the Pre-K for all movement started in the early 2000s I think we know from all of that data what happens when we expand opportunities to families if you look at Oklahoma Georgia New Jersey some of the early states that established Pre-K for all they had to take up rates of up to the 78% rates so we can use some of that data to make some assumptions in our case we can look at some of the states that led with quality like Alabama and Tennessee versus quantity I won't name them but I think that there's some things that we can do to see and be really intentional and learn from past mistakes and so I think we have the right skill and will and optimism I'm really excited about that

[02:30:00]
and I think just from the perspective of the North Valley I also want to express appreciation to the district for all of the Outreach that you've done to that Community to the neighborhood associations to the schools and to parents individually have heard specifically from parents that they've been contacted individually proactively so just really appreciate that as well thank you okay so the next right-sizing Discussion Group will meet at 5:00 and the delayo mark room on it yet to be determined date and with that weird thank you everyone
