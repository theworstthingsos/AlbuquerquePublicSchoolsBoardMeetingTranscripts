==================================================

[00:00:00]
chairman Dominguez we are streaming good afternoon and welcome to the policy committee meeting I'd like to call this meeting to order Dr all right man I have a roll call please note vanilla store Courtney Johnson for consideration in action is to consider adoption of the July 7th

[00:01:00]
2025 policy committee meeting agenda may I have a motion and a second please I move that we can figure out something the July 7th 2025 policy committee meeting agenda board member benavidez I will remember having some audio issues I think so too but I think that was a request for a roll call so Ronaldo yes other than Evita our next

[00:02:00]
approval of the minutes from the policy committee meeting on February 3rd 2025 may I have a motion and a second please I will move to approve the minutes from the policy committee meeting on February 3rd 2025 this is number Jackson and I'll second member benefits may I have a roll call vote please yes let's see I'd like to ask for a motion in a second for a to consider recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy and to have a discussion about that I have a motion in a second

[00:03:00]
I move that we considered recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy this is board member benavidez in I will second Tom werito may I have a roll call vote please Dr Albright or discussion oh yes yes yes it's do I need to vote for discussion it's an action item so yes apparently okay could we have to have some directions and then we vote to either approve or deny recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy and anybody who differs from that can let me know

[00:04:00]
is to recommend the development of a new tribal consultation policy about okay but just just point of clarification if we if we vote on it now we are voting to recommend it to the full board and that means everybody agrees with that but if we if we discuss and there are people who differ then they might vote against recommending it to the board so if we vote now I mean I'm just trying to figure out what the

[00:05:00]
was your motion to move to discussion or recommend to move to discussion well it was considered recommending the development of the consultation policy because they're it doesn't say or make a motion to discuss so the way that I understand it is we make a motion second we discuss and then we vote on whatever it is we feel about the issue so I mean I suppose we could vote now without a discussion but somebody who is well-versed in Robert's Rules please chime in here yeah I know so Heather I think so you are correct that like we would you we would move we would second we would vote on your motion and if that motion

[00:06:00]
10 the recommendation for the policy fails okay but then but then there's no discussion but then there's no discussion right okay chair Dominguez how would you like to proceed no I think I'd like to hear a discussion because I it's lacking oftentimes among board members so we've made but we've already made a motion and we've had a second is that correct yes and and the motion was to consider recommending the development of a new consultation policy it'd be short and sweet if we just vote for that okay

[00:07:00]
but we can just move forward with however you like and I apologize I don't mean to hijack the meeting I apologize I think it's important to clarify that I mean we're not experts in in Robert's Rules and I think it's okay to suspend moving forward to get clarity so I appreciate your taking us through that Clarity I will open it up for discussion regardless of how the vote goes out to consider recommending the development of the new tribal consultation

[00:08:00]
play along with a discussion if necessary I hate to throw a king and things but I got out my Roberts will book and I think we do you can make a motion and second that then you can have discussion and then you can take the roll call vote so I apologize but I think you can have discussion the most importantly opens the agenda item for discussion discussion After You Go Ok Google necessary before discussion occurs you just need to make a motion in a second

[00:09:00]
where to open up the agenda for the discussion then you discuss that you vote and but here's my point if if the motion fails what would be the point of having a discussion your I believe and I think I believe I think if you make the motion and the second then you begin the discussion and then after the discussion you vote if you vote and it goes down you don't have a discussion one and if it doesn't get a second you don't have a discussion but if you just get the second and then you have the discussion you don't take the boat so if you take the boats then the discussion is over and the boat is done that's my understanding so if I'm trying to encourage

[00:10:00]
the discussion just so we can have questions and answers again in a second and then you open it up for discussion okay so we have a second so we are going to open it up for discussion then so anybody I think would I like to clarify is why this is on the table so in in June board member my journey around this topic goes way back to the first time I attended a national Indian Education Association conference and was schooled

[00:11:00]
about the school boards my obligation as a school board member to honor what was then termed a sovereign to Sovereign Nation relationships because I was an elected official and so I started in researching the second Naya conference I attended clarify that for me was his whole notion of tribal consultation once again came to the floor and I believe his name was he was this is terrible I don't remember his title but he worked with the US Department of Education in the Indian education department specifically Mr Julian and he and another policy analyst

[00:12:00]
along with Acting Superintendent of the Navajo Nation set me down for a conversation and scold me about the importance of tribal consultation policy coming from a school board and so I wrote a memo to everybody and I addressed concerns about my having voted in favor of a resolution called the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students and that was I think the intent of that resolution is still a good one but we left out our tribal leaders and that was a violation of tribal consultation

[00:13:00]
so ultimately I'd love to revisit that with our tribal leaders and the night forces with our Urban indigenous leaders and involved just passed away their net for participation and honor the law so that gets us to why the history behind this topic being on our action item so I'm hoping that there will be support for recommending the development of a new tribal consultation from the New Mexico office around accreditation

[00:14:00]
I spoke to help me with his last name board member tomari to were Vicky or is Vicky executive director Was Vicki who is working with assistant Secretary of Indian Head Katie and juanico they are in the final stages of clarifying some steps for the accreditation process and it will involve having a school board policy so I'm happy that we're a little bit ahead of the of the game to anything that I might have left out

[00:15:00]
especially with that the legislation passing that 30 million to through Indian head and through the Indian education Financial I forget the name of the exactly but tied to that and expressly if legislation pursues more money and gives money to tribes and to tribal education departments they're also looking at Indian education departments within our districts and so that are Indian Head program can apply for those money I think it's what 10 million dollars that they could was it was not that many million but they can apply for some of that money where to help benefit their programs but in order to do that there needs to be A needs assessment there needs to be the following through of accreditation with tribal consultation looking at Charter Schools

[00:16:00]
can we open a charter school in tribal lands we got a consult there's a whole process in how these conversations are going to have to open up and when we were at the government to government meeting many tribal leaders stated they not only want to meet with the superintendents but they also would love to meet with the school boards and to have those kind of conversations to so this is taking it up another level that we have not done before but I think with Katie and her Deputy the whole policy changes with some of the legislation and funding and money that's coming through they're trying to also make sure that we are following the requirements not only through federal law but what is it saying through the Indian Education Act so that's just a little touch base on what is occurring at the moments

[00:17:00]
so do the other board members have something I have a quick question and forgive me for not knowing this off the top of my head to Dominguez and maybe board member Jackson can chime in but do we already have a policy regarding this and if so what is the the letter number combination so I can look it up I do happen to know that and the the the the the procedural directive that we have right now is called p 29 and it is in direct alignment with the federal and state statutory obligations as set forth in the executive order as well as the New Mexico Indian Education Act that are all current current law and so I hope that answers your first

[00:18:00]
yes thank you and so I guess what we can do is review p 29 and look for what might be missing period which is an I believe it's an administrative policy and so you know there are already procedural directives and policies within Albuquerque Public Schools that align specifically with tribal consultation and do you mind if I jump in her real quick board member benefits

[00:19:00]
what kind of a point that aligns with this as well no of course not thank you I think one thing that is really giving me pause on this recommendation of a policy as a board policy is particularly the use of government to government relations the school board is not a government there is very specific language throughout all of those federal and state statutes that designate a local Education Agency as the entity dot sorry my daughter's calling me as the entity that is legally obligated to perform the consultation and this New Mexico statute particularly 22-5 -4 gives

[00:20:00]
the school district the designation of the local Education Agency and not the school board so given the fact that we be District by way of the superintendent already has procedural directives and policies in place it is really the obligation of the superintendent to be performing the the tribal consultations and the boards role is to maintain a government's position but it is not our legal obligation to perform the tribal consultations that is the superintendent's job the sorry there's another I have a few points that you absolutely the other point that the kind of goes with that is that in our governance manual infection 3B and a lot of the

[00:21:00]
the kind of the lead and talk to this is about potential policies or potential legal obligations that might be coming down the road but have not yet been implemented and according to our governance manual section 3B particularly number two and number three it says that it's actually the superintendent's responsibility to recommend policy for adoption when there is a statutory obligation so if it comes down the pike you know from Peg or through statute or through the legislature that there is going to be a requirement then that is something that we can revisit down the road but that would be the superintendents obligation and responsibility to recommend that to the board not the other way around and so I want to caution us from making policies when there isn't a legal

[00:22:00]
spell obligation to do so right now especially cuz we never know what's ultimately going to come out of the legislative sausage so that's my second point but I'll wait I'll step back for a second I'd like to respond to that we do in fact have a legal obligation and because of that we have a legal obligation it's just never been formalized and and I would in reading our in Reading IH 9 I think we have the potential for you know revisiting

[00:23:00]
this policy and strengthening it but it does say very clearly that the Board of Education Works to ensure educational opportunities but the Board of Education will Foster a Cooperative partnership with tribal leaders and what's very clear in the federal law and in this new resurrected conversation at the state level is that they want tribal leaders want to be talking to us the policy makers and that does fall under our governance duties you're correct that the implementation of those policies falls under the jurisdiction of the superintendent

[00:24:00]
but there is a role for the Board of Education to be part of the tribal consultation very directly and that's a two-way conversation as stated in the policy the Board of Ed will Foster a Cooperative partnership with tribal leaders and maintain a two-way communication with tribal governments whose jurisdictional boundaries include areas within the aps boundaries and of course out of that communication that two-way communication this Cooperative partnership will Foster an agreement between the tribes and APS engine education policies and procedures

[00:25:00]
as is the case with any policy so I would argue we still have an obligation and I think our current ped Secretary of State and the assistant Secretary of Indian education made it very clear that school boards had an obligation to State very clearly a tribal consultation relationship with tribal leaders that is the expectation so a couple of

[00:26:00]
in in The Indian in the IPP the reading further down the authority of conducting the tribal consultations is designated to the superintendent and so while that policy has Board of Education and the district further down in the policy the the duties the specific duties of consultation to initiate and conduct should be performed by the superintendent and the Superman there is already a procedural directive and a policy that outlines how that happens and so I just I want to caution again against policy proliferation when there are already policies and procedural directives that are active and

[00:27:00]
and I'm in effect in the other thing is is if we look at in our board manual in our government's manual for Section 4J are board policy and development we are we have stated that we will limit the adoption of our policies to those that are required by law and that are inappropriate exercise as it's defined by the boards adopted goals and guard rails and so Point number three is our responsibility is to implement policies that are in furtherance of improving student outcomes and so I believe that we are addressing from our from our role as an oversight and a governance position we are addressing the needs of our Native American students particularly through goals wine and goal too which are our policy

[00:28:00]
patience and so creating another policy that is outside of the student outcomes focused obligation or that are is not required by law is just policy proliferation when we already have those may I I just like to reiterate that while we do have I'm going to stay focused on on the policy and not the procedural directive because I feel that the procedural directive falls under the role of the administration what what is missing in in the current IH 9

[00:29:00]
you know we don't have to we don't have to create a new policy but I think this one definitely needs to be strengthened with some key language that needs what keeps getting repeated over and over again from the federal down to the state level is Meaningful to way communication needs to be meaningful it needs to be there are three words and I don't have my let's see it needs to be meaningful

[00:30:00]
play and I forget the 3rd but there's a word but this is required by you know Elsa every student whatever that happened legal obligation of the school board it's the legal obligation of the school district district is represented through the superintendent and the administrative side and we do have two weeks

[00:31:00]
it is what the law says the 22 - 5 - 4 say the local Education Agency is defined as the school district the school board is the governing body of the school of the district but is not the Leah itself in my discussions with people who are working with the first of all we do take Federal money and that law is very clear that the Ali-A includes the school board and the way the current Secretary of Education and the current assistant Secretary of Indian education is Translating that the Indian Education Act of New Mexico they are most

[00:32:00]
definitely including school boards so that is in fact it's going to be clearly stated that part of the accreditation process it in fact part of the accreditation process melts very directly with student outcomes there's a systems assessment and I do believe our our goals and guardrails are going to respect so I beg to differ with your interpretation of statutes and laws however I do take your point that we may not need to proliferate a new

[00:33:00]
we'll see but the one that we have now IH 9 definitely needs to be revised to adopt to adopt language that states that we will honor a tribal consultation process that we have yet to I mean the tribes need to be part of that in conjunction with the school board as to how we divide meaningful what was the second word I used timely and I'm forgetting the third two words in the language that appears over and over and over again

[00:34:00]
I'd like to hear from other members I have a comment chair Dominguez if you don't mind I would suggest that we moved to a vote so that we can hopefully if this passes we can get it on an agenda for a board meeting and we can hear from some of the leadership in our tribes in Pueblo who want to be a part of this and get their their input I think that would be very helpful I've not heard from before I take you up on moving forward and I think that it's one of the

[00:35:00]
is the the areas of not only yes there's Administration consultation but ours is going to be a little more different especially if we look at accreditation the needs assessment making sure that we follow through on that that needs assessment and reading that data and understanding what does that look like as we have these conversations with tribes but not necessarily based on the conversations that the superintendent would have I think that this is going to fall on the lines even of our community engagement and how do we initiate some of these concerns have a lot to say but nobody has really listened and I can only say that based on my own personal experience and working with an Indian Head not only in Denver Colorado and really and helping people understand that there has to be meaningful is the key

[00:36:00]
but I do agree with what Heather says we have to at least listen if we're if we're doing our whole you know our student outcome Focus governance and we want to hear those that are represented by Martinez and Yazzie it is the tribes and so I think we need to really consider how we do that so yes I agree with Heather and so I would just love to hear from Miss compost about what it is that the district is currently doing as far as two-way communication how the tribal consultations are going and I won't ask you to to give your two cents on whether or not a new policy needs to be adopted but we'll just kind of love to hear your thoughts on all of this

[00:37:00]
the good evening church Dominguez board members superintendent Blakey so I can just kind of give you a rundown right now of what APS is currently doing I also want to stress that just like anything else there's always room for improvement moving forward so we do have Tribal consultation once a semester normally mid-fall and then usually around March so we have the formal formal tribal consultation during those two times on there we have been moving forward in the last several years and we're going to be really continue moving forward having again I believe some of the conversation and I know speaking with our tribes is that yes those formal consultations are a great opportunity but we need to have more conversations just outside of those formal consultation pieces as well so

[00:38:00]
we always say we need to get together and then we never get together again so we need to kind of push that a little bit more so that is something I know our Equity Group in Indian education is looking to and to see where we can have more of I don't want to say informal because those are very important but I mean outside of those two consultation pieces as well so for instance I'll give you one example this summer are the Zuni Governor acting governor and Tribal Council invited myself and some of the Indian education department to go and just go chat with him on a Friday afternoon and so we spent about 3 hours just having a really good conversation about multiple things that we're currently doing that we're not doing and so that's one example that I know we want to push more

[00:39:00]
words is having more of those interactions going again not where everyone's coming to APS but we're going there instead of Pueblo is also having their wanting to have a meeting don't quote me on this I believe it's July 23rd so again a lot of those more kind of pieces of course we also have our monthly Indian parent committee meetings as well and that is kind of part of our federal funding that we have we have we have a parent and community group and so also what I'd want to say to in terms of our formal consultations is we have been here for 8 years and I know and I've been attending those for the past eight years and the message from our travel Community has been a consistent how do we kind of have again try to have a little more authentic conversation but knowing there's a kind of a formal structure I know the past couple years we have put out the

[00:40:00]
agenda prior to our tribes asking them what is it that you're wanting in this consultation so we're not getting you the agenda but we're asking you what do you want to hear from us who do you who do you want to hear from us and so that's where we have in the past several years of taking that lead from them and so if they said we want a presentation on Martinez Yazzie we want a presentation from our federal programs then those would be we could put out as well and again that's very open so an opportunity could also be if the board would like a presentation or a time during our tribal consultation if the tribal government say yes that's what we're wanting to do we can absolutely combine that into our current tribal consultation structure on there so I think again we're really wanting to create agendas in those formal meetings that are consistent with the tribes are asking us to provide them as well as in provide

[00:41:00]
Trinity's throughout the year just to have much more just again some more informal dialogue so and just having some of those what I call you know as a couple of woman myself just having it sitting down and just just talking and having some really good conversations and hearing each other out and moving forward from there so if if I didn't cover anything please please let me know if you have any questions on that thank you I do just have one question on that so of all of those you know items that you've listed that are already in the works are our board members allowed to attend to be able to participate in those engagement activities and to hear to have to participate in the two-way conversation yes absolutely and I think a good example of that was when we went to Navajo Nation in January

[00:42:00]
students who take classes do the Pledge of Allegiance for the council and we got to view not only to talk to the Navajo Nation president but his key staff because there was plans that we were trying to move forward on but everything shifted within the government and that's another thing is that when those shifts happen within the government we have to just sort of flow and do what's needed but there were some concerns that were mentioned with those Administration from Navajo Nation and I know they came out here but to see them within their community and to see our students performing there's also those other areas and how we can improve that you know if it wasn't for us going out there is Bored we would never see how do we improve the Navajo the language is within our schools how we can how can we make that because we got to even meet with some of the parents and they were telling us how great of a program that was

[00:43:00]
but this is how you can make it better you know so those kind of conversations were being had when we went out there January 27th which was a really great invite I have a question as well I'm on the policy side when you have Tribal consultation how often are they so for example when you have Tribal consultation in October of 2023 did tribes weigh in on the resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students the resolution and full disclosure I voted for it in retrospect that was an error on my part but did tribal leaders weigh in on

[00:44:00]
resolution to collaborate with Partners on improving outcomes for indigenous students to church Dominguez I would have to go back to those notes for 2023 I wouldn't have those technically right here but again what I would just emphasize again as we asked the tribal leaders to set the agenda so we take again we take their lead in what they want what they want us to present and who who they would like to meet with on there but I would have to go back to the 2023 minutes for that for about 2 years ago and this this I will tell you this came as a surprise because I mean what you ask is an appropriate question however we missed were we did not align

[00:45:00]
call the board with tribal leaders was they didn't even know that this was an existence and so how can they know to ask for something that they don't aren't aware of and so that's the point of connecting governance or the governance team here the school board with tribal leaders because that will Elevate the conversation so to speak to a policy level and help them understand how that policy gets implemented right gets expressed in the on the administrative side what you do and and so I just want to clarify that piece for

[00:46:00]
everybody but I'm going to go back and I need to disagree slightly because that resolution that was brought forth was brought forth through the Indian education department so right so it was done through them with the landing well maybe maybe there were some but I mean I think we need to be very careful about casting blame when maybe we as when maybe the there's only part of the information available so that was brought through the Indian education department and it was it was not Courtney and I can clarify that well so as I did my investigation and I don't mean to do that

[00:47:00]
I took full responsibility for I said I think the intent of this resolution was I'm behind it my concern is that we did not and and the evidence is in the language we never in this resolution do we have a role for tribal leaders separate from Urban leaders tribal leaders so again I'm not I'm not blaming as an example of a misstep and the need for connecting policy makers which would be the tribal leaders and school board and so board member could you repeat what you said earlier

[00:48:00]
louder please when I asked if we could move to a vote Yes I think that that's obviously your decision or the chair but I think that if everybody has said what they need to say and if I'm not sure if anybody else on the meeting would like to chime in with any information they have then I think that we could be ready to vote and move on because we have other things on the agenda I agree and so unless there's something new I would like to move forward with a I think it's appropriate to ask for a roll call vote now doctoral I have a clarification on the vote the original motion was to recommend the development of a new tribal consultation policy is that still the vote you're wishing to take I think

[00:49:00]
but that is allowable because of the discussion so would you like to make a friendly Amendment to the motion or would you accept the development of a tribal consultation we would remove new and I think that would help in light of IH 9:00 what about the revision of the tribal consultation

[00:50:00]
C or I mean I'm not sure what the goal is now yeah I'm not sure if I mean is that called a tribal consultation it just says I hate Indian education policy that and it mentions to wake communication but I you know I'm going to suggest that this is if we revise this is Jessica

[00:51:00]
if we can take the title of IH 9 and change the title to the tribal consultation policy or tribal consultation and engine education policy the policy committee can certainly recommend that the board the full board look at a change to the name to reflect priorities modification is the same situation you can you can request that the full board suggests that the policy committee make make a review and determine what needs changing or not so yes it's allowable but it requires full board permission I guess I'm I'm looking for language consider recommending a

[00:52:00]
review of impossible development of a new a new tribal consultation let's see a review I'm writing this down for you Heather consider recommending a review of IH 9 and possible revision or development of a new tribal consultation policy Madam chair I think it might need to be one of the other I think if you make the recommendation for a review for an additional separate policy if I'm not mistaken I think okay so here's what I'm going to suggest

[00:53:00]
I'm going to suggest that we recommend the development of a new tribal consultation policy we're going to leave it as is because it establishes what we're after is establishing the importance of the governance to governance aspect of the conversations happening in Santa Fe now I made this policy IH 9 states that we will Foster a Cooperative partnership that maintains two way communication with tribal governments etc etc the attached procedural directives is the tribal consult

[00:54:00]
so there is already a policy it's IH 9 that directs the superintendent to participate to facilitate and to initiate tribal consultation so essentially we already have a tribal consultation policy it's ih9 it might not be titled as such but it does direct the two-way communication so given again our governance structure of the board setting the policy and then passing it to the superintendent for the fostering and the development of that policy we have done that we have fulfilled Our obligation we have the policy we gave it to the superintendent attached to that policy is

[00:55:00]
29.10 is the day-to-day the step-by-step obligation of tribal consultation so I would like to say that we've we actually have the things that you are asking for already let me clarify because I finally found the language that is being used by tribal leaders and government officials that the expectation is that local education agencies and specifically School boards consult with Indian tribes and tribal organizations on issues that affect so this is a bigger umbrella issues that affect native students and that all governance

[00:56:00]
what's an educational policies that impact Native American children attending APS to include but not limited to resolutions initiatives memorandums of understanding judge operating operating understandings Etc would require the aps Board of education's approval and therefore in order to promote positive outcomes for Native American students the aps Board of Education would commit itself to engage in formal meaningful timely and effective tribal consultation with a list of the Navajo Nation the 19 Pueblo Apache Nations and other designs it would further clarify that the aps Board of Education would commit to engage in meaningful collaboration

[00:57:00]
done with the aps Indian education parent committee per state and federal law nothing in IH 9 addresses these new ideas and so let me guess it doesn't address them because they are not statutory so they are every Student Success section 8538 this is language that is embedded in that act and which is further supported at the state level so because of this language again I have not come to this

[00:58:00]
phone I have done so under the guidance of the Native American community and and at all levels at the at the federal level the state level and tribal level and so because this language is so distinct from what is an IH 9 I'm going to stick to consider recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy and so we are ready for a vote thank you for the clarification

[00:59:00]
and everybody to be prepared with their points and also for the community to chime in so I'm voting yes Courtney Jackson know because I believe it is our responsibility is a committee to make sure that we are only promoting and policies that are necessary and are within our oversight as far as governance is concerned in section 4J I also believe that the operational duties for this is left in the superintendent I believe that we should avoid policy proliferation and I believe that the requirements for tribal consultation are already listed in IH 9 in the IPP as well as in our government's manual infection 4D so no Ronaldo I will be voting yes

[01:00:00]
because Native Americans sitting on this board and really witnessing some of the things that have been occurring and also have brought up to leadership in the way we conduct our our consultations but I feel that we need to take it to another level so I think that one of honoring those relationships and because we do get money impact Aid we get back Johnson O'Malley we do a lot of a number of areas that we are not representing well and I do think that we have to create a voice within this policy that states that we are truly hearing a huge representation of Martinez and because of that specific lawsuit we do need to take a look at how we're conducting those matters with those communities that are those subgroups within that lawsuit and I agree with this thank you

[01:01:00]
Josefina Dominguez yes and so if we could have any roll call Vote or maybe we just did okay thank you so we will it moves forward with a recommendation only to the full board we move on to 4. 2 2 5

[01:02:00]
a new capital outlay policy and if we don't get a second I said okay so while the boards job is to have 50% volume

[01:03:00]
for approval of fiscal matters the Assurance of community engagement to address Community concerns that surface organically and and I'll use the November and December of 2024 example as the right sizing concerns that that bubbled up as an example ensuring the Integrity of contracts that will come before the board before we approve them and hearing to new statutes and laws that need to be addressed as we just talked about and with tribal consultation that is the other 50% of our job by Statute of our job to ensure not only the execution of laws but also and here's the critical piece

[01:04:00]
aligning the goals and the guard rails with the cascading priorities and processes of the administration I think it falls to us as a board to ensure that whatever is getting implemented on the administrative side aligns with I think we need to have vision statements vision and value statements in the gold I'm sorry in those policies so in this particular case it has to do with capital outlay which this is a this is a bond election year and so I think it is very timely that we should have a stated Vision around

[01:05:00]
what that's going to look like how we will honor our the values and the vision and the values that have been articulated in in our goals and and in our hope to execute those goals and guard rails and so that statement stands for both of the capital outlay policy and the charter school policy but I'm going to ask him or policy analyst to weigh in as to why this is a new capital outlay do we not have a capital outlay policy that addresses right sizing and the goals in the guard rails as we know them now Madam we don't have a specific Capital outlay policy however the boards budget policy directs the board to develop a budget that is in alignment with the goals

[01:06:00]
and that includes our Capital funding okay and so I guess what I'm recommending is that we be more explicit in light of what what we encountered well for two reasons what what we encountered over the right size is going to be with us forever weather consolidating repurposing or expanding at some point it's we're always going to have to address this topic and I think it's best if we have a vision statement that guides those decisions and so that's the backdrop

[01:07:00]
to to this request for consideration of recommending the development of a new capital outlay policy sure I'm not sure if you if that was a question for me but I can say that anything related to our Capital outlay including the capital master plan right-sizing all of those fall under our administrative procedures thank you I'd like to hear oh yes I think that the first thing that I want to stay very very clearly about the addition

[01:08:00]
broadcast to recommend this policy is that I respect wholeheartedly the role of the superintendent and her ability to maintain the procedures and delegate the operational side that we have asked her to do so this policy goes the recommendation from what I am seeing goes very into the line of management instead of governance Miss Martinez brought it up that we already have a budget policy and a few points to make about that budget policy is that the capital planning is already included in that budget policy that is a board policy in section the budget development section it does say that the

[01:09:00]
add there has to be evidence of resource allocation and how it aligns with the board schools and guardrails and the district strategic plan and that that must be included in our budget updates so there's already a requirement that it's let me get to you the phrase in in the action item there is already a requirement that we incorporate our student outcomes strategy and that's listed in our the budget policy the implementation of the capital master plan is an operational delegation it is not governance also in the budget management section of our budget policy it says that the boards oversight should not be interpreted to mean that the board manages budget implementation it says the responsibility is ultimately the superintendents so the capital master plan is already addressed

[01:10:00]
we already also according to the budget policy we already have we have oversight of major Capital expenditures again in the budget management section of that policy it says the board will approve all proposed District purchases and expenditures that exceed or are expected to exceed 500,000 so we already have authority over purchase approvals we have a finance committee and the finance committee is responsible for providing oversight on Capital planning in the finance committee section of our government's manual says the committee will make financial planning recommendations to the board and serve as an external monitoring committee on budget and other financial matters and then finally the budgeting approach that we have again established within the budget policy that we already have like I said before already embeds

[01:11:00]
in the budgeting approach section of that policy it says in support of the board's goals the budget will allocate resources to schools based on a community granted definition of student need so again I believe the recommendation to include a capital master plan policy is redundant it's false very clearly within administrative or operational it is not governance we already have a budget policy that addresses some of the issues that you are trying to address with the recommendation of this policy we have a capital master plan already that is a 5 year 5 year Rolling Capital master plan the bond resolution has already been approved and it was approved by the board it was brought to the full

[01:12:00]
and we just went through a policy diet exercise for the last 2 years period you were there when we had a capital master plan policy that we archived because we agreed that that was an administrative position job not a government job so we used to have that policy we don't anymore because we agreed that we were going to focus on student outcomes so we've already gone through the policy diet we've already done this work and we have a budget policy that aligns with wanting to focus on student outcomes which is admirable absolutely that's all I want to focus on a student outcomes we already have a policy that does that so I recommend against moving this to the full board

[01:13:00]
I think that that warrants for the discussion on whether we need this motion but what I really wanted to make sure is that we're getting the boats correctly so I'm watching the voting results for the last motion and it says four votes yes Dominguez benavidez and Janella story I don't believe is that this meeting so and then we have one vote no for board member Jackson so I just want to make sure that we are capturing the boats accurately Dr Albright did you get that thank you I did get that and my little bit differently and we are capturing them correctly okay well I can show you the screenshot of what I have so just so you know I'm not pulling out of nowhere no that's very helpful and

[01:14:00]
yeah I'll send it just to make sure that there's not some weird discrepancy because you know that's alarming but anyway okay thank you know I don't really have any questions right now okay so here's a question that I have if we have a policy that reflects

[01:15:00]
Division and the values of our community then how could we have gotten the right sizing situation so horribly wrong in December because we had community so I'll ask this question what evidence was there during that Capital planning or Capital decision what evidence was there that there was alignment with the goals and the guard rails equitable distribution of resources honoring Community voice because we did ask in November to be part of meetings with the community and I don't believe that

[01:16:00]
well we weren't invited anyway and if there's if the finance committee is addressing this or or in charge of ensuring that there's an alignment what evidence is there that the finance committee ensured that alignment and I'm not you know I want to be very clear I'm not interested in telling the superintendent how she should Implement her make those decisions but but we cannot as a board abdicate our responsibility to the vision as stated or division has stated in our four goals and the

[01:17:00]
use as stated in our guard rails I think it's our job to continually keep that very broad understanding of vision and values we need to make sure that in fact what is in practice aligns with so I'm looking for that mechanism and and I don't think I haven't seen it in the finance committee specifically on you know the new the capital outlay decisions they sound fine until we get this bubbling up from community and and so clearly

[01:18:00]
something went awry there and so how do we address that I guess that's what I'm searching for we can't just bury it what what is the role of the board the proper role the governance role we can't just abdicate vision and values we have to we have to find I think we need to have a statement about the importance of decisions and yeah so

[01:19:00]
first of all I think we need to be careful about relocating an issue that has already been discussed as well as the fact that particularly right sizing is not on the agenda and this discussion needs to focus on whether or not we want to move forward with a new capital outlay policy so I think we need to be very cognizant of that I will kind of go back a little bit there are two years ago 3 years ago two and a half years Whenever there was a right size of the board

[01:20:00]
patents there was an agreement of the board to give right-sizing to the superintendent because right-sizing and capital outlay and capital master plan and all of those very operational decisions sell more appropriately within their expertise I agree with you that we need to have strong Community engagement we need to have strong two-way communication and I believe that that is something that we are constantly working very hard on to make sure that we are out there and we are hearing what our community is asking about us but I do not believe that me personally I do not believe that the issues that you were discussing particularly right sizing I do not believe that those

[01:21:00]
were hidden from the board or that we were not given information but the discussion that we need to have is whether or not there's the necessity for a new capital outlay policy and my argument stands that I think we already have a policy that addresses the issues that you are trying to Bubble to the surface thank you for that I just want to add the agreement was that on that committee that the right size and committee that the the details belonged to the administration another agreement that was forgotten was that the board would get regular updates and we did not

[01:22:00]
we didn't get that was another agreement and so on that can vary pardon me Recollections on that can vary that was not a recollection that was that was an agreement that the former the former updates what I'm saying is that regular what what what what I'm saying and again like I don't we are not I don't want to get into the weeds of a discussion about right sizing like that issue when I'm saying is that how regular those updates were Recollections on that can vary I felt like I was updated you felt like you were not so there's a disagreement on that okay

[01:23:00]
and just for the record too Capital outlay underneath Capital Outlet am I incorrect superintendent Blakey but under it seems to me that under Capital outlay you have the capital master plan have right-sizing those are all the minutiae of capital outlay yes so just for clarification right-sizing is one little piece of a broader strategy for the district it's not necessarily connected to Capital outlay and the capital master plan itself is a lot of what you see come before you usually in the finance committee as far as projects that are being worked on updates to facilities like it's beyond right-sizing

[01:24:00]
is a complex piece of running the district that's not necessarily connected to Capitol and I wouldn't say connected to Capital outlay really at all the capital master plan in a bit but I also would say that we have to be careful with Community feedback because there is democracy gets messy and so listening to the community doesn't mean we can always respond to 100 different requests or desires so we can listen to the community but that doesn't necessarily mean that we can do everything that each Community member wants because they're always listening and having the goals is so important so that we make decisions that are made in the best interests of meeting the goals and so I think that overall that's where you know the foundation lies in how we

[01:25:00]
isn't the budget how are you how are we creating a budget that is connected to the goals and to student outcomes and how can we show that the decisions we make are in the best interest of delivering on student outcomes hungry yeah I mean my only point was processes need to align with the vision vision and the values and and so okay so right you don't so what's the distinction then help me understand the distinction between capital outlay and say Capital La is a source of money it's a funding source the capital master plan is a larger long-term vision for how we determine use of land and Facilities the capital master plan

[01:26:00]
so right-sizing Falls more under Capital master plan yes and no it's in combination with finance and academics as well because sometimes right sizing means downsizing on certain areas right

[01:27:00]
Courtney Johnson no Ronaldo yes Josefina Dominguez yes ok Google revision to the charter school policy and I'm going to ask for a motion to move and a second to move to discussion I move that we consider recommending clarification of the policy committee year round I'm sorry

[01:28:00]
a revision to the new to the charter school policy this is board member Benavides hey Google what is the strategy that is connected

[01:29:00]
to our vision and our values and how it is expressed in the charter school policy I also so that's one and probably the most important secondly I'm concerned about our capacity to manage 33 I believe it's 33 charter schools to do that well especially when I think we've had how long have we had 33 charter schools and what I'm getting at is there has been a dropping enrollment in the school district but we keep the same number of we're still authorizing the same number of charter schools not all those charter schools are I would argue

[01:30:00]
lighting by student outcomes a student outcomes strategy and so I just believe that we need this umbrella strategy or statement about how this district is going to authorize charter schools and aligned that with our student outcomes are goals in our guard rails I don't think we have a good discussion going on around that that piece so that's the justification and I'm open to discussion we can skip it comments observations

[01:31:00]
board member Jackson thank you so like you said we already have a policy Casey that establishes the complete and legal framework for how the district must the Board of Education must act we have three defined rules in that we approve the establishment we reserve the right to deny suspender revoke and we shall establish a process for application submission review and approval one thing that we need to be very very careful about is that state law sets the statutory Frameworks for Charters they are semi-autonomous by law and we do not

[01:32:00]
have the authority to place additional directives or burdens upon them while I agree that we would want everybody to align with our particular student outcomes Focus governance model and aligned with our board goals and you know everybody's working towards the same goal we do not have that Authority per state law and so we need to be very careful about in fringing upon the autonomy of the charter schools and the other thing and I continue to say this but I continue to believe that this is true is that the review of Charters is an operational evaluation we have which is the superintendent's responsibility we ultimately have the

[01:33:00]
review as an authorizer but the day-to-day is Joseph's Joseph's responsibility what else they already submit their policies for review and if there is a need for their Charters to be reviewed that is done through the contract process in which the district and the chartres have that discussion that is not an involvement of the board so I think ultimately Casey that we already have already addresses the legal obligations that are inherent within charter schools and key to that is they are semi-autonomous and we cannot micromanage how each individual Charter School chooses to run

[01:34:00]
organization they have their own governing boards we are just the authorizers we have no way of holding them accountable when when things go awry and and so that's that's the piece I mean if they want that and talk to me they don't have to come to us they can go to the PEC and so what I think there has to be something some kind of negotiated understanding about what we get out of that approval

[01:35:00]
Brevard Vision and values and you're right we have to I think that has to be a collaborative understanding with their instructions no governance councils and I'm not interested in getting into the details that's not what this is about it's it's on a higher it's a higher level conversation I don't feel good about Robert stamping contracts and also I did not appreciate not being made aware last year that we had I mean people we were played with Samantha's I had no idea that aims was a brand new to the district renewal

[01:36:00]
the other problem is we don't get accurate data and and so these are we cannot I don't feel like we are being responsible of proving contracts when we don't have accurate data and we don't have a relationship with their governance body about understanding that are connected to our goals and guardrails so that is that is the responsibility of the governing board of each of those individual Charters to decide how they are going to run their organization that is that would be like I don't know some other overarching organization coming in and telling us as a board of education that we have to do something very particular I think we would take

[01:37:00]
because we as a board have agreed how we want to move forward as APS and so they are semi-autonomous by law and we cannot go to their governing board in order to the Oregon to this the charters themselves and tell them you must Implement X Y and Z that's that's their decision and we have you know we don't we don't rubber stamp I mean you and I have sat through what three four authorizations now and some of them can get pretty pretty heated and and have a lot of discussion but our Authority by law is as an author and that's where we have the opportunity to question that's why we get the information in advance so that if the the data doesn't seem correct or we have questions then we have the opportunity to go to the superintendent and her design

[01:38:00]
is to ask those questions but it's it is overstepping to create a board an APS board policy that forces our system of governance onto a charter school again they can get that they don't have to come to us to be authorizing go to the PC and so again what is what what's going to be the benefit the mutual benefit that's I just want that to be really clear and and I will say it from I don't know if this is yes it's pk4 to allow the development of different Innovative forms of measuring student learning and a

[01:39:00]
so achievement is part of the discussion to address the needs of all students including those determined to be at risk for talking about Martinez and yassi so that enters into our should enter into the conversation with their governance board to create let's see opportunities for teachers including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the school site that sounds like professional autonomy there to improve student achievement which is what we are about and so I don't think we're far off I do think we need to be more

[01:40:00]
I think we need to have a better understanding of where were the alignment is where are the benefit to them and to us is why are they coming to us for authorization and that's just an honest conversation and anyway board member benavidez do you like to wait yes the policy it shows that the board has the ultimate authority to either approve or deny a charter school and that is where our and I hate to use this word but where our power is we don't have to rubber stamp anything the information that's brought to us at the meeting or ahead of time it's our responsibility to do our research

[01:41:00]
and decide based on what is provided to us if we feel that this school should continue should be authorized whatever the case may be whatever it is they're asking for so I think that we are the oversight it's our response that's our ultimate responsibility what about a strategy on how many how many is too many no I think we're talking about something a little different at that point but we shouldn't be representing anything we should be doing our research with the information that's brought to us and ask questions and if we really think that a school has issues and shouldn't be authorized reauthorized then we have to make the case on the dias that's our job

[01:42:00]
I know it's not as simple as that but just trying to to summarize it thank you board member tell Mauricio school and I think moving forward and now that going into two years and understanding what is the role of a charter school and how does that work and how do we Implement our personal say so and I have to agree with Heather that we do have oversight and it's up to us to understand what that means and how do we create the conversations on the

[01:43:00]
to really ask those critical questions and whether or not the schools should be recommended for you know for charter school and but it is hard though you know I can tell you especially being the Native American board member and hearing from native parents and from administrators who attend NACA and what they're going through but it was also letting them know that you have a governing body because many of our community are also confused they think we oversight we see over there bored or we are there bored because we're APS so those lines are not understood for our parents and even our community members on how Charter Schools work and so they you know you getting letters and people talk to you

[01:44:00]
how about NACA and what's going on there but I often say to them you go to your own governing body but that's never understood so I think that and clarification we need to really bring to community members and parents how do these lines work and what do we have oversight and what does your governing board have oversight over so I think if we can create those clear lines it would better serve what we're trying to do and I think that many times when you hear those issues some of them are very serious it's just how do you make the recommendations when they're coming to you but I've often have just said you have your own governing body and I'm sorry that I have to take so yes I understand what's going on but I do agree with we do have that oversight but I do know that somewhere if we you know maybe there's not a somewhere

[01:45:00]
maybe it's just really asking those questions when there is renewal of some of the things we're hearing and how does that school become better and whether it's having those conversation with their governing board because people are coming I know people come to me and so it's just one of those things of of helping parents understand so anyway thank you in a few months we're going to have a renewal again I guess I don't like waiting till the last minute to get a load of information and so maybe that's more of a process a question or request that I did request a list of who you know who who who's up for renewal

[01:46:00]
when can we expect that information and for the last 2 years anyway that I recall we have been corrected on the Dias about data accurate data and so I just want to assurances that we're not going to face that at during a high-stakes vote because there are legal consequences if I remember correctly to not approving a contract is that correct superintendent Blakey there are the language of charter schools it's pretty regulated by state law so you can't not approve it if it's anything that's arbitrary capricious so not approving you can't not approve a charter school because you don't have enough information or anything that would appear to be arbitrary or capricious

[01:47:00]
and so I guess this is more of a procedural issue then but it it impacts our my job as a board member to to cast a vote that I can feel good about I need to have again accurate data well before the vote and it would be great to have access to have an Avenue of some sort so we get access I get access to their governance Council for questions otherwise again right by the state

[01:48:00]
I think you're not your notebooks like forget it I get it I get it but again I'm going to the point of being well informed well ahead and that's more of a procedural problems so I think we just need to take a vote personal responsibility and making sure that we are fully prepared when we're on the Dias to

[01:49:00]
make the decisions that we have been elected to make by our communities and I know that's really hard we're all very busy but I definitely don't want to be ever accused or think of myself that I'm rubber-stamping anything but I also want to be clear that these are children's lives that were that were affecting and their outcomes and I can't imagine how disruptive it would be to a child to find out that their charter school has been eliminated for some reason and I'm sure it happens I know what happens but you know I if we ever have to make that decision I want to make sure we're making the right one so I'm not even sure that this is necessarily a policy change other than maybe just figuring out ways to get the information so that were fully informed or we feel we're fully informed thank you and remember Dominguez just as a point of clarification all of that information

[01:50:00]
so the charters are all listed and their renewal dates are are on our APS website so like if you're curious about who's coming up for Renewal if it's on our website I'm so curious about like what the data is I'd like to know like just like I can go on on our dashboard and see what the data is for the traditional schools it would be great to have access to the correct enrollment I can't pull it up immediately from memory but I know there was another we didn't have percentages or demographics broken down properly last year and so that got corrected

[01:51:00]
and so I just that's part of having all the information that I need to to feel good about voting on those contracts so I don't want to be late for just for clarification I think doctor schools have internal ways of collecting their data it's not matching what we see on our side and that might be what you know so it is upon the charter school to correct that with Dr Escobedo if he has data in their snapshot that is incorrect and so where they're keeping that might be different than the student information system that we can see

[01:52:00]
and that's what he has access to that he's showing but you know I do know that he has the timeline for the renewals and a pretty robust process that he has for visiting the schools and putting all the data together for the renewal packets I can check with him as far as what the timeline is of how far in advance you do get those packets after they do their site visits and compile the renewal data as well be helpful I do know I've heard from I've heard from charter schools that it's I guess they don't they're not part of the sapper the sapper system they have to go out and get their own data monitoring system but it doesn't it doesn't

[01:53:00]
talk to probably for security reasons to but I'm speculating it doesn't melt with our system and so is is there yeah they are the charter schools are autonomous and so they aren't required to use any specific system that we have however that being said the state is moving to a unified student Information Systems so as that moves forward in its life all schools across the state would be using the same information now they all have you know the data that's available through the Vista site that's collected for all schools across the state where you can look up specific Charters and see their performance data on the New Mexico Vista site as well and that's a Statewide

[01:54:00]
right where all of the data is the same for schools across the state but vista's is well I'll figure it out I'll check to see if it provides the information I'm looking for okay thank you so may I have a motion and a second for consider recommending the revision to the charter school policy you have a motion by Heather benavidez so we're going to move on to a roll call vote Dr Albright thank you heather benavidez honestly I'm a little torn about this at this point because we have a charter school policy it seems pretty clear and I'm not sure exactly what the revision would be

[01:55:00]
so I'm going to go ahead and vote Yes just so that if it does make it to the full board chair Dominguez please bring your vision as to what you think needs to be changed because I think that the policy is pretty clear as it's written right now but I did make the motion so I'm going to follow through with it though I'm the same way only because I do see the responsibility side of being a board member and making sure we do have the data but I also can say that if it's a newly elected board whether or not we're going to be able to make sure they understand what the protocol is what they need to look into

[01:56:00]
but I think someone we need to implement a stronger way of making sure information is given so I'd like Heather don't know whether that means policy or process but I think if we can at least discuss and and see what that means I'm going to say yes thank you Courtney Jackson know and I'll make note that the onboarding process will be on the July 16th Board of Education meeting in which we will have discussions in there as to what new board members need to know and I believe Charter Schools is one of those issues but no we do not need a new policy we already have one supposed to the last item 4.4 consider recommending clar

[01:57:00]
location of the policy committees year-round role in governments yes so after conversation with are policy analyst Jessica Martinez I think that it would be wise to revisit taking the annual governance manual review and rather than doing it all at once doing it throughout the throughout the year is probably more wise

[01:58:00]
and I say that based on conversations I've had with Fort Worth I believe and San Francisco and one other one other school district but also talking to other coaches who believe it's it's wise to to do this policy review throughout the year also after talking to our policy analyst and struck me that there's a rhythm to policy review and it has to do with the legislation the legislature so

[01:59:00]
so I would like to recommend that we clarify the policy committees year-round role in governance and I am I asking for emotion in a second for discussion can I ask a question yeah yes how does this differ from our implementation timeline

[02:00:00]
I don't I don't see other than the government's manual being well I guess I have concerns especially a review coming at the end of the year I think that's the only place where I see an implementation melding with this I see this is more separate but that's a good question I think you can clarify or provide a different answer so are you asking if the recommendations are in alignment with the implement

[02:01:00]
beautician timeline or so but and I can I can see that they're different but I'm just wondering if there's any overlap and I think it would it would take a little analysis for me to to really see and obviously I don't have time to do that right now but if nobody else sees it right off the bat that's that's fine I just I just really feel that we shouldn't be duplicating work at this point yeah so and and to your point member benavidez if there are recommendations to changes in the implementation timeline we're going to be discussing that at the July 16th board meeting so there's a possibility that you if you feel the need you know to address that that is something that we can discuss as a full board done but I'm a broken record by saying I agree I don't think we need to have policies that duplicate things that we already have in place

[02:02:00]
yeah and this isn't a policy this is just clarification of the policy committee year-round role in governance so it's it's into your point board member Benavides like where does it fit into an implementation timeline right because I think we have to take into account that anytime there's a legislative session we need to carve out some time for potential impact on board policy so yeah it's it's again recommending the clarification can smell the discussion on the implementation timeline is that on the 16th

[02:03:00]
so then clarification of your clarification is this is not this is not a request for a new policy because it is does to create a framework for an annual policy cycle where does it say that in the background sorry I've been ignoring us okay so create a framework well I don't see that as policy it's just to confirm the role of the committee and create a framework for an annual policy cycle that is aligned with the boards governance role of oversight and policy setting so

[02:04:00]
so there's a framework there a sample so we know that between March and June we're going to respond to an active or proposal legislation impacting board goals or District obligations July to September develop and refine policies maybe in anticipation of legislative session this is simply a framework for what a policy committee schedule a lot by legislation but we also have moments there September to February September 13th January September to November where you identify and address community-driven or

[02:05:00]
policy needs alive with the boards adopted goals and guardrails just I think the rest of the time we should be able to revisit the manual in bits and pieces rather than the entire thing I don't think the model we followed this last year was was a sound I mean it happened at the end of the year we were in a workshop on December 20th it's not productive and then we had homework over over over Christmas we came back to lots of revising we had a

[02:06:00]
one board meeting that went way too late anyway yes board member Jackson okay so a couple things so if this is not a request to create a policy then this isn't I think I'm trying to work my way through this if this is not a request to make a policy then this actually wouldn't go to the full board I think this is more of a policy like chair decision as to how the policy chair each year would want to potentially review potentially review policies additionally though we have the governance manual that already dictates when policies are adopted address brought up

[02:07:00]
and like I said at the beginning like it's the superintendent's rule through her design knees to determine when there is a statue that requires a policy be adopted by the board but then we also have section 4J which is our fairly robust board policy scope and development section that already has very particular requirements as to when policies are adopted and I agree like having a structure in a framework kind of maybe makes us know what to expect but I mean if we've learned anything no one year is ever exactly the same and I think sometimes we just have to adapt and adjust to what is in front of us and I'm hesitant of putting I think this is more of a norm that you're trying to introduce

[02:08:00]
so this is kind of more of a discussion it's not necessarily something that goes to the bored cuz you're not asking for a policy to be written if that if if I'm understanding you correctly you're not asking for a policy you're asking for just a framework and so this is this is for something that the committee chair I think would look at in in January of each year and maybe basically lay out okay what do we think this next year is going to look like but I don't think that we can like force a structure on top of it especially given that we have the government's manual that already so do you see this as having a is there a role for this in the governance manual well I think like maybe being particular about this there is not actually

[02:09:00]
a policy committee listed in the governance manual there are only two required committees that are listed in the governance manual being audit and finance so there isn't a policy committee listed in the governance manual therefore there is no need for a detailed framework of the policy committee to be in the government's manual because for Jay already dictates for the full board how policies are adopted revised Etc so I understand wanting to have a framework but I get your point that we don't need to make it an agenda or a recommendation to the full board yes

[02:10:00]
I mean I think this is something that the policy chair in January talks with Miss Martinez talks with the superintendent says what do we think this next year is going to look like and generally outlines if there is if they're even if they're even is a policy chair in January and it could be that all policy now comes through the full board I don't know anybody want to weigh in more conversation I just wanted to ask a question about taking away the policy committee how was that determined and taking him out of the governance because I know when we first looked at it I know that

[02:11:00]
there was mention that it needed to stay in there so how was that determined to take it out and that was at the meeting that we all had when we voted section by section on the governance manual I think it was November or early December that we had that meeting all of that was when we went through the government's manual piece by piece and I think it was January and February through this piece by piece so I mean what's what's in my updated governance manual is we had a final revision I think in March but it was approved February I think our minutes are minutes tell us that was very fast

[02:12:00]
yes 5th at the full board meeting and I think about it by board member Jackson and board member astorga that's right November November December 4 as a reminder policy analyst Martinez what is the statute around policy and the board so if you'd like me to pull the exact language I'm happy to do that in general the statute of Education to established Finance

[02:13:00]
audit and those are the only two required statutory policies if they decide to establish other subcommittees there within their right to do that is there a specific language about a policy committees or policy unforgetting the language I know what you are referring to Madam chair what the language of boards of education is to establish educational policies it doesn't directly that needs to be through the full board over through the creation of a separate policy committee is that right yes yes yes okay yes thank you you're welcome so I'm going to suggest that we don't need to you don't need to

[02:14:00]
do you recommend clarification of the policy committee easy around Rural and governance unless you feel that we need to take it into consideration when we're discussing the timeline and the implementation timeline but I think we can do that without moving this to a recommendation is that correct okay so how do we handle this do we do we still have to vote and vote know there was never actually emotion or a second it went straight to discussions right okay well I don't think we need further discussion are we in agreement and if that's the case then I'm going to move

[02:15:00]
Groupon to the chair report talking points so tonight the policy committee has suggested that the Board of Education authorized a committee to Begin work on or have a discussion about and begin work on policies related to tribal consultation Charter Schools capital outlay and that's it items approved by the policy committee this evening will appear on the consent agenda at the August 6th board meeting this evening at the August 6th board meeting

[02:16:00]
discussion you'll have to request that they be pulled from that consent agenda just a reminder to clarify what's going on the consent agenda is simply the recommendation to develop in this case to develop a new tribal consultation policy the development of a new capital outlay policy and the revision to the charter school policy yes so there aren't if everyone's clear about that I'm going to move to Idaho City

[02:17:00]
what is it the next policy committee meeting will be on let's see the next committee that was scheduled for Monday August 4th will be canceled due to the items going before the full board on August 6th yes ok Google thank you good night
