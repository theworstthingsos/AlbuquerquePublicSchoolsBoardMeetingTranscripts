[00:06:00]
the initial audit procedures have been started by the foundation team they have met with their Outsource accountant and provided a PVC list of requests for the foundation to provide and they're expecting to start their audit early in September and then from an update on the charter school perspective next week will be our third week on site at the schools and we are sending weekly requests updates and making sure that the charter schools are staying on track but every one has been super responsive so far has been providing requests so no delays or anything of that sort that I would need to report at this point Thank you are there

[00:07:00]
repeat questions for our presenters yes yes when you talk about Charter School audits is that plural you're looking at other schools as well correct the district has a number of charter schools that they authorized under the school district so they are considered components of the school district then we're also in charge of we have a team within our office that works on those as well okay and so that is beyond the the Josephine William W and Justin Bieber external audit so was that part of I'm sorry

[00:08:00]
full month was that part of the original the original request yes engagement the foundation and the components which are the charter schools William Joseph School last fiscal year but we still have a financial transactions that had to be done to close out the finances of the school so since they're born APS became the de facto

[00:09:00]
conference Insurance conference updates because we're serving is that body for the school even though really it's it's just some few transactions to close out their books and this will be the final audit and we will have any more hot as related to them after this year period thank you thank you I have a point of clarification but I don't if somebody else has a question I'll wait I'm not seeing anybody else with questions so go ahead so I just a point of information Madam chair I learned this morning that the district received 14 findings after the

[00:10:00]
view of our Perkins grant program can you clarify what if anything and this is supposed to say la as well as the district can you clarify clarify what is anything the audit committee could have done to prevent these findings I'm just feeling a little bit like I want to reassure myself mostly that we did not Overlook Something board members Community Church have been from the 2021 incident going forward

[00:11:00]
I am not aware of any additional 14s on so last I heard there were seven but then all the sudden today at 8:00 a.m. a table discussion with our guests the Ford and NG I'm sorry I don't I forget with Ford that came to light and so the 14 came to light and so again I'm just asking if there is anything what if anything I am trying to execute my duties as a Committee Member

[00:12:00]
and since this was information that maybe was not in the packet and it's something that you learned today could you consolidate all of the information that you have what you've heard that you what your question is and maybe submit that for an RFI the team can then better look into to give you better information because I believe this is quite on the agenda so they're probably not able to answer this question right off the bat I understand and yes I'm happy to put in a request for information but I yes and I'll direct it I'll include CLA as well I'll submit exactly what I said because that's all I've got

[00:13:00]
perfect okay all right are there any further questions from the committee okay I am seeing no more questions so that closest this agenda item which means that our next audit committee meeting is on Tuesday September 23rd 2025 at 5:00 p.m. virtually and this meeting is now adjourned thank you thank you thank you
