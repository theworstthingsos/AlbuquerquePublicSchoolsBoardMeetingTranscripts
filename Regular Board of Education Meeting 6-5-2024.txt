[00:05:00]
my name is Isaac petali and I'm a social studies teacher at West Mesa High School I have come before you today to invite you to have a dialogue with our teachers and administrators regarding a topic that is adversely affected the students and culture of our school particularly during the school year that just passed specifically I am speaking of the profound difficulty many of our teachers who joined our ranks at West Mesa from countries outside the US and who have developed their skills and rapport with students who find themselves in the situation of not being supported and obtaining their residential visas to remain in the country and serving our students may have found particularly confusing is the relative ease with which these teachers have been able to secure these residential visas through other Charter or smaller school districts within the state I have become appraised enough on this issue to have an appreciation of its nuances from the standpoint of a large institution seeking to mitigate risk

[00:06:00]
in control costs but what I have also learned from the ground level at my high school is the devastating effect on culture quality of instruction and morale as teacher after teacher who would love to remain at West Mesa must for the sake of their families or professional livelihood look elsewhere for the support that would certainly be what is best for our students even being adversely affected by this topic on a personal level I hold no malice and wish only to engage with those District leaders who crafted these policies in order to engage in a mutual dialogue about other ways that might allow our school to retain these teachers in ways that also manage the district's exposure to risk nearly every teacher affected by this have told me they would be more than willing to pay what the costs are in fees to secure both their work and residential visas the will is there and it is not too late to do what is best for kids at West Mesa have spoken with one teacher affected by these policies only days

[00:07:00]
who is reluctantly sought and secured employment elsewhere but is still optimistically held the door open to entirely cutting ties with APS in the hopes that this request might generate some solution that would allow her to stay please help us to understand why this keeps happening and consider discussing ways to resolve this before we have to lose even more qualified Educators thank you thank you sir our next speaker is in person Mitchell recall recall Rico is Rico you have two minutes once you begin speaking good afternoon board members dot Rico and I'm special ed teacher with 17 years teaching at West Mesa High School and I'm also a colleague of Mr pedals and in fact I'm here to speak on the same issue good news is Mr Lee explains so eloquently APS has a rare opportunity to change a situation that's lose

[00:08:00]
into win-win at West Mesa loan 7 teachers from overseas who wanted to stay have left the school blowing huge holes in our departments holes which are extremely difficult to fill remaining staff or overstretched and student outcomes suffer greatly it's just one example one of my science colleagues is about to leave for an APS Charter School unless APS changes this policy quickly I strongly urge the board to look into this issue and whoever is in charge of deciding this to carry whatever risk is run by helping these teachers with their visas against the very real and severe consequences to students remaining staff and the departing teachers that continuing it represents stopgap measures like moving resource teachers into the classroom do not address the long-term structural problem otherwise where are we going to get the teachers to fill these

[00:09:00]
needs positions does APS have some secret pipeline of teaching Talent it's about to open unless they do APS needs to decide either continue with the current lose-lose approach or change it to win-win for District staff parents and most of all for a students and here we have 400 signatures of West Mesa folks who agree with us on this that we would like to present to you all thank you for your time and consideration thank you sir period if two minutes once you begin speaking hello board members and Dr Blakey my name is Ana Cheri I am a parent of two students at Adobe Acres Elementary School recently APS has decided to change times for the schools due to buses

[00:10:00]
several different reasons and so in speaking to several of our families they are suffering a hardship due to the change because several families they have like five or six kids they can't find ways to get their children to school with the time changes and so they'll be pulling their children from our school if we can't see some way to get our schedule changed back to the normal schedule that we have now they're going to lose the schools going to lose and after school program there hasn't been any notification of any sort of before school program parents like I who work we are struggling with finding ways to get her children to school and because of the time change so like you have kids you say oh well this is the time to start so then you prepare but when there's so many different changes and I looked at all the schools all the different schools some

[00:11:00]
and so for us as a as a community as a whole would benefit much more if we were able to keep our current time for several reasons I mean the kids are Tapped Out talking to teachers you know by 2:00 they're tired and so we're going to be there till 4:00 what are they going to learn in those two hours on top of like I said the after school programs we're going to lose we there's just so many several different reasons for sure so we're asking you please to consider keeping our current time schedule we did send I did send to all the board members a copy of our petition and so we're hoping you guys will consider it thank you thank you thank you our next speaker is Dr samella you have two minutes

[00:12:00]

[00:13:00]

[00:14:00]
call Cesar perversion mutilation castration and sterilization which are actually abortion and transgender among students thank you and God bless you thank you thank you sir and our last speaker tonight is Jayden Miller you have two minutes once you begin speaking from the parents teachers and students at Hubert Humphrey Elementary School who are concerned about the changing bell schedule for this next year I know this has been discussed previously but as mentioned before this creates a great hardship on parents those who both work have a difficulty finding safe ways to get their children to school the before school program is full and these are elementary school kids who are not legally nor should they be left at home alone so how are parents who work at 8 a.m. able to get their kids to the bus or to the school safely with

[00:15:00]
adult supervision parents are also concerned about after school activities extracurricular activities one parent expressed that her daughters are involved in swim team it's been enjoyable for them as well as a great confidence Builder but it's at 4:00 p.m. three times a week so now they're faced with decisions on do we just cut this activity out of our life or do I get my kids out of school early three times a week teachers have expressed concerns about student behavior in the afternoon hours of school for the younger greats five and six year olds as you know they are tired by the afternoon my kindergartener comes home a little bit hungry and grouchy and now we're going to be keeping them for an extra hour it's almost at 9 to 5 job for for children who are just very interesting a full-time school day all parents are concerned about the mental and emotional well-being of their kids in the coming year coming home at 4:00 those who bust won't be getting home

[00:16:00]
until about 4:45 during the winter that's already dark so that's a safety issue as well as students who are coming home with homework with extracurricular activities with family responsibilities how will they fit all of these things in including dinner when elementary school kids go to bed much earlier than middle school and high school students so where is the balance where is the time for them to relax we've been told that this is a bus schedule issue and if that is the case can we have an open dialogue can we come to some kind of Solution that's mutually beneficial for all of us and is there an opportunity for that open dialogue to her so I present to you all hand this out at the end the petition from the parents students and teachers who are concerned about this change in please seriously consider a request thank you thank you and board members that completes public forum thank you to all our public forums speakers our next item is to consider approval of the consent

[00:17:00]
agenda which includes items 5.1 through 5.6 is there a motion in a second for approval of the consent agenda I need to prove the consent agenda for items 5.1 through 5.6 this is member Jackson this is Crystal I will second it thank you we have a motion from Member Jackson in a second from Member top your Romero Miss King can we have a roll call vote please resume all right next up on our agenda is a discussion on community engagement ad hoc committee goals are presented for this is board member Courtney Jackson who also serves as the chair of the community engagement at hoc committee

[00:18:00]
who will provide an overview of the charge that was given to the committee as well as an initial draft proposal for the goals that we consider for the committee and I just want to remind us that the purpose of our community engagement efforts really is to hear and understand the vision and values of our community so that we can ensure that we are representing those visions that vision and those values and it's also the opportunity for us or opportunities for us to have a two-way conversation with our community we just witnessed the public forum which we know it's not a two-way conversation we sit here and listen but our deeply committed to really hearing from and having dialogue with our community and so that's why this committee exists and that's why we are setting goals to hold ourselves accountable and so the process which member Jackson will walk through will provide a little bit more contacts but then this is a discussion kind of a bit like a work session we're actually going to be

[00:19:00]
developing finalizing these goals with the goal to reach consensus so you may notice this is a discussion item it's not an action item so we don't need to vote but we do and I hope reach consensus that we are in agreement around what are the goals that we want to meet when it comes to community engagement so with that I will turn it over to the chair of the community engagement Committee Member Jackson thank you madam president and you said you took the words right out of my mouth no it's fine don't worry I will have more words and it really is the point of you know we set goals and guardrails because we want to honor the value in the vision of our community and in order to do that within this community engagement and Outreach committee is to really Elevate the voice of our of our community and so as we were

[00:20:00]
developing goals we really wanted to focus on areas where we thought maybe that voice was not being elevated or was not being heard the reason being is because if we have if we have participation then we have we have voice right we have we have a way for our entire Community to to be part of this conversation so you can see the four goals that the committee discussed and one thing that I would kind of like to talk about before we have before we open the discussion is that I've been doing a lot of contemplation on the goals that were presented and I really want to make sure that the goals that we ultimately decide because one thing that's really important to remember these are not the goals just for the committee these are the

[00:21:00]
rules for every single one of us up here and so I want to make sure that the the goals that we have for Community engagement and outreach are authentic and that they are actually meant to elevate the voice that we we want to elevate and so what I'm what I'm concerned about with some of the goals that we have presented is that they are some of them could be viewed as more of check the box instead of actually elevating voice so one of the goals of this committee was to increase participation so to do that we have to get we have to get people to to the events right we in order to participation equals

[00:22:00]
equals the vision of the community so I would actually like to before we move any further I'd like to actually offer some amendments to these schools because I think it's important that we really focus on the authenticity of what we're trying to do instead of just checking a box so that we can later Pat ourselves on the back and say good job we did some events so here are my suggestions for some some edits the first one revolves around student engagement so right now it says student engagement at Community engagement and Outreach events will increase from X in August 2024 to why in August 2026 the first amendment that I'd like to make to that is to remove Outreach events because again what we're trying to do is to increase the two-way conversation to amend it to say student

[00:23:00]
Community engagement events will increase from X in August 2024 to why in August 2026 and I'm just going to put a pin in that right now and something that we need to think about as the board is to decide that X and that why do we want the X to be a percentage do we want student engagement to go from a certain percentage to a larger percentage or do we want it to be a numerical value so something to contemplate on that the second and third goals are the ones that I would like to amend the third goal right now that discusses and student engagement events that's the one that I'm concerned is more of a check the box instead of an authentic increase of participation and two-way communication so what I would like to offer as an amendment to that is students

[00:24:00]
play families listed in APS schools 1 and 2 which as you can see a PS schools one and two are our Yazi Martinez plus African-American students and families will increase from X percentage in August of 2024 to why percentage in August 2026 by offering that Amendment it removes the second goal that is listed because it becomes redundant to have Native American attendance at Community engagement events so that is my second amendment and then the third is just to leave it as is each APS board member will participate in four out of events by December 31st each year beginning in 2024 and ending in 2026 so what you can see from the Amendments is we've we've or I'm suggesting we reduce it to three goals two of which are engagement goals and

[00:25:00]
the third one is an Outreach school so I believe that is all that I wanted to say before we got started before so in order to start this conversation I'm going to go to the committee Members First so sorry secretary is for good do you have anything you would like to add thank you I agree with those amendments I think that it really clears up what are vision is for this committee and I also just wanted to share how excited I am for these engagement events and how intentional not only the committee with the board has been on having discussions around racial equity and what that means for our district and also about what it means to talk about checking the boxes and tokenizing and how we don't want to be that I want to be intentional with how we're communicating with with our constituents also with students because that's a

[00:26:00]
it's very different to communicate as board members with board members and communicate with students so making sure that we're targeting students and their engagement and their participation is really exciting because we have to learn a lot of things right we have to learn how to engage them in advance how to engage them and expressing their voice and being comfortable with board members to be authentic and genuine if there's issues or however it is that they want to see their education system so I feel it moving in a really positive direction and really excited and how it's going to be developed I would also suggest that we use a numerical value instead of a percentage just because I feel like it's better to say we have connected with 100 students and we're going to connect with 300 students next time I think it's just a lot funner to say that we have like these are targeted students that have showed up so that's just some of my input for the first one or the first

[00:27:00]
okay and also Committee Member okay Committee Member Josefina Dominguez thank you I'm going to weigh in right away on the numerical value being a preference over a percentage I think the start it's important to know raw numbers and I would suggest it's probably true for the rest of our targets and you know I continue to to be concerned about especially the Outreach I think well actually both both both the engagement and the Outreach need Improvement and yet I have to remind myself that we're starting and and we need to be patient

[00:28:00]
but I I hear the I hear the need that the urgency right that board member Jackson has voice and I think we all have it just takes time to build relationships and that's what we're doing we're taking time to build relationships and that doesn't happen overnight but we need to be intentional and keep ourselves our feet to the fire and we need to be accountable so I'll just go back down I guess the only clarifying question I have because I agree with the numerical versus the percentage as well who is tracking this cuz when we talked about

[00:29:00]
you know what we're being mindful of what is our plan for that thank you that's a great question and thank you for bringing that up we as a committee have started the development of a new check-in system for the events and we are going to add once these goals are finalized we're going to kind of add into the check-in system like self identifiers when people when people arrive because this might sound crass and it will it does sound crass but the one thing we don't want to do is have somebody show up and say and are you low income right we don't want to do that so we're going to we're just going to have a check in system that is a self-identified so we will be able to start tracking which is why it doesn't start until August because it hasn't been developed yet based on the fact that the goals haven't been set yet but

[00:30:00]
it'll be electronic okay and then my final question when we talked about Outreach events are we still using the same I guess list that we identified previously and we just continue to build on that and work with those groups yeah I mean that the Outreach events and we've been saying this since the beginning right Outreach events those are really incumbent upon the board members that we are the ones who if if we feel that there is a group or group of people or students or you know parents that we don't feel are being heard that it's really incumbent upon us to then go out and to make sure that we have those two-way conversations so that's why we as a committee it was really important to be very specific about Outreach events as part of the goals so what I'm finding is

[00:31:00]
Outreach it's a it's kind of organic you you meet somebody they get interested oh you know I'd like for you to come talk to our group and so that list that we had that Master list I think is still developing and I think it just needs to be said that it will be like most of our documents a living document Ever Changing Madam president Thank you period your leadership on the committee just want to start with that because it's really exciting to have the opportunity to talk through these goals I am definitely so I'm super excited to have these goals in front of us I do agree with the Amendments that you propose

[00:32:00]
I think it makes a lot of sense we've talked a lot about the importance of focusing so having three goals I think to focus on is going to be much more valuable and meaningful than having more I think I have some questions about some of the logistics about how we're going to track and manage and I think just considering when we think about the populations that are identified in the Martinez Yazzie suit English Learners low income Native American special education I think that if we were to Total the numbers of students and families that are represented in some way or another in those groups it gets pretty high pretty quickly and I think is probably the vast majority of our district population and I don't know what I'm looking at Dr Blakey but I'm assuming it's up in the late 70 to 80% of our student population would fall in that those categories so I suspect

[00:33:00]
but I really appreciate the intentionality and the focus on the target demographics and making sure that those voices in particular are really elevated and heard so I think that's exciting that we're going to prioritize prioritize those I do think having a numerical number is helpful and I'm also just wondering if we're starting with August 24th are all of our exes just zero like that's our start point so all of our exes are 0 and then we will increase to you know 100 200 300 whatever we can figure out what those amounts are for for your reasoning goals but I think that would be really helpful to have that into communicate that out to the field and then again just real intentionality around how we partner with partner organizations to pull this off because I think the unique thing is that this is Bored owned but we need help to do

[00:34:00]
quiet and I can just recognizing how important that is to have the community walking alongside us and co-developing these events to really make sure that they're meeting their their goals and that they're really being heard and I think also just I've appreciated the to do so I appreciate the committee for doing that and we're just encourage additional creativity around that because having a session in a school auditorium you know every four months may not be the best way to meet all of the people that we're trying to get to and so for example the United game is really exciting because it's an opportunity to have fun with our community but also to talk about education and literacy and our goals so just encouraged they creativity around that as well but just wanted to say the work I think your amendments are on Target and I think starting with numerical numbers

[00:35:00]
so just to clarify so student engagement so far what I'm hearing is a numerical number obviously we start with zero because we don't know what it is yet and we can ever after everybody's had a chance to weigh in I think we should go back and decide we know it's going to be 0% so what do we want it to to what's the why and then are you also suggesting that the second one that says students and families listed in APS schools one and two will increase our you suggesting a numerical value there as well or a percentage I think about you and then like so we'll have to decide on and increase for that as well okay thank you for clarifying and remember when we say okay I do agree

[00:36:00]
what is a president on her topics concerning the Martinez in Yazi subgroups and that definition of parents but I also feel that we should expound that even greater with the list that we offer and have of organizations if we can divide that with those subgroups and and have those intentions of what organizations represent Native American special education and Ale and even economically disadvantaged if we can divide those groups on that running sheet that would be very helpful I also agree with the numerical piece I also feel that with the student and the Outreach to the students I really appreciate the young ladies that were here the other day about how do we get more involved in the schools and initially how can we set some of those activities to be more involved with in those schools and engaging because I think one of the other areas that

[00:37:00]
I have great concern is how do we get feedback Within These community events from the community how do we create that feedback how do we also set our goals that will be president for these engagement community events so that we are initially hearing what the community is saying and how do we draft those thoughts how do we put them into our goals so that we're making sure that we're hearing and that we're proceeding forward as we create Community engagement and the same thing with the students I think that's another area that we need to sort of plan forward and how we're going to break that down because this is huge and I'm very grateful for the community engagement to take this issue on but this is near and dear to my heart so it's one of the things that I am really grateful for so I think anyone and everyone for getting on this test but I think we can

[00:38:00]
do it to where we are initially hearing those voices but thank you for doing this important work and I'm not going to repeat everything everybody said because I agree with all of you I agree with the Amendments but what I will say is I'm particularly excited about this because this is the fun stuff this is why we do this I think that's why I do it so and I know that speaking with community members they often feel that our meetings are very businesslike and that's the way they should be because we're here to do work and we're focusing on student outcomes but this is where we can really engage and show them that we are listening and have that dialogue and get to know the people that we represent and care about so I'm really excited to measure our community engagement and make sure it's meaningful so thank you you okay okay so

[00:39:00]
does everybody's had a chance to kind of weigh in and I just want to confirm these are some of the things that I have heard that we want to do with the goals as well as some things that the community ad hoc Community ad hoc committee needs to work on as we move forward so as far as the goals are concerned it sounds like the the amendments are accepted and so will move to deciding what those numerical values will be as far as action items for the committee what I'm hearing is that we need to make sure we're looking at creativity of events that we look at the Outreach event list form that we have maybe needs an update to be a little bit more the lineated and that also we need to work on how the feedback is coming to us so that we really understand what that two-way communication is did you hear

[00:40:00]
anything else that I missed know I think also just bringing an update on the check-in system next time we meet so we can see what that looks like and yeah I'm excited to talk about what board member don't worry too was saying and how do we receive all these communications and how you put that together so I think that's going to be the fun part for me cuz I like the data and all of that look like but I think you got it all and do you hear anything that were suggestions for the committee moving forward that I missed in that list I just want clarity about something hot when we say or when I hear how feedback is coming back to us what I'm hearing is we want to how do we document right yeah what we're hearing by topic by

[00:41:00]
but I also think we the Fine Line we want to hear from the community in those community outreach events we also have I think an obligation at some point to to clarify for the community and to reiterate the lesson plan goals and guard rails and remind them that they have a role to play in giving us feedback about so it's both we want to hear from you and we may hear you but we also have to remind

[00:42:00]
we're evaluating our new superintendent on these items so both and both and and it'll be exciting what we do both and okay so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go back to the the top goal that we have so that we can decide what we want the the why in the school to be so as it is right now this will be the new goal student engagement at Community engagement events will increase from 0 in August 2024 to why in August 20th and I just do want to stay we already know that students are coming but if we know we know students are coming but it is not 0 but because we're not starting the clock until August we have to start

[00:43:00]
what is 0 so any suggestions as to what why should be 100% and we're counting all these activities at least 10 students a district which would be like 775 students and the reason I would start the number lower is because we really want to be intentional with participation this is not just students come to an event and protecting the box of that but it really is how we engaging with those students what is that look like and how are we genuinely getting feedback so I would be comfortable starting at a lower number where we're more intimate and building relationships and said of starting at something larger

[00:44:00]
I have another clarifying question on that so for example how the students asked for us to go to an assembly and introduce ourselves and talk about how you can reach us and what the purpose is and what our goals are are those events those aren't counted either those are considered Outreach okay okay okay so we need to start low cost engagement events in the fall and they have targeted all of the student leadership organizations and are working on other organizations like gsa's for example and so even if they were to get only 20 kids her high school or something like that that's still pretty high and so like I think it's possible that we could have 200 at that first

[00:45:00]
and one thing to keep in mind is that this is a two-year-old so it could be that our first event has 75 but we need we're looking forward to August of 2026 so so both points are valid right like in August of 2024 we might or December of 2024 we might only have 75 but can we then build on 6th we really do have 500 or 1000 that attend because there's the other question is it cumulative or is it our final event in August of 2026 has its come

[00:46:00]
putting together a list of the student facing organizations student loan organizations student voice

[00:47:00]
okay and I will say the two year mark makes me feel better so I'm going to read it as the final goal for the record and student engagement at Community engagement events will increase from 0 in August 2024 to 1,000 in August 2026 all right the next goal is the students and families listed in APS goals one sorry

[00:48:00]
thank you in engagement for students and families listed in APS schools one and two will increase from 0 in August 2024 to why in August 2026 do we have the number or a rough number of the total that we have managed to engage so far over the last two years of the families listed in general I'm just wondering like if we've done the two engagement events in each of those has had 200 people were already reaching 400 yeah that's but if we don't have it that's fine I'm sure I'm sure Christy we don't have it at hand I think

[00:49:00]
are inventor averaging pulling the summit out of that cuz I think the summit was pretty large I think our average at events is around $100 per event now the summit was much larger and is how many per year for is in our engagement calendars legislative open house which I guess that doesn't count Regional meetings during budget season and then two more town halls in the Spring Hope someone is coming and then a Summer Event Summer Event and you did the like the state of the district event cuz that's all

[00:50:00]
engagement events scheduled right now so from 0 so we would assume right now would be at 6:00 and we want to increase right we want to increase over 2 years and we want to be now I would say that that 100 is what we don't know which is why we have to start tracking this data we don't know what percentage of that 100 are the families listed in two if we wanted to go off percentage of families who are APS families maybe 75% actually are of those attendees we just we just don't know so if we so 600 you know 1800 2000 do we want to say 2000 by August 2026

[00:51:00]
it's going off of 600 each year and then bump it up a little Yes sounds good 2000 2000 2000 you're thinking 12,000 I know it's in your head I don't know anybody else down there crystals calculator with our numbers and so that's why I'm like yeah yes okay and here's the thing like we can adjust this if we blow it out by in a year and we're like oh my gosh we're at 5000 will come back when we blow it out we'll come back and adjust the the goal upwards okay

[00:52:00]
so I'm going to read this again for the record engagement engagement from students and families listed in APS goals one and two will increase from 0 in August 2024 to 2000 in August 2026 to us so if right now we have we have

[00:53:00]
people average at each event for six events so it's $600 per year so $600 + 600 + 1200 because we're getting that naturally now without any intentional effort well as like an aggressive goal versus now you know if you're going to be even more interesting okay so 2000 okay yes okay so let's move to the final one which should be easy each APS board member will participate in four Outreach events by December 31st of each year beginning in August or big sorry beginning in 2024 and ending in 2026 everybody cool with that okay all right now I'm President we are done we have some gold we're just getting started

[00:54:00]
thank you for that and thank you to the committee for your work on those goals and again because this is an ad hoc committee it was established just to carry out a charge and so as that charges meant then the committee will dissolve so there's some work that you mentioned that still remains in terms of categorizing the sheets and a couple of other things so we'll just touch base on the future of the committee and I'll provide an update when it makes sense when when the committee has made a little bit more progress with some of those tasks great well that takes us to agenda item number 7 which is the president's report and so I want to thank all of the board members and staff who are there earlier today when we hosted a reception for outgoing superintendent Scott Helder who will retire on June 30th after 33 years as an APS teacher principal chief operations officer and finally as superintendent as I mentioned during the reception Mr Elder demonstrated a commitment to our educational

[00:55:00]
