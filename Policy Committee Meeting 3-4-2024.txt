[00:02:00]
when's my next item for consideration in action is review and is a review and consideration of a recommendation for approval of the superintendent evaluation process may I have emotion and a second please I moved to review and consider recommending for approval the superintendent evaluation process this is Courtney and I second it Ronaldo please open it up for discussion oh oh sorry I thought we had to yes okay so we are now opening a review and consideration or a recommendation discussion of the superintendent evaluation process

[00:03:00]
and let me pull up my notes may I say that's why you're doing that maybe Miss Martinez has some information to give while we're at the action process yes thank you tonight have been tasked with reviewing and recommending a superintendent evaluation 3C superintendent evaluation of the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education governance States

[00:04:00]
superintendent is evaluated only on performance regarding the board's goals guardrails and interim goals in Barbados the board considers superintendent performance to be indistinguishable from school system performance the superintendent evaluation process outlines procedures for conducting the superintendent's formative and some of the evaluations because the Board of Education doesn't have procedural directives which are administrative the superintendent evaluation process will be included as an addendum to the manual and cross reference superintendent evaluation thank you Miss Martinez board members we are open for discussion well I have a

[00:05:00]
who sings this if nobody Minds me jumping in please jump in okay there were I think that the evaluation process document is well thought out it seems to align very nicely to the contract of our incoming superintendent the only for me it's just some some wording that I would suggest to be switched around slightly the first one is up at the very top in the very first paragraph where it says it starts with their for as it states right now it says therefore the board will evaluate the superintendent based on progress toward reaching the goals and guardrails in quotes the board consider superintendent performance to be indistinguishable from school system performance and quotes according to the aps Board of Education governance manual to me that seems slightly clunky

[00:06:00]
so I'm trying to pull up my my comment that I pull this up so what I would suggest is to switch it to say to take out the the quotes and say the board consider superintendents performance to be indistinguishable from school system performance period therefore the board will evaluate the superintendent based on progress toward reaching the goals and guardrails verification just to clarification so you would put the board considers superintendent performance to be indistinguishable from school system performance as the 3rd sentence basically just

[00:07:00]
saying the same thing but I don't know that we need to quote the board considered superintendent performance to be indistinguishable because you know that stated in our government's manual and it's pretty much stated throughout a lot of the documents that we already have so that's my only amendment that I have otherwise I'm happy with the document is anybody Miss Martinez how do you how do you feel about that

[00:08:00]
in the sentence the part of the sentence that says according to the aps Board of Education that is implied correct correct thank you I have a question Miss Martinez when we gave feedback as board members was there anything drastic that changed or does it look pretty much the same document is pretty similar recommendations and the document that you already have drafted perfect thank you and I think if I could just jump in also probably more importantly it also aligns with the contract language so we want those two to be in very good alignment

[00:09:00]
along those lines I have a question if I may if no one else has I don't want to jump in until everyone has had a chance to weigh in I'm fine I'm okay with it go ahead I'm looking at the first paragraph under the bullets under summative evaluation the board will monitor goals and guard rails for an entire cycle based on its progress monitoring calendar before conducting the superintendent's first summative evaluation I feel like there's a little bit of ambiguity here so does our cycle did our cycle begin in July when we about when we had a practice session

[00:10:00]
on guard rail number 1 in the superintendent's evaluation the way that I read it is that it's the cycle of because this is a new superintendent that it begins when that superintendent starts so I think it's meant to be drafted slightly ambiguous to make room for the fact that and we hope the doctor Blake is with us for a long time but given the the chance that we have superintendents coming in at various times during the the cycle it's meant to be ambiguous so that the new superintendent gets a full cycle a full year before they are evaluated then I think we need to save that

[00:11:00]
play because this reads July to July and and if we intend for it to be if we intend for it to align with the cycle when a superintendent begins I think we need to be explicit about that is this our is this considered a just for the sake of clarity is this a first read a second read I don't remember the first three

[00:12:00]
so again let's see of this language the the evaluation

[00:13:00]
but I think I think we'll need some clarification for the sake of clarity and being clear about expectations so it sounds like we need to add a definition for what cycle means beginning beginning with for an entire cycle goes and guardrails for an entire school year based on his progress monitoring well do we want what you wrote earlier said I thought you

[00:14:00]
did it to begin with the whenever the superintendent began her term well that's how I interpret it but I'm offering up other suggestions I interpret it because I believe that this is the same language that is in the contract that because we're trying to you know align the documents it's not totally fair to have superintendent be evaluated without an entire like a full year right so could we say after an entire cycle I just had it aligned with the contract and based on the progress monitoring calendar

[00:15:00]
gorgo monitor golden guard rails for an entire cycle comma in alignment with the superintendent's contract aligned with the superintendents contractors yes it's in the second paragraph under the bullets the board will monitor goals and guardrails for an entire cycle comma aligned with the superintendents

[00:16:00]
contract and based on its progress monitoring but the progress monitoring calendar but let me check here the the formative evaluations are during the school year right yes and this is in reference to the summer too so I almost

[00:17:00]
can I pause and think for a second While others jump in and here's the other question that's going through my head is we can't wait till July to to let the superintendent know what the final evaluation or just another question that's Brewing any thoughts from the other committee members

[00:18:00]
is this year's a little more different only because we have a new superintendent is that correct or is it are we running it basically how we always rent it no I don't think it's so to to josefina's point we were doing formative evaluation throughout the year right and so each one of those is an is an evaluation but we have like we have to allow an entire year to pass before we start a summative evaluation in an entire cycle an entire year before we can evaluate Dr Blakey on

[00:19:00]
the performance so we will not be able to evaluate her on this year's outcomes we will only be able to evaluate her on outcomes from school year 2425 because those are the ones that she had Direct oversight for so these formative evaluations that will start officially in July when she takes over we have a Year's Worth or you know a school Year's worth of data July to July and some before we would be able to evaluate her after that because she'll be with us for a while I see you Dr Blakey on

[00:20:00]
because she'll be with us a while it'll become more systematic but for right now it sounds like our cycle does need to be I mean going back to I'm I'm fine with the Way It Was Written originally with it just as an entire cycle because again the document also says that this will be in consultation with the superintendent so there's not going to be any surprises for Dr Blakey we add okay so does that take into account on 11th cycle versus a 12-month what you just explained Courtney

[00:21:00]
it would be more than a 12 month like if you take it into account if she starts July 1st July 1st to June 30th right is her July 1st of 2024 will give it a year to June 30th of 2025 she can't be evaluated on that data until we have all of the outcome data that closes out that entire year so like 12 years 12 months old 12 months cycle so essentially we're not going to actually be able to have a summative evaluation like summative evaluation until we get that date which we all know how quickly ped gets our data it might be September or even October before the actual evaluation occurs but it's on data from

[00:22:00]
I first 202425 to June 30th of 25 at the board meetings so that the superintendent is not shocked at any of the I guess the expectations that we have all the feedback that we're giving so we're all on the same page throughout that entire cycle so that when we have the data for the summit of evaluation we're still on the same page because we had that full year of progress monitoring constantly giving feedback to make changes so I think it reads well the way the way that it's written yeah okay I do too because after after your explanation Courtney yeah I was just looking at it I think that we're you know we're

[00:23:00]
turn the basis for all of it but then I think also I think as you're saying once it gets into its year to year it's I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's written to where it's explaining things yeah period defining that entire cycle just putting I mean we know it's it's July 1st to July 1st right or to June 30th is that correct or this superintendent correct but I think the issue the issue because of what it says at the very beginning after consultation with the superintendent there is going to be an opportunity for us as the board to consult with the superintendent to discuss what the evaluation process is going

[00:24:00]
more specifically what it will look like so again that there are no surprises for Dr Blakey but you know God forbid this this any new superintendent coming in the cycle might be a little bit different so and that's why it says then you know after that first sentence was the board will monitor goals and guards for an entire cycle based on its progress monitoring calendar blah blah blah it says then and during the same time in subsequent years the board will meet so this is the only the first time where it's going to be on ambiguous because after that it will we will know it will always be in September at the cemetery for information when we need it the summative evaluation will be in September in

[00:25:00]
25 and 26 in 27 it's just this first year that it can't be specific just a second sentence does clarify that point then and during the same time in subsequent years there's the implication there right there okay question mark

[00:26:00]
but we've only made one recommendation for for a change for a minor edit is that correct okay so unless I hear otherwise I think are we ready for a boat

[00:27:00]
all right I move to review and consider recommending for approval the superintendent evaluation process as amended secondary

[00:28:00]
2 recommended Amendment Amendment to the governance manual it has long been understood that request for legal council on behalf of the Board of Education go through the board president however know where in the aps Board of Education governance manual does it specifically state that all requests for legal counsel which are charged to the district should go through the board president therefore it is recommended for clarity's sake that the government's manual be amended in a few places to make the rules of the board president and board members abundantly clear as it pertains to legal counsel the recommendations are included in the action report for this agenda item first we are starting with Section 4D which is board responsibilities and Authority this is on page 9 if the manual after item four the following five

[00:29:00]
board members with the exception of the board president will not make requests of nor seek legal advice from lawyers or law firms whether in house or outside of APs on issues not authorized to be a board approval 6 board members will not provide constituent services that belong to the administration and will instead relay those requests to the superintendent or board Services office 7 board members will not give directives or instructions to District or School Employees the superintendent is the board's only employee next we recommend that for the final item in this list which will become number nine we add board members to the beginning of the system sentence to make it consistent so it will read 9 board members will adhere to the boards guard rails and finally we recommend adding to section 483 roles and responsibilities this is page 12 in your manual or it talks about the role of the president after

[00:30:00]
5 seek legal council on behalf of the board when necessary you said just a point of clarification for the third recommendation add to 483 and there's a listing of YES Madam president

[00:31:00]
will at least in my manual Miss Martinez I think the way that it's listed in our manual their letters it would be it would be L maybe it would be a letter letter five the number five and it would be letter e so it would come after finer cause to be signed all resolutions contracts and other instruments then after that seek legal council on behalf of the board when necessary yes it's 48 so yeah you're right it is as letters so we are looking at 1:23

[00:32:00]
item D it'll make a new number e and everything else will bump down so under item D so I'm at right now at 4-H item D sign or cause to be signed inserted after that sentence is seek legal council on behalf of the board when necessary thank you for that clarification member Jackson so you're in item 3D is that correct she's in 4833 dot dot dot dot dot so where the insertion would be that legal council on behalf of the board when necessary would become four h

[00:33:00]
Bree and then everything else underneath that would bump down a letter word and then I'm sure I'd like to apologize in the hosted version of the governance manual it does she's number so that's where the confusion came from so we'll work on getting that consistent hey Sal I think you're not muted any any discussions to to our governance manual

[00:34:00]
yes indeed okay if there is no discussion further discussion or clarifications then I'm going to ask for a motion I move to recommend approval of the amendments to the aps Board of Education governance manual emphasizing the board president's role in seeking legal counsel on the boards behalf this is Courtney

[00:35:00]
yes moving on to item 4.3 our next item for consideration in action is considered recommending for approval the archiving of fiscal management D policies that are administrative or included in the budget policy and once again are Jessica Martinez are policy analyst and perhaps some for introducing that action the finance department found that 12 physical management of being administrative these these policies have been requested by The Board review

[00:36:00]
is 6 Pollock should remain on the books six more fiscal management policies are still under review but we ask that you do recommend to the board that the 12 fiscal management policies be archived those policies are de fiscal management goals DB annual budget process DB1 operational cash fund balances db2 budget transfers and amendments DG check services and signatory Authority di2 external auditing DJ Central purchasing DJ one purchase and project approval DJ 233 of contracts and DK payroll procedures available if you have questions clarification this is all work

[00:37:00]
is this part of the the previous policy committee or ad hoc committees work or is this something that began a new with the New Year policies that the ad hoc committee requested additional review from last summer so as we've gone through the process of reviewing the policies in chunks and was one that was requested for a departmental review and like I stated there are a few that that are still in question about whether you know we need to keep them or further review are there any questions

[00:38:00]
if not then let's proceed with emotion please I moved to recommend for approval the archiving of physical management D policies that are administrative or included in the budget policy this is Courtney rentals please number five discussion items our next item for consideration is the government Affairs update and Jessica Martinez and Dr Joseph

[00:39:00]
Escobedo the government Affairs team are here to report their fun they had in Santa Fe Joseph Martinez case and dealing with the performance of public education in New Mexico you should know legislators were very supportive and knowledgeable of the shift of

[00:40:00]
play outcomes Focus governance and the priority that you're placing on that I would say most of the Albuquerque legislators really engaged with us and express confidence in the emerging stronger strategic plan and so just a couple of days you should be aware of March 6th which is Wednesday that is the deadline for the governor to sign it legislation that is not acted on by her is pocket veto so popular legislation that is not a general appropriation if it doesn't have an emergency classic goes into effect May 15th so one of those so we're going to talk about a couple of those pieces and I'll pass it over so we have a few people

[00:41:00]
places that are going to be affecting a PS that we want to share with you starting with Senate Bill 275 which is our capital outlay projects these are awaiting the governor's signature and are still subject to line item veto so we'll know more on those Wednesday Senate Bill 275 set aside about 1.4 billion for brick-and-mortar projects throughout New Mexico APS received 16.65 million dollars in capital Appropriations this is about 3.24 million more or a 20% increase 959 million 550533766

[00:42:00]
5,000,903,341 for insurance special Appropriations to APS include 4 million for school turn around pilot projects $160 million I'm sorry 160,000 for before and after school programs for middle schools 320,000 for summer and out of school time programs including literacy and map enrichment Selma Wellness life and career skills tutoring with an emphasis on under resource families these Appropriations are significant because we have not regularly received this type of funding we have also House Bill 171 which is high school graduation requirements this bill maintains the 24 credit requirement for graduation APS does required 25 credits to graduate the Administration has a working group that will bring you wreck

[00:43:00]
recommended changes to your current policy but here is a high-level overview of House Bill 171 elective offerings change from 7.5 units to 55 minutes elective offerings must now include financial literacy computer science student service learning Career Technical education courses and a sequence of languages other than English shall be offered as electives and this includes ASL media literacy and pre-apprenticeship programs may also be offered as electives each School District must establish to local discretionary units toward graduation the bill requires that the discretionary units be accepted by receiving schools if a student transfer School Districts The Next Step plan will now be developed at the end of 8th grade and includes options such as advanced placement International honors dual credit distance learning

[00:44:00]
Career Technical education and work-based learning courses or pre-apprenticeship programs we also have the addition of graduate profiles specific to each Community graduate profiles articulate the core competencies and subjects that are key to the graduates post High School Success there's a change to health education the bill removes the requirement for the public education department to approve which grade level health education can be offered and additional graduation units are now protected under the bill which protects the school district or Charter Schools authority to require more than 24 units for graduation elaborate on that last piece please please like the bill also protects the students opportunity to take advanced placement honors International back

[00:45:00]
etcetera how does it protect the students opportunity to share the the opportunity has has been available however the next step plan is going to allow students to build in those optional programs starting in their 8th grade year currently we don't do next step plans until just before students are about to graduate so this allows a little bit of looking ahead a little bit of planning for students as they start to project their secondary situation thank you and you're not saying contacts and the bill protects the school district school district authority to require more units for graduation so at the beginning you said we have 25 but the requirement is 24 so we can maintain the 25

[00:46:00]
I think my other question was going to the special special Appropriations I'm going to assume those are one time just this year will be watching is how quickly we get the award letter so we can use the funds and that's been a problem with some of the grants that were singing in real time right now thank you talking about the next step plans and the development and 8th grade and then each year into high school how are they planning to

[00:47:00]
make sure that those processes are occurring or the relationship between the 8th for kids when kids leave 8th grade and we designed the plan they go into High School how how are we going to make sure that those plans are going to be you know looked at and follow through discussion for a gap in communication on my second question is I know with kids with disabilities and especially with the three diplomas in the graduation of the you know the standard the modified and the ability are those plans going to be aligned with those two

[00:48:00]
or are they just are they going to be aligned with transition plans also I'm just wondering how that's all going to work and I will ask doctor I think that that's going to be a topic that we're going to need to have our our internal conversation figure out what that what that looks like I know that next step period

[00:49:00]
fill the document check the box I'm just trying to figure out if it's going to be more aligned and for those students to make sure that we are continually looking at those plans year to year because I think sometimes they sort of just drop off you know it's one of those things where I just that's what I was just wondering on that thank you so I'd like to raise one if if no one else is going to I guess I have some concerns about how we go about notifying parents early on about before and after school care especially in med school because if I heard you correctly in the number crunching

[00:50:00]
this year there was a million dollars that covered before school possibly after school care at the middle school level is that correct through the Boys and Girls Club but I just think I remembered Child Care being such a big deal when I was a single parent and so I want to make sure that we are giving parents a heads up right away about what what the Yeah the low 16000 for before and after school did I hear that correctly and so that is just for APS so they're still will be fine period

[00:51:00]
grants to supplement other before and after school programs in our school and Community Partnership department will apply for those and that'll be supplemental we just know we're getting $160 million or $160,000 to APS so we can count on that if it's not lied on an item veto oh okay well that puts me at ease in so we've got a whole lot of money 10 to 20 million for but actually you know if we choose to use the 300,000 that could be supplemental to the school time programs as well so you're looking at for 180000 which is half of what we needed to have the full program continue so there's hope and when

[00:52:00]
the anticipate knowing about those funds for where they land so the governor has until tomorrow or Wednesday to sign the bill so we'll know if anything got line out of vetoed and then that just starts the process with ped to put out the grants for the next school year and our departments applying for them so you'll see them in a cyclical pattern cuz you'll see them through the finance department you know come through for your approval as well so you know this is very first step of that so your experiences were assuming that it doesn't get pocket vetoed that were in good standing to continue those programs if need be I believe the school Community Partnership department will be able to use these Fun Center

[00:53:00]
we've communicated with them and I just have to say like you know like it was a tremendous feet for us to get you know this for 4.4 how was 4.5 million dollars in special Appropriations so I I've been doing this for 15 plus years and we haven't seen that so like I think we're really turning the corner on being a progressive and not just defensive and so I think you know I just really good news thank you if there are no other questions we're going to include literacy in math

[00:54:00]
restaurants are we including teachers in this whole summer program and then I just thought that was the second but on the third one why is swimming the only activity in there is it because it's summer I'm just wondering that because I know these are all new so I'm just addressing that so Madam chairwoman and board member of I believe there's always been the before and after school and 21st century this is specific to APS so the wording in this is is specifically but I think it'll just supplement the current programs and that we are already have underway so I don't think it'll be necessarily an opportunity to develop absolutely apologize okay thank you

[00:55:00]
the specific mention of swimming may have to do and we don't have all the information on this yet but I think that it may have to do with the limited number of swimming pools and you know contract out the time and and use of the facility okay yeah that's what I was wondering too cuz we don't have those facilities they're scattered thank you if there are no more questions we're going to move on to the final final item and that is the chair report in keeping with the work of the previous policy diet slash review policy review at home the policy committee's work will pause after tonight while the administration continues to review the remainder of the policies ranked for

[00:56:00]
down below and I'm going to take the time to give a brief reminder that the policy diet review process uses a scale of 0 to 10 to rank existing policies 0 to 4:00 identify policies that require administrative expertise a 5 identities that require both equally governance and administrative expertise and 6 to 1055 policies that require the boards expertise there are about 40 Pollock that last year's ad hoc committee reviewed these 40 are currently undergoing review by the administration along with their corresponding procedural directives once the administration finishes its review of those policies they will make recommendations for archiving The policies will be put on a consent agenda for a regular board meeting

[00:57:00]
or the administration may decide to return some policies to the policy committee for further review based on statute or some other solid reason then board staff will begin the next steps in the policy diet process and that is deciding whether to keep to delete or to modify those policies that last year's policy ad-hoc committee ranked 56 or 7:00 and so remember that is 4 or 5:00 and administrative expertise equally a score of 67 prime merely requires board expertise board staff will recommend these policies right to the board at large for archiving updating or keeping those recommended for archiving or for minor updating will be added to the consent agendas of upcoming board meeting

[00:58:00]
maybe appointed to work with board staff on updating policies deemed in need of modification these policies requiring modification will then go to the policy committee for review and recommendation as described in the governance manual the policy review or the policy diet stall for about a month while our policy analyst Jessica Martinez was wearing her other hat as a government liaison but she is back and in the swing of things and hopes to have much of this worked up this summer let me just say there's a ton of work that's gone on in the background so we want to announce the date of the next policy committee meeting tonight but we will let you know in plenty of time when we plan to reconvene thank you to board staff staff at large and previous committee members for the work you have done to ensure that our policies

[00:59:00]
the line with the board skulls guard rails delegation and governance responsibilities and with that mouthful unless you have questions by adjourn this meeting
