[00:01:00]
Twisted May 1st policy committee meeting minutes of second great thank you we have a motion in a second from the motion was remember the second remember Jackson may we have a roll call please Yolanda onto a Cordova yes they give me a little Arizona is on page 15 of your

[00:02:00]
Sonic documents changes to the procedural objective include alignment of language clarifying language regarding the hearing process and alignment with legal references this procedural directive is duplicated in the handbook this is a discussion item that will be finalized by the cabinet doctors Chanel Segura and Melody legal counsel from module Sperling are here to assist with comments and questions thank you as Miss Riser noted many of these are procedural directives and best for discussion only so there won't be a vote but with that I'd like to open it to discussion to see if anyone has any questions or comments I just had something Madam chair so under the remote and I did get this like answered but still under removable of extra-curricular privileges and it says its students may be removed at the discretion of the principal from any part or all extracurricular privileges for the time period equal to suspension so my question

[00:03:00]
does discretion and what one principal will do is going to be different than another one having work for different principals something that would principal would just go no big deal another principal would think it was a big deal and so I mean I just for they say you they may be removed and there is under these five bullets there's not a lot there to tell the principal what they have to do so that's just that's just my concern that it's at the discretion and then that they may be removed not that they shall be removed and Madame chairman of the board absolutely I also feel that if a student is you know suspended from school for academics then extracurriculars also applies and so I believe that that should be students

[00:04:00]
Shelby and it's just that if they I mean they are they aren't they aren't in school and so I don't know if that's like you know statute anywhere in there so whatever it is that needs to be done is so then I guess we would also need to strike at the discretion of the principal it's up to you all so students shall be removed from any part or all extra curricular Privileges and that you'll take back for everybody to look at that anyhow right so cuz that's not it's not us so okay thank you thank you members anymore discussion on this item or questions and

[00:05:00]
but I'm curious about how Administration is moving toward addressing our board adopted goals and guardrails as you look at these revisions and and it doesn't mean that I'm just curious about how what the impact is on the thinking as and discussions we have absolutely been using our goals and guardrails as a lens so when we look at things such as you know as Equity we want to make sure that our policies and our procedural directives are applicable to all students across our district regardless of where they are in the district and so when we're looking at specific

[00:06:00]
suspension any type of removal from academics or extracurriculars we need to make sure which is why I appreciate board member Mueller out of guns request or suggestion regarding may be removed at the principal's discretion because that does create some inequity if principals feel one way at one school versus another so that is part of what we're doing is we look through and moving forward with our procedural directors looking at like data on is there a particular kind of stupid and black students I know that a few years back we had

[00:07:00]
disproportionately High rate of expulsions among black female students which surprised me and so that's what I'm I guess that's the lens that I'm interested in how are we collecting data on these populations or what are the plans to do that and how will we delve deeper into if there is disproportionate number of kids in any given category how do we how do we begin to think about that and again it's it's looking to the Future right but I think it also requires us to start collecting that kind of information now

[00:08:00]
Madam chair and board minger board member Dominguez we are currently working on pulling all the data the disciplinary data from this school year and breaking it disaggregating it so we can have a clearer picture on where we may have an increase with some of those subgroups that you have mentioned we are planning on presenting this at the beginning of next school year so that we are following along with our procedural directive as well to present this information to you all but something else I think that needs to be noted is that we have worked this year with our principals to make sure that they are entering our students their student discipline in Synergy so that we are it's not just an issue of equity regarding the consequence but also the documentation of it so

[00:09:00]
we had some individuals who were maybe documenting it on a Google sheet or a Google form and so we need we really worked to make sure that principals were clear that all disciplinary information needs to be put into our Synergy student information system May and I'm going a little bit here what are we doing in terms of restorative practices we did something today as I recall yes so we met today to discuss what next steps look like as a committee there has been a working committee who has worked to determine which direction we want to go because at this point in time or I'll take us back a few months in my observation what I realized is that our district has undergone multiple iterations of restorative practice training restorative justice conflict mediation

[00:10:00]
and so I felt like we needed a reset to start over and to get us all in the same page and so I believe that our task force has determined goodness and I think I have the information here okay yes so foundational training will be conducted on July 14th by restorative justice education and they are out of Fort Collins Colorado this training is for all school and District administrators and then ongoing support will be provided for schools this year in a differentiated format beginning in September so we have identified the organization that we would like to work with and at this point will move forward on the task force will move forward with specifics after the foundational training

[00:11:00]
okay and thank you for that update on the start of practices and I had another fleeting thought and I think it had to do with how how we deal with long-term suspensions and short-term suspensions in relationship to our goals like and uninterrupted education while giving students consequences for for serious violations so that's I think that's what's down the line that's what concerns me is the impact of these suspensions consequences on

[00:12:00]
on our goals thank you remember Dominguez I think just also important to remember that the US Department of Education Office of civil rights does also require the reporting of exclusionary just one data disaggregated by race ethnicity as well so hopefully we are doing our federal reporting job there so the data should be clean and available any other questions on this one before we move on to the next procedural directive which is agenda Item B I just have one quick question so I hope I'm on the right one still I'm trying to in my mind I know long-term suspension expulsion they're so like I mean because hopefully expulsion is like you know it seems very grave because there's some significant consequences their students not allowed to be enrolled in in the district or we're not

[00:13:00]
who's been expelled somewhere else so those students where do they go so long term suspension and expulsion for general public schools for students with an IEP they go back to their IEP team to look at those Services when we talked about long-term suspension long-term suspension is for until the end of a semester so okay when a student is long term suspended if they are in special education they go back to the IEP team to look at what services are

[00:14:00]
excited for our general ed students for Middle School we have Vision Quest available and for high school students we have continuation school available and I'm just trying to you know just trying to think in my mind in terms of the I mean I understand the process they go through hearing officers and so on and so forth I'm just trying to think of like what are some options for our families and our children that are in that space right I think a lot of them end up in our charter schools because there's no I mean they they could matriculate through an APS Charter correct yes I mean they're just not in our regular or traditional schools but they're still there's a potential for them to be in an APS Charter I just want our kids to be somewhere I mean I'd rather them be

[00:15:00]
their kids are not attending school so expulsion has a time limit as well exclamation point they still wouldn't be able to come back until the following spring could be longer as well but one calendar year or longer okay and generally with those students that you know expulsion I mean because it's got to be pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty big I mean a big issue that's going on there so are we just we're not under any kind of obligation in terms of like referring them to other things or addressing you know just giving family some resources or things like this or we just say you're out

[00:16:00]
I mean how do we do that we do have resources through the hearing officer through Charter Schools any any resources that we have depending on what the violation is provide to the family the family A lot of times by the time they come to hearing of already made a choice of what they're going to do until they can return period And I would assume it's not very I mean I don't know I mean I'm in the dark I don't even know what our numbers are terms of expulsion or what that looks like so I'm looking forward to that I will tell you our data has our number of hearings and number of students has been in long-term has been expelled has greatly decreased over the years and again this year and we'll show you that that all right thank you thank you I want to acknowledge that member Peterson has her hand up but I think maybe remember Jackson has some questions too but I wanted to before transitioning to remember Peterson follow up on one of the questions raised by

[00:17:00]
which I wasn't familiar with so can you share a little bit more about how many students are enrolled in where is it located and one site was closed because we did not have enough students so we collapsed that set and then I'm not sure which location

[00:18:00]
there was a fairly small number of students middle school students that went through hearing that that ended up at Vision Quest which is why once I was closed I think second semester every single middle school student that came through the hearing process was referred to Vision Quest and I believe there were I don't have I don't have my dad in front of me but around 20 that were referred our numbers are a lot lower than the numbers you'll see it was in a lot of students to refer but every student that came through was referred division so when I looked it up on sapper the enrollment shows in 2017 6 students and 2018 five students in 2019 7 students 20214 students in this year one student so I guess my question is what the long-term theory of change or efficiency of having a operating a program what res

[00:19:00]
horses does it take if we are serving a population of anywhere from 1:00 to 6 students and just sort of how do you think about Vision Quest as it sits in the overall strategy no Madam chair members of the board I think that goes back to like program efficacy and is what we're doing working so when we look at that data and again when we get all of this data and put it together to do that presentation for you all in the fall that will be part of it because mid I mean we have to look at the data immediately when we realized oh there's only a few students here in a few students here and we have all of these FTE for those few students to say they didn't need them they did however we also have schools where we have 30 students sitting in a classroom with a substitute and so we you know we put those teachers back into the classroom

[00:20:00]
and condensed it to one fight so looking at that I have not had the chance to look at it but when we do those decisions are going to have to be made and looking at alternative programming that could be offered that's not going to encumber such a large number of FTE because our FTE are needed everywhere so can you just remind us what's the time frame for that we're looking in the fall so August September I believe remember Peterson is unpredictable so I'm going to throw out some things that are sort of overarching for the whole discussion I'm going to participate as much as I can I'm pulled over on the side right now but I need to get back on the road so I'm not sure

[00:21:00]
I think the the overarching idea if this entire conversation really is how are we teaching kids and whether you know whether it's the most minor kind of infraction for a kindergartener or whether it's the most major kind of infection for high school student our mission is still has to be to educate them not just academically but how do we live in a community with each other and so I'm happy to hear that there's motion on restorative practices I hope that we leave through that Community connections because they're strong Community Partnerships and I think part of restorative practices have to include Community for understanding

[00:22:00]
what the what the goal is and what the process is as we do restorative practices I'm yeah I mean that's that's the main thing we have an obligation to be educating so we're looking at repurposing schools as we're looking at choice schools and all of that we have some really successful programs school on Wheels Freedom High new Futures when we take on providing services for group of students that are not working in a Traditional School setting we do a good job with those students and it seems to me that instead of marginal efforts to serve kids

[00:23:00]
seriously how how could we provide services in a real education for kids that are facing expulsion because there may be some legal things involved there may be extreme cases where we can't do that and there are other settings but I think it's something that we need to take on because we can do it well when we do it those those are my main one other thing that I wanted to say is that I really agree with sports and discrimination based on from one school to another but

[00:24:00]
it's not it's not the framework we need but I don't think we can impose it I think that it needs to be developed first with staffs at the school site and then with principals in a task force that's across schools for what what should consequences be because the internet we use the nmaa is an excuse sometimes for excluding children but apparently they don't have strict guidelines so we should be able to form them in a way that the educational

[00:25:00]
I think we can weave it into our further conversation but I do want to emphasize that I you know agree and in many conversations have had the need for consistency throughout the district and I'm trying to align and get things to where they need to be so that they're when we're looking at Equity that we don't continue with some of the inequities we've had in how you know from school to school so that is something that we are looking at period I think when we try to have one one

[00:26:00]
practitioners we've got engaged in schools to see what really is working and what's not working and put more support they need for really implementing restorative practices in a meaningful way but thank you I mean I am very happy to hear that there's there's a plan there's a road forward now and I and I truly appreciate that thank you remember Peterson thank you so looking at page 20 of the digital packet so first of all I that the the red but the inserted language and first of all I appreciate that that language was inserted probably on a personal level but I appreciate that thought was in there but I have two questions is it in there because I think I read later on that that statutory that there was a statue and so that language is in there

[00:27:00]
which was just brought up and we were discussing Charters I don't know if there might not be a conflict because the answer to the question it says the district shall deny enrollment and then the answer to the question was but a child who is expelled or cannot enroll in an APS Traditional School can enroll in an APS charter school so is that now in Conflict like would I I I'm wondering if that language just needs to be because the way I would read it is if it's an APS Charter or an APS traditional what no matter how it's the Epps District you cannot enroll and you'll need to go to an MPD Charter but the answers to the question was they could enter an APS Charter so

[00:28:00]
there seems to be discrepancy so the paragraph is actually written that if you look at that last night I'm sorry remember Jackson where we would take the information to our chief of schools to have a conversation and what we've done is we've actually added a checkbox into synergies that their parents have to answer the questions are you long-term suspended or expelled from your current school or the previous School you attended if a school misses that and enrolls a student then we could go back and look to you know but we're trying to add some safe cards around students with serious behaviors at in other districts as for Charter Schools charter schools have the same guidelines they could choose to enroll or not to enroll Justin so to clarify the question though

[00:29:00]
let's say that they did let's say somebody comes from ABC private school in Albuquerque and they have been expelled from ABC private school which means that they now cannot according to this cannot enter an APS District school does APS District include the traditional and the charters it does not remember Jackson it does not include APS charter schools so APS public school is separate and apart from an APS Charter School okay okay that answers my question read thank you before I go back to member Dominguez I had one question that I had submitted late and it's sort of in response to a little bit of what number was speaking to about the process but the question is who are the hearing officers what are their qualifications did they typically have any expertise in child and add

[00:30:00]
do they understand the impacts of childhood trauma and Aces on student behavior and decision-making so who are they and what are their qualifications so we made some member Gonzalez we made some major changes to the hearing office this last school year about mid-september when they position opened we changed it to a more of a contract position and all of our hearing officers are retired administrators who do have an educational background an administrative background and so they do have the knowledge of what's good for schools we look at what interventions have been put in place and so they're we've created a more comprehensive system of looking at the students when they come to the hearing and our hearing officers do understand students to educational process and so is there any specific qualification related to demonstrating understanding

[00:31:00]
go to Child Development and bases I think that training because it's it's constantly changing and I'm not quite sure you'd have to speak more to that at TC that we look at the minimum minimum qualifications of the educational background the administrative licensure and their knowledge of of the educational setting but I'm not quite sure what the training looks like of for them I know they do get training through legal counsel and I'm not quite sure if Aces and all of that is part of that I know it as part of the hearing process those considerations are put in place because you are learning about a student's point until they get to where they are sitting in front of you and so those things are discussed I'm just not quite sure what kind of training is involved and maybe that is if it's not that needs to be incorporated

[00:32:00]
so one of the things and chairperson Gonzales that I can say is I have been advising student services now for over a decade so I have seen numerous iterations of the hearing office and where it stands today in terms of the change this past year to having basically a pool of hearing officers and all of those hearing officers are former Educators former administrators individuals that you know have been in the classroom have run a school so they are already come from that background and then in terms of the training that really TC implemented over this past year was us really taking a look at the hearing process on the structure the nice thing is is a lot of the hearing officers have themselves sat in the administrators position and have had to put on a hearing for a hearing officer in the past

[00:33:00]
but we went through you know the handbook the process that needs to be followed considerations that need to be followed I personally do not sit in in every disciplinary hearing I only become involved if the parent or the guardian brings legal counsel to a hearing so I have seen my fair share of hearings and this year they have run extremely smoothly and in a real good process and then I believe there will be training again in the fall before the school year starts based on the new student handbook thank you for that and thank you for the improvements to the hearing process and the Contracting of hearing officers I do think worth exploring what additional training are opportunities might be made available I think typically retired administrators are a little bit more old school on some of the disciplinary approaches and maybe less up to date on some of the new and developing research on Child Development brain development and implications for behavior and decisions so

[00:34:00]
just another suggestion and I will turn back to member Dominguez I'm going to Echo that sentiment when I look at these kids the kids who are getting in trouble you know they're they're dealing with trauma and I think mental Behavioral Health needs and and so I worry that we aren't appropriately with those kids

[00:35:00]
we need a different option and and I finally remembered the question I think it was first semester of this year I attended a a brief workshop with Chris Chapman and I just wondered if he struck me as someone who was well informed and had a program and board member Dominguez I would have to speak

[00:36:00]
with the individuals in the task force regarding what that looks like and how they came to decide upon this organization this is the information that I have right now I think I can bring a Tanya compost up to speak a little bit more to it it is in her department and they've been working on it quite a bit the board member I believe Chris Chapman was an individual that we had been looking at we've always are looking at multiple people one of the things is who's out there who can bring different perspectives right now so that was more I think just kind of a conversation

[00:37:00]
headed to meet with him one of the people we've been working with gosh we're probably about 5 years now which is very similar is Dr shiroki Holly who does the cultural linguistic teaching and training he's out of La we actually connected with him initially through the New Mexico PD office and he's he's actually been on contract with us for several years he does similar work with Dr Chris Chapman did another reason why we already had someone actually very similar on board he does a lot his work is not restorative practices because he's really focusing on is behaviors and there's multiple different types of behaviors that he looks at in fact the number one Behavior you said that word

[00:38:00]
what is the number one outside of anything else that we have that schools have to really understand in terms of our students coming from an age culture on there so he does a lot of work related to that in terms of how to identify behaviors are they where are they at more appropriately doesn't mean that it's a per se bad behavior but where is that coming from and how is Educators can kind of redirect those behaviors more appropriately and educational setting that doesn't have to be punitive basically it's an educational moment for our students as well as our staff to talk about how as adults and staff and we can model that as well so he's one of the many people we already have on contract that's doing phenomenal work as well as again we're looking at particular store to practices vendors of one of the things we've noticed and I just want to add in about like Google absolutely there's some wonderful people who are doing locally restorative practices

[00:39:00]
work but we're finding though is that their they don't have the capacity within themselves to be able to tackle a district the size so what we're trying to do and right now for Colorado seems like they really have the edge on that there's a number of larger restorative practices organizations out of Colorado that have that large capacity that could take on a district like us but the caveat is that they need to work also with our local community and that's one of the key things and that's one of the things that this organization is coming in July is known for is really partnering with local communities in fact that their framework is out of indigenous lens and they've done work with they haven't done work specifically with New Mexico tribal communities but they've done in Colorado and Montana so they actually are working much more on an indigenous framework than I've seen for any other vendor out there in terms of

[00:40:00]
so it's that combination of bringing someone who has that capacity but really connecting with our local communities cuz that's really the heart of how it's really going to you know go in because those local community members have already the buy-in from the community on their thank you that's that's encouraging could you give me the name of the organization again please it is a board member I have to practice that almost every we're started practices organization starts with restorative so they can be very confusing but this one's restorative justice education out of for Collins they're also working right now with the Denver public schools and they're doing some really good connections Not only would Denver but working with their local colleges and universities to partner as a Continuum and also

[00:41:00]
certificates and course credit for their or Educators in terms of working with the universities there so again they're really known as good collaborative collaborators book community and education wise thank you thank you Miss compost and board member Dominguez I think we have one last and I just wanted to flag off of chairperson Gonzalez's concerns around the hearing officers I do want to put a plug in there for making sure that it's sort of a generational piece on there because I think there's there's going to be different perspectives in terms of the age in terms of what hearing officers look like as well but I also want to say it would be really helpful to have someone with a mental health background on there as well so whether it's a social worker or counselor

[00:42:00]
be be a way to just make sure that we're also not just missing some undiagnosed piece as well because I think sometimes our children will fall through the cracks and it's easy to say it's so easy to say the family didn't follow through or the student didn't follow through but it's not really about following through sometimes it's because the way that something's been presented or the type of referral or the mechanism for that referral is not necessarily workable but I would highly highly recommend a mental health professionals part of a hearing officer lead on their president Montoya quarterback I did want to add one piece another action that was added this year for the hearing process is that for a school to bring a student to a hearing they must answer a series of questions for their Associates superintendent who does work very closely with

[00:43:00]
and they look at the child as a whole what is the background of the student had they been referred to Saturday and special education do they have a 504 and what interventions have been put in place because our Associates are the ones that oversee and and work directly with the schools by the time the student gets to the hearing process the hearing processes is very simple the hearing officer looks at is there evidence that a violation was committed yes or no and then do they in looking at the data and the evidence do they either uphold what is recommended by the school or not uphold but there isn't a process for the hearing officer to say you should go back and you know go to your mental health professional that really is the process that are Associates are looking at prior to a student coming through a very well then obviously through that process

[00:44:00]
list of the discovery cuz it sounds like there's this whole piece around you know discovering putting a case together if you will I'm hoping then that one of those assessments that's being done is aces you know is understanding you know what were some of the aces for this particular child coming in that brought them to this piece because I think that needs to be understood for sure because that whole you know so if the school is not prepared to do a trauma formed approach dealing with a number of Aces then it's no wonder that they may get expelled or they might get long-term suspended so I think one is just making sure that that's part of of a lens that they're looking at that from too because that could very well help us sort of understand the Gap to in terms of our schools and being able to really be a trauma-informed approach or a understanding how they might want to work

[00:45:00]
that thing so maybe that's part of it as well and when they do come to hearing the hearing officer cannot give a higher disciplinary action that people has recommended but they can give lower and quite a few of the hearings have resulted in contracts back to the school oh nice okay thank you thank you for that I'm sure if I may just explain that what Aces is adverse childhood experiences I know that some individuals I heard some Whispers Larry's a lot of educational jargon we have it was awesome thank you for that and I know we already did begin to have a bit more of a broader conversation than just the red line so I think we'll probably continue to do that as we go but with that we'll go ahead and move to agenda item for B which is presentation of revisions to administrative procedural directive student participation in activities and Athletics restrictions related to controlled substance alcohol and tobacco and for

[00:46:00]
executive director of the student family and employee service center and Dr Gabriel Gabriella Duran Blakey chief operations officer is what my script says but I'm happy to go with whatever you all want this procedure has minor changes to line with the updated handbook this content is also duplicated in the proposed student handbook for next year this is a discussion item that will be finalized by the cabinet and we now stand for your comments and questions great thank you board members are there any comments or questions I had a question remember Jackson thank you so I did send in this question but I don't know that I'm still confused so okay so page 24 sorry page 23 to 24 the used and or possession and the just so the discussion so first

[00:47:00]
play elevation you are out for 10 school days right okay then you go to you go to pip and if you have a second violation if you can show completion of pip then you are eligible to be out for 30 days okay but then reading down it says second violation if you have not shown completion so let's say you have your first violation you're out for 10 days you get it you didn't do it then you come back the way this reads to me is if you didn't do pip and you get your second violation you are now out for the remainder of the academic year but the answer that I got was when you can do pip again or you can try to do pipe again even if you have a second violation so those seem to be different in their fighting each other conflict thank you I mean we were talking about why didn't I know that word I remember Jackson I shouldn't have answered the question that way you were correct

[00:48:00]
then they do get that extra opportunity to continue to play if they don't do that don't go through any prevention methods and they would be out and the the answer that I gave us more for the handbook side for other violations the other stuff okay and that was going to be a follow-up question so you've already answered it was that those again seemed to be in Conflict okay so I think the only the only other question I have is I'm just curious why it was changed to school from calendar I just noticed that so I'm curious as to why seems like maybe changing it to school kind of creates more on page 23 and 24 versus 10 school days and said 10 calendar days I'm in favor of it being school don't get me wrong but I'm just curious remember Jackson I believe it was supposed to be school last year and we missed it the old handbook had calendar

[00:49:00]
to have a violation in December say right before a break then they could go right back to school in their violation is over without really any so it is we updated it to make sure it was consistent and said School throughout fantastic I'm in favor that it was caught and so I was just curious as to why and then I think just my last question is you know over the course both last year and this year we kind of hear from high school principals how this actually works in practicality so what kind of feedback did you receive from high school principals regarding this issue in particular like you have some football players who are drinking on the weekend but they get to come back 10 days later we have a high school principal right behind us would be like her answer but the changes that were made by our high school principals and brought forward this year during our working groups so these are changes suggested by

[00:50:00]
sorry I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that person Gonzalez members of the board and superintendent Elder the beauty of this committee and the work that we've done here is we formed a principal committee so our voices were heard because we are the people on the ground that are doing the work so we were able to provide feedback have some really deep conversations you know we discussed the law that was in place policy and procedure and then we did look at the different consequences as we went through this process so do you mind repeating your questions so I make sure that I answer your question well yeah but thank you for that lead in like I'm happy to hear that and I'm sure the whole board is happy to know that your voice is were heard and the question was do you think that this is an actual

[00:51:00]
do you think this is a deterrent to what's the to somebody else the volleyball players who are partying on the weekend and get caught and they're like Emily out for 10 days no big deal do you think this is actually a deterrent I coming from the point of view of this you know the high school and students I think this is definitely a fair and Equitable consequence for them because I'm in past it had been I believe 45 days and for 45 days I mean they're like when we're looking at adolescents you know they make some bad decisions and you know that's their entire season so our students work very hard you know our athletes student athletes two participate and be members of the school community and they made a mistake and so that I think this allows for them to be able to return back and say hey not doing that again

[00:52:00]
like data like how how often do the kids get to the second and third violation I just think that would be it doesn't have to be tomorrow but just interesting to see how it actually plays out in in the real world so thank you for the the background and I'm glad to know that the principals had such a strong voice right thank you both remember more I know I'm I'm just glad they're not out for so many days that was just so this is a win for the kids so that's that's a good thing so I know I didn't and I'm just going to put it out there I had asked some dick you know for some data and I just want to make sure because I was told that coaches are not going to feel rosters so a child is

[00:53:00]
suspended and the tryouts are over so they can come back and try outs are all finished for soccer they're done so the coach has to wait to allow whoever was suspended that wanted to try out and wasn't able to be there they have to give them that opportunity so they wait on filling that roster until the child who has been suspended is able to try out and that is across the board every school every sport correct remember Mueller Aragon on page 23 that third bullet does say that the student is serving a suspension cannot try out participate during the suspension however a coach shall provide a tryout opportunity to a student wants to suspension is complete I did speak with our athletic director and he said that is what coaches are taught good okay I'm glad about that and then the

[00:54:00]
is there a question is I I mean I would also like to have some data about who this disproportionately affects you know is that you know is that females is it you know are there more football players that get in trouble that I mean are there is it more you know our African-American students are Hispanic students who is it really affecting and I know I asked that question and you said that you have to review how this data was entered into Synergy but I think that's data that would be really important for us to to know who it's really affecting what sports it may affect and I mean cuz I think that would tell us a lot about what we may need to do to make things better so whenever you get it if you could just share it with us that be great thank you great thank you yes yes thank you regarding Kim if I

[00:55:00]
from a previous presentation maybe a year ago lack of follow through with cited as one reason for 50% participation or completion rate for that program so I guess it's more of a comment we can't continue to do the same thing at some point I'd like to know how we are addressing substance abuse and kids are going out and getting drunk on weekends then it's not just that moment so how are we providing opportunities

[00:56:00]
a learning experience that comes with the consequence yeah and and just reconsidering doing something different than what we've got in place that's it thank you madam chair and board member Dominguez we did have this conversation with our staff regarding pip and its efficacy what we determined and what we heard loudly from principals is that hip is something that we do after the fact and what is needed is prevention education and I don't know if we all remember back in the day we had the Dare keep kids off drugs program I think I still might have my t-shirt from elementary

[00:57:00]
but nonetheless that Grant went away and so did the prevention programming and so we're looking at we actually put forth a recommendation to be able to hire two additional Crossroads counselors to be able to work with our elementary and middle schools with prevention it's it's definitely needed and we're seeing our principles are seeing the vaping and the smoking and the drugs that are getting I mean the escalation and just the level in severity of drug use has increased and so we know that there's a need and we are also looking to partner with our community members regarding what resources they may have because we can't do it alone when our kids leave our schools they're going into the community and we need partnership and wrap around in our in our entire city so that's part of what we're doing at this

[00:58:00]
this time I'm going to I had a reaction to your when you mentioned their the Dare program quite frankly as a parent I was horrified because it just I thought of you know other parents and kids that I knew and it was shaming it gave know what is a child do when your child is in a household you know I mean parents still need to have you still need to talk about parents with a sense of dignity and respect because that child is going home to that parents and and Jared did not do that so and I did speak to the officer afterwards but

[00:59:00]
I hope we've evolved since then thank you thank you remember Dominguez are there any other questions or comments on this procedural directive I just have a quick question so and thank you Dr Segura you mentioned that adding two additional crossword counselors to add to middle and elementary because we only have two Crossroad counselors going through all the middle schools yeah and I mean I mean I think just adolescents as a whole that's the age where risk begins and so I think it would be great to to really think and utilize our own data I'm assuming we probably have yrs data that tells us a little bit about the risk our kids are taking at that age or anything that we might have to add some some additional Sports there cuz I

[01:00:00]
counselors for just the middle schools is adequate right we have the two right now and they've requested to add two additional so that they can work with the middle and elementary in their Zone okay thank you great thank you we will move on to each item four seats up with students regarding all substances and there was an hour and we lost you but I think Dr

[01:01:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:02:00]
I would really like to hear some crossword counselors and with the results of it what is what's the success rate of it what's the participation rate and whatever information

[01:03:00]
specific data points that need to come out of pip I did want to respond quickly to the other question that was asked and that pip isn't that the presentation we did a few years ago pip changed drastically since then and it used to be several Day program in it was taken down to one day which changed how many people could come and that they would participate because it's all they had to do is show up for one day so we didn't see people that you know showed up for one day and then they were there for the others which means they didn't complete pit so anyway you can't complete it now if you go is it to leave early and so it's a it's a one day one evening it's not all day it's an evening program and the way that it works right now with the middle schools is the crossroad counselors are doing for middle school so in order to do the preventive programming that girl was talking about we need more counselors and in the high schools they do both because they have a

[01:04:00]
but right now in the middle school that's all they can handle is doing the PIP programming for the whole District great thank you for that remember let me guess your hand is up is do you have another question or comment or okay so we thank you all and we will go ahead and move to agenda item for C presentation of revisions to administrative procedural directive for student dress TC and Dr you have the floor this proactive is on page 28 of your electronic documents this procedural doctor has updates to prohibited clothing items options for students not following the School dress code and guidance for elective courses with specific dress and or hair requirements this is a discussion item that will be finalized with the cabinet and we stand for your comments and questions great thank you for that to any questions or comments on this one I mean Madam chair the only thing I would like again is data

[01:05:00]
about who gets and this is just what I've heard it may not be true or not is the violations for student dress disproportionately go toward girls and so I just want to know if that's you know if that's true or not and I mean I just personally have a hard time punishing students based on their clothing choices and I just wanted to let that be known out there so having had three daughters and how much trouble they got in for what they wore and then now I see things that weren't even around when my kids were the jeans are almost entire length of a leg and so I'm like okay they think it's cool you know I mean I'm like why am I paying that much money for that but just just what I think and just that I mean I'm just worried that it just is affecting more females than it is males so

[01:06:00]
so if if somebody is wearing I mean I see those I don't know what like muscle kind of shirts they can't wear those right yeah and I believe that every school has worked with each of their communities to determine their dress code which makes me nervous but at this time I think it's it's buried and it does create variation and that's what makes me nervous and inequities so I think at some schools a muscle shirt would be allowed and others it would not cuz I mean I'm just thinking about you know it had its said here like under clothing Warners primary clothing items well if at some schools where I've seen the guys can wear that you know a muscle shirt but if a girl or something similar than that and then she has a sports bra

[01:07:00]
and so I'm just concerned about the differences that there may be at different schools and just that I just don't want it to be something for a girl can say I'm you know it's just always happens but that seems to be the case so it's just something to where you all to just think about and just kind of let us know what that data is thank you remember the only time I have with that is I agree with you what you said Dr so good as that it does vary from school to school and that does make it for principles and you know Administration to really have something that's uniform across the district I know it's the way it is but I agree that I wish it was the same across the board that's it thank you remember Dominguez what kind of support do we give principals who are having a hard time with that issue

[01:08:00]
dress code specifically or gently I know you know principles have been vocal about you know how struggling with young women in particular and inevitably it's young women but young men also and it's interesting to be on this side of the conversation we had that conversation in my household provided to principles on interpretation of these policies so I mean when you struggle

[01:09:00]
I mean we do in the classroom and and administrators have to face you know kids that are thrown out of class because they are sagging inappropriately or wearing a sports bra even though they've got a tank top on how how does the district support the conversations that need to happen to address those remember to make us we have principal Laura Jean from Kennedy Middle School here to provide some input your person Dominguez members of the board and superintendent Elder I was speaking to my college so I have conversations with newer principals I like to take us back to a time when we were so grateful our students were back from covid and a lot of things were quote unquote let go because we were so excited for our students to be there were in our classrooms they were able to do an extent of Hands-On learning be with their peers and I think

[01:10:00]
some people have forgotten the the commitments they made to themselves about the importance of students being in school and learning and having access to material regardless what material is on their own body I think we are moving away from a time of traditional dress and we need to remember what we see is traditional male and female and not forget our non-binary and our members of LGT lgbtq plus Community I am a principal that I was here to the procedural directive and I use that my guideline and I do not have any other additional rules for my dress code because with my school my culture and my community it's very important that students are there and they're learning and that is more important than what they are wearing and I personally have not had issues with it so I'm very glad to be part of this working group in doing this work and making sure that our language is gender neutral because I am very cognizant as a school principal that dress code is has originated

[01:11:00]
I'm in the oppression of women and minorities and I think we need to keep that in mind and also where we are in today's time and what our focus is in our classrooms great great thank you for that and it does sound like an opportunity at a later date just to look at that data and explore and also just determine what additional what additional supports maybe needed are there other questions or comments on this one all right we will go ahead and move thank you for all of that we'll go ahead and move to agenda item for D presentation of the 2023 2024 APS handbook for Student Success and Miss Frazier you have before thank you good evening chairperson Gonzalez members of the committee and superintendent Elder we bring for your discussion the handbook for Student Success for the 2023 24 school year the handbook Begins the edited version of the begins on page 34 of your electronic documents the first section of the handbook Pages 2 through 23

[01:12:00]
the document has the minor updates to language updated goals and guard rails and updated or deleted links to policy and procedural directive as a reminder for policy or procedural directive is updated throughout the year of the link would still be to the most current document in the electronic version the second part of our handbook is the code of conduct this begins on page 24 of the handbook moving from electronic document page numbers but to your handbook page numbers here to make a little simpler so it begins on page 24 of the handbook the code of conduct section will have no changes during the school year and is formatted in a way that can be printed copies of the code of conduct can be requested from the service center and are or printed at any school the code of conduct was updated collaboratively through a working group that you heard about a little bit throughout the evening and just collect this working group met weekly from February 7th through May 30th the working group included for high school principals

[01:13:00]
5 middle school principals 6 elementary school principals our principal support Specialists and are associate superintendents so we had representation from all zones the working group collaborated with APS please the office of equal opportunity our counseling for Crossroads Crossroads program input and we had legal counsel the working group goals were to update the code of conduct to support consistency in disciplinary consequences across the district that was our main goal with consistency across the district while aligning to the policy and procedural drafted in Edition it was important that the language was clear and understood to our principles so that the principal group could train and discuss with their colleagues this summer was reviewed by all principals on May I think it was May 5th so some of the updates to the code of conduct

[01:14:00]
action was changed to violation that was to align to the language and Synergy consequence is now consequence / disposition because disposition is the language that is used in Synergy violations were reordered by severity and they were previously alphabetical up to language will utilize to give a maximum consequence but to allow for lower consequences to be listed Early Childhood basically Pre-K the third grade are separated into the consequences as those are not grades that would typically be considered for the hearing process all consequence sections State utilize intervention strategies the working group is continuing to meet and is drafting a separate document with intervention strategies and is working with both of practice Department in addition there is currently a group working on conflict mediation and restorative practices foundational training

[01:15:00]
will be conducted on July 14th by restorative justice education out of Fort Collins Colorado this training is for all school and District administrators ongoing support will be provided for schools this year in a differentiated format beginning in September as a reminder the Hamburg reviews and annual process and are working group will continue meeting later in July the handbook is for your discussion and it will be finalized by the cabinet later this month with that we stand for comments and questions but I do want to introduce we have Antoinette Valenzuela principal at Rio Grande High School Laura young principal Kennedy Middle School and Anna Travis principal Alameda Elementary School here to assist with any of the discussion questions and they were part of our working group great thank you for that Miss Frazier into the members of the working group who were present tonight in available to answer questions thank you for your work as part of the working group with that we will just open the floor to questions and comments on the handbook

[01:16:00]
all my questions my answer if not I'll go I'm sure I have more but just as I was trying to talk to you I was listening really intently different differentiated format training regarding restorative practices what what does that mean you're going to do a foundational training for all of the principles on July 14th and then a differentiated training how is it differentiated I could give a brief answer some schools are already a member Jackson some schools are already using restorative practices so that initial training is to get everyone on the same page and then they'll look at where each school is sitting with what they're currently doing to kind of differentiate so that we're not going back and retraining where they've already been trained and restored and practices in our inhabited UT

[01:17:00]
okay but I'm looking at you you said that we're bringing in restorative justice education from Fort Collins to kind of do foundational so that we're all on the same page because again going back to the beginning I think doctors are you said is we were all trained on not we everybody was trained on different aspects of this so when you differentiate the training are you going to make sure that everything's in line with one system remember Jackson correct so first the foundation is exactly that there are schools that are little different levels that have done work on the road so we want to make sure we're meeting them at that however we have not done a district wide training implementation on even what we mean by restorative practices sort of justice so we all need to have those found

[01:18:00]
additional understandings and definitions to make sure we're on one page is a district and be at that level and you know some again some schools some schools are a different levels but then some schools may be potentially think that they're at a higher level than they might be at that so we just need to make sure we're we're all together and consistent when using consistent wording so for instance when we say restorative conversation what is that mean we all need to be on that same page and then at that point so it's the balance of making sure as a district where line but then giving each School the autonomy and the flexibility develop something that's going to meet the needs of their school and so who will be determining that differentiation is that the the vendor that you've hired or is it a PS employees as you go in to these other schools how are you going to determine that who

[01:19:00]
that's clearly still a conversation we're having but probably will be a combination certainly we're looking at our trainers they are the expert they've done this with multiple school districts and multiple areas so they do have that expertise to come in and give us guidance but certainly we're also looking district-wide we're also part of this principal's working group I actually have no a subcommittee of principles working with this on restorative practices with or where their team so it will be that combination on there so we absolutely want to honor what schools have already done but again we do need to make sure everyone's aligned right okay thank you that's it for now that's it for now thank you so I have some questions about the proposal to shift to permanent expulsion is the minimum requirement for possession which is on page 99 of the electronic package 30 of the handbook

[01:20:00]
itself now my question was what research supports this shift towards permanent expulsion as a minimum consequence for firearm possession what evidence supports the claim that a no excuse your tolerance tougher consequence will convince students to leave guns at home it's just whatever evidence supports the decision to move to this tougher consequence and so Madam chair members of the board I believe that in working with this working group of principals and listening to community members come to board meetings and speak about their feeling of lack of safety within their school environment from students afraid to go to school staff afraid to

[01:21:00]
go to school and be able to do their job comfortably and families afraid to send their kids to schools that was some of the data and understanding of what the conversations were in the working group and so I can have principal Valenzuela speak more to that because she was there for all of the conversations all this members of the board and superintendent Elder this was a very in-depth conversation because we went you know back and forth you know what what was our reasoning behind this what data did support this and I think at the end of all of our conversations and going back and forth it was Safety and Security for ourselves as the principals because we are along with APS police where the first

[01:22:00]
I know defense that goes out to really deal with the situation situations as such and then our staff and students so we want to make sure that in a situation where it is a weapon possession and currently it is the one year expulsion up to one year expulsion is really thinking about the trauma that we are dealing with when we know come March of next year we have students that will be returning that were in possession of a firearm so that is where the conversations have led so I think our primary concern was Safety and Security for everyone at that school at our schools thank you for that and again for the seeking a feedback from principals and I understand the traum

[01:23:00]
the individuals across the board experienced I also have significant concerns around the long-term trauma that this causes to the student of the family and the community this being permanent expulsion and so just to offer because our procedural directives do refer to the American Psychological Association I Googled American Psychological Association and evidence on these things and I'm just going to read to you what it says they convened a task force on this issue and they determine that these policies these policies being 0 to make negatively affect the relationship of Education with Juvenile Justice and appear to conflict to some degree with current best knowledge concerning adolescent development to address the needs of schools for discipline that can maintain school safety while maximizing student opportunity to learn which I think is the main challenge words speaking to here but reporters recommendations for both reforming Zero Tolerance where is implementation is necessary and for alternative practice to replace either 0 to a more appropriate approach is indicated

[01:24:00]
I appreciate the perspectives of the individuals who are consulted but I would like us to make our our policies are procedural directives with evidence in mind and I know this is a great issue and it doesn't seem that there's any evidence to support the notion that a tougher consequence a permanent expulsion has any correlation any connection to the decision-making of adolescents whose brains are not fully developed yet so I think just considering that there's no link between a stronger consequence and whether or not kids are going to bring a gun to school so I'll state that I know we do not have a say here but have received a significant amount of emails expressing concern for that I do also just want to express and read our student discipline policy which reads the district approach to Student Success reflects the board of education's desire to work with students in school communities to understand and address root causes of behavior so this is our approach to discipline

[01:25:00]
root causes of behavior resolve conflicts repair harm done restore relationships and successfully sustain and reintegrate students into the school community so it's hard for me to see how permanent expulsion entirely from atheists forever does any of these things that are listed in our policy so I would just encourage the administration to go back and consider just the relationship between this policy and this procedural directive because it seems to me to be pretty out of whack so with that I will leave that as my recommendation and see if there are any other comments or questions on this particular agenda item which is the student handbook I will just second one person Gonzales and I would like

[01:26:00]
to see I mean I really appreciate the description of how we're moving forward that Mr Eisner gave and I would like to see some version of that in actually in the handbook to say you know while we learn restorative practices it doesn't mean that there aren't working out

[01:27:00]
children

[01:28:00]
stop or they don't they don't stop learning we have to provide a safe and a learning situation for that child who brought a gun to school I don't think our responsibility ends with expulsion that child is still part of the community and learning something and I'd rather that we have impacted rather than other people in in that child's Circle and I'll just leave it at that I think there's work to be done around how do we continue a positive learning experience

[01:29:00]
for for kids who get themselves into trouble you know or who are faced with untenable circumstances we can't they can't be throw away kids and yet I want to honor the very real sense of insecurity that schools are feeling thank you the lack of Distinction of differentiation between elementary students and high school students so clearly there's a different there's something different going on with the five year old is bringing a gun versus an 18 year old so to have the same consequences for both like again seems a little just connected or in Conflict so I know

[01:30:00]
I mean I understand what the principles were doing and I just respect your work you wanted to make your staff feel safe your students made it's all with you know your students feel safer and you're doing it with the best of intentions and I know that none of us are saying that that isn't what what happened and that was one way you thought was going to make your community and your kids and your staff feel safer so I do appreciate all the work you all did on that but I feel as a school district that we have to provide the supports for every child whatever it is that they need no if they bring a gun to school they need something and we don't know what kind of Aces they went through during their life

[01:31:00]
and so I think that we need to provide them the supports in the safest way that we can to keep people around them you know from getting harmed in any way so I think we need to think about it we're here to educate every child and as member Dominguez said I mean I personally believe almost every single person can be saved and we can help almost everybody to make better to make better choices I don't believe in that throw throw throw away mentality at all so I mean it's up to you all I think you're hearing what most of us are saying that that permanent explosion that child is going to be out there out in the community with I mean no restrictions whatsoever they're not going to be in class what are they going to be doing and they're still out there and they could still harm people unless we provide the services so I think that they need so it's something we need to

[01:32:00]
kind of think about and then I just have have one more just to kind of asking I know you try you answer my question but I'm still kind of confused so TC on the audio video recording or photographs I think it's page 47 and it says that students will not use audio or visual recording devices to video photograph or record handbook violations or to violate the privacy of others you know that's that's good but then I look at this is just a question you can just clarify for me so then I look at page 56 and it's talking about controlled substance sailor distribution and it says just distribution and sale require evidence to include photos so do those photos can't come from a child who photographed that

[01:33:00]
Dale that distribution because it says that it can't so are you talking about that the police APS police or APD have to provide the photos and then the same thing on threats of violence it says threats of violence require evidence to include photos social media posts but yeah to go back to number 16 again on page 47 says that students can't photographer so number 16 does say students cannot that it is a violation of the handbook but students still do take photographs and post them on social media and do you use apps to sell drugs on campus so they are using their devices for items that are then used as evidence by our administrators piece is the adults collecting the evidence of what students have done but

[01:34:00]
it's not allowable for them to utilize their phones in that way on campus okay and that's what I thought you were trying to get to I just wanted to just clarify and then I gave all my other so everybody knows all the other little edits TC has them so I don't have to go through like 500 great thank you remember Jackson so I'm probably going to speak an opposite opposition of what others have said because I am in favor of the policy you know as it's in like this is something we've dealt with these last several months that has been like reality of what's happening in our classrooms in our schools and I'm thinking as a mom if my girls are dealing with a situation where another student has a firearm like I want severe consequences like that's where my head is going like at

[01:35:00]
isn't the Forefront of everything we do I don't think anyone said that we're not going to provide support for the student that needs them but there has to be a severe consequence of making sure that these students just don't return back in a classroom like I'm thinking me as a mom and knowing I have that student sitting right next to my daughter that came with the firearm that could have had an intention or Reason of hurting my child like I'm not okay with that and to me that even adds to all the reasons why we talked about declining enrollment and things changing and people leaving our district a lot of it is not protecting all of our students like we can't forget the ones that are really there to do with their supposed to do truly and I'm like my gosh we've had West Mesa here almost every board meeting saying do something stand up they feel like they're not safe we've heard from other schools throughout the

[01:36:00]
restrict other families and students students have died yet we're not acting like this is a policy that we need to have in place and we need to kind of sugar coat it based on other students and the trauma that they've had we agreed they need support they need services but I need to ensure that my girls are safe like every child there is going to be safe and they get the education they deserve and it just like hurts me because I'm like are we really saying this like we're really saying that we don't agree with the policy to not protect our students it's saddens me because this stuff is real it's happening all the time like I'm seeing stuff that I've never even had as an adult that our students have access to every day and I'm sorry if I just said that's just my style he goes you guys know I just speak freely and off like the cuff sometimes but I'm like

[01:37:00]
I will also follow up with that I wrote in my notes that I was completely in agreement with the more severe restrictions and I think part of that listening to the conversation I think I'm also maybe I'm very black and white if you do something wrong you have to have consequences for that but we've also heard from several of you of all of the other things that APS is attempting to do to lead up to this event right we are doing restorative practices we are meeting with our our students we are providing resources we're providing all of these things but at some point if you're bringing a gun to school there has to be

[01:38:00]
consequence for that and I'm in favor of the consequence that has had is currently or has been updated in the procedural directive and I also think of the fact that because we realize this is an issue we have also been proactive right we're going to start initiating a curriculum within APS that talks about gun violence prevention we're going to be continuing to to offer resources for our children for all of our students to at every step along the way what could you what could you do different how can we help we are here we are here to help you but to board member Topia Romero's point there are let's just take a middle school as an example there are 800 other kids in that middle school that now are fearful to attend because of one person

[01:39:00]
and we have to start thinking about the benefit or the safety and the well-being of all of our kids and I did have a conversation with somebody earlier today kind of concerned about the explosion language and I think what came out of that is we APS and all of the organizations that are consistently being brought up right we're hearing about City resources we're hearing about you know hip and Crossroads and all of that there are also so many resources in the community and we have to start doing a better job APS of communicating with all of those into all of those resources that we have I don't know that we do a good job with with reaching out and sharing and in a situation like this I think of the child who

[01:40:00]
does get expelled well let's make sure that we're doing a good job when that happens of following up with other organizations within the community to make sure that that child doesn't get lost but but there are other kids there's other staff members there are other parent there are other people in that school that shouldn't have to bear the burden of feeling fear because of one child so I appreciate that you put that there I am in support and that's my black and white thank you remember Jackson are there any other comments or questions from the board on the handbook I feel like I need to weigh in I'm on the fence actually on this because I truly understand the concerns about and what happens for me

[01:41:00]
language the way that I read it is only the superintendent May modify in writing and so there is an opportunity for modification and there's an opportunity for a hearing so and and I'm going back to TC's words initial earlier where you said a hearing officer could also it could go lower can't go higher but could go lower so I think the intention of a handbook is to communicate a consequences to communicate you know the what's what if scenarios and I know that one of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to have a very strong message about don't do this because if you do it could have huge consequences so I think we've done a good job of describing that this is very grave and it does rise to that level of that I think and I have to go back and maybe it's going back through

[01:42:00]
play the handbook is just reminding folks that you know that hearing is also an opportunity there because I am concerned about the elementary kid that gets expelled I mean that that to me is the one that just like makes me a little bit anxious because I I just think about the age and what's going on there so I think for me it's just looking at at that and I know she's an elementary principal so yeah go ahead chairperson Gonzalez members of the board and superintendent Elder and I'm here to speak on the the differentiation between Elementary and secondary disciplinary and also the considerations of including Elementary on the same level and what that is is an opportunity for us to start the conversation and start teaching what those consequences are and in order for us to teach that we also have to have some supports

[01:43:00]
so this really does allow Elementary's to become part of the conversation with families instead of it just waiting until they get to middle school and high school so this opens up the opportunity for us to have a first teach in elementary around our expected behaviors of safety and it also highlight some of the supports that can be in the community that we have access to if we're starting to see some behaviors that come up that could become concerning and they do start at an early age the permanent expulsion hearing is an opportunity it's a process and having Elementary part of that creates more conversation and more awareness it does not mean that the permanent expulsion is it automatically happens the hearing is a process to figure out if that's the most appropriate

[01:44:00]
next step to take and we do have flexibility within that so but to have Elementary in that with secondary does open up that opportunity and I thank you so much for saying that because I keep going back to thinking about the purpose of the handbook write the purpose of the handbook is to just really lay out the here's the rules here's the here's the rules of the game you know this is the Rules of Engagement for for dealing with us or working with us so because you're right I mean it doesn't mean that it's going to result and I I think it's like it says you know it does provide for mandatory expulsion but it you know and the superintendent and that hearing is really the level that is going to determine that and hopefully it's like you said it's like this first teach because I think all so on the middle and high school I've heard of some

[01:45:00]
some instances this year where even at the high school level you know a person showed up with a gun in possession but really didn't it was I was almost like it was a it was a lapse of judgment for sure there's no doubt but nonetheless at high school you should know I shouldn't be going to high school with a gun right and Elementary Age kid could potentially just you know if it's not secured at home put it in the backpack you know but not really having tension and it's really more around the parents and you know not having it safely secured and stuff but it's still great and I get that because an accident could occur and so I'm okay with this as the way that it's written because I keep going back to what TC said about that that hearing and so maybe we need to be really clear about you know the perfect I think we do I just can't remember

[01:46:00]
there's a lot of pages in there but just really reminding our families you do have process there's due process through a hearing but this one is one of the most Grievous things that could happen and it doesn't matter how the gun gets into a possession of a child whether it's by accident or things like that and hopefully we're not you know explaining Elementary age kids I mean I'm hoping that that's not what's occurring and that we don't use it as an excuse to expel a kid because the kid could have some other behavior issues other things that are going on but again they still have due process and if they have an IEP it's also coming back to that as well so I'm just I struggle with that because I'm always going to be on the side of you know making sure that our children also have an opportunity first and we're not sort of like creating this pipeline in a different way but I appreciate the language you president Montoya Cordova I would like to point out a couple things on page 29 of the under

[01:47:00]
pause and it is not a new language and it does say it may be longer or even permanent when we talked about expulsion cuz expulsion is one year or longer and then the gun free schools act under firearm use does say mandatory explosion for a period of not less than one year and when we're looking at those consequences those consequences when we're talking about going to a hearing that's the maximum consequence that principle can recommend when bringing a student to a hearing right but it is still go through that hearing process and does still have the ability to be appealed which then does go to super review thank you great thank you are there any additional comments or questions on the student handbook grade can you give an update on the time frame you said this will go back to cabinet for additional review and discussion and then sort of what's

[01:48:00]
the remaining timeline yes member Gonzalez my expectation is to provide an updated handbook to the cabinet by the end of the day tomorrow for them to have a few weeks to review and that we would finalize it by the end of June to post on the website and begin getting copies for the service center period thank you and so with that we will move to agenda item five which is policy chair update so I wanted to provide an update on where a couple of different policies and processes stand so as you may remember in our May meeting we talked about the ad hoc policy Review Committee is recommended by the great City Schools as part of the student outcomes Focus government's work we appointed president Cordova appointed myself member Peterson of a member of Romero to this ad hoc policy Review Committee so we had a preliminary conver

[01:49:00]
Haitian and made some initial decisions and set some goals and timelines that I just wanted to bring everyone up to speed on so this policy review at hot committee will be decided to and will be conducting a review of our current policies a c d and e in June and the rest of the policies after that so it's a little bit more about the process you may have noticed I said ACDC but not b and that's because policies b or the board governance policies essentially and board members Jackson are simultaneously participating in a policy review crosswalk of those policies in support of the development of a board government's manual so it's kind of a similar timeline that work that they're doing will come to us for review and discussion around the beginning of the school year as well so with respect to the policy review at hoc committee the committee members are going to review all of those policies against your rubric it's a 10 point scale and so we'll be each

[01:50:00]
when will essentially rate each of the policies on that 10-point scale and the Continuum is sort of 0 being all administrative 10 being all bored 5 being balance of bored and administration and so we've decided to try to use five that middle marker as the point at which we would bring them forward for additional discussion and talk through what we sort of table or not tables set aside move into an administrative manual versus keep in policy so we're using that five threshold as on the rubric as a starting point so when we meet again at the end of June which will be June 23rd it'll give us an opportunity to do a couple of things one is just to sort of to consider like interoperability how aligned are we with each other on how we're waiting each policy and does five make sense for us or do we want to maybe adjust maybe up higher 678 or lower 43 Etc so we'll do that

[01:51:00]
meet again in June we'll discuss those two things and then based on that conversation will go ahead with the remainder of the policies throughout July and then bring back sort of final recommendations back to the full board in August so that's the first thing is this policy review at hot committee and I think folks remember that sort of three big questions is the policy legally required does it fall under the purview of the Board of Education or the superintendent that's where we're using the rubric for scoring and to what extent does the impact the boards non-negotiable priorities and goals or goals and guardrails so that is the status of that and then I just wanted to give an update on sort of what's on the hopper for the August so these are the following policies which are up for consideration in August the 1st is Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act slash American with Disabilities Act compliance which is currently under review to update those policies to be in compliance with the alignment with the

[01:52:00]
workers Fairness Act which goes into effect June 27th so there's that process those policies will come to us in August similarly the Indian education policies and procedures have been reviewed by District staff and they're now awaiting approval by tribal leaders and committee members at the June 22nd Indian policies and procedures meeting so once that happens we'll have that feedback those revisions will be changed and those will be brought to us as well in the August policy committee meeting the next one is policy I hate which is our community schools policy so folks may recall that we reviewed all of our I policies in February and we took this one off the subsequent agenda for the Board of Education meeting to allow time for both additional discussion but also review in particularly review from the ABC and Community Schools staff so that process is happening right now will have their feedback and again that I hate will come to us

[01:53:00]
in August and then the final one is the new budget policy so again you may recall that in may we had an initial review of a model budget policy just to get the juices flowing and started brainstorm around what we would like to see in a budget policy so following that brainstorm now this policy development will go sort of through the standard policy development process so the policy will be developed to be a first read which will be at the August committee meeting opportunity for public input and then a second read and then it goes on to the consent to approval agenda for the full board meeting following that so it's an exciting time in the policy World lots of stuff in front of us and as a reminder since we meet the first Monday of the month that would conflict with the 4th of July holiday so we will not be having a July policy committee meeting and the next policy committee meeting will be held on Monday August 7th at 5 p.m. in the John Milton Community boardroom of the Alice

[01:54:00]
Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard or virtually at APS dot edu and with that this meeting is adjourned thank you but we're not done okay but we do have a we do have a special board meeting so we'll go ahead and take a break and then we'll come back
