[00:09:00]
what we have heard overwhelmingly from our school Community regarding the schedule change at our school has been the families and staff believe that their voices have not been given the regard they deserve they have spoken many times about the fact that the district put out a survey regarding the bell schedule but that even though they spent the time to respond to the survey there needs were not given due consideration members of our school Community are here today to voice their concerns regarding this matter and I'm here asking you to demonstrate collaboration with the families results this problem thank you thank you our next speaker is Vicky Brooklyn one minute once you begin Brock and I'm here to speak about the closure of the abrupt closure of the Blended program at Academy on July 11th we were informed some of the parents were informed by a mass robocall and email that

[00:10:00]
Graham are very valued program was being closed I received a phone call on July 26th this means I had two choices return to an inadequate homeschool or to fully go online which was inadequate for my son as well because of his vision disability now because of the closure of this program my son will spend each day home isolated and a fully online program he doesn't want to attend he will know have no longer will have any regular socialization with his peers because of this decision my son will be forced to pay the price this decision disenfranchises some of the most vulnerable students in APS one of the keys to educational success is consistency students furthermore the closure may have violated federal law the individuals with disabilities Education Act mandates schools provide prior written notice for any changes to the educational setting or Resources with students with IEPs

[00:11:00]
however parents were not given prior notice as emails and phone calls do not meet these legal requirements federal law also stipulates parents must have the opportunity to object or challenge these decisions which was not provided in this case this program needs to be reinstated thank you our next speaker is Dr Samuel Dr Samuel you have one minute when you begin speaking thank you dot

[00:31:00]
put on some molding works so I started looking through Craigslist and I found a number called it and Mr Coffee answered the other side of that line and said sure come on down bring the trailer over to Valley high school and once I got there and we started talking to the project this is February early February of this year and I said hey I've got time let's leave it here with you all and you know get all this work done and I think I got it back a couple weeks before school was out in May so I'm going to run through the the items of things that were done I had four corners welded 3x inch square spacers and that allowed the leveling jacks to be welded to the spacers to reach the ground properly one five gallon rotopack frame folder holder 120 lb propane tank holder a 1 inch angle iron around the actual

[00:32:00]
top of the of the trailer I'm sorry I got to stop yet you're going over your 1 minute so if you just wrap it up very very quickly so let me say this last but not least I see what these kids are talking about Mr Coffee is awesome and if I can leave any superintendent and bored with anything if we can get them all the welding stick and the and the shields to make sure that each kid that walks in their has all the tools and supplies that they need thank you thank you sir period Valley High School's metal technology program is a remarkable initiative in a subject they are passionate about but also in the vital skills that will

[00:33:00]
serve as a stepping stone into the skilled labor market post-graduation I have the honor of working with three graduates from this program at Valley High School upon graduation these individuals joined local trades unions and start our journey in the trades without any delay the Knowledge and Skills they acquired from the metals Technology Program prepared them for what they would encounter in the field of plumbing and pipefitting they came into the industry with a clear understanding of what was expected of them and a solid foundation that is made them exemplary employees they are meeting the requirements of their ownership programs and their to be exceptional assets to our team apprentices play a crucial role in the growth of the trades industry the industry relies on skilled workers to continue to grow Innovation and sustainability Career and Technical programs and schools provide students with the opportunity to explore different types of training before the graduate high school this experience allows them to have a clear vision of their career path eliminating the need to drive from school to school or job to job search

[00:34:00]
yeah I can let you finish in one quick sentence okay thank you ma'am what president Gonzales board members that completes public forum but really excited about the work that we heard about in public comment and unfortunately it's not a dialogue so we will hear everything that you shared and take that into account as we progress with our work going forward with that we will move on to our next agenda item which is to consider acceptance of progress monitoring reports for goal 3 from goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 which is post-secondary Readiness so our facilitator for this will be board member benavidez thank you ma'am thank

[00:35:00]
I appreciate that Gabriela Gonzalez superintendent for leadership and learning and we have sherry Jett our chief academic officer before you begin with a couple of seconds for folks to transition in and out of the room as needed and get folks in their places and then go ahead and cancel

[00:36:00]
and I want to thank you for your time Dr Blakey I know how busy you are and I believe that all the criteria for an effective report have been matched but I will not open the floor to my fellow board members

[00:37:00]
you might feel we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests otherwise wonderful excellent since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or technical in nature before tonight's meeting and these questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to review compelling stuff you should look at it each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the boards and guardrails those questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time Downs so let's get started does anybody have a question

[00:38:00]
and before you ask your question will you please reference the interim goal that you are nothing about you can go certainly please thank you I see that you've identified as part of your strategy forward what kind of analysis has been conducted to investigate our capacity for expansion and what investments and Staffing how you identify to make this expansion possible thank you for the question I'm going to ask Dr Gonzalez to help us with the answer but I'm president

[00:39:00]
the middle school sale at 8th grade and the high school sale at 12:30 but as a district we've recognized the need for comprehensive systemic support so that we are supporting all of our schools we often think of Spanish as the bilingual seal when we as a default but there are other languages that are Pathways for our students to achieve the bilingual seal so again a systemic approach we have over the last couple of weeks the chief academic officer and I approached a external partner that is going to be working with us to look at the work of our Language and Cultural Equity department at the district level how do we offer support to our schools what does that look like from a maintenance from a dual language from a bilingual and ELD point of view recognizing that these are all distinct services that are schools offer

[00:40:00]
and through that analysis and through that review which will yield recommendations we will then take those recommendations to offer systemic support to what I would argue with one of the Hallmarks or programs that are district repeatedly is touted for importing to important to note we have international visitors that come on an annual basis to visit Albuquerque and what we do in our bilingual programs so I'm definitely more work to do we have done we recognize some internal capacity but we've also know that we have to do a lot more so we look forward to the recommendations this external reviews thank you so much thank you for

[00:41:00]
progress monitoring report and and also the the answers to the questions so my question is what plan is in place to tap the Immigrant newcomer Refugee communities language capabilities to bolster bilingual seal in those ale student communities and if you could provide a timeline that would be helpful thank you for the question I think Dr Gonzalez spoke a little bit about expanding the languages for the seal as well as building a newcomer program but I will have a doctor Gonzalez get more specifics to those two things for having us here tonight we are

[00:42:00]
aware of our growing newcomer and Refugee population in Albuquerque and it is actually a major Focus area for some of the work we're doing in Language and Cultural Equity including working towards really leveraging the assets that are in the community to provide a welcome center and down the road a high school that will serve these these students and so toward that very long-term goal and want to get distracted but we will definitely be looking at our population and the adults and how we can work with them in order to really bring this community together and leverage their resources their expertise their cultural assets so that he can really begin to support this community is Thrive that's really helpful

[00:43:00]
3.1 and I think just to dig a little bit further into what board member Astoria was asking I guess to know more like what is our strategy to make sure that we have an opportunity for all students to make sure that they'll receive their bilingual still and when I say an opportunity I guess tie it also with the timeline on when we when we will be able to actually meet this board member Romero I think that access to classes is is something that the team is working on as well as making sure that the classes are offered at schools and I know the team has been working on that and I'll have them answered the specific questions to to that Madame President

[00:44:00]
table 81 the requirements for biliteracy seals for high school students I just point that out because I think one of the things that your question alludes to is the notion of access access for every one of our high schools for our students to have the opportunity to pursue the bilingual seal should they feel compelled to do so and this table I think is important to lift up because it does a couple of things first it outlines that there are multiple Pathways for students to achieve the bilingual seal the state seal the district seal the district seal of Distinction and the global seal so when we think of bilingual seal sometimes we lump it into one category when in reality there are multiple Pathways for students to achieve the bilingual seal therefore for example if you have a school that does not have a comprehensive wall dual language program for example

[00:45:00]
there are still opportunities for students to access and achieve the bilingual seal so that's a long-winded way of saying that right now at every one of our high schools for example are students can achieve the bilingual seal the second thing that I like to point out is as we move forward and as we to your question about timeline we hope that this report will be complete this semester so that we are able to act in real time with budget call and appropriation of resources and intentional next steps for the spring semester and Beyond supports for schools around bilingual seal is thinking about things differently and not being afraid to be bold and beginning at our elementary middle moving into our high school level is

[00:46:00]
I'm looking at creative ways for our students to access programming and this bleeds into 3.2 and 3.3 so if a student does not at their homeschool have access to a class that they are really passionate about how can we think differently as a district to provide access for that student to achieve and take that class similar to the work we do at CEC so I think that's going to be important that's really one of the big things this bowl is calling us to action on is to think differently and to make sure our students have access to the classes are passionate about which is also what HB 171 the high school graduation requirement bill that are district has this year to kind of plan out for implementation in August is also doing so we have a parallel track in terms of the

[00:47:00]
board president Gonzales board members Tapia Dr Blakey I just wanted to add also really thinking about how we transition students from middle school to high school and really now that we're entering the first phase of House Bill 171 which will require Next Step plans to be created 8th grade and followed through students through 12th grade really leveraging that system an alignment with that transition from middle school to high school so we can one ensure that family and students and then connecting them with the appropriate staff at the high school so that they can register for the correct horses so I really believe that 3.1 and US progress monitoring that we can ensure that we're doing two things one increasing the overall

[00:48:00]
enrollment of 9th graders taking the entry bilingual course but then once we have them enrolled then we use the same concepts of progress monitoring ensuring that we have a champion on campus that's you know overseeing their transcripts overseeing them taking the correct courses and then also if they're at a school that might not offer a course that we can find a way to provide access to the course so it's really a comprehensive approach including the transition from middle school to high school thank you I have a question that is related to 3. 3 5 4

[00:49:00]
bilingual courses I'm curious what strategies does the district have in place currently to ensure that secondary registration process is clear and Equitable and manageable and I'll note that the report does mention training for curriculum assistant principals to reduce barriers to course selection but clearly there's many more pieces to the registration process than what just the curriculum materials curriculum assistant principals do and as a parent who is just navigated this process with some challenges and registration along the way I just would love to know what strategies are currently in place besides the training for curriculum systems currently what we have in place is based on teacher or really the teachers

[00:50:00]
that we have in place and the courses therefore that we can offer we're trying to adapt to kind of what Mr Garcia talked a little bit about to have more student request driving the schedule so for example with the welding that we just had presented if we had enough students that wanted to request that class that we would change what we would do now is we would limit the number of students and then close it off so the students would have to take another class and that's really problematic if we continue to do that with our goals and our guardrails because we won't be able to get students in at their early freshman sophomore level and those are usually the students that get kind of kicked to their second or third choice electives and so we have to be able to drive the student request to be able to build the sections out and there's also a new process for like the new Next Step plan that I think became a little

[00:51:00]
get routine and just people stop doing it so I'll let Miss jet kind of answer some of some of the work that we're doing with the new The Next Step plan thank you Doctor Blakey thank you for the question president Gonzalez you know in his response earlier Mr Garcia talked about opportunity and knowledge and I think that is sort of a key phrase we've been talking a lot about in terms of how do we make sure that our incoming freshman families or where the long-term impacts of taking advantage of those opportunities you know hearing the students talk about their experiences this evening and how long they have been in the program and how much they treasure it right that is I think the type of impact we want families to realize from the beginning is possible in our programs but we really need to take an intentional approach to doing that

[00:52:00]
so the current process is traditionally been I'm going to say it's usually counselor lead but not always but it's been an 8th grade visit to the high school to orient the 8th graders to the big new high school what does opportunities are usually some sort of assembly style to highlight the band the Athletics you know all the opportunities that open up to our students when they go into the high school setting I do think the that is an opportunity and entry point for us to really good at highlighting and telling people about the opportunities of the school and helping the families be a part of that conversation I know if I left it up to my own child to pick up extra curricular and rigorous classes she will not do it so how do we help the families really understand so they can begin to talk to their students about you know this actually would pay off and let me tell you about how it's paid off for me

[00:53:00]
in addition the The Next Step plan will be an opportunity for us to really tighten up this growth of opportunity knowledge we are happy to be piloting the level of platform through the nmped to capture our next step plans I'm sure you know that they're in statute they're required for 8 through 12th graders to complete and as Dr Blakey said we haven't always had maybe a great system for managing that oftentimes it is a carrying a box of documents from the Middle School to the high school and that's not super efficient in the 21st century so we're excited to really tighten up this process and because the level of platform was developed specifically for New Mexico it is looking at the economic needs that aligned to industry in New Mexico and so that's going to help us all to speak better I guess that's terrible thing to say

[00:54:00]
about what the opportunities are and it's going to help us is the Educators really begin to align those opportunities better in our school to the state of New Mexico's needs thank you for that response and it helps give me a better sense of the current strategies or initiatives in place I'm curious if you could also speak to some of the perhaps technical dimensions of the registration process as I got some feedback from some constituents that they for example receive schedules that had four PE classes and no core classes or no and so I'm just curious like again where is the human check human involvement in that process and what strategies are being used to help make sure that it's not happening tomorrow families

[00:55:00]
president Gonzalez members of the board on Dr Blakey beginning in the spring semester early on in about February on a curriculum assistant principals and counselors begin was called on Phase 1 scheduling and there's three or four phases of scheduling which are pretty comprehensive really aimed at avoiding what president Gonzalez described and I think that's a regret and something we would like to look into because quality assurance is important to us to ensure that every student today the first day of school has that Chris aligned schedule that they're going to be able to engage with and be successful with as opposed to waiting in lines to get things right this week the beginning of school so phase one is really the conceptualization of the schedule

[00:56:00]
where on the school sites work with a pretty robust a student information system Department here at the district on people that live and breathe the technical inner workings of the schedule and then they move on to inputting their schedule which I think is something I just want to take a little bit of a bird walk for a minute because I think what we offer our students is critically important now more than ever the course offerings that we offer our students are important and that's really a conversation we're having right now through the steering committee The Advisory Group working to advise on the superintendent on how we're going to execute HB 171 in high school graduation requirements in other words what I'm trying to say is students need to take what we're offering so we need to make sure that some of our offerings are engaging our students like the students at Valley High School

[00:57:00]
and then through the next phase of scheduling the systems people work with our curriculum assistance to make sure that everything checks out that duplicate courses are not there that semester courses are complimenting each other so that we don't have a student taking two semester 1 English 9 classes that everything is really aligned so it's something that we want to look at any time what you described happen on a case-by-case basis certainly hope that that's the exception not the norm but definitely something we're committed to looking at looking for thank you ok Google so this kind of goes to what you just said Dr Gonzalez and this is about all of the interim goals but I'm genuinely curious and this is a question I asked and you didn't answer it so I do have a question to follow up but genuinely curious as to the language

[00:58:00]
enrolled and earned credit in AP bilingual seal and career connected because to me if they aren't credit they were enrolled so I thought that that was Superfluous but the answer is to be able to count towards each of these goals we are focused on increasing the percentage of students who enroll in these courses and who earn credit we believe that only focusing on lowering the failure rates of these courses will not meet the challenges that we were given I understand that so here's my question what is the plan to increase the interest in enrollment and once they're in the course how are we planning to support them so they not only have this interest and enroll but earn the credit for the course and as is obvious based on our audience tonight there is a lot of interest and that's wonderful how can we keep that up Mr Garcia

[00:59:00]
Ford president Gonzalez board member Heather Benavides Dr Blakey really thinking about students in a holistic systemic way it takes really everybody at the school to create comprehensive programming and really thinking about students and I'm going to relate it back to the next step plans and then happening in 8th grade so really this pre-k through 12th grade continue on that in elementary school we begin exposing kids to corrective learning and an introduction to elementary students began to connect some of their interest to potential careers through the next steps then identify horses and horse sequencing in a pathway on so really students began to intentionally take courses along their interest

[01:00:00]
well we have to do systemically as a district is ensure that we provide again I'm going to use this phrase opportunity knowledge to students and families so that we can provide the courses for their interest but will we have to do is the system is we have to use data literacy we have to look at the data I'm going to use Yahoo Martinez focus group students as an example so when we look at the data for APS say when we look at that data for any given school what under what what's the data telling us about underrepresented students so then we asked why why are these students underrepresented okay well the next what have we done to promote what if we done to recruit what have we done to really ensure that students have that knowledge of the courses available to them so it's really a comprehensible to take all hands on deck

[01:01:00]
to really use data literacy use root cause analysis as to why there's underrepresented demographics and any of these courses and then when I say A systemic approach it goes beyond just the counselor meeting with families and showing them of course request card we're talking about having student ambassadors who come from underrepresented groups that can speak to other students about their experience to really being intentional to create systems and systemic approaches that provide a broad spectrum of opportunity knowledge and then supports along the way so it's really a mindset and a comprehensive approach that I believe we're really shifting towards and and excited about it thank you so we have not asked a question

[01:02:00]
well unfortunately my questions were taken but it's probably because we all kind of zeroed in on this the same concern and so if I may since my my question was taken I'm going to ask you for looking question if that's all right okay so my my question and kind of similarly to board president Gonzalez I have real world experience that the plan is created then thrown in a box and never looked at again the family is not encouraged I didn't even know that it had happened so the family is not really encouraged to look at it and I think that you guys have given really good responses to the questions what I am not hearing

[01:03:00]
and that I would like to to be a little bit more specific about is what is the exact plan from a system perspective it seems like it needs to be a little bit more centralized as far as the next step plan I mean you've written I've written down student ambassadors more focus on Personnel developing opportunity knowledge using data literacy those all sound yes like I'm high-fiving you from over here but what is the very specific plan you know me I want you to tell me by December of this year we will have done X by May of 2025 we will have done why so is there a plan to create a system that will address The Next Step plan

[01:04:00]
there is and it's part of our strategic plan it's an initiative three where we have specific tasks that are outlined through the course of the year that I monitor to make sure that the team is following through on the test of the Strategic plan specifically looking at the next step plan but I think that probably Dr Gonzalez and Miss jet can talk about the specific tasks within that initiative it is very clearly aligned to one of the initiatives in the in the Strategic plan thank you for the question board member Jackson and I do appreciate a specific plan I love to put things on calendars and so I understand unfortunately I don't really have a calendar in front of me but you know in terms of the specifics of rolling out the next step plan in

[01:05:00]
can you platform of level all I think this is a really good example of the banner is that adult behaviors are going to have to change and so the first part of our planning is to train our schools our teachers are principals are counselors they are the advisors they are I love the term life coach that was used earlier like I like that and that is how we need to be thinking about like we're not just teachers we're not Educators we are life coaches and so helping the the life coaches in our schools get a handle on what this new platform is with the expectations are there's going to have to be fairly significant training for our 8th 9th 10th 11th and 12th grade teachers in order to make that happen and I know one of my colleagues behind me probably is saying I know the dates I know the dates so along that line we really are going to have to leverage how we use advisory in our schools we've talked about

[01:06:00]
advisory before and everybody's buried experiences with weather kids go to advise her or not that's something that's going to have to change who really are going to have to make that a fruitful part of a student's School experience so that we can actually use these tools and resources that are top-notch but if you aren't able to students in them and and engaged with them they're really just not going to be doing what we want so you know the I know that's maybe not quite as specific as you're looking for but it really is going to be a heavy push through our school personnel and then looking at the platform in the familiarity with it and then and I'll be frank I'm not sure I understand everything the platform will do like I'm thinking about how do we get families more involved in the conversation because I think that's the key component too of making sure the point like it happened and you didn't know well that like we should be having these conver

[01:07:00]
patience together and encouraging the students and the adults who love them and take care of them to be a part of that conversation in that encouragement and Madam president of member Jackson Dr Blakey I would just also just to expand on that just a little bit and it's fundamentals it may sound I think it's important Elevate is that in this case I think we have a system or a space for some of this work to happen in what we know as advisory what I don't think is that that time has been optimized story so what I think the level all read them the Renaissance of The Next Step plan has the potential to do is make it meaningful in terms of the connection to the student because as I understand it

[01:08:00]
level all connects the student kind of like an inventory of what they in their state could connect to in terms of their life's passions their where they want to go where the next step is and I think that's the power of really getting an advisor that maybe for too long has been waiting for something a lot to ignite a conversation with the student now the tools there and they can bring the next step plan alive to the student and to the advisor and hopefully facilitate back next year and Beyond The Advisory classroom into our community which we know as Albuquerque in New Mexico because we have a specific pilot through level all that's making this next step process real is the Hope for each one of our streets

[01:09:00]
I just want to add I think what's different about this is that when you think of systematically transitioning Next Step plans that are paper form from middle school to high school from one grade to the next just the logistics of it I think became burdensome as a barrier to one of the reasons The Next Step plans were not optimized as as maybe thought out I think what's different about this plan is that and working with level all is that the actual Next Step plan sits within the platforms that it stays with the student and the student will have access to that next step plan so I think that in itself makes it a little bit different what else I think she needs is that the NPD has been working both with

[01:10:00]
roll three and go for in looking at the next step plan but also us being able to communicate to the person that's overseeing this what are board goals are for example they've actually have worked with level all to identify actual little Pathways that students can do within level off for example for bilingual seals and and bilingual Pathways just as an example of how they're really trying to curtail level for our community and make it real for our students and the experiences we want to provide so there was a video that I wanted to show you all that I got to see in level all and I'm hopeful that in a future meeting we can share it with you it's a video I never thought that I would want to run into a burning building but it's like a video explaining being a firefighter and it's just a 30-second clip of

[01:11:00]
giving students the the inside of what that career might be and then students do the platform can dig deeper and look at different careers but they have all of these great really up-to-date videos that students can see and then by navigating the platform they can then look at careers and then when we couple that with our career pathway course offerings that's where we allow students to really again match the next step plan with their course taking sequences and then providing counselor support in horse taking and aligning them you know and of course request cards now let's do it comprehensively I think that's what is really going to make the difference and board member Jackson in the monitoring reports on monitoring 3.1 and 3.2 on page six it has

[01:12:00]
play strategic plan initiative with specific steps connected to implementation of The Next Step plan and then it's also in 3.3 I think it's earlier it's a shorter report which will kind of outline what should happen by the next time we bring this interim goal to you then these steps on the Strategic plan initiative should at that time be have been completed and so that has kind of a little bit more of the specifics of developing the framework a lot of the advisory that doctor Gonzalez talked about and specifically looking at how we work on 8th grade advisory and implementing all the way to 12th grade so that we see a pathway and the training of the staff to be able to implement it now thank you for that I think it's just I can't overstate the importance of having a plan to get to where it is that we

[01:13:00]
fantastic but knowing that there's a plan and then you know fulfilling it just as a follow-up question do families also have access to this level level all you said that the students have access to it do families have access to see what their student is looking at looking backwards because Kenny's been working closely with the level is do have access to Internet

[01:14:00]
and how do we proceed forward I have a huge issue as I look at the progress monitoring with where our children with disabilities our transition Plans Incorporated how are they going to be looked at and monitored all the way from 8th grade until 12th grade and you know I see you next time I don't see how the transition plans are also going to be incorporated so that parents can have an understanding of how this process will proceed for children with disabilities and I would love to have a plan and have that initiated because I just don't want it to be as Courtney said just answers

[01:15:00]
and specifically when we're looking at Martinez and yazzie's subgroups one with the disability but also our English language Learners are low economically disadvantaged students and our Native American students if you could just give me an idea of what that looks like I would appreciate that president president so we are in the throes of really defining a platform that we can use as a state perhaps to

[01:16:00]
bleed into other districts moving forward so I think this work is in its infancy and I think it's important to recognize that with that said I do think that there are several ways of intersection that we can use this tool to make the transition plan and even the IEP table a more robust conversation for parents and students along the way of establishing and completing those transition plans and those IEPs in other words I think it provides additional context I think it provides an additional data point for our sponsor teachers to really illustrate where the student is in terms of their attributes and what their passionate about and how it is driving their success or lack thereof and they're giving classes so I do see points of intersection I think your point is absolutely well taken

[01:17:00]
and one that we can take back to our partners at the PED for additional conversations of exploration on how we can use our partnership in this pilot we see great benefit we see an opportunity here for APS to do something in an area that we have seen and quite frankly have spoken at this table to you the board over the last several years that this next step period so we do see and I'm kind of excited that we have a steps to take I think so and I think that you make in regards to transition and IP is one that we have thought about what will continue to talk about and lift up in the pilot conversation for our district benefit but also for the benefit of other districts that move on as it is

[01:18:00]
understanding that this platform will be required Statewide in the not-so-distant future thank you a Ford president superintendent with special education to to think about special education at Next Step planning it was a technical question asked to us and in researching the IP document and the next step plan work together to really inform and identify students interests and then ensuring that both work together for that transition plan for the students so they're not separate of one another but actually work together to support the students post secondary goals and transition plan

[01:19:00]
I'm concerned with the amount of paperwork and will that also with Next plan and transition create the frustration of trying to balance both for those who would have to make sure there's that integration of both of those documents not a president my first reaction is I don't see that being an issue based on the utility of the tool and who is completing each section of the word in the words the level of work is really a conversation with the student input by the Student Exploration by the student whereas the transition plan is an input by exactly are there any

[01:20:00]
I have one question for 3.2 and about 4 for 3.3 so I'll just do 3.2 right now so for 3.2 and strategic initiative to at least some of apses partners for career connected learning in response to a question about these types of Partnerships in your Q&A responses you mentioned the launch of the professional Hub at the aps Transportation Center and how it will enhance Career Connect and learning Pathways my question is what is the value proposition for creating our own Learning Hub and how we Analyze This in contrast leveraging existing Partnerships and learning spaces for career Pathways so for example School spaces that we have that aren't in use or partnering with our local unions who do have space thank you for the question none of the spaces that were working on right now particularly the Transportation Hub are specific to us it is in collaboration that one particularly is in collaboration with CNM and so I will

[01:21:00]
have probably Mr Garcia answer this specific question to it but our intent with our space and in opening up areas like this is that we are collaborating with another kind of like an anchor partner and in this case for the transportation center and the diesel program it's with CNM or president Gonzales board members Dr Blakey we are working in really looking at our current facilities one of them being the transportation help that we have and we're currently exploring with CNM to look at potentially offering diesel mechanics of one pathway but also looking at other opportunities to build out there that also would include a learning space for the community so CNN would be able to offer dual enrollment courses in the evening which are

[01:22:00]
would also have access to but then also a trade Hub where if we do have Partnerships with trade unions they could also use that facility to train some of their employees and also that collaboration between you know CNM trade unions in Albuquerque Public Schools really creates the optimal situation where kids get to have the exposure they know where the classes are offered they'll also get the opportunity to meet instructors they're not intimidated because they've been in the space before and then that partnership with trade unions obviously like when they have potential students coming up to be able to take jobs accordingly it really creates a partnership I think we're really trying to be mindful of equity and access to these courses so how do we also leverage the bus depot obviously the bus

[01:23:00]
just come back to there and go out into the community so that's another opportunity is leveraging that to be able to also provide transportation to a local Point kind of like CEC what kind of expanding it to the north campus with the ass that we already have with the bus depot so I don't know Dr Blake you want to thank you that was great I think that brought him a piece of my question that I should have asked where it wasn't just the diesel program so thank you for bringing that up too but more about even the welding or the wood shops or any other I guess locational programs that are trade programs that we want to provide how are we giving a little access to those spaces and I know I spoke with Mr Coffee who was here about another school who does have a welding space that's not being used so how do we equitably access all of the spaces that we have with an APS for just the trade programs for all of our program so you didn't answer my question thank you

[01:24:00]
so if I might just kind of tail off of your question mine's also in an interim to interim goal 3.2 and so kind of in that regard what metrics or data are you looking at to determine if a program is successful I think it's quite obvious that the engineering in the future is a wildly successful program so what metrics are data are you looking at to determine one if a program is successful to if it is successful how can it be replicated and three if it is replicated do we have the capacity to replicate it and for how do you determine where certain programs are placed question

[01:25:00]
I think your first question was how do we know how do we measure if it's successful I don't think at this time and I'll look at the team I don't think there's anything formal that we use to determine if it's successful or not I do think that this interim goal will help us in measuring it because it's looking at our enrollment and the pass rate as well of the classes so particularly as we present the interim goal as a Continuum of all of the programs the team can look in desegregated data to see which of those programs are we seeing the largest growth in enrollment and our students keeping with it over the course of time meeting if they take welding the first year do we see a trend that they like to stay in it to continue

[01:26:00]
so I think that that will help us in having real data I think we do have qualitative data that the schools are pretty good at keeping as far as like we heard tonight with the students indicating that they felt empowered that it kept them focused on school that they were able to get jobs those kinds of things so I think that that's always good data also to keep track of your second question was how would we know if we need to replicate it if it is successful how would you replicate it so sometimes I don't know if replication is the answer because if we replicate things too much we run the risk of having to keep up with something that we don't have the either Personnel or supplies or different different things that cause us to then lose access so to me instead of replicating I think we have to look at different ways in which we open access to the program so

[01:27:00]
that could be things such as a hub such as CEC at Valley particularly because they have the engineering the future they take a lot of transfers to their school that come in particularly for this purpose and so opening up our schools to make sure that if there are programs that people are that are students are interested in that we provide more access to them on the barrier that we foresee with that I think the team has talked about is transportation to those locations and so I think that that's a barrier within the state that we'd have to look at as far as funding but to me I would rather look at opening access more than replication because replication can get a stuck in unintended consequences on the other side and your third question was the third question was to capacity which I think you just answered and so then the fourth question is how do you

[01:28:00]
best practices that we have now and so that's one of the things that we use is you know for example Valley there wouldn't be a reason for us to move that program to another area for example so I think we look at a lot of the where the interest is for the students the second thing is that we're trying to as I think it was Mr Garcia talked about earlier this evening is expanding the way that we have student request Drive the schedule so if we if we put welding for example on every student request for all of the high schools and we see the you know there's high schools that have 100,000 and it gives us an idea of where to allocate resources based on the students and that's something new that we haven't done in the past is opening up what are registration card looks like it's looks

[01:29:00]
different at different schools across the city because they offered different classes so until we make it kind of look the same at every school and then we determine what classes we can offer we don't know if there are students at the school that have welding for example interest but they aren't in the program and building out we've talked about building out CEC to become you know maybe we need that in another location to provide more access for programs that often get closed that we need to open up more space for so I would like to move more towards using student requests as the driver to know where we need to put in programs awesome so did I miss something we currently the high school registration cards I know they're totally different but you're thinking of moving towards a more centralized registration that says these are all the courses that are offered throughout APS what are your interests

[01:30:00]
and then we would have to get a baseline to know you know what the requests are so you know we have our core classes that are the same there's part of the district request that's the same at all schools but mostly it's like the electives and such are where they're very different at some schools than other schools so welding for example we'll just use it because we're all familiar with it after this evening might be on the registration card at Valley but it might not be on the registration card at Sea because they don't have a welding program I don't know if people have a program so that's an example of if she has welding as an option then at least we start getting the data to see are their students that are interested in it because we don't have that student interesting again it doesn't mean that then that means we're ready to go turn the key on opening up programs at every school but it gives us an idea of where the interest is and where we can move some of our personal I love that

[01:31:00]
what what you just encapsulated is that you are moving to a student-centered focus away from the adults and like what adults are present in the building at any time so you've moved towards students and I love that cuz I can't wrap my head around like if there's a kid at La Cueva who really wants to be in the welding program how do they even know that there's a welding program they don't and so to have that as a possibility is just incredible like and I really think of it more of how we are flipping looking at it more of its the frame in which we're looking at it we we tend to look at things in a very limited resource way so we we close down our options so if we close down our options saying well we can't put welding on the card because we don't have the teacher we have to think first like well let's put welding on the card and then find the resources but we always we limit our

[01:32:00]
because we make our decisions based on limited resources first so it doesn't mean the resource is a pure but it means that we're able to make decisions in a more proactive way instead of limiting ourselves from the beginning are there any other questions I think we've been a little LAX with our tactical and Technical creeping in with our strategic questions so I would ask that we keep them as strategic as possible moving forward 3.3 so you identified creating a pathway for APS courses to honors programming opportunities when investigating this as a potential strategy will hurdles have you identified that the district will have to overcome to provide Equitable access to those opportunities for our highest needed needed student groups so for example if we have Spanish honors classes and that is our Pathway to a peak classes but we don't have

[01:33:00]
Spanish AP courses how are we finding Equitable Pathways that makes sense yes I think that the student request driven schedule can will help that but I'll turn to the team if they have something to add as far as specific strategies not a president I think one example is 8th grade and how do we make sure that every one of our middle schools has access to those rigorous courses for example I mean I'm thinking about honors Algebra 1 and every one of our 8th grades to make sure that that is a constant and that every student has that access to high school credit in 8th grade reading this factors and everything else but I think that's an example that illustrates the broader point in making sure that we have those opportunities and I think that that 8th grade year

[01:34:00]
totally critical in jump-starting the reality of high school that's one example I could go on but I'm going to ask my question cuz that is part of it but I'm more asking if we do have Algebra 1 throughout all of 8th grade but it's in Spanish and you get to high school and you have honors classes but they're only in English and you're used to learning in Spanish because this is my case I'm bringing this up and I'm seeing it with my younger siblings as well so how do we fix that gap or if you're starting a rigorous course you can continue throughout your high school career Gonzalez member I understand thank you for that follow up attention to is program design in the case of dual language and I think to use Dr blakey's point

[01:35:00]
Pinterest in student desires needs to drive our practice and then we work to fill in the details after that one of the things that cannot limit us is we need to think differently in terms of how we design our dual language programs with alignment from eighth to 9th grade to make sure that we do have in I think I'm going to make a guess that it's a technical subject that you're alluding to maybe math or science sometimes it's difficult to find just going to guess a Spanish teacher that can not only teach math and science classes in Spanish but teach them at the academic language level which is absolutely critical to program design and do a language so I think that there's been a lot done in that articulation work I can tell you that as we look at budget

[01:36:00]
and then we're looking at bilingual budgets and how we know that student enrollment and Staffing inform how schools are budgeted we often see that there are some gaps and right now during this time of year we see that there are some gaps as we look at compliance to make sure that small classes aren't collapsed in these types of programs so it's really the way we operate the way we think about supporting our schools and also again it was said earlier thinking differently so if we do have a case where we do not have a Spanish Algebra 2 class or a Spanish geometry class is how do we partner with our sister schools to offer opportunity to students at Highland in Albuquerque High to take that class I'm just making an example to be able to make sure that the access is there that the adults change their behavior

[01:37:00]
ensure that students have access to these kinds of classes so that program is offered regardless of Staffing applications because that's what it comes down to is the Staffing application is the whole that I'm going to guess prevented the alignment of the continuation of service so I have a follow-up like more clarification on that so when we're doing AP exams that count for college credit are those able to be done in Spanish or a different language or would that have to be done in English because that creates another barrier if we do find those teachers at those Advanced levels and then they have to take the test for the actual credit and it's an English because that's something that I feel very passionately about in terms of access to program and the

[01:38:00]
Associated assessment and I won't go down that rabbit hole even though I'm tempted to right now is it stands AP the College Board dictates the language the test is administered in we do have examples of courses in APS that are approved by the College Board to be taught in Spanish for example however the test is still in Spanish so for example that's an example of college board approval of to teach that class in Spanish setting the test is still an English that's kind of where I was getting at 2 so thank you for that definitely something possibly look into

[01:39:00]
I don't know if there's anybody else or if you want me to continue board member benefit of you how many more do you have we're getting our points tonight I'm very passionate about this particularly subject I have two more in this strategic plan students academic performance from the 10th PS4 PSAT exam I'm interested in learning more about how this model affects our ESL students potential to be API when the PSAT exam is not giving in Spanish and perhaps putting them in a lower level that they should be I want to just clarify the the it's not the AP potential is the only used to determine students if to take APS it's one of the areas that they're using to encourage students to

[01:40:00]
thank you for being able to clarify that was that your answer is one indicator but it is not what we were planning on using that might be a mistake in the question or the answer to the question it's one indicator to use to increase enrollment in AP courses of students who may not be thinking about AP but it's not the only strategy to use perfect thank you and my last one is strategic slash technical question but I'm just going to say it since I'm the only one I have a question so after speaking with students and experiencing first hand challenges with AP courses I've noticed that there has been incidents where students are interested in enrolling for honors

[01:41:00]
depending on their background under middle school if they previously attended so how will the team and sure that discrimination bias and discouragement is not happening in our school what cultural and narrative shifts can we expect to see board president of gatekeeping shall no longer exist if a student would like to take a course we're going to do our best to encourage them but also support them through it and it's really again that comprehensive approach and we've really done some work to update procedural directors but also last year through the registration process it was clearly articulated and schools worked on ensuring that there was no gatekeeping in the process and really trying to shift mindsets

[01:42:00]
to meeting our goals so we've done a tremendous amount of work in that area and if we do find it it's happening it will be something that will be addressed because it's not acceptable all students should be provided the opportunity to take the courses that they choose and in addition the I think we've talked about it before but the understanding that the superintendents evaluation is based on the goals the progress towards the goals and guard rails the leadership team their expectation is that their evaluation is based on the interims and so also in that it trickles through the system right so that the expectation is that the leadership team takes up to the principles that these interim goals are also a part of their evaluation so particularly looking at the principals and having those conversations like we have here if we see the data going the wrong way it gives the

[01:43:00]
time for the assistant superintendents and the chief of schools to have conversations as far as why is this not growing in these enrollment at the school and breaking down anything that we see as far as barriers so if the system is able to look into the barriers then we're able to kind of see past the this is our expectation but what's really happening on the ground level by bringing these interims into the school level can you remind us all of us and people who are watching what students can do if they are encountered with a discouragement is there any place that they can go to report there's a couple of places so the first thing would be to talk to their counselor it can talk to the principal and then they can also bring it to the attention of the assistant superintendent that's for that school and so we have different layers in so if they feel like they're not getting you know answers that they could reach out to the

[01:44:00]
and that oversees that particular school thank you any other questions okay so I just wanted to make a comment about my absolute favorite question that was submitted is it possible to pass courses with good grades but still not be bilingual I think anybody who's ever taken a foreign language class can answer this question and it's heartbreaking but I thought that that was something to to remark upon because I was certainly there so all right thank you board members for this productive conversation now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with a superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of

[01:45:00]
this report meet our vision of the goal is their growth towards the vision and number three is there a strategy and plans sufficient to cause growth towards the vision and we can accept them is accurate and the superintendent is working to improve student outcomes president can we have a motion to approve sorry to accept the progress monitoring report for goal 3 in a room goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 I move to accept the progress monitoring reports for go three in German goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 post-secondary Readiness this is number Jackson said this was supposed

[01:46:00]
thank you we have a motion and a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please now this is Ronaldo yes Heather Benavides Crystal tapio Romero Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes and no Gonzalez yes thank you and I like to thank member Benavides for facilitating us through that conversation and just provide a reminder that in the interest of continuous feed continuous Improvement if you have feedback about progress monitoring facilitation from your experience is the facilitator or any board members is your experience if you could just send that to me within the next two weeks so we can continue to upgrade our progress monitoring facilitation guide and also appreciation to Dr Gonzalez Miss Jet and Mr Garcia for your presentation and more importantly your work we will now turn to agenda item 5.2 still under student outcomes focused governance which is discussion on a revised interim sorry discussion on revised interim guard rails and our presenter is Dr Gabriel

[01:47:00]
thank you for president Gonzalez and members of the board at the board's request the leadership team and I collaborate collaborated extensively with student outcomes focused governance coaches AJ crabill and Ashley pause to revise our interim guardrails incorporating any feedback we received from board members we believe that we are interpreted interpreting the guardrails as the board intended and I am confident that they will help us in honoring the communities values most of these interim guard rails have annual targets while some require new Baseline data many interim cards reference priority in emerging schools as defined by The District's performance framework this is a framework that's developed by the team and categories of schools into four groups of Distinction acceleration emerging and priority schools with low academic achievement High absenteeism and higher teacher turnover will have more support and resources and

[01:48:00]
schools with high academic achievement absenteeism and teacher turnover will have more autonomy but fewer resources and support I won't cover all of the interim guardrails as you have had them for a couple of weeks but I want to highlight a few points we remove the interim guardrail measuring chronic absenteeism based on the coaches recommendation but we do remain focused on improving student attendance knowing that we can't teach students who are not in school we chose to measure Community Schools for wrap around supports due to their comprehensive approach to student outcomes we are seeing improvements in early literacy proficiency among students with letters certified teachers so we aim to have more teachers trained which is noted in guardrail 3.2 the interim guard rails for guardrail 4 ensures that we hear from student staff and families and we are more specific about survey measurements in guardrail 5 focusing on professional learning resources and site

[01:49:00]
decisions on school budgets and instructions and so with that I stand for any questions on the revised interim guardrails thank you Dr Blakey is there any common question or discussion on the revised interim Cardinals have a comment I was at first surprised that you had taken out the interim government or concerning absenteeism because we all know in the city desk reported it is the rates are pretty high specifically for our Martinez students and so I was going to comment on it but you did say that you're still going to focus on it so I think that's important thank you yes thank you board member benavidez we did take that out under the guidance of Ashley pause primarily looking at the percent of like responsibility that we have on actually leveraging change to Chronic absenteeism and so while we agreed that we do have a large percent of it

[01:50:00]
I don't have complete control over it and so she was hesitant into using a measure of something you don't have full control over and so I think in the work particularly in adding more community school work into the interims that's where we also see the connection of really addressing chronic absenteeism so I think that that's where it will be seen thank you you are other questions or comments I will say I'm happy to see and I'm going to ask when is this teacher survey on professional learning when will that roll out in Trump 5.151% of finalizing the survey and so we hope to have the Baseline will probably be before February we used February because that would match the February of when we would

[01:51:00]
put it out every year so it will go out this year thank you with no other comments or questions we will proceed but thank you to Dr Blake and your Administration for the extra work on those guard rails to ensure that they are as aligned as possible to the community's values with that we will move to agenda items 6 which is our consent agenda so we will be considering approval of the consent agenda which includes items 6.1 through 6.12 is there a motion for approval I need to approve the consent agenda for items 6.1 to 6.12 this is number Jackson and this is Crystal a second thank you we have emotion in a second can we have a roll call vote please

[01:52:00]
Heather Benavides Crystal told me of America yes and your Gonzalez yes thank you we'll move on to 7 which is our action items and agenda agenda item 7.1 which is to consider approval of the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal School District number 12 in the Albuquerque teachers Federation as a reminder the board approved policy for f which states to preserve the confidence and trusted to us as public officials the board commits itself to ethical professional and lawful conduct proper use of authority and appropriate decorum board members will publicly disclose any any campaign contributions in excess of 1,000 whether individual or in the aggregate before voting on matters involving individuals or organizations who made the contributions and will recuse themselves

[01:53:00]
if there is a conflict unless the board decides that recusal will prevent the board from fulfilling its legal Duty discussion during the consideration of this policy when approved last year related at the time to contributions in the context of the Albuquerque teachers Federation the discussion was that the final policy states is as I read that members should disclose any donations over over 1,000 and then also participate in the debate and discussion and then prior to their vote members can decide whether the contribution will influence their vote and either recuse or not the statement and any recusal is entirely up to each board member with that I'd like to continue to move ahead and introduce our presenters for the agenda item so we have Todd Torgerson who is the chief of human resources and legal support services Dr Valerie who's the executive director of Labor Relations and Dr Ellen Bernstein president of the Albuquerque teachers Federation

[01:54:00]
thank you so much for your time tonight and president Gonzalez Dr Blake he remembers the board as noted on the agenda we're here tonight before you for your review consideration approval of the negotiate agreement with APS and ATF it was a pretty straightforward kind of conversation with respect to clean up language and wages on Doctor Who's put together a summary of those changes also Redline document that you all have any board pack and with that we stand for any questions unless you want to elaborate further on the summary of changes I did provide a one-pager for your information with all of the changes but I did want to take an opportunity to thank the negotiating teams for the work and the time and effort that they put into our negotiations process this year and we look forward to any questions you may have great thank you for that and I will start with questions to my right and we'll just go down the line as

[01:55:00]
do you have them so we'll start with number Jackson you will be first for questions okay thank you do you want me to ask all of my questions or do you just want me to ask let's start with one question and then we'll continue through and circle back around okay and thank you for providing the the changes in the negotiate agreement I appreciate that very much so that I guess my first is not really question it's a comment and that I think the reason that this is not on the consent agenda is because this document really does Drive the day-to-day activities of the district and I think that it's really important because of that fact that it is always discussed even though this was a fairly straightforward negotiation this year but there were some things that were placed in their simply because of Statute required it you know the the pay raises were required by statutes they were

[01:56:00]
Associated so that's I think it's just important that the public really understands what's happening here and so I just want to make that comment that I do think it is really important that we discuss as much as possible so that we are transparent and we are accountable to to our constituents and to our community and so I think the first sorry I'll get to my question and the first thing that I wanted to say is I really want to give kudos that the memorandum of understanding reduction 50% reduction 50% reduction I mean I'm just high-fiving you guys from from everywhere I think that's a really really good focus and and I appreciate that you did that and so my first my first question is probably there is more of a technical question why why was the Preamble of the previous negotiated agreement moved into the body of the

[01:57:00]
it's now included in the contract instead of just as a preamble and my question is is it because if it's just the Preamble it's not legally enforceable but if it's moved into the contract and now is thank you for your question board member Jackson I'm good evening again everyone we looked at that very closely and felt that because it is a structure a district Federation structure that super Bernstein APS work on together that it was important it was a good move to put it into the into article one as opposed to in the Preamble The Preamble is more of a this is what we believe sort of statement and then the actual contract language is these are the things that we do to meet those goals outlined in the Preamble so it makes it kind of more

[01:58:00]
enforceable in the sense that is now considered contract language instead of the Preamble I think and you know we have canceled here too if they wanted to jump in on the technical aspects of the legal question but I think in the context in the reading of the full agreement I think there is way in the Preamble as it would be in in languages in its totality with respect to all of them okay so just done more from a stylistic instead of having some particular meaning thank you for that at the moment can I go ahead and pass absolutely I have a question and I'm looking for it it's in reference to the to the action report the bargaining unit consists of 6,255 Educators and I don't remember

[01:59:00]
where I found this but in 2023 it was $6,500 is that right and I was just curious about did we lose that many people so first had an increase in the number of Educators so yay for us you know 6,124 is the latest report that I was running on that so that's an increase over last year of the 6000 to thank you for that we will move

[02:00:00]
great thank you Secretary of Astoria yeah I have a couple of questions so I'll do the first round and this is just in regards to preparation time and just from conversations that I've had with teachers especially Elementary School teachers and putting prep into recess and 20 minutes 20 minute increments that has been very difficult for teachers because most of their students stay in their classrooms so they don't actually get time to prep so I was wondering if there's any conversation around that and then another part of preparation is for our bilingual Educators and if they receive extra time to prep to provide a good quality education and two languages because I didn't see that in the closet is either and then my last thing on prep time is what it's collaboration time actually but hoping to see more collaboration time with special education teachers and general and teachers so that we come to

[02:01:00]
president Gonzalez members of the board superintendent Blakey those are really important questions it has been a goal for many many decades to increase the amount of prep time that elementary teachers had it was built in traditionally into the high schools and some decades ago we were able to incorporate it into med schools we have worked very hard for a long time since I was first a teacher to increase the prep time at the elementary school and we're still working on it I think what's been most difficult is what little wiggle room we had at the elementary school was pushed out when the law increased her instructional time from 99214 for the elementary

[02:02:00]
and that has pushed out a lot of what little room we had as Elementary teachers it is a goal that the superintendent and I have talked about that we have the kind of individual preparation time and collaboration time at the middle and the elementary levels just like we were able to do some 20 years ago for high schools but it is such a big cost item to be able to stop a school so that people are actually freed up to work together and freed up to have preparation time away from students and so one of my goals and I know the goal of many districts is that we get the kind of funding from Santa Fe that we need dates but to also have some local discretionary money

[02:03:00]
to work on goals that we have to make our district better and so that's been my Mantra in Santa Fe for some time and I think we could do great things because we know the research says that when we collaborate and we create lessons together and we have time for work together that actually increases student achievement and so I'd love to get there thank you very much so I had a question first I want to begin by expressing appreciation to negotiations and acknowledge that nothing can happen towards meeting our goals and guardrails without our Educators so extremely pleased to have the opportunity to consider this negotiated agreement and extremely pleased to have so many quality Educators in our district my question is about the 3% raises updated

[02:04:00]
updated salary matrices to reflect the 3% increase in base compensation can you share a little bit of the background of the reason for that being included in this disagreement and also just sort of the relation between having two year agreements and one and sort of why we're here certainly with respect to the 3% of the statutory mandate and just a plug on that increase the level one Educators 506 370 from 201877000 or 6294 an hour yet question mark

[02:05:00]
why are you talking about this contract if we were doing to your approvals well partly for this openers for wages and clean up one there was the intent by the negotiating team certainly to work our best efforts to clean up language and as I remember Jackson pointed out we had a 50% reduction in the number of mou so there's a continuous process Improvement it's a living document it is something we certainly aspire to improve all the time thank you yes Madam president let me just to add that traditionally we have had yearly openers for anything that has to do with money because we are funded annually by the state and that has been true for a long time so we have traditionally had just money and clean up after a short session and the whole contract after a long session and tracks with all the legislature thank you for that well

[02:06:00]
I think this is I would just be encouraged to hear the discussion on this how do you eat from both sides of the negotiating team how do you feel the agreement supports and further the objectives of the Strategic plan in order to reach our goals and are there any challenges that will still need to be addressed as we venture forward into the next negotiating cycle so I don't know I don't know I saw you first OK Google I think thank you to both teams

[02:07:00]
especially the financial department at APS for being able to work with us and carry through on another chunk of differentials we have had for 10 years a joint plan to increase the differentials for co-curricular extracurricular and Leadership responsibility differentials these are very important because schooling is more than the time we're teaching schooling is much bigger and it engages our kids it keeps them in school all of these Coke regular and extra curricular activities so last year it was wonderful we were able to say okay 20 year old differentials for sports we're going to do a little bit for you probably it's already Antiquated but we did a little and this year we did fine arts and you know I think anybody who plays an instrument or

[02:08:00]
is in a choir or my nephew was the band major at Manzano and that was his life and it keeps kids in school it engages them their peer group is all around their activities so in terms of your goals and I think in the press release we mention go 3 that I say the right for sorry I think we're particularly addressing that and then I think it really matters when we're talking about attendance because sometimes kids go to school to see their friends and sometimes their friends are the ones that are doing those co-curricular an extra curricular activities the challenge that we have moving forward is exactly what board member of Starbucks and that is the kind of working conditions that lend themselves to the best professional

[02:09:00]
and when you do International comparisons in other countries the teaching professionals have much more time to work together and a lot less time in front of students and it really increases student achievement helps it just matters when you're able to work together more and have more time and so I think as we look at funding our Educational Systems we have to look at adult time as something that will really matter in student learning thank you for the goals

[02:10:00]
right within honoring regardless and that is the work that we are all aspiring to do and that's going to go throughout the organization she had to get it and where there might be conflict with that relative to negotiate agreement that would be something that could potentially be dedicated by way of agreements and handle that way thank you thank you thank you one of the things that I really like to emphasize is the sqt or the support supporting quality teaching work that has gone on over the past year with the units of study and really focusing on the standard space standard space teaching and learning there's been a lot of time over the past school year and over the summer where teachers and administration have been working collaboratively to build those units of study based on the standards

[02:11:00]
the amount of work and the level of collaboration and conversation that is coming from it is huge I've heard so many of the teachers so many of the administrators saying you know this is really reinvigorated our passion and our knowledge of the standards in our desire to just really get the kids engaged in the standards and I think that's that's going on a long way to help with our goals that that's great to hear it's it's nice to see when contract language so I'm thrilled to hear that and I'll save my next question for her when you get back to me thank you I'm staying to my right any more questions and just the Gratitude and not only to go negotiations

[02:12:00]
Cibola High School and what really helped my oldest son with his twice exceptional with a disability and the giftedness and music and it was the giftedness and music that launched his ideal and his self-esteem and so I'm really grateful for the orchestra teachers the guitar teachers that every piece that they Incorporated to instill what they did for my children so thank you thank you about the Summer band camp is finally paid time how long is this Camp thank you for your question some of the marching band directors were doing three up to 3

[02:13:00]
and then I think the majority of them have we narrowed it down to the 10 days is the average amount of time that they spend some of that and they spend you know a vast amount of time in those 10 days up to the full Duty day 6 1/2 hours a day with the kiddos working on preparations for marching band for the year so I was curious about the Summer band camp because I know as someone who played in the marching band they have long hours and the fact that you know we we tend to overlook or not be intentional about honoring the amount of free time that goes into these activities so I was

[02:14:00]
lady that the Fine Arts people who I call the most fun group in the district all of them they're finally getting their due and so yeah it's it's great it was fair that the coaches got their differential with last year they put in their time that was the right thing to do but I love that we're moving into the academics and I hope we are going to cover other academic coaches please so this is been a long term project it was over 20 years ago

[02:15:00]
the Union in the district made a commitment to think of academic leadership teacher leadership as important as Sports it took us a long time to remember that yes football has traditionally been the highest paid differential because of the culture of our state and our country but it's the band people who go to every single game and Beyond and so in terms of not just in what we value but how much time how many kids they impact we in fact I worked on this project with Dr Blakey years ago but I also want to make a comment that I think I've been trying to advocate for a long time that the state include this in the funding formula

[02:16:00]
as a part of operating schools and that we should be able to look at the kinds of credentialing and the kind of extra time and extra work as a as a career ladder that the state helps fund and not just as a district priority because what we see over time is that some of the smaller districts around the state have been able to fund differentials especially Sports much in a much bigger fashion then we have so I think this conversation about schooling being more than the classroom the whole school experience is something that we need to keep working on cuz it's taking decades just to get here and we have far to go so is that above the line or a below the line asked of the legislature both

[02:17:00]
it just depends on how it gets into statute or if it ever does think you would like to just add a reminder for members that the focus of this conversation is on what is in the one-pager the changes to the agreement this week and sorry this year and to refrain from any comments or suggestions that may be approaching the line of negotiating or offering suggestions acknowledged that the board does not handle the negotiations and we don't do negotiations in public and with that any more questions to my rights and then to my left from my questions with that okay so just wanted to be really mindful of that we all certainly have our personal interests and amazing ideas that we all have and want to leave it in the negotiation and the capable hands of the administration and the district

[02:18:00]
your last questions and then certainly there are other opportunities for us to express our interest areas as board members okay so again based on the fact that this document is 168 pages long and again credit to reducing the memorandum of understanding by 50% and have is there a strategy or a thought to look at an agreement diet similar to like the district and the board are going through policy diets I think that was a mutual interest this year to explore that and I think as articulated in a previous answer that we're always looking to improve processes and this is a living document and if there are items in there that we can address and delete

[02:19:00]
members of the board superintendent the more we partner to make our district a place that supports teaching and learning and the more we Define that it may add language one of our longest articles is the mentor and article and it's long because we have worked as partners for since 2004 to develop this program and ensure that are beginning teachers and struggling teachers have the support that they need and because we work on it jointly as partners sometimes we need to Define things a little more or add a little more detail to things

[02:20:00]
I would not promise that necessarily the cleanup absolutely paying attention to when something is outdated positively but sometimes when we work together to do the best things to support the staff so they can do the best work with kids it gets wordy thank you that was my last question and I would be fine with moving to accept the negotiated changes to the negotiated agreement between the Albuquerque Municipal schools district number 12 and the Albuquerque teachers Federation thank you is there a second I'm happy to second that this is supposed to know that you have a motion from Member Jackson in a second from remember Dominguez before we proceed to a vote is there any additional discussion or questions I just have a comment that I am excited to learn more about the negotiation

[02:21:00]
causes of how we as board members can support the teachers and the teachers union to provide some of those things that I had mentioned and there's a list of more that I think teachers deserve but I think it's going to it's a start to a great process great thank you for that and with that Doctor Albright we have a roll call vote please you know the story goes yes yes crystals yes thank you to our presenters and with that we will move on to agenda item number 8 which is the president's report so today was the first day of school like to welcome back students and also to thank all of our teachers and staff and I also just want to take a moment to turn to superintendent Blakey and see if you'd be willing to provide a report around how things went today thank you for president Gonzalez and members of the board it was a really

[02:22:00]
exciting day it's hard to believe it was today about 12 hours ago that we are walking onto the first opening of the school day actually yesterday it started with i attended web day at Eisenhower Middle School which stands for where everyone belongs and it is an amazing program that is at Roosevelt and Eisenhower Middle Schools to welcome sixth graders to middle school and they have pure helpers that are 8th graders that apply to be web leaders and they welcome the kids it was like assembly style they were high-fiving as they ran through the school and it was just a really good setting to start the school year the web leaders actually wear their t-shirts to school today so that 6th graders if they're lost or confused or sad or whatever their feelings are they can reach out to a web leader and feel safe

[02:23:00]
middle schools moving forward today I visited several schools as did every member of the leadership team including many who are still sitting here with their eyes wide open but it was great we asked everybody to go to school so every school will be visited either today or tomorrow so every child every staff member will have a member of the leadership team on site I mean includes our Chief Financial Officer went to school today or if human resources are even Dr Albright from board Services before she prepared for the meeting she went and visited some of her schools and so the team got together this afternoon to just discuss if we had any issues at the schools wanted to so the doctors to grow and her team could address them right away with the assistant superintendents and actually our meeting this afternoon was a lot of celebrations of the great things that we saw going on today

[02:24:00]
I did tell the team that as they go into school something I'm very strong and is that they approach the school like their child goes to school so if there's an issue that they address it just like they would if their child was in that class and so I think that the team really did take that to heart today as they walk through schools and it was a great opening I would like to credit much of it to the team and all the prep work that they did this summer we had a dashboard of course Chris West likes his death words so we have an idea and he makes a dashboard so we did have a dashboard that looked at the opening Readiness of schools that we looked at weekly in cabinet to see if schools were ready and our new Deputy of operations took a big step into the World opening up for school and making sure operations was ready our m&o the custodian spent all summer cleaning

[02:25:00]
bring and today the team all noted that custodians were really proud of the work that they did at the schools and that they were clean and ready for students one of the members even mentioned that the custodian like wanted to walk them around to show how proud he was of the work that he did over this summer Transportation went well today we had a buses dropping off picking up our number of special education routes has increased significantly from the past and so we think the team for working on that it was great to see families taking pictures helping carry in school supplies students got lost they asked me where to go I didn't know where the stairs were so I had to ask a teacher for help and the teachers were just really excited they you know we're greeting kids by name they were just you know I talked to a first-year teacher so they were just about as nervous as the sixth grade student you know welcoming students into their classroom for their first day on the job so it was just a

[02:26:00]
play good I'm feeling and we had a team member who went to New Futures as one of her site visits and she just commented that it was a really neat day to see like 2-month-old at school and then she also went to have a high schools and saw seniors and so she said it was just eye-opening to see the whole spectrum of students from new Futures to watching graduation and so we are all really excited tomorrow will be our second day back I have to say that doctor Gonzales was he got he says he got tears in his eyes today but Harrison Middle School has a new principal and she also was a teacher at Harrison and it happened to today was the day that they all got together to bid on the new building and so she was surrounded by all of the contractors that were looking at building the new building and she had mentioned that it was just a great experience

[02:27:00]
to feel that first day of school was when she was going to see this new building start so and she had started her teaching career at the school too so seeing you construction is also really exciting to see as Things become new so by tomorrow every school we play music when we walk around so tomorrow by tomorrow every school and every student will have a leadership team member there to address any issues so we are really excited it was a great feeling in the schools today thank you for that Dr Blakey it's super exciting for the back to school season love it next I just want to share the next item on the agenda is our executive session and so when we do go into executive session the board will discuss the recommendations of the ad hoc committee on superintendent performance incentives so the conclusion of that discussion

[02:28:00]
the board may choose to vote in public on updating the contract once it does the committee will have completed its tasks and will be disbanded and I'd like to thank board member of Benavides for leading this committee is the chair and also thanked board member top your Romero for serving on that and completing your task we also currently have an ad hoc committee on requests for information I met with the chair of that Committee Member vice president told me to last week and so that committee is also actively meeting they are working to assess the effectiveness and the roll out so far of the let's talk platform which is the new platform for essentially customer service with our community Gathering feedback on that so they can integrate that into the work in the recommendations that they're doing they will be making recommendations on both policy and processes as well as creating memos and training resources for the board for us to know how to handle information requests and

[02:29:00]
more so just want to acknowledge that that committee is continuing to meet and we'll move some potential policy recommendations to the policy committee process and acknowledge that this committee was called request for information is is broader sort of a committee dealing with Knowledge Management and the board overall so everything from how we asked questions how we share that information how we store information how we provide information to all of the task force and commissions were on and a whole lot more so appreciate to vice president to for leading that process and continuing on with the ad hoc committees so now that the new superintendent and leadership team are in place we will resume with the policy review and diet so a new ad hoc Committee of members Jackson and benavidez will begin meeting to finalize the policy diet and then to make recommendations for the November meeting this new out of hock committee will be supported by our policy

[02:30:00]
