[00:36:00]

what's the address to the discretion of each board member so our first speaker is Franklin Ghana president piercing members of the board tonight I'm not here to yell at you yay but I am here to thank board member Peterson for attending the Labor Day event at Teague Park Labor Day and supporting unions are extremely important especially now in these crazy political times as a public official it's really hard to be a normal person has done that time and time again 35 years in the system isn't easy I'm actually glad I was never one of her students not because she's not a good teacher but because we would have had really

[00:38:00]
interesting public political discussions and I probably would have lost which is really really sad the intelligence and commitment to the teacher Union in EA Union is amazing and I know I yell at her and all of you a lot but I wouldn't do that if I didn't think that you were great leaders and also since I still have time a special thank you to Ellenburg for all of her commitment as the teacher Union president and also Kathy Chavez who trained me and is probably on many occasions you know very sad that she did so well thanks for your leadership appreciate it our next speaker is Janet's

[00:39:00]

[00:40:00]
I know you have busy weekends but everyone is invited to come out that day and I enjoy coming to board meetings because I met a Del Norte graduate tonight and I've latched on to him already Mr McDaniel that was here with the Garfield group is 1980 graduate of Del Norte so he'll be hearing from me and meeting these dogs oh my gosh this was like the highlight of my day 2198 to 1978 he's coming from Texas to be part of that and a woman named Judy nickel who was the columnist for the album in 1956

[00:41:00]
was that the board meeting when the Hodgen was created as a Barrack school and Judy will be attending as kind of our living link to 1956 when hodgin was created and anyway so and go down Nights at Freddy's

[00:42:00]
are school has been based on community involvement we are currently feel like we're not a community and we're being pushed out not only with our children in the classroom but just as a community as organizations have left our school we feel that we're being harassed we have had over 30 teachers of children and this is the best interests of our children and we feel that that's I don't know I've never

[00:43:00]
when did this so I don't know if any of you are aware of what's going on down there Adobe Acres thank you he is mentioned on a daily basis brought up conversation showed up at our school I'm sorry I'm so sorry I just wish that you guys can look into this and you guys can see what's going on

[00:44:00]
I mean we're generations of community involvement that has just been almost completely destroyed down there thank you thank you thank you thank you for your input that concludes the public forum tonight thank you we'll go on to the superintendent report good evening president required by the State Department of Education parcc test scores are being sent home to students who are in the third through 11th grade and took the parcc test last spring so the results are going home period comprehensive guide on aps.com edu to help explain the individual students

[00:46:00]
nice and short wouldn't you say thank you thank you very much we're going to the special issues we have a long list of what I call board operating policies and we should be able to get through most of these fairly quickly but we will take a look at that and we have presented being a lot of people but Brenda is our executive director of services education in operations for you to discuss with the corresponding committee on September 12th

[00:47:00]
Board of Education committees and be four public participation at Board of Education meetings and since action is needed on each of these policies before you tonight Heather doll are policy analyst will review each of the policies briefly with you thank you the first one you'll see a sorry board of education goal and on this one the revised suggestion is just to update the board policy cross reference is there any way that we could all student succeed that we

[00:48:00]
you can say that our students succeed because we always say there are students I think that's an important thing to to put in there that's just that's just my opinion on that one so stupid if you want to do it that way or our students I just think I mean I just like our I like it like that so without

[00:49:00]
did the legal cross references the board policy cross reference in the procedural director of cross reference so those are the only revisions made to this one we seek your approval on that any comments from the only thing that I that I would just like I mean I think it's all fine and it's things that we say that you know we should do but sometimes when it comes to knowing what all are federal statutes and regulations Etc are that sometimes I think that we need a little bit of an update on what is some of the big ones with some of the big ones are that may be our attorney can kind of let us know when we're talking about that is really important that is our nation's law on education but yet when I was trying to read over it I mean it's really detailed so do we really know everything about it that we need to know so I think when there's anything big like that I think it's important for us

[00:50:00]
to to be updated on it so that's my only my only wish this is not in the same realm as the legal status it is not a statute so but I think your point being even that even the regulations and things that might be of interesting is the nation's law on education so we need to kind of know what is that not true like why do they put it out there I think it's important for us to know so however if we can get updated or something I think that

[00:51:00]
I think it's important for us to

[00:52:00]
what are the relationships that we really need to have and I think sometimes we can look at the federal and think well that's a little different interpretation here than the states having it and maybe we have a local interpretation that maybe a little different and so how does that all work together I think we as a board need to be informed about anything to do with education

[00:53:00]
so let's take that as a baby in action item for us to take a look at it maybe wouldn't even be a bad idea to have a retreat where we really talked about all of those kind of things you know that's another thing that might be useful but okay we'll look into that thank you Peggy any other comments okay we have a motion for approval all in favor please say hi hi Google OK Google

[00:54:00]
board membership we again updated just the one procedural directive cross reference and with that we seek your approval any comments thank you thank you for the superintendent evaluation seconds

[00:55:00]
add two grammatical fixes as well as board policy cross reference updating and procedural directive cross-reference updates with that I seek your approval any comments I've got a motel and with this one we changed the date of the organizational meeting to be in January rather than March based on the election time and we updated the procedural directive OK Google

[00:56:00]
where we get the information that January is the time frame and do we have it here I just wondering you know I didn't have it for Mark but I just wondered if it would be useful to have a reference so that we people wonder why you have it in January I don't know that HB 98 is what we reference but you know something cuz we will have more discussions on that and the procedure Google so

[00:57:00]
add a motion and a second please say hi alopecia thank you thank you thank you updated the administrative position crossword

[00:58:00]
earlier today when we're saying we will not conduct a vote by secret secret ballot I just want to know and nobody could answer this for me today when we use consensus in executive session that is not considered anywhere a vote correct that's correct okay I just wanted to verify that that I was thinking about what does that mean when we do when we have consensus so I just want to make sure that that is the case she's over here trying to figure out who's saying you know thank you thank you

[00:59:00]
list for this board policy we updated the legal cross reference the procedural director of cross-reference and the forms that we seek your approval any comments please say hi hi hi the text of the first paragraph to properly identify the Board of Education conducts meetings to clarify and then we updated the procedural director of cross reference kind of about how to say this word and I don't know that it came out kind of with any of the suggestions it

[01:00:00]
look like it to me but I didn't write it down but I thought that we had said you something that I know Lorenzo had said suggested and I thought we but I didn't write it down so I was trying to remember I know he was generally but I don't remember exactly how it came out but I thought Robert's Rules of orders order she'll generally be the basis for conducting our Board of Education meetings I didn't write it down so I don't know yeah I think what I said at some point in time of educational

[01:01:00]
Board of Education meeting so we kind of don't make it as wordy so right now we need conduct

[01:02:00]
what sound shall be generally shall be the best might be grammatically a little bit nicer and then what do you think about for conducting or because then you can have the general a little bit closer to the bases and then what after that do you think I remove color I would add she'll be the general basis of how the Board of Education

[01:03:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:04:00]
any comments from the board members second all baby please say hi hi hi thank you Administration temporary suspension of policies and procedural directives for this one OK Google

[01:05:00]
things that have to be done so well don't ever have to do this that's absolutely

[01:06:00]
I'm just confused about the second paragraph the first paragraph is talking about us being open and transparent with a public through our communication so we need to make sure that we all have access to the same Communications in order for us to be able to do that one but then the second part is talking about forging relationships in non-district organizations so can you tell me how those kind of go together what do we do as part of that communication how do we communicate with the

[01:07:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:08:00]
do we have any kind of a thought across the board here I just don't know if it would go better somewhere else and you might know Heather from looking at it might that second paragraph might go better second sentence whatever might go better somewhere else when you're talking about organizations or adding if you want to add something about Communication in that second I don't I don't know remember organizations like Michigan School Board Association and then or the pre-k program that we attended a couple weeks ago so it gives you an

[01:09:00]
play Trinity to forge relationships outside of the district and to represent the Board of Education in that those meetings and activities but if you want to revisit those things and procedure directive I think that's where it would be better to lay it out I would just take the second part out and then just what procedures

[01:10:00]
so I don't think either one of those work cuz they don't they're not talking about us communicating organizations to talk about organizational you know legal responsibilities which is straight out of the statute first of all and the other part is just our members so I think it would have to be a different one and end up you know there's all kinds of groups forming all the time and some have

[01:11:00]
when's that I agree with others that I might not but the important thing with me to would be for me as a member of the Board of Education to begin to build relationships with these folks to actually look for opportunities to communicate hear what they have to say and address issues as they come up because there are there are many groups out there that we have no clue what they're about and I think that part of my responsibility is a Community member and as a leader in the community on this board I should be available and open to those meetings doesn't mean I have to go to meetings every night of the week but I do think that when it when the occasion arises it makes sense to to go ahead and go organized labor or other Business Leaders I'd be happy to do that the Board of Education in transparent with the public through systematic

[01:12:00]
communication and through forging relationships with non-district organizations period and then and then it goes into complying with confidentiality requirements yeah that's what I was going to say is if it if it stays in here there needs to be something that ties at the are we forging relationships in order to make something happen because when we when we Forge relationships with say Mission graduates to make something happen or are we looking at forging the relationships just to communicate what's happening in the district is representative of the district to those organizations in

[01:13:00]
turn it off and then if we need to do you have the participation committees and other stuff there are other places in policy that talk about action let me read the sentence and then I recommend that we take this one to the September 12th meeting and I'll update the procedural director of cross reference but the first sentence would read the Board of Education shall strive to be open and transparent with the public through systematic communication and participation in non-district organizations in non-district organizational meetings that implies

[01:14:00]
find for me is the Latino education task force you know 9 years ago it didn't exist and a few of us got together and decided that maybe we should look at the Constitution and check out whether or not sufficient and adequate funding was actually being followed or could we find some leverage to to say hey it's not happening well guess what they organized and they actually began to raise these issues in a systematic way that maybe will have some constructive impact on our ability to do things we need to do I just think it just be Hooves us to begin to do it the other example is the men of color initiative and Dr Percy force the issue at the Council of great City schools that Latino young man would be included that it wasn't just about black men but

[01:15:00]
is Aldi's Global majority men who were challenged systematically by the education systems throughout the nation that we needed to have a relationship through those folks I think Dr maestas went off to a celebration at the White House and other things so I just think that we have to say you know this is part of our role and sometimes it's it's I guess finding a new path to to try to move education forward we don't have relationships forging relationships in there and we always say how important that is so to add to what was saying if we say something like the Board of Education shall strive to be open and transparent with the public through systematic Communications through the forging of relationships and through the participation

[01:16:00]
play non-district organizations that way we kind of have all of that in there I like that sound system

[01:17:00]
and participating in non-district organizations just to be reasonably English correct we don't forward your relationships in usually usually 1111 OK Google

[01:18:00]
State Statute of regulations and any confidentiality agreement and removing the other paragraph so that's what we're voting on okay we've had a if we had a motion in a second we have had Megan says all the paper please say hi hi Google

[01:19:00]
Board of Education business and we updated the legal cross reference to updated cross reference with that we see her approval so that covers all the Ada is that in compliance with the legal cross reference

[01:20:00]
sure that covers all of 88.16 in the legal cross reference I just didn't see it up top and I just wanted to make sure that that was what you wanted a second place

[01:21:00]
thank you thank you appreciate it thank you very much so we'll go on to the approval of the consent caliber items that item number 7 do I have a motion for Google

[01:22:00]
also I'm sorry I didn't see you Franklin I was out there too which was nice it was it was a beautiful day and then I just have something that I just want to read just having and you'll kind of know what after I read it what it kind of pertains to It's called The Kiss she is pregnant he had just saved her from a fire in her house rescuing her by caring her out of the house into her front yard while he continued to fight the fire when he finally got done putting the fire out he sat down to catch his breath and rest a photographer from the Charlotte North Carolina newspaper notice turn the distance looking at the firemen he saw her walking straight toward the fireman and wondered what she was going to do as he raised his camera she came up to the tired man who had saved her life and the lives of

[01:23:00]
turn babies and kiss them just as a photographer snapped this picture and people say that animals are dumb it was a dog that was pregnant that got saved from a fire that is all burned and came across to think that fireman so we know just seen all those animals here today that animals are extremely smart and I'm very thankful to have my new adopted one no thank you very much better if they're surrounded by a variety of other trees that they actually communicate

[01:24:00]
in the interest of getting to Jefferson Middle School open house all I'm going to say is again thank you to all the work that's being done to get the school year kicked off to a good start it's an enormous task and I have to say the work being done at Hawthorne and Whittier is exciting and fun as well as being challenged what are the other things that are needed and what's going on

[01:25:00]
Boulevard schools too so thank you all right here I don't have too much I just want to say I really enjoyed talking with the young people outside in the foyer there they're amazing just listening to what their lives are about and what they're thinking about and as they explained their projects that just looks so so exciting I was very pleased and I think we could be very proud of those young ones sweet and who wants to become mechanical engineer and her brothers to have these conversations with these young ones and got to see how how well they present themselves

[01:26:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:27:00]
I just want to say thanks to Janet and to Franklin for always coming out your Civic engagement and just being part of the board sharing news talking to us that's important and I really appreciate when we have have you come out because it really are upstanding members of our community and so thank you so much for doing that and then I just want to say it was it was amazing last Friday I had an opportunity to present to the Science and Technology legislative committee and it was about science and technology and building a Workforce and so seeing the students out today was it was just amazing because it was exactly what we were talking about it was about you know the importance of having opportunities for young people to engage in technology and in science projects that really gives them sort of an idea of what's going to happen with the skill the things that

[01:28:00]
developing and what does that look like for them into into into the workforce so I was very I was great I wish I could have taken them with me to Taos to present to the legislators because I think it would have made a difference in terms of instead of just talking about what's happening or what it looks like but to actually see young students being prepared in that way so that makes me proud because it's you know something that our school district is making available for students to be able to engage in and demonstrate those skills that drone technology was like just like mind blowing so so that was pretty awesome and it's always refreshing to hear from you and thank you for coming in and Franklin thank you for your service to the community as well I always look forward to hearing

[01:29:00]
you have to say regardless of how it sounds you know you put us you know a notice sometimes and that's that's good keep this keeps his active one of the things that I wanted to share is that Albuquerque is you know we all know Albuquerque is the largest city in New Mexico and it's also the home of the largest District the largest school district APS and home of the University of New Mexico Lobos and so the majority of our students actually graduate from UNM actually attend graduate makes sense that when the when the University of New Mexico reaches out to the district as well as representative was very active in the community and asking us to on Fridays you know we are one

[01:30:00]
Community one Albuquerque and this makes sense that we all do this on Fridays and I'm just asking the superintendent I know that there was there was some information sent out so I just think that it makes sense that we're all part of one community in this in this area you know we share students and it only makes sense that we were red and so I just wanted to tell you that I'm wearing my cherry cherry red here it is not you know I just think it's a great idea it gives us a sense of community and bring it together and it's one of our our Jewels is really the University of New Mexico and so let's get together and let's do this on Fridays I'm just asking you to do and then one of the exciting things that we're doing we have a new school in the North West

[01:31:00]

[01:34:00]
I'm done it's been pretty exciting so we look forward to walking over there tomorrow and being a part of the celebration in the cookies and lemonade at 5:30 tomorrow a couple of other things that we have coming up in the community again I love what candy said in reference to being a sense of our communities we have our state fair parade coming up and so let's participate in that or at least cheer people on as they float on by and they are both when they hit the ground

[01:35:00]
I didn't think about that but I just wanted to share one more thing with everybody and it's kind of a feel-good positive story that I've been meaning to share since summer graduation and but I was reminded of it again last night is I had an opportunity to meet a Highland High School she was kind of a junior senior at the time and the dressing room at Target and she was in an olympic boxer I know we I conversation anywhere so I struck up a conversation with her grandma in the Target dressing room but she was an Olympic boxer at Highland High School and her grandma was concerned because she was spending so much time training and being Olympic boxer and she wasn't really good about communicating that with her teachers and administration so she really needed to be in a place that could accommodate her schedule and reference to being in a Olympic boxer so I worked with Pat Our Guest to get her into a different school and have a different kind of schedule and

[01:36:00]
what kind of followed her and checked in with her every couple of months to see how she was doing well it caught me off guard when we were caught me off guard so much that I cried when we stood on stage during summer time and shook the hands of our summer graduates because there she was you know like a year and a half later crossing the stage and it was so exciting and then last night I was reminded of it on her Facebook page she again was trying out for the Olympic boxing team and was there and you know there she was in front of the big Olympic sign so it just gave me chills and it was just such a feel good moment to know that you know she is a graduate of APS and and not in the non-traditional sense and we helped her with a different route in reference to be non-traditional and graduated and now she's gone on to realize those dreams of being in the Olympics so it was just a special moment I wanted to share with everybody so thanks again every single day for everything that you do

[01:37:00]
thank you thank you thank you very much we're going to the president's report which is going to be short I'll 7th the comments from all the board members I think that's the proper 7th on thank you Janet thank you Frankie for being here I appreciate all the things you do and I can tell you my wife knows Janet a lot longer than probably any of you here because she graduated with Janet high school they were the first graduating class in Illinois

[01:38:00]
and I think we need to see if we can have more of those maybe in the future and if you got any topics you would like to cover I mean even the one you brought up about the es and all those things let's talk about it and let's see if we can have more discussions like that I think we were pretty Frank with each other most the time and I think again it was good to talk a little bit with each other you know I think that's always good I think we as a board need to come up with some of our resolutions for the New Mexico School Board Association so I need to work with probably a little bit to do that and see if you know if you guys have some ideas of tell me again Barbara thank you

[01:39:00]
Florida Community Schools and and we do have some funding you know from the city or you know Brandon County Commission we like that that's good but we're talking about more of a legislative funding and trying to help all of the districts in terms of this kind of a model and we do have quite a few districts that are working on that you know Santa Fe Las Cruces and others and so I think that's a reasonable kind of thing so we'll work a little and maybe we can get that on the agenda for the next regular board meeting cuz I know we're following the policy and all that so maybe two weeks from now see if we can get some resolutions I don't know what the deadline is do we have a deadline October OK Google

[01:40:00]
I'm not quite as close to Jackson as a board member of mijo but it's always great to see what we're doing in our in our schools and what we're doing to try to improve them and and and and and all the capital stuff that we that we have it's just fantastic and the band was a little loud as gyms are but it was great cheerleaders are there it was wonderful and a greatly appreciate all the stems stuff of course that's well at least it used to be down my alley and talking with all these people and certainly they UPS Education Foundation

[01:41:00]
but I think again this whole idea of experiential learning is so important to our kids to really get experiences with building things with doing stuff with showing product you know it's so important to understanding how things work and how things don't work you know and so I think that's all part of this you know this idea of CTE how does it fit within our concept of College and Career and that kind of thing before so I think the things were doing are great and I think that's what we need to keep emphasizing and these relationships and we talked about the relationship with not those are those are working with Workforce Solutions

[01:42:00]
we can exercise what we think is our responsibility as a board to bring this to Bear right and that's kind of the idea of what we were talking about is how do we use our responsibilities in a good way and and so I think these are all really really good things and working with the community on these things are part of what makes us so I think that's really really important so appreciate all the comments from the board members again I'm always proud to be part of you guys so thank you very much
