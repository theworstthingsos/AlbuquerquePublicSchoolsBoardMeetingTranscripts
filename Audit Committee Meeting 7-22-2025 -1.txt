[00:06:00]
here in by the end of the week so that they can begin uploading those items once they're ready as Mark mentioned we did have the charter school entrance conference last week I think it went really well everybody should have had some items in their portal that were due by the end of last week we are now beginning our sample selection process with the Chargers schools and we are providing Roberta at 8:00 p.m. weekly status updates so then she is aware of any schools at could be falling behind if that does happen that is all I have thank you are there any renette did you know I was just going to say thank you for the update and we stand for questions thanks for not thank you for the update and we now stand for questions anybody

[00:07:00]
any questions for the team I submitted questions last month and I was directed directly to the company and so I just want to report that I did have a very great conversation with the leader and I'm forgive me I'm forgetting the other yes yes yes and I at the University so I learned what an external and an internal audit is and internal is much more extensive and more

[00:08:00]
play and so we are doing an external at the end of the conversation I asked if Charter Schools were the only contracts that the auditor was looking at and I was advised that that was not the case and I asked if it was appropriate for me to to request a contract be looked at and and so I offered I requested a review of the procurement process that was followed for the for actually the the board work or I should say the government

[00:09:00]
contracts and so I just want to in in full public disclosure stand by that so thank you thank

[00:10:00]
service center today I bring for to you the ethical Advocate data for April 1 2025 to June 30th 2025 which has been shared with you is you can see we've received a total of 97 whistleblower complaints from July 1st 2024 to the end of June 30th 2025 the reporting your packets provides a breakdown of the data in by several categories and the report also shows that the number of this your lower than last year's report time frames at this point I stand for any questions are there any questions on the ethical Advocate statistics to report anything that looks
