[00:03:00]

[00:04:00]
rules and expectations which are starting officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that are gender specified in advance to items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up with their in-person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers you will each have two minutes to speak other

[00:05:00]
once your time is up you'll be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message you my email board Ed at aps.edu in addition for those of you here tonight it representative from our service center will be here to assist you Mr Gonzales please introduce the speakers thank you board members are all of our speakers this evening or in the room we starting with Daniel Tafoya Daniel do have two minutes once you begin speaking my name is Daniel I'm here to talk about retaliation by the principals and cover up of child abuse I have reported several claims between the past two years one and a principal dragging out a student and dropping him on his head yet she was nothing was done she covered it up and was transferred to another school another teacher going a student off the desk yeah he was with me at that school had a special ed and EA sleeping at her

[00:06:00]
pictures taken by students yet she was made redirector of the school another teacher told the students on a couple weeks ago nothing was then he still working yet all of these have been reported principles covering up saying she's taking action and nothing is being done no one has contacted me or witnesses to verify pictures taken evidence so I don't understand how everyone is saying that these are being investigated properly but yet when it says have not been contacted evidence has not been asked for so what is being done the principals are allowed to say oh it's my school I handled it correctly when it has not been handled correctly yes she is telling another principles and staff are recently meaning of mandated reporters this needs to stop we need to take care of our students and protect our students and protect our other staff which is not being done by APS APS police retaliating two

[00:07:00]
investigations it needs to stop thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Chad run Kidwell you have two minutes once you begin speaking good afternoon about the Coronado expansion and it's always great to see positive news stories about public schools it was very informative in the first two seconds I learned Coronado is the only dual Language School in Albuquerque so wow that I learned that prior to his expansion they are there was no no language middle school programs there was a gap but now thanks to Coronado we have Middle School level language instruction so parade of gratitude to the influence of bourbon parents of Coronado for getting it done

[00:08:00]
find the example of showing how you get a dual language program up and running and how you make it work and using that example who knows what could happen maybe schools in historically Chicano neighborhoods will come up with their own dual language programs it could just grow and Thrive I don't know maybe schools like East San Jose or Doris Gonzalez or Truman or Washington I don't know sky's the limit and then the second thing is just while back I had a meeting with this District administration and I learned one of the things that APS doesn't do great is tell our stories but based on this news coverage I'm just so happy that we are getting so much better at telling our stories you have a good afternoon thank you thank you thank you man or next speaker is Dr Samoa 2 minutes won't you begin

[00:09:00]
besides you just said let the little children come to me Democrat legislators first special session in Santa Fe are pushing a bill that would strip parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children and with mandate that all school children public-private parochial and even homeschool father immunization rules dictated by the Department of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics which would lead to vaccine injuries do you know what are the toxic dangerous ingredients in the vaccines acetone animal blood cells healthy again report reveals that chronic conditions are now the normal one and two children has at least one chronic illness ADHD autism diabetes obituary

[00:10:00]
call Sarah how do you need to start a triple in the last 30 years developmental delays and neurological conditions are skyrocketing what happened to medical field on my parental rights why should an unelected bureaucrat decide what's best for your child this is not just about vaccine but about control versus freedom and who gets to make decisions for your family how do you expect our children to try back academically and athletically would you please call your legislative support children's

[00:11:00]
and you'll have 2 minutes once you begin speaking all right good evening I want to emphasize again the extreme importance of the negative impact on our children's Minds from the explicit books in our school libraries I have detail I have a detailed copy of the parents guide to explicit books and APS libraries there are the titles the authors and the contents of the books that need to be taken off the shelves the words containing these books describe right incest in sexual abuse and pornographic images of material does not benefit our children's mind it damages them like a drug making them more addictive it needs to exaggerate a beliefs and sexual activity among peers sexually permissible attitude and sexual callousness including more negative attitudes towards sexual partners

[00:12:00]
adolescents are normalizing sexual abuse done to them because of the pornographic exposure females are specially prone to the normalization of sexual promiscuity which heightens the risk of being victims of sexual violence and STDs I've been in the AP system APS system with five kids some of graduated I pay property taxes as well and do not want my money contributing to this much it is a violation to expose on innocent children's Minds to explicit sexual acts without their parents consent sex sex is an action that should be between an adult male and female that love each other are married and ready for children this is the way God intended it is pornographic books do not educate nor cancel young minds but instead they corrupt twist and Destroy thank you

[00:13:00]
what president Gonzales that concludes public forum thank you Mr Gonzales we will move on to our next item which is to consider acceptance of the progress monitoring report for goal one which is early literacy are presenters for this agenda item or Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey Dr Randy Mueller wine on a Chavez and Sherry Jets before we begin we do need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I met with the administration to review the report and believe that all the criteria for an effective report has been met but I will open the door for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests otherwise all right seeing none then I will turn to Dr Blakey to just explain details about how we will monitor this particular goal giving some of the circumstances that we discussed at the beginning of the meeting

[00:14:00]
thank you president Gonzalez and members of the board I am pleased to share the preliminary results on goal one 31.7% of our third grade students identified in the Aussie Martinez decision along with her African-American students demonstrated grade level proficiency or above on the English language arts assessment that is a 6.4 percentage Point increase from last year and above our 2024 2025 Target of 29.3% which marks real progress toward our 2028 goal of 37.3% every student group that we tracked showed improvement with notable games among Native American students African-American students and economically disadvantaged students these gains appear to come from stronger skills and key reading and writing areas like understanding context clues recognizing an author's point of view and writing both informational and story based texts I would like to clarify

[00:15:00]
buy a point of potential confusion when the board received the draft agenda it did include the gold one progress monitoring report report was then removed from the posted agenda and that is because we had anticipated that the public education department would have released the data before the meeting but that has not happened yet so what we are presenting tonight or are preliminary results to stay on top of our progress monitoring calendar and while these are early results they do reflect meaningful progress and demonstrate that are focused efforts are helping our students build the foundational reading skills that they need to succeed so with that my team and I are prepared to answer your questions based on these data great thank you Doctor Blakey since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will go ahead and open the floor to our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have submitted questions that are technical or tactical before tonight's meeting and those questions and their answers are

[00:16:00]
with the agenda materials for the board and the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails in this case boards goals those questions must be smart meaning that they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time bound so let's get started I will go ahead and start on my right with member popular do you mind if you come back to me I will come back to you we will go to member store thank you for putting this together I did have a question about male students falling behind their female counterparts but I was answered so thank you for that answer my other question is one of your next steps is to have a assistant superintendents and principals Implement rigorous B4 or the beginning of the year and middle of the Year progress monitoring for third grade similar

[00:17:00]
K through 12 students how is the strategy different from what's already happening good evening the way that that is different is it is also following the path of our progress monitoring with first grade and second grade that has resulted in some really great opportunities for early and intervention so we realize that the third grade level that is something that we could Implement very easily as it's already a practice so we are able to look at third grade interim assessment results to by interventions before the State Testing happens thank you can you explain to me what type of assessment this will be is it something that we've already seen before or is it different yes it's the same as first grade and second grade you have

[00:18:00]
thank you so much great thank you remember to worry too ah yes I know with this new program coming about with somebody else could you tell me where kids with disabilities how are we using this specific program to adapt to the disabilities and to make it more accessible and individualized for each student board president Gonzalez members of the board superintendent Blakey it's nice to see you this evening thank you for the question I'm definitely not the expert on the Ameri Administration however just like any assessment that we provide to our students that have IEPs they follow all of their accommodations and ensure that they have the testing environment that will best suit them and certainly at hair to those and work with the students to make sure they're able to really show us what they know

[00:19:00]
AI can you also just give me an example on how we are initiating the actual talk through for some students especially if they don't especially kids with disabilities my concern is since it is computer and its some such a screen many kids just pick and choose and so how are we going to make sure that they are not doing that right

[00:20:00]
play Mirrors there is the oral fluency part and that's actually where sensor speaking speaking to the microphone but other than that the other parts that are done the same way with the student so the combinations are there in their IP so if they're supposed to have somebody there to go through it with them the same accommodations are followed so that's something that we've been doing for a long time now so it's not any different than what we've been doing before with other platforms because there are parts of it where there are being asked to pick from multiple choice or to look at it and do things so it's not it's no longer in terms of how our students are experiencing that type of assessment go ahead and go through if I kind of just one thing to is that so one of the things so that the president of America today which I was very happy about because we got to have some very little bit better for us and that also included our our special education so it was a very open conversation

[00:21:00]
they're really open because it's a big investment of the state of New Mexico in this assessment like they were really getting a lot of direct support including them actually coming out to our schools I'm in the coming weeks so my point is that there have been some concerns but I'm really happy with the level of support never received to make sure that it is appropriate for our students speech to language how is that being followed through each other in case they have difficulties that's what I'm asking because you know the sound and repetition and words you know is it going to be understood for a majority of those kids just as well as it has been so again it's not a complete separation from the teacher the teacher is still there with the students and one of the biggest things about our assessments which

[00:22:00]
is to make sure that it's not in lieu of the experience of the teacher so the teacher is there with the students so if the teacher at the student has something in their IP is something that they've been doing regularly with the students we always say administer the assessment and the same way for for this is for interns a little bit different for the state to state Brandon MSA has a little bit stricter rules that we have to follow as well as for Nate the national assessment at educational progress but for our interns we make sure that the way the student experience is classroom every day the way they're taught is how they experienced the assessment because we don't want to be in it nor do we want to be disruption we want to be a part of learning process so it's very personalized when it comes out to our students at a very specific needs in their IEPs thank you and just as a follow-up or point of clarification since we are monitoring them to Amira is

[00:23:00]
the portion of the report that describes the next steps and so given that and you're describing the additional training for teachers and how you're going to end principles and how you're going to use a mirror I think it might also be helpful for the next report to integrate some of the feedback from member to amorito around as it relates specifically to students with special education or IEPs I think that would help as well and then did you have any questions about the demographic results the goal one thank you sure remember Jackson thank you so I just want to pause so that Noah has a chance to write this down 6.4% increase in a year that's incredible what a 6.4 percent increase in a year that's incredible amazing and I think is a testament to some really well done focused leadership

[00:24:00]
so thank you for what you guys have done and I see him typing so I'm glad that that's going to make it into the next article my question is in regards to it's on the next steps page so it would be on page 5 of the report and it's the inconsistent expectations section so if this is kind of a two-part question throughout the report there is a reference to the what is it called the classroom observation tool that is being used so my question is is the district using consistently using the classroom observation tool as you are observing these inconsistencies due to the fact that the report mentions that it's anecdotal information so I just want to confirm that a you know aligned tool is actually being used as this data is being recorded

[00:25:00]
and then second to that what strategy are you going to use to make sure that you're moving from inconsistency to consistent usage because this is now the second time in a report that we have seen that usage tends to drop as we get further along in the school year thank you vice president Jackson for the question we are you know one of the things we've learned over the last year particularly around structured literacy and you know we've been mentioned accelerated learning and standard space station is that the importance of the observation tools being used with a certain amount of fidelity is really important for us to be able to understand what is happening in our classrooms and to help our teachers and our teaching and learning coaches know how to best support the teacher next and I do think one off we have last year was that are structured literacy tool could be used in a stronger way

[00:26:00]
so I'm very happy to say that Miss Chavez and Miss wheeler in our executive director of Elementary learning they are working with that tool one thing about it is it's a very dense tool and so they are pulling it apart and so that it is more usable and we can use it in a more targeted way so that we really are looking at what are the skills that the students need to be working on and how do we help the teachers to get to that level of specificity to the second part of your question I mean I think that is part of the strategy is to reintroduce the tool but make it more usable for our practitioners and for our principles to give that very specific feedback and then do you observation where we see is that feedback being taken to account are we seeing some changes in instruction and our kids getting that specifically thank you

[00:27:00]
specifically a follow-up what kind of training is being done what kind of professional development is being done on that tool board member Jackson members of the board Dr Blakey I'm actually very excited to elevate the work that it is being introduced tomorrow at our possible meeting I didn't even know I swear so teaching and learning department will be presenting the walk through tool as well as how it is been lying down month by month with specific look for that are lined with letters strategies and training so we pulled that piece in as well as with 90-day plan process and critical actions that schools have identified and looking at a specific strategy to really observe and allow feedback so that we can improve those practices so the walk through tool is being presented tomorrow as an additional resource and then we also I would also like to elevate the work of teaching and learning Department That'll Walk Through tool was developed that makes it very access

[00:28:00]
call for principals to walk into the classroom with a digital copy and can fill out that information that we can progress monitor as well as us being able to take a look at the actionable feedback that is taking that assistant superintendents will be able to utilize doing our coaching sessions fantastic one final yes yes okay thank you so I think this may be is harder and maybe more harder question but how can the board specifically help to improve consistent usage what can we do to support to make sure that consistency is the key

[00:29:00]
that's such a good question I'm at a bit of a loss but you know what I'll let you think about it cuz I actually I stole board president Gonzalez's question so you can think about it and then we can come back and she can ya think about it right now to Member's thank you appreciate the increase by how much 6.74% for the aggregate group students with disabilities went from 6.9 to 10.7 they had a 4.1

[00:30:00]
I don't want consistency in that case because clearly we need to do some root cause analysis and figure out what's going on there and forgive me there were changes to this agenda that I wasn't expecting and so my notes are not all with me and the embedded link is not live on my copy from 2 weeks ago remembered so that because of the Embargo no documents are linked so it's all in our email well at some point I had I had access before September 17th that was the part that she explained at the beginning in terms of the timing right so we do have a my point is I don't have my notes in front of me but I'm crunching numbers for memory

[00:31:00]
and the gap between the aggregate group grew of about I think I mean on paper it looks like 20% there's a 20% Gap so not everyone my point is this not everyone is enjoying the celebration and reports from three other districts preliminary I need to say preliminary data subject to change indicates that three other districts had their scores drop among English language Learners students with disabilities and Native Americans and if I remember correctly that is what I saw

[00:32:00]
so how are we what are we doing to mitigate those challenges because they're big challenges well I was going to offer to come back if we wanted to allow me to get an opportunity to open up the spreadsheet to have the date of my September 17th file folders so I'm good so we have increases in special education and what you're not can you restate with the question is yes not all students had that 6%

[00:33:00]
increase we have kids developing an achievement Gap so what are we doing to mitigate to mitigate that situation I'll start and then it looks like you have the answer okay I just want to start with clarification that the growth that we saw is for all of the groups so when we look at it individually all groups did have growth so I mean I I the 4% of special education students the growth of 4% of special education students I do think needs to be celebrated because that is a large growth and the staff is working really hard with our special education students to have access with supports to grade level content and I think that's where we're starting to see that

[00:34:00]
shift is by having more inclusive practices for our special education students primarily in the classroom so I do think that we have a variety of growth from our Native American students went up 12% and so are in our special education students 4% and it's really important to note that this is just third grade so when we look at it as a district 2 we've seen very large growth in what we have been able to do with reading that will be shared when that those data are released but the I think the four percent of growth in special education is something to celebrate is there work to do yes with all of these you know we're not celebrating that we're done we're celebrating that we're our progress is moving in the right direction right but if you want to give some specifics to what we're doing yeah thank you

[00:35:00]
I think it depends on how you look at it at our data sometimes when you look at a subgroup that was at 6% and then with the 10% that's nearly a 60% game when you look at areas that went from 29% or excuse me on 25.3% to 31% that's about a 56% game 50% volume

[00:36:00]
what were aspirational goals is to increase layer 1 instruction every day get better every day deliver really really teach your friendly usable CDs our teachers can change their action steps their pedagogy in the classroom to improve instruction for all children and then I'll add to you that they just left that we can bring into the classroom that actually we need to increase

[00:37:00]
but I am I am the leader of the team I think that the results in special ed should be commended because of the percent increase from where it was and not just 4% compared to 6% it's like where you were and where you ended up it's an alternative way to really look at that but it's something that we consider when we look at all so just to follow up so clearly are teachers are mitigating some of the challenges that other districts are reporting with a mirror of the voice recognition piece of it and this is a cursory research project with teachers here though some that the voice recognition when you are in a large

[00:38:00]
classroom you have to have high quality your phones that block out noise in order to get a proper response from Amira but but the concerns have been with the two groups who are not saying the same level of growth as our Native Americans did and it's e l l kiddos and students with disabilities so again I know that the program poses some challenges and we just to acknowledge again we're not talking about this is about the number so I just want to make sure we're staying on the agenda and not bearing are we talking about the information that we received these days are from the master and so they don't have any

[00:39:00]
speaking part of this of this particular assessment okay so in the strategies you'll see of using Amira as a strategy for students but the actual data we're looking at here is the NASA test that the students took a lot of the summer in 1.1 and 1.2 we would see those are Amira and so I believe you already have when it could be yeah that's that's what I'm referencing and and I I guess this isn't a complete report because we're not referencing in room one point one and 1.25 again I don't have all my notes with me so my question again

[00:40:00]
still is how are we going to make sure that that Gap doesn't continue to grow between else and students with disabilities I mean it's great that the other groups had great growth president all those students in one group so in the past and you'll see in our in that line grass and I'll send them tables and this is the first year where we decreased which

[00:41:00]
has been increasing but I would like to point out that we actually decrease the Gap last year which is I will say the data person I was surprised because that's when you see things changed in the world of data especially the number of kids that we serve that's a big deal so I just wanted to make sure that for the record that we actually saw a decrease in the Gap this year I okay maybe I'm looking at something else and I mean I'm it says State English 74 on the aggregate group is that correct and 18.445 for additional services so yes there is a gap between them and

[00:42:00]
and I think that's that's in the aggregate right and that's our goal and and yes and I also I mean I do both right I look at the Aggregate and yes we've had phenomenal growth but I don't want to leave anybody behind and that's all so when I'm here to Advocate on behalf of President we are constantly looking at instructions

[00:43:00]
specific students and then we can look at how to intervene with specific students so that gets back to the subgroups and what you're what you're speaking of and chief academic officer jet is working on you know comprehensive special development we can get into our teachers hands give them good training also give them data so they can make really data-driven decisions on how to intervene with each student so those things are ongoing so we're excited about where we are by no means that we think we're done or are we going back I wasn't here for everything is very reflective next steps thank you

[00:44:00]
we're just getting good news after good news and it's wonderful and I want to recognize the consistent hard work of the administration and the teachers and the staff and most importantly the students regardless of what the reports reveal because we see how hard everybody is working and I want to thank you for that and offer Kudos all around so beyond this extent or progress was noted what additional standards are students still struggling with and how those gaps being prioritized in a professional development and resource allocation and number benavidez board president of Dr Blakey I am not sure I'm kind of looking for using his phone so I'm going to buy him just a minute you know when we pulled into Masa data the super team it's really my favorite part of the data is

[00:45:00]
they pull out what standards we need to focus on because that really does Drive our professional development and our next steps and how are best supporting the classroom that being said as we move forward we will have our formative assessments are interim assessments as well that will be helping us to drive further knowledge about how current students are doing right in the moment in terms of addressing standards and so I will say that is not really what I mean but a moving Target right like we're always doing constant data analysis in terms of what are students able to do and what are the gaps that we need to fill in so I'm not sure I can give a specific answer but I'm going to hand it off to Mr West to see what sort of specificity he has thank you so much and I'll buy more time for Mr West ignoring that we do also have access to that view in the internal visualization so for us as board members if we go to soccer and quick assessment and

[00:46:00]
all kinds of different ways so we have access to that but Mr West is going to walk us through more detail well and more importantly the public who's watching this and the parents and the families and the people who need this information probably don't so they'd like to hear it here so we do look at it and it is an internal visualizations and it is something that we can share at some point it does but we do we do look at the standards the standards do the specific standards to very slightly from year to year

[00:47:00]
find the New Mexico medical center in the reason for that is the important for a state to not accept the exact same standards every time because you don't want people to change to the test so there are some changes that happen however there is also overlap and why is there overlap because that way you can look at things that we can't see whether things are improving or not so some of the areas just to give you a few that were still struggling with and I will just give you a few because I did not prepare enough to give you a very detailed but we're still struggling in some of the areas and informational texts I remember a couple times ago we had talked to you guys about Alexandra we had talked about the differences between going from Reading literature to reading information I'll text and how that happens in third grade and so we still struggle a little bit in those areas we have gotten better as this point out and the report in terms of identifying the main the main theme where the main characters or the point of view of the character but we do still struggle and some of those

[00:48:00]
I'll just give you the exact ones like determining how an illustration contributes to the readers overall understanding so it's that we would say maybe the deeper learning right so it's it's going Beyond being identified parts of what students agree but also being able to identify what to do with it or how can I think about how I would feel if I were to put my place in there so the comprehension and that's something that we've been working on but that is an area that we still struggle and so I hope they give you a little bit of a little bit more specific again thanks for helping me thank you so my question was another flavor of what number Jackson asked but it was what strategies are you considering for maintaining the momentum and what barriers might you anticipate as well and the follow-up is what can the board do so strategies for maintaining

[00:49:00]
I've heard the administration speak about how often times are sometimes people can get sort of a cultured to things change every year so why should we continue so love to hear a little bit about just strategies for maintaining momentum and then anticipated barriers Gonzalez members of the board Dr Blakey our first strategy that we have outlined is working within your previous question which are standards we know there are many standards that every grade level to teach we also know that there are essential standards that spiral through each grade level as they go from pre-k through 12 and we also have recognized that there are some key priority standards that within our elementary school commitment specifically is when we focus on priority standards and build proficiency will open Pathways to gain greater understanding to build on other standards so that piece is also being

[00:50:00]
percentage of principals tomorrow and are teaching and learning Department have put together and will explain our priority standards there are three Ela and three math for each grade level as well as partnership with our skills habits and mindsets go for of what we will work towards proficiency for each grade level so we have we are very excited about this strategy because it's working with something that we already work with and we will also create systems to build a very effective strategies within those standards and then that will also come into play with the walk through tool the look for with letters strategies and then also progress on its we're very excited but specifically with standards we have identified those priority standards that will help continue Stepping Stones that's great awesome we're excited to for president in addition I think that it's important to

[00:51:00]
I think Miss Chavez's explain how excited they are but I think it's important to note the momentum in just sticking with what we're working towards and so I know we had a lot of principles and stuff like oh what's the goal for this year and so it's like no we're continuing to keep working on it and I think that that helps the team also always be planning for ahead instead of trying to like catch up and so I think she's underestimating the work that the team is doing that's at the table in making sure that they're always a step ahead in working together to look at the data to plan the professional development to work with the principals to get to the classroom and to be consistent and they're doing a lot of work in that that's awesome so given all that amazing work what barriers might we anticipate

[00:52:00]
barrier I would I wouldn't say this is a barrier but I think it's an important to note that there are the children are human in behavior and so they're not as predictable the data that we look at is a different subgroup each year and so I think looking at it holistically is looking at how you get to consistency and growth is how it goes through the whole system and the law of work we're trying to do pre-k 12 is how we're changing what learning looks like in the classroom because then it's consistent for all grades we we have to know that the group that we're looking at will be a different group next year so how we get that consistency and really look at what does teaching and learning look like in the system as a whole and that the humans are adaptive and every year we get as a special group that might need different intervention

[00:53:00]
and then they spend the year before and so I think it's not necessarily a barrier but just a note that what we're saying now is a standard that might be important is actually for our fourth graders and so we have to be really on top of looking at current data in the practice so that we can really get good at meeting individual kids where they are and being able to show show growth on the individual great thank you we will Circle back around to remember thank you thank you thank you thank you and thank you for being patient I wanted to make sure we pulled all I refer to the data because we've said it multiple times regarding the Improvement that we made but if you look even further like this is from what I can see in over 5 years we have not this type of we've had this type of growth and knowing again that we had a 2-point drop prior to see the success that we

[00:54:00]
made now it's something that I feel like celebrated is an overused word tonight but like if anybody who knows me I'm like we're going to party and we're going to have a fantastic time because it's pretty freaking incredible on what's Happening Here and I attribute it to us being intentional about the goal and being very strategic about where we're headed and not getting sidetracked with everything else that has happened so Bravo all of you fantastic job on what you're doing but here's my question okay so as we look at you know and we're seeing the actual success that we had here and knowing that the goal before we were off track we did not meet it last year can you describe the specifically how did we pivot and considering those practices that you put into play how are we going to put those into play and making sure that we are hitting the other goals and implementing the proper implementation going forward I can start it and then I'll probably turn it over to miss her team was

[00:55:00]
instrumental in the growth of gold one last year so I think the first thing is the wake-up call that we were off track so and I know just from my perspective I think it was like one of my first meetings as superintendent that we had to present in off-track progress monitoring report but I think that that's really important to the process because it showed we did do a root cause we look at what we can do we put the strategies in place and then we're able to really see what's happening one thing we're really trying to do and Mr can talk more about like specifics of what we've done but we're trying to celebrate the schools that are seeing the improvements so that other schools learn best practices from our own backyard and so it was even though we were off track as a district how can we identify the schools that are seeing growth and learn from there because the preliminary data if anybody from the newspaper is in the room the preliminary data

[00:56:00]
is really good for our goal but we are really excited about what we're seeing in growth when we get to look at all of the data so this is important as a goal for the board and what we're really focused on but the efforts that we're doing to Target this in third grade when we look at our Namaste data for reading overall when we get to see all of the grades we have really good news to share in that on the preliminary data is showing that our our teachers are working really hard or principles are working hard and all these efforts that we're putting in place so I'll have missed kind of talk about some of the specific strategies we did last year after we had to put their big red off track thank you super intimately Romero you may remember over the last year when we did progress monitoring we came before the board and we talked about accelerated learning and that was really an effort

[00:57:00]
that was led through the team to ensure that we are focusing on standards-based instruction we had a fear that perhaps students were not getting appropriate access to grade level standards because if their skills were not maybe at that standard perhaps the teacher was changing the material we really held strong to this is the standard of this grade level let us support you in scaffolding and differentiating so the student can indeed achieve the standard and I attribute for what I know it's hard to pinpoint it much of this growth so on that very targeted message to our teachers about standard construction along those lines I think of focus on collaboration throughout the district and so that means between departments that work under me the assistant superintendents as Dr Blakey mentioned having our principals here from one another about what's working what's not working what can I learn from the school down the street that's been a really critical

[00:58:00]
component as well as to the greatest extent possible emphasizing how we can have our teachers collaborating during the school day to share their best practices and I think finally what Miss Chavez highlighted in terms of our strategy around the priority standards now it's the next level of work about how we are identifying those strategies excuse me those standards that are really critical to setting students up for Success at the next level and how we emphasize those so that we can ensure kids are moving into the next grade level ready for what's ahead of them awesome thank you and again just what you all are doing it's phenomenal and I want to recognize the importance of a staying consistent and following through before we set these out of five year olds you know when you said how they asked okay what's next no we stay focused on what we're doing why these keep the main thing the main thing so thank you for what you're doing thank you for keeping all this information at our fingertips so we

[00:59:00]
can access it and read it clearly and it's simple for us to understand but great job guys thank you and thank you board member taught you remember I just want to not let it go that it's not without like a team so you have a team here and then in the audience there are some key players who have been leading this work I see Miss ogene and Miss wheeler Mr size who are all working really hard Miss risers done a lot of work Mr Salazar like remember all these doctors every time you say gold for is like cheering I don't know if anybody know this is that but it is all interconnected it really is and behind all of these fine people are teachers and principals who are working really hard and I go into the schools every day and see the focus and the intentionality and what our schools are doing in the special the collaboration time that they're really trying to prioritize in really

[01:00:00]
schedules and I think all of that makes a difference thank you thank you remember top your mirror so don't worry till you indicated you had a follow-up question but before we moved to that one of the day in the order okay so we'll go to move to number to work great question Falls in line with what was mentioned earlier about comprehension hopefully with this increase and what we're doing great will we see significant increase with our comprehension levels

[01:01:00]
you can decode and things like that but if you're if you're not if you're not if you don't have you don't have a high grass on the floor and see if it's much harder to to be to demonstrate comprehensive so we have all the things in place that we we do believe that that will continue yes it's something that they will definitely be talked about with her early childhood education but we believe that we're putting the pieces in place to ensure that that continues to increase as we continue to want it for years ago thank you were there any other additional follow-up questions were there any other additional questions just kind of a point of clarification is do we know when this data will be made public and is there

[01:02:00]
any plan for celebration in a major press conference with balloons it's ready but I see him every morning period

[01:03:00]
2004 Community however Chris West apartment has worked really hard on things that they have found discrepancies and what they believe and what the data and so we're hoping that that gets rectified as well will they do that by the 3rd we hope so if not we will keep the board informed on when thank you and when that data is really it'll be not only the goal data but the overall data of for our schools and I believe the vistas maybe that's something to round of accountability and New Mexico so there is the perfect assessments so about to go into that

[01:04:00]
so the New Mexico that's called the assessment of science fairness and ASR and also forget that we also have our SAT which is our high school measure so that's our SAT school day which is administered to all 11th grade students so all of that the Embargo that we're currently under will be available hopefully by the 3rd the next thing that you're talking about happens November and I do not have the date with me right now and I will not say it because I don't know the exact date but that's what you'll find that designation and that's where that's where the world of the MRI CSI all the different letters that you hear us talk about that's what happened so they're two different places and then okay so I guess

[01:05:00]
I need to wait on this question how are priority schools the report on priority schools is forth comma so just for clarification tonight was more of a presentation on the New Mexico Masa preliminary data right for gold one right not a progressive not including 1.1 and 1.22 separately correct so now I don't even know if this is the right time to ask the questions that

[01:06:00]
admitted 2 weeks ago by way of an RFI they had to do with Goal one the supplemental intersectional graph that was provided for September 17th 2025 and my first question on there was which population is a substance are represented as 78.5% proficient because I think it's also important to let the public know that we have we do have kids at 78.5% proficient something that I tried to make clear the other night at singing arrow Community Center

[01:07:00]
the aggregate doesn't always reflect the 20th or 30th you're doing well so do we have that information can you use your correct so this actually as part of this in all progress monitoring that we've done and that's been a response to the to the great request that you guys have given us we do provide that supplemental table so that way it's not just so this came out of I think a couple years ago it was so make sure that we were not losing sight or not looking at our students that were not covered by the gold so you are correct so all we call all other students which may sound strange but the point there is that their sins that are do not fall under one of the Martinez and African categories of students so can we say all other students specifically so students who are not economically disadvantaged students who are it's not everything so they're not

[01:08:00]
cancel that they're they're not English Learners they're not Native American and they're not African-American so all the students which in our district is a smaller proportion of our population I think it's like $800 and something for the school yes they grew as well and they are now up to 78.5% and as I said earlier that I think that is a celebration because we didn't grow the goal by one group going down we grew the goal with all of our students going up and nothing celebration that Dr Blake he alluded to when we were able to talk about the rest of our data yes and is there a demographic breakdown of that group and it doesn't I guess really the question is when did you receive that this list of questions and will I cuz I said something like I said during the meeting and maybe there

[01:09:00]
because of the Embargo and not knowing when we are going to present the goal we got we got a little off Cadence okay he did receive the questions and they were answered and they should be they should be in route from Christy that you responded to asking if we could discuss the details just just now okay then I haven't had a chance to look at it so I will I'll wait and just I'll pass to the next person thank you it sounds like we don't have any additional progress monitoring questions but I just want to verify going twice all right thank you for this productive conversation drama trying to

[01:10:00]
play one more time I believe we need to answer it and you gave me a little bit of Grace so I'd like to answer the question on how the board can support is moving forward let's do it I think I think there was some really popular kids and I think that's one thing I think two other things is that I can I can share with you that we do really have high standards and high expectations to hold myself

[01:11:00]
I would ask you to continue to have thoughtful questions because you guys take a different perspective on things and we get into the the world of edgy speak in our business everyday and so thoughtful questions from our school board helps us get better as a team and I would I would just like to add that the word team got thrown out in a lot tonight and I didn't have a whole lot to do with these results but I am new to the team and I have a lot of Idaho in a lot of faith in the team that has been assembled by Dr Blakey that I was lucky enough to join and I think will be delivering the results and so now we will vote on whether or not we will accept this progress monitoring report as a point of clarity

[01:12:00]
you were voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and that we have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students is lined up with our vision for them in order to accept the report we must be able to answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision for the goals yes yes yes is their growth toward the vision and is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth towards Division and a plan for a bunch of balloons in the air to sell all right since the answer to all three is yes and the board can accept the monitoring report confident that the data is accurate and that the superintendent and District are performing at this point we are ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report I move that we accept the progress monitoring report for goal one early literacy

[01:13:00]
thank you we have a motion for member Jackson and a second from Member astorga Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes thank you again to the team our next item is 5.3 which is a discussion on board time use evaluation and our presenter for this agenda item is board member benavidez thank you president Gonzalez so the Board of Education second Gabriel reads the board will not spend less than 50% of public meeting time monitoring student outcomes this means at least half of all meeting time including committees with the exception of executive session should be focused on improving student outcomes to ensure the board is living up to its commitment to each month board members will take turns conducting time use the valuations and this month is mine or this quarter is mine and so

[01:14:00]
the spreadsheet and making sure each of us have it on the diet and I'll just be really brief and unfortunately it doesn't seem like the news is good but we are still making progress and we are going to be consistent consistency is key so for July I have calculated a total of 79 minutes focus on student outcomes and that was at the regular board meeting of the 16th where we monitored in room goals 2.1 and 2.2 and that's 14% for for that month for August I have calculated 58 minutes of student outcomes focused for a regular board meeting of August 6th 6 where we monitored in a room goals 1.1 and 1.2 and then the regular board meeting of August 20th 74 minutes monitoring gold 3 and

[01:15:00]
and for the month of September let's see 30 minutes of student outcomes focused board minutes we're at the regular board meeting of September 17th where we had an update in the language on interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 which is 8% for the month which gives us a grand total of 15% for the quarter and there could have been errors in my calculations because there were quite a few meetings and I wasn't certain if each meeting needed to be included for instance I put the state of the district on there I don't know if that's accurate and there are a few others that I left off so if anybody has any questions or wants to provide data different than what I have provided here that's fine with me you can have a discussion thank you remember benavidez so this is not an action item so we don't need to approve but we will have

[01:16:00]
play discussion opportunity to ask questions and opportunity to go back and add and make revisions I wanted to turn to secretary Astoria who is not here I will turn to her later since she is responsible for managing this process and tracking everything that we're supposed to track is there anyone else who has a question or a suggestion or point a conversation or point of clarification about the board time you said evaluation for this quarter so I think is the question I was hoping that secretary Historia could help shine some light on is the ad hoc meeting so we do we have been counting those in the prior quarters and so I don't think we have them counted in this quarter and so I know it's the

[01:17:00]
board guardrails when I don't know if they were meetings but I think we just need to get those minutes and integrate them to into the total okay so the minutes for the community engagement weren't readily available and I did have a question about whether that needed to be included or not so that's simply why that was left off okay yeah but I don't know do you think that we have minutes for the guardrail so I don't know if you did you meet again after the 19th and then after June 19th I don't think we did okay so I think we have that June 19th time for the community engagement those are on the boards Collective calendar that Dr Albright manages so there's those I think a couple of our blocks that we can lift off of there and so all of the meetings are actually on that calendar and so I maybe we can go back and just double check if there were any other at Hawks besides Community engagement or anything else we need to integrate

[01:18:00]
which is fine but it would be accurate so I think for the purpose of this discussion maybe we could just note for the minutes the notes that will follow up with secretary historica who is the master of how to do this and check about whether and how we need to integrate ad hoc meetings and I think that's pretty straightforward since they're all tracked in that shared calendar are there other questions remember Jackson and then remember Dominguez and so not a question but just it just a point of clarification for for everybody when we whoever's time this is next the community engagement ad hoc agenda minutes and me meetings sorry minutes and agenda are in the shared folder for that everybody has access to so it should be in your Google Drive and

[01:19:00]
call the minutes like the notes we just need the minutes like the time so that okay minutes and minutes of the meeting and minutes of the agenda and so anyway just for future reference those are in our shared agendas or shared drive thank you remember Dominguez so I just need a point of clarification here we want to add the ad hoc meetings just to keep track of total times but those ad hoc minutes don't necessarily fall under a OG they don't count us any other questions clarifications suggestions do you want to acknowledge that we did a total of well without the community engagement

[01:20:00]
which we can add in a total of 1,592 minutes of work which equals 26 hours so that is a lot of work and whether it's monitoring students student outcomes or not we all work very hard and we should be commended for that and acknowledged for that right thank you so typically we are going in District's orders to the next board member who would be responsible for time of use evaluation would be District Five and that would be happening in January of 2026 so maybe we will find that to whoever wins just so we'll have to figure that out come January doctor all right perhaps maybe we just start to cycle over with our secretary she's also not here so I can assign that to her so we do have a Time used to evaluation on the calendar for the for January and we'll assign that to Secretary of State all right our next

[01:21:00]
item is agenda item 5.4 to consider an option of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance annual summative self-evaluation and I do want to just clarify that this is our summative so we have done this for a year even though we're not at the end of the calendar year so we do a four quarters worth of summative four quarters worth of evaluative data to consider this is our summative evaluation which we're all so for our board government's policy required to do before we do the superintendent evaluation so we are doing that so student outcomes Focus governance is a framework that is designed to drive the boards ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes this is a process of calibration and recalibration that allows us to align and realign our governing behaviors with those most effective in creating contacts for improving student outcomes

[01:22:00]
board members have been asked to individually complete the self evaluation form for our board actions from the last quarter the majority of us have done this and have submitted individual results to the board office for tonight's discussion I will now review the results for each of the six competencies of the sosg self-evaluation and at the end of this review we will have a brief conversation about what we feel is possible by the next quarter for the next quarter so we did receive scores from four board members and the total ranges the total is from 58 to 60 so for the first time we are actually pretty well calibrated and we only have a 2 point difference and that difference is in only one of the competencies so we'll discuss only that competency which is continuous Improvement to reach our consensus number so for vision and goals individually board members rated us as having achieved a 35 for values and guardrails IND

[01:23:00]
Julie board members rated us is having achieved a 10 for monitoring and accountability individually board members have raided us as having achieved a 10 communities and collaboration individually board members have rated us as having achieved a one for Unity and Trust individually board members rated us as having achieved a one so there's consensus across these ratings for continuous Improvement which is the last competency board members rated us has having achieved either a one or a three so we will take a minute just revisit our board packets to review the continuous Improvement so we're going to look at the orange column or Peach whatever it is for approving student outcomes I'm sorry approaching student outcomes focus and the green column under continuous Improvement for meeting student outcomes focused and we'll discuss which column we collectively agree that we land on so is it the one

[01:24:00]
point for approaching student outcomes Focus or the three points for meeting student outcomes focused Focus so for any of the members who submitted either the one or three would you like to provide the evidence to support your rating remember Jackson so I think this is actually a good discussion point because I submitted a one but was going to do a three but I wasn't sure how we wanted to rate where it says the most recent board annual self-evaluation took place no more than 45 days before the most recent superintendent evaluation because today is our annual self-evaluation so this isn't a hill I feel I need to die on

[01:25:00]
but if we want to rate this is the most recent Board of annual evaluation then I would be comfortable moving to a 3 and then I think that we have met the other parameters within that third column yeah okay as one of the people who rated at 3 I did do it because I think we are doing the annual self evaluation no more than 45 days before the superintendent evaluation so I took that as a literal we've earned those points we've done that but I'm also not going to die on that Hill remember your room so I rated it a one but I'm comfortable to go into the three based on what we're saying we're counting what we're doing at the moment so does anyone else still strongly about the one or the three or else we'll just make it a three make it a three we will make that three all right so back to the other script so for continuous Improvement board

[01:26:00]
So based on this discussion the consensus score for this annual summative evaluation is a 60 now we need to set our goal for the next quarter and I would like to hear from members of the board what you believe is possible by our next self-evaluation and who wants to share their thoughts so it's on the monitoring and accountability section and based so I think that we could move into a 20 because we will have satisfied the last parameter that's

[01:27:00]
it says the most recent annual superintendent evaluation took place we now can say that that's happened I think that was one thing that was kind of keeping us out of that column and based on our time use evaluation you know where we were quarterly we were at 15 I mean we're we're getting there we're getting to the 25 and I think within this next quarter we can move up to the 25% so I'm going to 2020 so for monitoring an accountability you are suggesting that we could add 10 points there moving from 10 to 20 right I agree I also put that in our Target gold is anyone think otherwise no okay and then to keep going for communications and collaboration we are at 10:10

[01:28:00]
so does anyone think we can earn the two points that would get us to I'm sorry the four points that would get us to a 5 no more than four board authorized public meetings per month and none last more than 3 hours I think that's the big one that's been holding us back to board meeting just the time no more than four meetings per month and none more than 3 hours so looking ahead of what we I mean I would like to say yes to I think looking ahead at what we do have currently we don't have more than four meetings scheduled for this next quarter I think the challenge is going to be the none lasting more than three hours so how do we feel people feel we can

[01:29:00]
keep it under 3 hours and set a goal for adding four more points there or no Dr Molly just told us that we need to have I expectations we were going to have high expectations by ourselves well I agree with that is everyone comfortable with adding yes I think it's really important to not curtail conversations important conversations in the name of trying to get to this particular goal so that's all absolutely and so do you have a stance on whether we are likely to have a meeting over at 3 hours or whether you think we can keep them under 3 hours giving what given what we know about what's coming up on our agendas

[01:30:00]
and our committee meetings but so we have this meeting in October we have in October 15th meeting because we got piled up because of the Embargo battling packed all that impact it's only two it's two so then also in the rest of October we do have Community engagement we have Finance in November will have a policy we do have to the Boise and then we have the special boe's

[01:31:00]
so is there any chance we can I would hate to do one meeting with two two goals is that correct did I hear that correctly yes I mean that is what we have to do because we just got piled up right but I guess in the name of of having I'd rather have one and have a valuable in-depth conversation and feel rushed to do too just because the calendar says so so I don't think there's any rushing implied I think we will have from my perspective of a substantive throw conversation to and then all of a substantive and throw a conversation to monitor in her own goals 1.1 and 1.2 they'll just be in the same meeting and so the question is between that the specials are we going to

[01:32:00]
are folks anticipating the policy committee meeting the audit committee meeting the finance committee meeting that any of those are going to run over 3 hours I think no I would like to know what we heard another know I'm hearing maybe yes so if we can just have folks weigh in then we can keep moving ahead here do you mind go ahead I believe we could I think what has held us up is if we're trying to search information and we feel like because even for me tonight I was trying to search and pull up what I needed if we have all of that and we're prepared it shouldn't hold us up so you think we can stay I do believe we could yes member story okay great anyone else feels strongly okay so we can potentially add how many points or more there and then

[01:33:00]
unity and Trust so unity and Trust we are sitting at the one which is approaching student outcomes Focus we can move into the green meeting student outcomes focus and add two points do folks think that we can meet all of those criteria in the orange and the green by the end of this calendar year I'm hearing one no others should I go down the line the third one that I'm the third one

[01:34:00]
I don't think we've that's ever happened okay conflict of interest and recusals yes okay anyone else have an opinion as to whether we can move into the green all right we will work consistently getting better every day but probably staying in the one there for continuous Improvement the last one were at a three right now we can add two more points by moving into mastering student outcomes which would be blue this would require us to have student presenters and at least one governance training session which we don't even have a government training session okay no great so we're going to be adding 14 points we're sitting at 16

[01:35:00]
how's our goal for next quarter is 74 all righty so at this time we'll entertain a motion and consideration of our quarterly self evaluation so the motion will be to accept the confusion some community members have expressed to me and to other board members regarding the purpose and process of the board self-evaluation while the evaluation is intended as a tool for reflecting on how much progress we've made many in the community question whether it reflects their priorities or provides meaningful accountability as a board we must hold ourselves accountable not only to the evaluation process but also to the values and concerns by those we serve balancing the monitoring of student outcomes and our own progress with urgent priority such as safety and ensuring our evaluation practices are transparent and clearly understood is essential if we are to maintain public trust and truly meet the needs of all thank you thank you very much at this point we are ready to entertain a

[01:36:00]
emotion in consideration of the quarterly self-evaluation so the motion will be to accept the quarterly self development annual salary annual thank you for that the motion will be to accept our annual self-evaluation score of 60 points on the student outcomes Focus governance self-evaluation instrument is there a motion and a second I move we adopt the aps Board of Education student outcomes Focus government's annual summative self-evaluation thank you this is remember toppy Romero second thank you we have emotion and a second Doctor Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes so that motion carries we will move on to our next agenda item which is to consider approval of the consent agenda is there a motion and a second for approval of items 6.1 through

[01:37:00]
6.164 approval to accept the consent agenda items from item 6.1 to 6.16 a second this is number Jackson thank you we have a motion and a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes thank you so that carries and we will move on to agenda item number 7 which is the president's report will start with public forum which again is acknowledging that public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue but we do want each speaker to know that you were heard and that we are working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues we heard tonight were regarding employment dual language in APS concerns about vaccines and concerns about books

[01:38:00]
we also had a thorough progress monitoring conversation about goal one with lots of Celebration and so just want to pile on to that celebration and just say that that gold one report was amazing it is so good to see that it is above Target and I do look forward to the celebrations to come with the balloons in the sky but also want to take a moment just to acknowledge the hard work of every student every teacher every staff person in this district for helping us to get to where we are and being able to celebrate that growth in reading this is the highest rating scores have ever been since we have adopted since the state has adopted the namassa measure and so that is really truly something to celebrate we as noted by members of the board the importance here is consistency I think that was acknowledged by the administration also and that this is the result of focused leadership

[01:39:00]
from the board from the superintendent and throughout the system and it demonstrates that when the board focuses on what matters most which is students and their outcomes above all else there is nothing we can't accomplish as a district we also want to acknowledge that although we just discussed only third grade reading from Martinez Yazzie students reading overall is improving a cross the district so yay that concludes the president's report the next Board of Education meeting is Wednesday October 15th 2025 at 5 p.m. at the Allison Bruce King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast and live stream to aps.com edu our next item is to consider approval of the Board of Education to convene in executive session as authorized by the open meetings act section 10-15-19 for the purpose of discussing a limited

[01:40:00]
spell matter regarding the superintendent's evaluation is there a motion and a second I move that we approve for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the open meetings act section 10-15 -182 for the purposes of discussing for the purpose of discussing a limited Personnel matter regarding the superintendent's evaluation this is board member benavidez a second this is board member they give thank you we have emotion and a second can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes so that made me carries the meeting will reconvene to open session in person only after the executive session at this time I asked that those people who are not part of the executive session to please leave the meeting
