Miss severe kovich your first you'll have 2 minutes as soon as you finish as soon as you start speaking good evening Madam president and school board members my name is Patty Sparklez I'm a native Albuquerque in I went to APS as a child my daughter went to APS my grandchildren are now in APS and I'm a retired APS teacher I trust that all of you are strong enough and bold enough to fight for our children and for our future Generations the quality of our children's lives health and well-being are at stake I believe we can agree that we all want what is best for all of the children now and in the long term Angela Ruiz is employed as a resource teacher from student

[00:07:00]
health and life skills at Albuquerque Public Schools she gave a mandatory training to staff from the CDC guidelines the transgender ideology in New Mexico schools and I watched a recording of this training I am going to quote hearts of what Angela we said in this training quote gender support plans or GSP is the referred to cover lots of different things and are not all Transcendent and not all transgender students are interested in a gender support plan students can use the sex segregated facility that corresponds with their gender identity they assert at school so how they identify at school determine which restaurant do not need a GSP or the gender support plan to access a bathroom or a locker room and of

[00:08:00]
then a teacher who was in the training who was attending their training asked Angela Reese so let's say Michael wants to be called Michelle now but there is an agenda support plan or a gender support conversation that has taken place Michael wants to use the girls bathroom so we're supposed to allow them to do that now and Angela ruiz's reply was yes you've gone over your 2 minutes can you please finish your thought and one quick sentence yes I just asked that you would consider all children in the future grandchildren parents that would respect the rights how can a child who's not gender support I'm sorry I just said it

[00:09:00]
Netflix good afternoon my name is Michelle Riggs on the mother of three adult children I also have eight grandchildren I can't even imagine as a young parent not being informed about what is being taught to my own children at about what might be done to them they're so impressionable their brains won't be fully developed until their mid to late 20s these transgender procedures are permanent our children are our greatest gifts at his parents we are responsible for making the best decisions for their future my 9 year old granddaughter came home from school recently very distraught she was required by a teacher to write a report about pronouns he she had her own but what what are the

[00:10:00]
it was a classroom presentation by a transgender mother and daughter unquote not quite sure what this looks like was it a man in a dress with a little boy and a dress or was it a woman with a shaved head and her little girl with a shaved head my 14 year old grandson who has schizophrenia was in the children's hospital for a year he was 6 years old developmentally well visiting one day my daughter-in-law was with a psychiatrist as a child was being discharged he said isn't it beautiful so and so came in as a boy and he's leaving his girl shortly after my grandson was discharged he said around the living room with his lips down telling me that he was a runway model most certainly he was heavily influenced by other kids in the hospital so capable of making permanent life-altering decisions a matter of life and death both of my 15 year old granddaughter and her mother have the same genetic blood disorder

[00:11:00]
if my granddaughter was confused about her gender and sought a mastectomy or another extreme surgery without her mother's and father's consent it could literally kill her parents have a right to know thank you very much thank you Miss wigs Dr Chinelo good evening period

[00:12:00]
because this is on you studies are looking at older generation there are online the transition groups with 25,000 Plus members many effects of the transition are permanent and cannot be reversed misdirected puberty and development voice changes mastectomy general surgery stability suicide a big lie that parents are being deceived that gender transition will reduce the risk of their child committing suicide seriously according to CDC 85% of diseases are caused by emotions 30 years study for plos one and I quote transgender people have a tendency towards lifelong mental health problems period imagine that transgender people have happened to be one of your students or loved ones military and transgender treatment for children there should be no medical treatment for children under 18 years of age there should be exist

[00:13:00]
extensive counseling therapy time required for medical gender transition is undertaken now for laws for and against transgender treatment for children according to Wall Street Journal European countries are breaking off from transgender treatment for children Sweden Finland and United Kingdom without said how would you ask the school board members help save our students from this transgender using are you willing to protect our children's health and well-being thank you thank you thank you though our next speaker is Verlander he's on Zoom Berlin are you there yes can you hear me all right yes you have two minutes once you begin I'm here to let you know of a event on the 11th was my mom celebrity they're going to Loveland Elementary

[00:14:00]
give gifts these things are incredibly blatantly a bribe to try to Garner public sentiments and is borderline illegal depending on the contents and pricing there should be a non gift Clause that should eliminate this especially from such a political organization if you wish for schools to remain non-political and brain neutral this event cannot happen it's very obvious ploy to Garner public sentiment in the school that is historically been underserved as well as the school that does not have a PTA to support it as well this is a conversation apparently for the end of time but to believe anyone who spoke before me about General ideology despite the fact that they have no idea what they're talking about everything they quoted has been scientifically disproven and the Very idea that emotions can cause disease is such a silly notion of makes it a cold from it thank you thank you Mr cooker our final speaker is Mister Baby good evening

[00:15:00]
Madam chair members of the board my name is Robert Beatty director of Robert of Kennedy Charter School and chair of Southwest educational partners for training swept a non-profit being a board member seems like it might be a thankless job at some times and I want to express this evening my sincere appreciation to board members Mueller out of going Peterson and Montoya Cordova for the public service to the students of APs we have a crisis in my community gun violence is killing young people it's not just a community issue sometimes it's a family issue and it's not getting better it's getting worse swept working with the next Mexican

[00:16:00]
in the pieces of Art and music taking the violence out of them young people need to be part of the solution I don't know appreciate the partnership with Albuquerque Community safety violence Intervention Program for the changes we are making it RFK if it happens at RFK it can happen anywhere RFK is not a feeling school it serves students who have not been successful for whatever reason we don't quit on students we don't quit on families we have always worked well with APS and we can do a better job I want to appreciate doctor excavator for his guidance and support as RFK enters the exciting world of more rigorous intervention thank you for letting me speak thank you Lord members that concludes

[00:17:00]
check Farm thank you thank you to all of our guests for speaking tonight we're going to continue on with our agenda so our next item really excited this is a presentation from APS in the City of Albuquerque and we're lucky enough to have our esteemed mayor joining us thank you mayor Keller for being here with us so superintendent Elder and mayor Keller are going to present to the board on a collaborative partnership initiative it's going on Adam president members of the board thank you for this opportunity and thank you Mary Keller for taking the time to come and visit with us the presentation and explain what's happening here but I will tell you this and I I'm really glad we're doing this in 2016 I was the chief operations officer and we were trying to do some after school programming with the city and it was difficult

[00:18:00]
can mayor Keller and I actually had a conversation back there about the barriers and the people and the sort of sense that we just were having a very hard time collaborating and it was not going the way either side wanted and we weren't happy with it and we spent the last 7 years of working so started with some capital projects we did a fiber project together then we did a huge Amino project with our city parks and our pools trying to clean up all of that which we were doing in the interim the mayor had appointed a educational liaison who then began to meet weekly with Dr Blakey and people like that to really begin to discuss some of the program that could happen and of course in the pandemic hit and we were all forced together to work and as he came out one of the first things I was asking and I said I hope it's a sense of collaboration so when Mary wanted to come and talk about the collaborative efforts

[00:19:00]
I think it speaks volumes to 7 years of hard work and effort on a lot of people and I'm just thankful that you're here and so Mary Keller it's your show well thank you so much Madam chair and members of the board it's been a long time since I've been here in person so it's great to see each and every one of you and I want to thank the superintendent for a little opportunity to connect up on our collaborative efforts I also want to acknowledge I think the bar was so low seven years ago we definitely collaborate more than ever before so that's a good news and it's been something where we've tried to do this in a way where you know without going into too much history you know there's always a little bit of finger pointing about challenges in our community we all understand that we have tried never to do that right so we resist the temptation to say well APS bubble and you know in return me it's like well the city should you know Etc and I think we've done such a good job of that and so we're in articulate

[00:20:00]
most reasons why and then I have a I think a a good ask meaning it's not controversial and I think there's a wonderful way that we can work together up in the session so with that let me dive in and mention that the first thing is the different programs that superintendent mentioned we actually rolled up into one in January or July so we now have a APS we say public school but it's an APS Support Division National division in city government in our youth and families department so it started as a liaison has now grown into its own Division and I'm going to introduce the folks here but just at a high level and that's our you can change the slide there our first slide is just to let you know what this division does so what we continue to do well as all our community school afterwards and just as a reminder you know I think about half of APs children are in after school programs or summer programs that are run by the city so we tend to help out essentially before school

[00:21:00]
after school and during the summer that's our contribution to our to everyone but but it's aligned with public schools and calendars and so forth so that's one thing that we do in a course we got APS on that board too I think we just helped a lot now we also have some initiatives around attendance and safety and also around mentorship and restorative justice and just want to highlight with respect to attendance a lot of this we've been working heavily at West Mesa High School so I'm going to talk a lot about our Mustang friends and what we're doing there because basically we want to expand it to every high school so with respect to what we're doing the School attendance we look at the local businesses and instead of eyes and promote daily School attendance through those and through the school and with respect to school safety this is a good example where we have a very close relationship with the Albuquerque Police Department to promote positive relationships between students staff and law enforcement and there's a number of ways in which we do that and of course there's our traditional out of school

[00:22:00]
programs in this case of West Mesa like also at Sandia and Eisenhower you know we have co-located programs and Facilities with APS and what a wonderful thing that is I mean that probably happened I don't know back in the 60s or 50s but it's something we'd actually like to do more of should the opportunity arise but that colocation has been wonderfully successful and kids don't care neither to parents whether it's the city or the school district but it's awesome to have West Mesa pool right next to West Mesa right it's the same for Valley you're familiar with this so for us though there's a new flavor around gun violence which is what we just heard that last speaker speak about about what we can do in our schools and so there's restorative justice practices that now we are now piloting at West Mesa as well as our violence Intervention Program what's going to speak about in a minute but right now I do want to quickly just acknowledge so is board members everyone knows who these folks are

[00:23:00]
vision is is in the department run by one of your own so I think Kata Sandoval's here just give us a wave of she is the director of which is like a cabinet Secretary of the Youth and Family Services Department in the aps support division is inside that and so we also have Tanya Covington here who does restorative justice work at Washington I think in West Mesa and there's Tanya and we also have Justin Freeman who kind of does the catch-all for everything else related and we all have folks from our community safety department and I'll explain their time here in a minute they're the ones running the violence Intervention Program at West Mesa so here we have I think Jeffrey and linear and so these are work and then of course team West Mason I just want to acknowledge because we're all about him principal Torres Houston for being here so let's go to the next slide

[00:24:00]
and in general we also do crossing guard program which by the way again is much much better than I think it ever has been in part of it is because we pay our crossing guards a little better so they now make $15 an hour and that's helped a lot and this again is shifted departments in the city doesn't really matter the history but now Consolidated undercut as leadership in this EPS Support Division okay we can go to the next slide and then we have the Handle With Care Program is another thing that we're working on that has multiple City departments so basically police fire and Community safety they essentially will work in a confidentially appropriate way whenever there's a traumatic situation that a child is involved in in this is something by the way I'm an APS parent just in case you didn't know that but I guess parent this is something all the parents want and all the schools want which is you know if a child is involved in criminal activity certain people

[00:25:00]
the school need to be aware of that and so now we do that in the appropriate way between these departments and you can see here on actually let's go to the next slide exactly what those traumatic events sort of cover but they can be certainly domestic violence drug-related activity medical episodes and again this is all done within the hospice of Youth confidentiality and so forth and that's what we have to work out and we we Buzz pass that but it took us like 20 years to put that together so this is a wonderful thing and I'm glad we're finally able to do it obviously the arrest of a parent or family member child neglect and even structural damage and housing instability and any of course self-harm and suicide so for the first time we're literally talking to each other about the situation our children are in and that's an amazing thing so we want to make sure we know do that as best we can and sort of deliver on that promise but at least now we're able to do that which again is a recent success

[00:26:00]
another one also is look at the cameras in schools for mass shootings we had tried this for many many years and I want to thank the board members who are part of this we now inappropriate the APD can access your cameras and thank goodness and that is also helped prevent a lot of false mass shooting IDs because they can very quickly assess whether or not that's true or not so again I'm just kind of catching Folks up we'll get to the the point of the day but look I know Scott's heading out at some point soon but it's also credited to him these are all things that APS in the City of Albuquerque have talked about for decades so let's talk a little bit about the future and we can go to the next slide is a refresher because not everyone knows this in Albuquerque city government we have police and fire we're all aware of First Response and what fire person does and a police person but in Albuquerque where fortunate to have a third first responder to Department that is the Albuquerque Community safety department it is

[00:27:00]
is an initiative that I started a couple of years ago it now responds to over 40,000 calls in the last year it was worth 40,000 calls that a ambulance and a police car do not have to go to which also means they can get to other calls faster which is why our response time is improved by 45 minutes so this has a major ripple effect and I'll talk about the aspect of this relevant for West Mesa but just wanted to let you know when I use the acronym ACS you know what that is and that department now does 24/7 response and so this is what we use for Down and Out favorite Health mental health home visits things of this nature and those are essentially social workers or trained individuals who can provide that emergency response and provide transport to places that are needed and again not tie up law enforcement resources now inside ECS is the VIP program that is a great acronym for violence Intervention Program and that's really the focus of our conversation

[00:28:00]
so let's go ahead and go to the next Slide the violence Intervention Program is again with respect to your agenda in time there's a lot behind us when I say a lot the concept of violence Intervention which is essentially a deep embedding into an individual's life to provide them essentially a little bit of carrots and sticks the sticks are you're on a dangerous path you're on a criminal that could lead to your loss of life or incarceration that's the heavy parties the lighter part of it is where there to help keep you off that path pull you off that path and this is a program that is last time I checked it's in 322 cities around the country the John Jay School of Criminal Justice is really the quarterback of this and so this flavor shows up in West Mesa and I'll talk about that right a flavor or flavor of VIP shows up there there are many flavors around the country of how people

[00:29:00]
do this but there is a ton of Academia behind this and so forth nationally just want you to know it's not something we invented so basically we began this at West Mesa and we believe that it is working very well and I'm going to tell you about it and then ask you I think we should have this in every High School in our city and here's why because it West Mesa we've seen 35 referrals into the program so that's 35 students and remember these are high school students and originally you know these are these are individuals with that again sort of a dangerous history they have accumulated a dangerous history so but what we've seen is very little re-offense so another way to look at that as we've seen an 85% reduction out of the folks who've been involved in that we've also seen a measurable increase in GPA from 0.983 which is

[00:30:00]
is you know actually a very meaningful difference even though statistically it doesn't look like it so and other than the the original 9 that started in this now we've been through 35 and I had the opportunity to meet with these students and talk to them and some of them are actually here in the audience as well I'm sure if they're available for questions or if you want to talk with them this program we think is literally saving lives in West Mesa it could be their individual life because it was at risk for gun violence or it could be their friends or their family and so obviously you can't prevent anything but this is one of the few preventative programs or you can't prevent everything this is one of the few preventative programs that is studied and tested and now we have our own local experiment at West Mesa so to give you an example of sort of how this works we can change slides the one example is a senior who had both major and minor

[00:31:00]
from 0.33 to 3.14 and attendance is also improved working with ACS and the VIP program their family was connected to resources so what you do and I'm going to try and explain this in a very common terms these students are pulled out during the day and brought together with each other and our facilitators and our trainers work with them and by the way they have their own lived experience many of them were the same children with challenges that were trying to help so they come to a common understanding of their own lived experience and eventually get to a point where the children share what's happening in their life that's the first break through and they'll tell you that you know there's domestic violence at home there's drug abuse at home or they're running early on with the game and this is done in a confidential environment it's done in a way that is in no way ever punitive the trainer then tries to engage

[00:32:00]
maybe there are some CYFD issues or maybe it's just look there's no one who has an income in the house so let's get you some subsidized housing for your parents let's get you diapers for your little brother those kinds of things relieve the overall stress that drive this path down a violent Road and so in this particular example that I was sharing we essentially gave thousands of dollars in rentals assistance because that is what was driving home homelessness was then driving gang activity which we were able to release by just providing a stable place to live and so another example of Junior that transferred from Arizona we see this a lot a lot of children with challenges end up moving cities throughout the South West there might be a cousin or an uncle involved in that exchange of cities are trying to get the child to a safer place and so this is another story where this child has came in with a 0.5 GPA and

[00:33:00]
now they have a 2.0 but they were getting assistance really with class assignments during that time so it's also used to study hall you know if the issue is you really need somebody to help you learn how to read but you're embarrassed to do that but you need someone else who doesn't know how to read until they may be learned it through incarceration when they were 30 that's the person who's teaching you how to read and in many cases that's the only person who can teach you how to read at that point so last example freshman gang affiliation no again this is tough stop this is acknowledging where we're at in our high schools absolutely there are freshmen who are getting Affiliated in her high schools so part of this program is acknowledging where our students are at and meeting them there so this freshman shows up at West Mesa but then we show up all so with the balance Intervention Program and so they had lost their mom and their dad and their aunt was diagnosed with cancer we were able to provide a host of services that enabled them to essentially leave the support

[00:34:00]
create a stable Network at home their GPA is gone from 1.14 to 1.7% of get through a lot of those issues around cancer so these are the kinds of things that were doing and I think seeing this it leads to an obvious conclusion which is that why is this only happening at West Mason well we know why we started at West Mesa given the challenges and the shootings that happened there but I believe this should be at every High School in our city and I think when parents kind of hear about this too it's a little bit of a oh well you know that school might have a VIP program right that's on the one hand on the other hand it's like why doesn't my school have a VIP program so I think we can do this I think we can scale this in a year to 18 months so the next slide articulates what we need Bundy big surprise but

[00:35:00]
we have a wonderful opportunity this coming legislative session we all know we have budget surpluses and I know you have a large ask for funding and look so do we and we all deserve a slice of that State Surplus but this particular program I want to make a priority and in fact I'm going to anyway at the city but I want to do it with you I want to have EPs and Albuquerque say that this is a funding priority and additional funding priority for the City of Albuquerque or the Albuquerque Metro area so that we can have the violence Intervention Program in every high school and here's the amazing thing if the state will deliver the funding we will deliver the results I've got the team that can do it that I just introduced to you and I know based on what we've done at West me so in the principal's work there if we have a willing principal we can do it at every high school so the costs are you know we tried to be reasonable like we didn't we didn't haircut these numbers a lot we

[00:36:00]
16 schools it's it's only 1.7 million but believe it or not no divided by 16 schools you can see that's actually not a lot and of course we would sort of say it doesn't really matter the state can give you all the money and then we can split it or they can give us the money and we can split it we'll figure that out I think our teams are very good at that now but this is something I know our legislators quite well as you may recall I was there for six years they are so thirsty and so is our governor for a program that is local that works that might prevent gun violence and we've got it so let's go ask for it together and I think we can actually get this funding also this could be one time funding through a term program right so you can do this a couple of different ways we'll work on the details but I'm going to put it as a top priority for us and I love love if you guys could maybe go through the administrative process to add it to yours and then we can go up there

[00:37:00]
weather and see if we can roll this out so I think the last thing just that I would say is I appreciate you hearing us out on this program we could not have demonstrated this without APS in West Mesa and I also know that if the end of the day there's a kind of a case load number here we think statistically we want to be able to carry 400 students we know from national violence intervention work that the impact of the most likely to be engaged in violent activity either on the receiving end or sort of the giving end we know in general there's usually a minimum of a three-time multiplier in terms of the impact that person will have on our communities so if we can carry 400 people that's probably a 1000200 lives that are going to be affected I would actually argue because of our extended familial relationships that we often have in Albuquerque it's probably five times multiplier so it's a great return on investment so I think with that superintendent all I'm here for questions or anything else you want to add

[00:38:00]
thank you mayor that was thank you so much I know I personally have wanted to hear about the VIP program I know that it was being started and there was some activity going on but it's great for you to be here tonight to just give us an overview and I kind of get it all in one and one place superintendent I don't know if you had some other comments that you wanted to add now or you want us to just go ahead and go for questions okay so what I'll just do is just I'll just go down the dice and ask for members if you've got comments or questions or some additional clarifying points that you need now is the time so we'll start with board member Consultants great thank you and thank you for the presentation but more importantly to the staff for all of your work that you're doing and to the students for being here as well really appreciate you the work but also advocating for these efforts I have two questions you want to do one or I'm going to do both go ahead let's start with

[00:39:00]
so my question is about opioid settlement money and that funding comes to the city into the County Commission and there's lots of opportunities I think to collaborate with our schools and our school system and think through how we might be able to utilize those funds for preventive measures and I'm just curious what do you both see as the opportunities there for some collaborations and creativity some Innovation perhaps it's related to gun violence but more importantly on just Community safety overall I'm just curious for initial thinking about collaboration related to the opioid settlement funds so it's a great question and this is always funny because it's a little bit like you know I always have to give a caveat which is expected so you know there are things I can control and there are things I need city council and County Commission to work on these are both Appropriations that have to go through those bodies so

[00:40:00]
colors and Commissioners would actually give you much better info but I'll tell you kind of where we're at the first thing is that there's been a joint agreement to form a working group to answer your question so I would touch base with the County Commissioners in the city councilors who are part of that I will let you know or not yet well they're not yet only because again I don't represent these bodies but the city council passed an ordinance and so did the County Commission so whether or not APS is part of that would be awesome for them but I don't think you are but you should be I'll say that much and so the challenge with the funding though it is very narrowly tailored I do want to let you know that I already tried to use this for all sorts of things and all of them were either not allowed because it's so narrowly tailored or because I have to get an appropriation to do it so it's a great question and I think the good news is the answer has not been decided so I would engage in that work with City

[00:41:00]
cancel in the County Commission as soon as you all see fit your second question it's related to the abcdc but Albuquerque Bernalillo County government commission plus a collaboration between the city the county and the school district and so again to both of you just curious for your take around how we can foster that relationship and prove that relationship and make APS more of an equal partner at the table when we I'm sorry I don't you go first when we were first approached by the that group as potentially being members it was initially around Mental Health Services and the concept of how could the county in the city work with us to provide deeper and more efficient services for our

[00:42:00]
unfortunately one of the first things that happened was the members of that group decided to bring APS on as non-voting members and it did create some tension and I'm not 100% sure where we are with that unresolved tension but I do feel that there was real concern about our kids and I did feel that they had an honest desire to to work with us and we get called in every now and then I know we're doing a presentation this month and we are happy to present and to share I kind of have a feeling you mentioned opioid settlement I don't think there's any doubt that there's an opioid issue in the community in the state in the nation schools are reflective of that and we're going to see that and I think in the Wastewater testing it was done recently by the Department of Health

[00:43:00]
I'm hoping that we'll see some work around awareness campaigns around education campaigns and it shouldn't be the schools that develop that material because we're not the only people that know about it but it should be the county it should be the experts from the city that help us develop appropriate materials for grade level that we can get out there because we need them we really really need them so I think that's an area since especially with that group perhaps there could be some direction out of that group saying to the people that are going to do the work this is work that needs to be done I would just add that to you know these are I always really pleased to see and certainly supported aps's inclusion on that I would support full membership or more membership it's all fine with me you know the funny thing is this is the difference when you have two branches you know those are all city council and County Commission decisions but to the extent you can use my seats on there which includes Kata and her team

[00:44:00]
absolutely were there to help and that's one of the reasons why we created this division but the you know the agendas and the scope and the membership is all all governed by ordinance of the commissioning Council level and if I'm not mistaken and I think Handle With Care came out of that group so I think it was the work of that group that helped fund and and develop that so it's happening and it can happen again it was for my two questions but again I just think it's it is a little for lack of a better word awkward to have you come and just give us this presentation around all of this great work that we're doing and it would be great if we could find other opportunities to continue that conversation to make sure that it's truly collaborative that there is feedback that there is equal seat at the table and so I think just to push for all of us to figure out how we can strengthen that thank you again and I just want to add I know what chairman was it at our council meeting I think just last night or Monday

[00:45:00]
night night and so that's a good thing you know and I don't again you know like I mean I have lots of opinions on this but they're all about city council so you know I would encourage and suggest that you invite Council for report out as well and vice versa I think it's a great thing again that's way out of my Lane but going back to VIP this isn't my Lane I'm here because I will deliver on this and I don't need anything from Council or County Commission to do that so that's why you can hold me accountable for this program and that's why I wanted to focus on it today you know and I was just going to add that just sort of like historically what I've seen in the city and the county having trying to like massage Partnerships over the last 20 years so there has been a lot of movement in terms of the partnership between city and county we we started a lot of initial work around the Community Schools initiative because

[00:46:00]
that's another place where city and county show up together and APS is part of that so I think what makes Albuquerque very unique is that we have started those kinds of of strategies that really brought units of government together to do that I think what we have it figured out yet is just that final piece of like there's this concern about APS being on City County because it's money that we don't we don't have to share responsibility over and so it always you know it gets like how can we be making decisions and voting on decisions around funds that are not coming through our late or not part of our lane and I think that's I think it's still doable and I think it's something that can still be worked on and what I'm grateful for is that these bodies still continue to collaborate and I'm so excited to hear about the mayor

[00:47:00]
movement in creating this division because I know that the county has spoken about something similar as well especially around conversations around school-based health and you know just the Whole Health thing so so there's a lot of movement and it's really exciting to see it after this number of years that a lot of this is has taken place so they're still work to be done but I think there's there's a lot of room and there's a lot of openness but I really appreciate that conversation because how often have we ever invited back like City councilors and say hey City come in come and report back to us or Commissioners come report us they asked us to go report so we go report to the ABCD whatever I get all the acronym all wrong but so they've asked us to report but it also needs to be reciprocal right so that we can also sort of connect the dots and here how was all working together but

[00:48:00]
I think there's there's definitely it's always interesting to be like that one of the older persons in the room who has seen it sort of going in that direction and it's so it's nice to applaud that piece where you see where the collaboration is really resulted in something like this that's really good so I'm move on to board member top your Romero thank you and thank you for the presentation for being here tonight and firstly I want to recognize my son and the effort that they made in her team the staff have done a phenomenal job to try to move forward with that all the challenges that they've had West mesa's in my district this is my school I graduated from there so I'm a proud Mustang and I want to ensure like because I feel like West Mason had this negative undertone under it that it was their problem and knowing overall it's a Community Wide problem unfortunately West Mesa had

[00:49:00]
huge Spotlight on them and I'm grateful that they took that as an opportunity not to use it as an excuse on the different challenges that they had but they used it as a reason on why they were going to beat it and Miss Torres has done a phenomenal job and making sure that her team and her family and her students are rising above it initially I know the original program was funded by Kellogg it was a grant that we had and going forward for some reason if the funding of legislators do not allocate the additional funding for this program do we see the fun there to be able to take it to other schools within the city budget now or is this an All or Nothing the legislature's have to appropriate the funding if they don't what is our plan B Because ultimately we do need to have it across all schools and everybody needs these resources not just West Mesa well thank you for

[00:50:00]
just really highlighting to that challenge it's not a challenge but the the identity issue with West Mesa and what they did and also just want to reiterate that's why I think we need this in every high school that that goes for the solution and the challenge right to your question about Plan B and funding you know I mean again it's always interesting because I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you but I'm going to promise you at the same thing which is that I don't control funding right the city council does but I will tell you this I will ask for this funding if we don't get it absolutely I can't tell you if we'll get it that's something okay and I guess I even look at superintendent Elder on this as well because if this is a joint effort across both of our organizations do we have any room in our budget is well to be able to support part of it partial or is it completely Reliant now on all legislators it would be most relying on legislative funding at this point all the things we've talked about over

[00:51:00]
few months that's not in our budget it's would have to come from something else does it mean it couldn't come from something else but it would not there's no money sitting there is not 800,000 sitting there waiting to be spent on half this program and I guess I just want to continue to stress the importance cuz I know myself board member Jackson we really have tried these last several months to ensure the Peace of Mind of our students and making sure that they know that they're going to be safe because when they're safe they can learn that's when they Thrive and until we meet that basic need all these goals that we develop are not going to be useful until our students are in a safe environment and I really hope whoever hears this legislators families city council are APS team that we prioritize the needs of our students first thank you thank you so I had three and a half

[00:52:00]
but now I think I only have two and a half thank you for remember top of your Romero but I do have a clarifying question so you just said that this that this was your program that this is that that we could that come to you for accountability but then you said the funding comes from city council so so what do you mean by that that if we can come to you for accountability it's only if the money comes from the legislature and then after that we would have to go to City Council to find the funding that's why I'm asking for State funding you know so this their old tricks that Governors and Mayors play and my favorite kind of money is money that doesn't have to go through Council because then I'm accountable for it and I can do you know it's it I'm on the hook for it so yes both are true if it comes from the state I know he can deliver on it if it doesn't come from the state I may not have the funding to deliver on it but most importantly our team and if

[00:53:00]
do you want to ask them questions too we believe in this and the team is set up to scale so that the trainers and the folks who manage this I have full faith in them and they have full faith in this concept of expansion so I think that's really important right lots of times we asked for funding for different programs like it sounds like a good program but it's you know the first step is hiring people or figure out how to do it we've got it and those are all obviously you know in the end work in it for the mayor's Administration so that's why I know we can deliver on it if we get the funding I was not trying to ask you a leading question but you led me to my next question so I appreciate that you guys are set to you said you're set to scale and I think this is probably an APS question who with an APS is going to manage this how is this just something else for our principals in our staff that they're going to just another program that we're putting on top of them not that it's not important but

[00:54:00]
what is what is going to meld with something we've already doing what's going to have to go away I mean you know we're trying to we're trying to streamline how who's going to manage this with an APS to make sure that it's done with Fidelity to receive the you know the outcomes that are posted here well at this point it's a city run program so I don't I have the principal in the case of certainly fall in a couple of areas we do have restorative justice we would ultimately have to I think we were looking for in the program so I know that we see some of the outcomes that are being measured as far as a reduction in referrals and the number of children that are being served and you know how much service they're getting and are we seeing a increase in GPA that could probably be picked up a little bit

[00:55:00]
we have some capacity certainly inside our existing structures that could be supportive it's going to be a matter of how much has to be collected and how much has to be coordinated yeah and I think that's like that I think that's my point is it sounds from what we see here it sounds like a fabulous program and I agree why wouldn't we want to put this in all of our high schools but we need to make sure before we do that that there's a strategy and there's a plan behind it so that we're not just putting something else on onto our principals and then I think just my last question this is more of a procedural question for tonight you said that you're coming to ask us for support just as to be particular we don't have a vote listed on our agenda so I'm not sure you know

[00:56:00]
or do we need to go back to the legislative legislative agenda to add this as the legislative agenda item so what I would recommend I mean I think what we're hearing is the city is going to go after this no matter what so the request is going to go no matter what and what I hear is that the mayor is asking for our legislative team basically to include this so when we're up at the hill or not the hill but at in The Roundhouse that were actually supporting the bills that go forward or the requests that goes forward and I and I see our policy analyst giving me the thumbs up and that's that that's what the request is is so it's not that it it doesn't it doesn't shift our legislative priorities or agenda it's just that an agreement that we would support the bills when they come through

[00:57:00]
we don't have to adjust our legislative agenda but we certainly partner with the city to advocate for this thank you it's like the first question whenever I present anything that has to do with schools is what is APS think right so in the room you need APS saying and I appreciate that yeah that's pretty much it but I know governing bodies you know are sensitive to what what their respective so I think I would just add look I don't think we're going to get this funding unless APS stands and support I mean who's going to give funding to a programs doesn't support so I also if you know it doesn't work out well we'll go ask for something else I mean we still want to do it but I think this is one of these like it works together or we can just do our thing and it's okay and we'll still keep working at West Mason RFK and anyone else we can put into know I mean I think I think it's a beneficial program for APS to support I just want to make sure that there is a

[00:58:00]
there's a strategy that you know we are being very deliberate with how it is being implemented so that's I think that's my 3 1/2 questions board member Dominguez I'm really excited about this program and I love that you say yes because too often we get feedback that we say no and we've got to get rid of that image and so I appreciate this I love hearing the success story of West Mesa and I was about to say over the summer of 2023 Manzano High School staff convened a meeting with City people with county commissioner Eric leave us board members

[00:59:00]
and and Scott rogowsky policy Analyst at that point for the governor's office was there and the the mission was essentially how do we address the the problematic Behavior the crisis that are kids are facing and the behaviors that are spilling into the classroom and they were frustrated the staff was with what was happening internally we just couldn't seem they couldn't seem to get a handle on things and and they didn't want to be in the Limelight they were trying to be proactive somebody from the city and I don't remember her name was at that meeting and offered so we can do it here and

[01:00:00]
no I just want to put that out there and say please come Manzano is waiting to hear from somebody and and we're happy to be the second school and I hope that our district will support that school in its efforts to do what is happening at West Mesa I have a question about these referrals are these referrals coming what's the process their thank you board member and first off we will definitely follow up on him so but I'm so glad you asked a question I don't have the answer to because I love you one of our experts so who would like to feel that one come on up

[01:01:00]
thank you very much chairwoman and board member so I'm Jeffrey Bustamante I'm the deputy director of violence prevention and intervention there at Albuquerque Community safety so we generally speaking we use the early warning system and the teams that gather and there's certain criteria that must be mad of major offenses and what's driving it to make sure that we're getting the right population connected but that early morning team will come together along with I have my intervention specialist here my father and are coordinator who will be part of those meetings to assess their referrals assess the appropriate in this and if it is appropriate then they'll get connected to our program and so for example if if a student has a breakdown

[01:02:00]
and in the classroom and assaults and assault and battery becomes the issue then that's the kind of student you all are willing to help them remember yes and in brief yes it there's always the process that of course APS has to work through to assess the students appropriateness within that school and everything else but of course that as the school seeks to support the students long-term and offer a path forward we are part of that so yes I would love to hear from students wait till we get to all our questions

[01:03:00]
I'm getting two students board member Peterson I think you're hearing pretty full throated support for the VIP program and so I'm going to and I think good questions have already been asked so I'm going to step back and ask her to the different set of questions because I think looking for instance at the VIP in that level of intervention that is going to work best only if you feel really come way before the more severe intervention in one of the things that I really appreciate about the work with the city I mean the ABC partnership has been up for a long time and City school calendar I think we

[01:04:00]
assertive feed in the path found a path through for that kind of collaboration and then the pandemic definitely I mean I still think the city every opportunity I get for the way we work together that families I mean I think really literally we have some families that survived only because of the joint effort that we made to pull together resources so looking at that and looking at the out of school time programs that are really vital that hopefully we can expand I'm curious what you see and I know this is cancel greatly cancel funded stuff but I'm wondering what your perception is about how fragile those those are and how much attention we need to pay is community to make sure that

[01:05:00]
discontinue well thank you for that question and also I know it is this your last meeting I was going to but let me just say what I was going to say anyway and I will never forget our phone calls during covid so there's a book about that so this funding for after school I think is very interesting so let me let me say one thing and all to maybe chimed in whatever she'd like to add I would make a general on a specific point in general city finances are pretty good we kind of running on a flat budget but that means like nothing gets cut so I don't see any major change on the horizon for that however we have been funding the same programs for like 20 years

[01:06:00]
and they are in desperate need of refresh especially the level of curriculum I mean typically right we've got college kids and high schoolers watching elementary kids and doing activities and my kids are part of this I know exactly what this is and I'm grateful for it but you know it does make kind of Wonder like could we sprinkle in some financial literacy or maybe you know some other things that might be helpful well the answer that's always simple who's going to actually provide that in that usually cost money so one of the challenges we've had to improve not increase the number but to improve the quality of the programming is absolutely related to funding and actually for five years I've been pitching that we should do more on this front but crime and homelessness have always kind of carry the day and you know maybe right so so this is something I'm very interested in in general and would love to work together on button do you want to share anything else on that

[01:07:00]
good evening I just want to go what mayor said that we the city very much look forward to Joint collaboration and in all of the above and serving our children and families in the ways that we always have and a new ways and developing programs especially out of school time programs for youth middle school teenagers in particular we look forward to that and using our community centers as a hub

[01:08:00]
to to receive them welcome them and and work with our neighborhood schools thank you really really appreciate that there's more work to be done and you'll still see me as an advocate I'm still going to be around because this work is too important we can't do it alone you know it is absolutely clear that the lives of our students outside of schools are deeply impactful of what happens in school and we can only address it together so I'll put in a final plug I know that homelessness is an ongoing and growing challenge I appreciate the efforts city is making but we have got we've got to keep working towards Solutions because my students in the ID Walkman

[01:09:00]
everyday and when we talk about childhood trauma that is one more piece of that traumatic puzzle that our students experience and so I appreciate the efforts that the cities making we've just got to really figure out how to do more because housed or not it's impacting the students that are in that Community thank you thank you thank you thank you I just want to say having you know participated with other school districts and larger Urban settings there is always a robust partnership with the city and I really appreciate where we are between this partnership between APS and the city you're right there it has absolutely ballooned into something that is much better than it's ever been

[01:10:00]
previously you know before coming on to the board I was working with Doh part of the school-based health center piece and there was a real disconnect and so you can see that you know through just the growth that it's done and under your leadership I really appreciate this commitment want to even creating that Division and it says APS in there it just really tells me that there's a real commitment from the city that you've recognized that APS are your schools and that we can't we can't get better if we're not going to be working on it together so thank you so much for your leadership on that that one I know that one really resonates with me tonight that's the one thing that I'm going to walk away with with that celebration because I know how long it's taking us to get there but I've also seen over the last six years that I've been here I've seen that movement where we've actually have made some tremendous progress in just the collaboration the communication and the idea of just working together I also want to

[01:11:00]
know what board member Jackson was talking about if we are definitely going to put something on to our schools we just have to be really cautious about how much it requires of them to do and how to do it well because I've seen so many programs to fall apart where it may have worked really well here but it's because we had all of that front end resource and support and so as we're going I would highly recommend that it's also kind of a tiered piece maybe Slow Rolling it so that we're not just like boom everybody all at once because I think it could also just you know because something will have to something will have to stop in order to keep this going and it's just it's just the nature of the game because the schools definitely do have a lot on their plate I do want to be selfish and I will ask the students this is up to you how comfortable do you feel just telling us a little bit about the program and what it's meant to you if you're comfortable with doing that it doesn't seem to scary please do

[01:12:00]
so but if it does seem a little daunting I totally understand as well it's up to you come on up we would love to hear from your perspective in terms of what the program is meant to you and just what it's what it's done for you personally and I'm glad that you're here in a in a group of three because that's all gives you some comfort that you've got some friends behind you here they're prepared I can tell they're prepared we have snacks so who wants to go first goal just just tell us a little bit about the program you made an effort to come to the board meeting tonight and it's really important that you're here tell just share a little bit about what the program's meant for you on how you've participated

[01:13:00]
my name is Carlos Cortez and I'm a senior perfect tell us a little bit about the program what what do you find beneficial how does the how does it work for you tell us what you do honestly I find a beneficial because like there's hard it's a very hard like Trust

[01:14:00]
issue with like people that don't know your situation but when you go into the class is like everything you forget everything like people are from like everybody in the class is considered violent but everybody has like a good side to them and the class really like helps you figure out who you could be and like the the person that you can be in the future and that like it's not always going to be what it's not your situation is not always going to like last forever that you could actually be somebody and I think it's very it's beneficial because he's he's a he's like he comes from our situation so he gets to actually sit down with us and give us life advice coming from what he knows and he could actually understand instead of somebody that really hasn't been through any of our situations so I think they just helps us and his advice it just helps a lot and so in the class it

[01:15:00]
you come in and you get to meet with Mr Potter what other kind of activities do you guys do together we are planning on some field trips but we haven't got to that yet but we've had some guest speakers come in that like just tried to come Shadow the program and help us out and give us advice just like just to help us out guide us in life like any advice that we probably haven't got from people around us so that sounds wonderful thank you so much for sharing do you want to share a little bit go for it and I feel like the program is really good like like people like to stop at school and troublemakers and I was one of the first kids so I've been there since my junior year and I feel like it's really helped really

[01:16:00]
has helped a lot of us and we can go in there like anytime of the day like we have a bad time or we can go in there and talk to him just sit there till yeah it's really good program a lot so how is it helped you with school I mean in terms of just what you're thinking about yourself for your future or what would you like to to do after you graduate do you see yourself graduating I hope you do yeah good me and Mike were talking about and to be a detective and I feel like it's like really like I like quiet space so I used to get past and go to his class and you know just sit there with music playing with my headphones and just sit there and just play better just to focus and be by myself that's awesome so you all three of you have seen like improvements in school and but more importantly just yourself and your family

[01:17:00]
it's more like you see more improvements in in yourself and you see more of a positive outlook on your life because when you don't really have that person there to give you that extra push it's just like you're you're not looking forward to anything but when you have somebody that's rooting for you and understands you it's just like and you just feel better as a person and you feel like you're actually get somewhere instead of all the all the people that are supposed to be there for you they're not there for you but like my he's there for us and he'll fight for us so not just that will have a positive outlook on ourselves that will actually make it instead of everybody that's doubting us that he's the only one that doesn't work because he was once in our position and now look where he's at now and it just gives us so like the whole thing and whatever we could do like as long as we don't make a decision that will permanently miss it up and that's what I think is

[01:18:00]
helpful for a song to know cuz they're all like a family like everybody started off all awkward and we started out awkward to nobody everybody's truck doing their own thing and has their own like life situation but everybody just comes together and everybody starts to understand each other and get to know each other and I just think it's and that's what it should be about right I mean that opportunity to be in a space where you can make friends you can have your issues but yet still be accepted and people pushing you and not doubting you I just want to say how courageous you were to come up and talk to us tonight I know it makes people nervous but you were not you guys don't look nervous at all you did an amazing job and congratulations for sticking it out you know and continuing with your education and continuing and believing in yourself and doing the things that you want to do to get yourself ahead I'm proud of you and I'm so proud to be

[01:19:00]
I want to call you our APS students too so that part makes me really happy thank you so much it's always great when we can have an opportunity with with our students about you know anything that we can do to change how to change until I don't behaviors change and this is about that opportunity for us to change our behaviors and the things that we do and the decisions that we make so that we can make sure that we're supporting our students so that they can get to the goals that they have in mind for themselves mayor I just want to thank you again for being here tonight and joining us what a wonderful opportunity to hear about this program and I have to continue with agenda but again I just want to say thanks to everybody that was here to listen to this tonight all right

[01:20:00]
the next item for I know I'm all emotional I can never know when I see students so let me catch my breath for a minute thank you students have a great day tomorrow and regulations for APS Board of Education governance manual and 6.3 is the archiving of non-required board policies and section J students and transferring responsibility to Administration I will move for approval of the consent agenda I will second this is Courtney right so we had

[01:21:00]
ocean by Gonzales board member Gonzalez second by Jackson and I have a roll call please and yell Gonzalez Barbara Peterson yes Crystal Tapia Romeo yes yes buddy Jackson yes our next action item is discussion and action approval of the continuance of the Albuquerque Public Schools labor board we have Todd Torgerson chief of human resources and legal support services and Valerie Hughes executive director for Labor Relations I know that there was several questions that were sent in and responses that were made I don't I guess just I'm not going to go there but does anyone else have any other additional questions or clarifying pieces that we need for this do they have an introduction a little bit more

[01:22:00]
executive director of a labor relations along with me on Hardy as noted on the agenda yeah we have this opportunity to present to you really before the boys will have is a continuance of our labor board and so pursuant to the Public Employee bargaining act FIFA 3 and 2022 the board approved in 2020 the board approved a resolution that allows us to continue our local labor board up from 1985 on through this pivot 3 we have had a local labor board it has been in the past the local school board wearing one hat as the labor board as a function of people three we now have a local labor board some of the benefits that you see with a local labor board certainly would be we have a local presents in the event that the board decides not to offer this boat

[01:23:00]
you would reside with the state of Illinois Labor Relations Board and that board would be aboard that's appointed by the board is a board that's a point by the governor so there's there's a local presence that we have we also maintain a level of local control associated with us by virtue of the fact that we APS leadership and management selects aboard panel member the union select a panel member those two mean confer and then select another member so we have that we have a level local control we also have a level of timely interaction and adjudication of claims that would come forward APS has is certainly a bureaucratic entity but not the order of magnitude of the state and the stage labor board and so with that we stand for any questions I would like to point out that we do have members of our bargaining units here with us this evening and all of the bargaining units did provide

[01:24:00]
letters of affirmation to continue operating under the purview of the aps local labor board prior to bring this to you this will just open it up for any questions discussion well the reason I asked is if you if you had an introduction was because I think you got the email that I sent yesterday which was like could you give us an introduction is to so it wasn't that I was trying to be like you didn't do what you're supposed to do it was and I got from I'm pretty sure you know what my question is was the president could you please give a pros and the cons of having this resolution and why it is so important why why it is important for us to be participants in the Labor Relations Board and and that really resides with the fact that we have a level of local control a portion of the local control and that we have a local labor board what they did then was

[01:25:00]
provided this mechanism under people through the Public Employee bargain act as third act to address how we can then sustain and maintain a labor board and and I think it is beneficial for the for the for the reasons that indicated we have local control we get to select a panel member we have timeliness and then also we have a local Factor too and that they know us they know APS they know the unions so there's that as well so there's a three-member labor board so we pick our management representative is Joe Sloan the union representative is one Montoya and the person that that joint selection is a retired judge at 10:00 and I'm sorry I missed Joe Sloan and and the other thing too that I think is important to to kind of illustrate

[01:26:00]
the resolution is a state form I mean that is basically a cut and pasted from the regulation and so the benefits certainly as I'm trying to articulate here is is that we have a level of local control as it pertains to our labor board our own labor board now if the board if this goes away the way the statute reads currently it goes away for good and we're in this list has gone down from local boards that are upwards of 50 seperate local boards now it's down to a handful of the head of the top of my head there are five municipalities one County and two school districts Albuquerque Public Schools and Zuni public schools are the only remaining local labor boards so to to vote in favor of this is

[01:27:00]
important because as soon as it goes away then the the the the the Labor Relations goes to the state and so things like negotiated agreements and stuff like that then become dictated by the state whereas right now we can kind of have some control over it because of the local aspect to it right this local board acts to hear you know grievances complaints they would also rule on an impasse if we were to get to a level of impasse again if we didn't have this three-person support deliberately asking these questions because I think that this is important like not only that we understand it but that the public understands it and so I appreciate you indulging me with some questions that I'm sure I've asked you before but I just think

[01:28:00]
this is this resolution is a very controlling document for what we do and I think it's it it's not only us that needs to understand what this document does for the ability to affect change the ability you know how how how we are interacting with with entities but it's you know it's a discussion that I think we need to have every what is this every two years that it's in the odd numbers by way of background you know previously from 1985 on through 2020 we have was acting as a labor board the resolution

[01:29:00]
what time are you guys meeting tomorrow 2 to 4:30 p.m.

[01:30:00]
Gonzalez Barbara Peterson yes Mr Tapia Romero yes if you need a Mingus yes Courtney Jackson yes Yolanda went to a quarterback yes so our next item is the superintendent's report you're getting your steps tonight so Madam president members of the board thank you for the first semester

[01:31:00]
a lot of positive things are going out there and I do think you'll see news articles and stories pop up because everybody's looking for you know the story unfortunately there are a lot of great things happening in our schools and food drives and kids getting clothes and then they're doing a lot of fun things and I I think I said this at the Education Foundation I had the pleasure of watching the East San Jose little geckos dance for us and they were really adorable adorable and they were first through fifth grade so they were not you know the Russian ballet they there was one young man I don't think he'd ever been to practice he turned the wrong way every single time but he was having the best time and he was the best stomper in the groups into the ground and you know as I get closer and closer

[01:32:00]
go to the end of my career I just realized how I should have I am of these young people and what they share with us and you know hopefully special at this time of the year I hope we take a moment and just be appreciative of all those good things that we have and that we're blessed to be part of so but you guys didn't want to talk about fun stuff you want to talk about the right size committee so that's what we're going to chat about and it's relatively brief but just a reminder the right size committee continues to meet regularly to review the data and recommendations that were established for the 2022 23 school year committee consists of chief operations officer the chief of schools Chief academic officer or associate superintendent of gold 3 the office of innovation the capital master plan and the executive director of budget and the senior director of budget so she identified five elementary schools in three middle schools to be candidates for right size this work

[01:33:00]
continuation of the work from 2015 to close and consolidate AKA iqama Elementary School it's not least to Papa charter school last year la Luz elementary school was closed and is currently being leased to the Albuquerque Sign Language Academy and going very well they're apparently pretty happy there last year but Alice Elementary School became a K-8 school by adding 6th grade this school year and this change has resulted in there being 369 students enrolled at the school up from 328 last year so we see that as a win the school in 10 to add 7th grade next year and 8th grade the year following Janet Khan has become a non boundary magnet school for the 2223 school year they have not seen a decrease in enrollment in this change their enrollment is steady so we are going to continue to work on Recruitment and students and we'll be expanding to 8th grade in the 2425

[01:34:00]
high school year we have continued to talk with the Coronado Community regarding their ideas for expansion into a K-8 school and the office of innovation is about to send out a survey to All Families regarding their thoughts on repurposing schools in the Albuquerque area back in 2016 we conducted a survey called voice of the community and it was revolving around the same concept and it was supposed to connect us to the interest in values of our community and find out what sort of programs they would like to see committed to so again I remind you that we spend a lot of time about talking about an example and I remind the state that the current CTE programs are probably not that we should be focusing on but looking forward and what are how do we introduce cybersecurity into the high schools in who's going to help us do that we have an interesting

[01:35:00]
beginning of a project with CNM revolving around diesel engines and potentially using some of our existing space to to help them do their program and in turn benefit our students so there's a lot of good work in this community survey really drives a lot of the beginnings of the conversation because I try to base it on what they see as being a necessary component in the Albuquerque area we also have the Early Childhood task force and they have now completed four meetings and this is included private providers the City of Albuquerque the county why and several other stakeholders their work has been collaborative and developed a prototype and a design as we move it to Durant's Early Childhood Center this collaborative work is also resulted in the planning of an early childhood Showcase of private and public providers that will be hosted by APS for the community in February more information to come on

[01:36:00]
this particular event as far as the work you'll be looking at doing soon we will be bringing boundary approvals to you soon which will include Durant's as well as the Northwest and Southwest boundaries that were discussed at a previous meeting and Mr Savage and his team will be meeting with the duranes community I believe in the next week and working to fine-tune the right size priorities for the district based on the feedback from the community and with that I'm open for questions we'll probably mostly defer to Dr Blakey is there anything else that you want to add Dr Blakey before we go to questions now I thought that was a very well written thank you but thank you for the information and the update I'll just open it up questions discussion

[01:37:00]
concerns I have a question just because Mueller Aragon is not here and I feel like this might be a question that she would ask and have you guys been able to engage with the aps Community Capital advisory Commission on some of the decision so thank you for the question we talked to them at our so we meet with them quarterly so at the last meeting we had we did have a discussion about where we were with right sizing and you know we had a really actually was one of the better meetings we had about what we could move forward with a lot of CTE work as well our next meeting with them is in January so at the January meeting will do more work with them on where we are with right size and get some more of the feedback from them and actually I can expand on this you asked a question I know something about that CCAC

[01:38:00]
Graham was originally started in response to their being concerns that in the capital program we did not have the financial controls that needed to exist that we knew more money was we knew where money was going to projects but it was not always easily accessible or we weren't able to give up to real-time updates on projects and and how much money was spent and where did gone so CCAC was formed to come in and help us work inside that department specifically and redesign the financial controls that that existed and it was successful and quite frankly that was what seek was developed for and so technically their work was done but there was an interest in maintaining the connections and the collaborative effort and so for the next few years we sort of have been casting about and trying to figure out what the new role of could be because we do bring them these projects and say what do you think and and sometimes they don't

[01:39:00]
think much and sometimes they have a lot to say and there have been projects that we didn't get in front of them and they thought that they could have helped us with but they also think they can do more and so we are beginning to evolve CAC in a little bit in terms of helping us as ambassadors as we begin to work out in the community and present projects one of the biggest issues that happens in Albuquerque is the concept of land there is no land for infill and you know a lot of people say well just keeps just give us your land and well we're not going to just give it to you we want to receive some benefit from it and so she can is looking at how they can help us as we develop strategies not only with the strategizing but with the messaging of how we reach out to local leaders and local companies and say you know we have an idea and we'd like to pursue this and I think that is really exciting and I think it was a great move by Dr Blake you

[01:40:00]
will you allow an encourage that that type of work so I look forward to seeing where the the next Direction and the next iteration of CCAC ends up thank you a question just about communication so the initial proposals that you shared from the right sizing committee were just that proposals but I think there was some misunderstanding that those were decisions and a lot of concern within the community around moving too quickly and not listening and not thinking about this group or the other and so my question is really about communication like what is being done to have clear open two-way lines of communication with Community to understand that these are proposals so I get that there's a survey and that's great but that's one way and in part

[01:41:00]
Taylor I think for the North Valley Schools the middle schools there the elementary that were identified as part of this there is just a lot of chatter around what's going to happen and when is my school going to close and your school is going to close and I think largely driven by fear in this information so I'm just curious what is the overall communication strategy just turning because we might need to say it initially when we talked about this is and I know you might be able to talk specific to duranes we are facing a reality that we have too many schools for the number of students that we have and I think what we've tried to communicate consistently in the public and in the media is that we don't really want to close schools because I think shuttering a school in a community is really a bad thing it sends a bad message about that neighborhood it changes

[01:42:00]
property values it does not help so the concept of repurposing the concept of placing something of that has value there is important so when people talk about what you're going to close my school yes but we're not just going to leave a husk of a school there there's going to be something that replaces it and there's what's happening now is for being approached by groups from outside that have ideas of how we could potentially use these facilities and some of them are really probably very beneficial to the community and and probably will help the community very well on the long runs of some of the communication is we need to know that we're actually going to do it so before we go out and say hey we're going to do this there's a lot of discussion that occurs with you all and sometimes are proposals don't go the way that we have proposed

[01:43:00]
so I think that's part of the communication now specific I do want to know specific to taranis what they're doing no that's okay that baby stuff because again I hear consistently from families when is Taft going to be closed when is Coronado going to be closed when it's raining it's going to be closed what's happening I have a fifth grader should I send them to send them to Tyler that it was put out there that Taft was going to close the door and was going to close and so how are we just continuing to communicate that those were proposals and if you have questions about if you're a fifth grader where do you send your sixth grader what do you do like how are we communicating so that's a great question and I think that in the work that we've done with some of the schools that have brought that to us too it was a really hard understanding to know what it is to get input that proposals meant we were getting input and I don't know if maybe

[01:44:00]
it was a shift from how people might feel things are done to them so when we said no we were just putting ideas out there and brainstorming as a community is really difficult with communication is what we learned but we're hoping that we build trust with people as we show that they were proposals for example totally shifted as we got feedback as to what we were going to do with it and ended up going to lease the charter school which wasn't the original plan but I think it helped show people this is just brainstorming ideas that we've heard from the community and then how we move forward Coronado is another example where we've been working with the community and the staff to say public brainstorming is really hard to do and I wouldn't say that we know necessarily know how to do it right because it's really difficult and people are used to when some information is giving that means a decision is being made so a lot of questions arise of well where are they

[01:45:00]
the schools that were identified are still the schools that are identified because that's the part that doesn't change the data that shows why these schools are being discussed is still kind of the non brainstorming part but the brainstorm is it now what do we do with these sites so that being said I think a lot of the work comes from the school itself because that's the place that the parents are getting the information and working with the associates to make sure that the teachers have the right information too because that's how the communication like unfolds that they trust the parents trust the teachers more than they trust us or what they read or you know the teachers are what they trust so the more the information we could get in front of them to the teachers the better I think the way that we put out communication of the survey may help with some of that because in how we message why we're doing this survey then people might get the idea that okay we still were not

[01:46:00]
of what we're doing with the school but the school is still identified as an underutilized school that needs to be right size and so I think that that we learned from La Luz I think we've learned it from it from shifting even with duranes and Mistress of age or why we called him up here he's meeting with the Duran and his staff so I think you'll see as he talks to them and he talks to the community that like Rumor Mill will help flush out a little bit but to be quite honest we're still in the business of figuring out how to public brainstorm and communicate and build trust all at the same time I appreciate that and I have heard great things from the duranes community in La Luz as well and so I think the communication directly to those schools around what we're figuring out what it looks like is great it really is the fifth grade families who are all convinced that all the middle schools are going away so I think just figuring out how we work with 5th grade teachers Elementary principal

[01:47:00]
but thank you for all that I will agree with board member Gonzalez because that is primarily the concern especially around like Coronado and it's that it's that transition age like what are we doing like where are we going what's going to happen you know I really and I think we just need to be really specific about when we anticipate a potential piece if it's going to go okay what what's the what's the timeline because I think everybody's thinking is it next year you know am I going to have to you know do I have to make a decision about where I'm going to to middle school now because that's going to it's going to be a significant decision for them so I think it's in that space But I agree with you it's just I think our families are a little bit confused about we're hearing all the stuff is going to happen with our school but we don't know when and how that's going to occur

[01:48:00]
so go ahead Barbara I mean Miss Board member Peterson I'm sorry to the Early Childhood proposals that one of the workshops I went to at the Council of great City schools around preschool in Chicago shared that when they opened up their preschools in they had very small enrollment because the community wasn't really aware that it was an option and within three years their attention to tripled and I think that sort of a good comment for us to keep in mind to as we look at expanding into preschools that it takes some time for the community to realize what would have been official resources is

[01:49:00]
and and even if you're looking at a small start it doesn't mean that we shouldn't foresee it because it's it's too important it's too vital and and once it becomes part of serve the culture and the the awareness of the community I think we can we can count on it expanding successfully any other comments from out of state entities

[01:50:00]
all right exciting news about the public-private showcase on Early Childhood I think that's great giving our families an idea of what's available in terms of Early Childhood so that's going to be really wonderful glad to hear that any other comments period all right thank you so much Board of Education meeting will be December 20th 2023 at 5 p.m. special Board of Education meeting has been canceled for December the 13th so we don't have that and meetings will be held here at the Allison Bruce King educational complex where now what consider approval for the Board of Education to convene an executive session is authorized by the public meeting exact second section 10-15-19 to discuss pending litigation and relation to Danielle Maldonado
