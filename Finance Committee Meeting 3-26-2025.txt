[00:03:00]
and our presenters for this is Miss Apodaca and Miss Montoya you have the floor ladies thank you madam chair board members superintendent Blakey item 4.1 is our second presentation for FY 26 budget and as per the budget calendar we are looking at scg projections and information on the special education department fly to the presentation has information on full-time equivalents did receive a question to ask student enrollment and we will be providing that information in the follow-up q&a's slides three and four are seg projection and related expenditures and now that the legislative session is over we will

[00:04:00]
do you get more information and will provide that in the follow-up presentations size 6 through 11 is information on special education it includes funding positives challenges and looking ahead and we do have a representatives from the special education department for questions so at this point we do Stanford questions thank you thank you thank you member of the committee any questions related to this brief presentation I know I had a question about special so

[00:05:00]
Chief Financial Officer Apodaca what what anticipated changes do you all expect and what challenges what positives are there what challenges are there and how will they be addressed or is it I mean do you have that information yet good morning are positives on page 9 of your slides and looking I'm specifically at our

[00:06:00]
the students with disabilities are receiving additional support through their ancillary services and that's going well as students with motor disabilities are sensory disabilities are receiving assistive Tech and we also talked about increasing opportunities for special education students in the general led class your other question was about changes and we are seeing about a 2% increase per year in our students with disabilities we are also expecting to see an increase in our gifted students with a gifted eligibility although I don't have a percentage on that as the processes have changed through an impact and so we will be managing those as we as we go and you have a third question that I believe I missed well what were the challenges and then and how will we address them and the child so

[00:07:00]
Staffing shortages you know I think Staffing shortages is an issue that we have across the district and we are working our best to manage those through our Kelly subservices and additional training and we have the HR is working on hiring International teachers to help support and then we do have that increasing number of students each year that and so we have to manage that we do have an increasing number of teachers that are needed each year because of an increase in both disability and gifted and so that increases the Staffing shortages and then you know one of the biggest challenges that we have is Staff turnover go from school to score school at least students A disruption of learning and so that's one of the items that we would like to work with ATF on so

[00:08:00]
so I have a follow-up a lot of concerns over I'm going to go back to the regular increasing support for students who have been placed in regular or general education classes so I think I heard you say that there is there are plans to increase support for regular education strategies and some behavioral needs that will happen over the summer and then also plans to continue those supports throughout the school year and those are those are not just a special ed initiatives but also initiatives through the chief academic offices

[00:09:00]
so what about kids who are again reports just from the classroom what about children who need additional it seems adult supports are they even going to be available for for their transitioning into general education classes remember Domingos we are obligated to follow a student's IEP so if the if that is what is placements are made available but we always follow us students thank you thank you thank you any other questions

[00:10:00]
related to this presentation okay thank you we will go ahead and continue thank you for that Miss Riser so our next item now is to consider approval of the grant budget adjustments for the following funds we hear have the Johnson O'Malley 2020 42025 in the amount of $354,000 926,000 the school bus cameras for FY 2533 level level four up rallies and star base for La Luz and our present for this is Miss Apodaca Miss Montoya over to you ladies good morning Madam chairman of the committee has first 10 of these items Haley thank you

[00:11:00]
March 2025 we have a recurring Grant increase allocation for Indian and we have a school bus cameras we brought priorly to your attention the bus funding for approval these are the cameras that will be installed on those buses then we have for the schools that have the structure literacy Grant something that will support in student incentives to to achieve good results in in this initiative we are adding a new school to the Starbucks's thank you members of the committee any questions related okay I see none we will go ahead and

[00:12:00]
our next item is to considered approval of the February 20th or function transfers for Grant budget and Miss Montoya yes okay turn it over to you madam chair members of the committee once again I'll turn it over to Mahalo for this item thank you thank you for February 25th and I do not see anything out of the ordinary they are regular thank you thank you very much any questions from the committee do you have a question and I'm sorry I apologize

[00:13:00]
did and posted but it never hurts to have it on on record in the public meeting so what are my questions has been a recurring question has been about spend down in Grants and I don't know if you can address this particular question on the board and just as a general analysis we have seen an increase in the current fiscal year of about 10% so we we are

[00:14:00]
are seeing a more effective and level of spending across the grand fund newspaper can you explain how we got that 10% increase that efficiency I'm the reason behind that

[00:15:00]
okay so I'm hearing that there's when you say that there are multiple reasons that there is a systems change going on braiding and linking did I hear linking correctly and I believe he might be able to provide additional details on this thank you very closely together and so by creating this office we have pulled all of the grant funding into one central location is used and make sure we're not using duplication of

[00:16:00]
this is and we're using the money to the best strategy that matches a meeting our goals and so she's done a really good job working with the grant department on the finance side to make sure that we're really strategizing and how we're using the funding and so it's not any more in departments pissed out but it's all centralized so we're able to really be more efficient in how we utilize those Grant funds Dr Blair do you have anything else to add to that thank you superintendent Blakey board member for your question it is just as Dr Blake said I'm going it's very comprehensive and systemic it's no longer in silos and so we're able to look at everything comprehensively we also have internally-developed systems to work with schools and departments in communicating what funds they have where they originally wanted to spend them if they're not using them moving them so on and so forth so it is more comprehensive

[00:17:00]
and there's more communication two-way communication with the Departments and schools who are allocated These funds and as a follower of if I may what challenges are you seeing in this systems change that remain to be addressed thank you for that question because I think that and will address this I believe in our presentation moving into another meeting but really one of the challenges is just shifting from silos or departments to a more comprehensive approach schools and departments to no fault of their own are used to doing things the way they have always been done and so working with them to understand the why behind what we're doing and really communicating with them about the process there's very this is a very technical logistical part of the work and so it's even some of the day-to-day interactions they're having with some of the staff who enter requisitions excuse me being able

[00:18:00]
go to check their balances manage spending it's it's just a very technical part of the work and so it's not a challenge per se it's just a shift and with that shift can sometimes be some difficulty but we are working through it and everybody is moving with us in the shift it just takes a little bit of time with such a large district and a large amount of funding and then I yes that's precisely what the chatter is right about the technical pieces and and coordinating I suppose I'm trying to understand without getting into the weeds just trying to understand the big picture and it seems that there are some technical misunderstandings perhaps deadlines one final question

[00:19:00]
once the the shifting gets to where it's raining you know the system is running smoothly do you do you anticipate that 10% increase improving and can you project how much more we can expect insurance for you I will tell you our goal is to make sure that every dollar goes to improve student outcomes and so any money that's left on the table is not improving student outcomes so I couldn't commit to any type of number but I will tell you that's the overall goal these dollars are precious I think we all recognize that especially recently and we have to make sure that they're going towards the goal of

[00:20:00]
so that's ultimately our goal throughout this whole comprehensive process is to make sure that there's Equitable funding that reaches our students so that we can remove that barrier for schools and departments and so I apologize for not giving you an exact answer but our goal is to increase it and to leave almost nothing on the table understanding that we have to spend responsibly appreciate your answer and and your systems approach to this your expertise thank you thank you and I do want to actually Echo that we talked about making some adjustments and Corrections in the past and to see the finance team actually take those suggestions and make those improvements because I do believe our system is running smoothly and spending has been effective to ensure that we are not having you know extra that is not going back into the classroom so

[00:21:00]
I appreciate what you're doing I heard I know you guys gave an extensive presentation on this last last time and I just want to ensure that you know we are actually doing what we're supposed to do with with the spending and not having a surplus you know that was left over so we will continue our next item is to consider approval of the February 2025 Interruption transfers of Grant budget and Miss maren alternative to you I got you for your consideration for the call Perkins

[00:22:00]
UCS taking steps to to complete that alignment and then we are closing fund to 91314 New Mexico Department of Health and doing final final closing entries other than that nothing out of the ordinary and I stand for questions thank you members of the committee do you have any questions on this item good question what plans are in place to deal with the dismantling of the Department of Education specific to the grants that we received the title one Sunday if anything else at this time we haven't had any decreased to the funds from the federal level so we're keeping an eye on it

[00:23:00]
working with colleagues across multiple districts in making sure that we kind of are aware of what's going on whether the amount of money stays the same or not is one thing and the other thing is if it goes into a different department so if it doesn't go through the Department of Education what department is it going through and how do the funds go through the state so what we're really trying to work on is making sure that the state department is able to take on this role in distributing me funds and that's where some of our concern is it just the amount of money that's going to come quickly to the state level and whether or not we're able to really coordinate that through the state to the districts and so we're kind of keeping an eye on it at this time we don't have any word on any funds being

[00:24:00]
what's at this point because their budget hasn't been passed we've been working with our Congressional Delegation to make sure that they understand the importance of how the federal funds are used and that they're able to support that in any Cuts so it's kind of like two-fold one is cuts and then one is the change in the distribution of how the monies are going to come to us and we're kind of we're concerned about both but primarily at the state level we want to make sure that we're able to access those funds and it doesn't get tied up in not being able to access them as quickly Dr Blanchard do you have anything to add I know you're working on on this thank you very much for the question superintendent Blakey Iko everything that she said additionally we're planning so there's its various scenarios and it's hard to anticipate what's going to happen but we're planning and as we do in every budget cycle we're prioritizing so if it happened what would

[00:25:00]
look like for this prioritization if Plan B happens what would this look like so it is a chess game and it's a guessing game we are working hand-in-hand with our partners at the PED as well as a Congressional Delegation just because we want to make sure if one person receives information about shared with everyone so I just I want to I just want to emphasize we're planning we're prioritizing and we're working with our partners but without anything specific and again is Dr Blakey said right now there's nothing specific to say that we're not receiving funds that's the best that we can do at this point but I do want to reassure you that there is there are plans in place we just have to wait and see what what drops thank you both thank you any other questions okay thank you for that drain and Dr Blakey we will go ahead and continue our next item is to consider approval of the February 2025 function transfers for all

[00:31:00]
damn construction for Taylor Middle School phase a and granting signatory authority of all necessary easements and infrastructure to the board president and secretary and with that Madam chair I stand for any questions thank you and I apologize I said Association so so with that I'll open up for questions to the committee I have a question I just heard good morning I just heard phase a this is funding phase a of the total project so how many phases are there I believe Madame Madame chairman of the existing Maine school building and it will be replaced with the two-story addition which will include the Administration health

[00:32:00]
office counseling Suite Library multimedia Center Performing Arts classroom and an art classroom and also an outdoor dining courtyard and Outdoor Classroom phase two I believe is a classroom Wing that will be added so will that be an additional I don't know 20 million or more answer that question I don't I don't know when I don't have you yeah that's a hard question to answer because we continue to see price increases in construction it's not going to be less than 20 million but it'll probably be something above 20 million especially when you consider the timeline on when we might get to that set that's so what has been budgeted for Facebook or does it work that way

[00:33:00]
bond election so we'll have a better idea about what we budget for when we bring that to the board the whole bond package for 2020 and forgive me but I cannot seem to without putting more than 15 minutes or 20 minutes in into it how would I find I'm trying to compare what we approved and I don't remember what meeting this was in what we approved for the maybe we didn't I could have sworn we did construction costs for the Coronado

[00:34:00]
how many schools what were what we're talking about currently doing is just looking at age appropriate modifications to the facility and that's what we talked about throughout our presentation so really looking at what that looks like things such as you know adjusting you know restrooms to meet the age-appropriateness for the students that will be coming in also looking at possible playgrounds that are age appropriate for students there so it's it's really minor in the scope of of it that were of what we're doing and more of a remodel or update to meet that age appropriateness not not necessarily new construction we're all looking at pick up and drop off after our traffic cities are complete which are currently in play right now will give us a little bit more information as well and board member is this is just a reminder I think it's already kind of talked about it but this particular construction on Taylor's from the previous Bond

[00:35:00]
but this has been in play for quite a while it was on the previous spawn package 4 years ago 3 years ago I've lost track of 21 20/21 thank you Karen so from it's from the bomb package that was approved in 2021 and so follow up one last question how does the budget priority or does the budget accommodate a Expediting is there any wiggle room for Expediting construction at Taylor given that it's about to increase in enrollment I think double possibly so yes so that's why from 2021 when this was part of the bond package it was the right size is a multi-year initiative so there's always been in the plans how to time the construction with the increase of enrollment and so

[00:36:00]
that's been in play for the past 5 or so years as we've looked at right sizing so the current construction plans for Taylor were with the understanding that that school is going to be bigger based on right sizing okay so but no I mean that's why the timing for this next the timing was aligned to the construction so I think we first approached the right sizing of the North Valley Schools a couple years ago but it wasn't ready yet because we have to wait for the construction of Taylor which is where we are today now in being able to construct it at the same time that we're facing more students in it just seems like a big project while you know why I'm looking at this like for me

[00:37:00]
I don't know from a mother grandmother teacher managing all those kids while in preparation or while all this movement is happening and and the sooner we can get that settled as soon as the kids will get settled so I guess that's my and and ultimately this is about student outcomes so just looking for a ray of hope that this is going to this construction project can be moved along quickly but I don't know you all are the experts in managing and spinning plates

[00:38:00]
redoing the entire School these are phased in so there's enough room to certainly construction is a inconvenience during the time but it's well worth it in the end most schools have said that so cochiti is another example of a school that we Consolidated they were under construction at the same time they've now reopened their additional classroom block so that principal has also you know can talk to the principal of Taylor to talk about how the consolidation of schools during construction works but in the it is inconvenient during construction time at any school but we also don't want to just wait you know you can if we construct did construction only for 2 months every summer on projects we would never finish anything so miss already in her team do a good job in communicating with the school and showing the phases of where we have

[00:39:00]
the students moving during construction time throughout the whole process so they they do walk hand-in-hand with the school during the phases and they adjust if the school is saying well we need to wait in this area for so they the construction manager is do a good job and working with the principal if they need to make any adjustments along the way and just just to add to that we have been planning this for a long long time so we've remodeled portable so that we can relocate people we've got the the area that's going to be demolished and under construction completely cleared out now we've worked with the principal in order to have safe walking routes for all the students and we continue to check that as we go and just to give further Assurance Bradbury Stamm has done a lot of projects for us on active campuses so they're very familiar with this and

[00:40:00]
