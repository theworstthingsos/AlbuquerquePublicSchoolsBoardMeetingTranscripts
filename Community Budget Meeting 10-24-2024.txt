[00:08:00]
as representatives of the public we on the board feel that it is our biggest responsibility to make certain that we know what you are customers think our customers at APS are not only the parents it's the students and the taxpayers as well your input tonight will help us on the board as well as superintendent Blakey and her staff to put together a document that best serves the educational need of our 68,000 students rest assured we do want to hear from our community members what you would like to see funded we're so glad you're here and we welcome the audience that's on our APS YouTube channel as well before we start there are a few people that I would like to introduce just so that you can put a name to a face for those of you that don't tune your tune

[00:09:00]
I have a board member Janella storka next to her is renette Apodaca our Chief Financial Officer Melanie blea our executive director of federal and state programs and at the end we have a superintendent doctor Gabriella Duran Blakey and then I just and then right here in the audience we have board member Josefina Dominguez as well so just wanted to put names to faces for you welcome welcome so I want to be respectful of your time and kind of dive into it and give you an overview of our agenda tonight so first we're going to start with a budget overview

[00:10:00]
I want to make sure that since we're talking about the budget and getting ideas from all of you that you understand where our money comes from and what money can actually be given input on are a financial like CFO or is it for DACA is going to be giving a presentation as well as Melanie blea are executive director of federal and state programs so they'll give you some insight and hopefully while you're listening to that presentation you get some ideas flowing after that we'll have a listening session or breakout sessions where we're going to hopefully discuss some of your ideas on what's important to you when it comes to the budget so we know what our community has to say so we can make sure that we're taking that back to our district leadership and the board and implementing some of those suggestions and will do that for about 30 minutes or so next we'll do a share out so as you're discussing make sure that you

[00:11:00]
pick somebody in your group to share out some feedback because you want to make sure that everybody here is listening and hearing what those ideas are and then we'll put them on these big sticky notes that you see on each side of the room and with that will collect that data and bring it back so we have those to look afterwards after Cheryl will be talking about next steps so we'll do a timeline for both what the budget process is and creating the budget but also what the timeline is for implementing some of your ideas that you share with us tonight and then we'll do a close out and hopefully this is a really good time that we have together we really appreciate you being here we'll do some closing remarks and then you'll get to go home and enjoy your evening so again I appreciate you all being here and I'm going to hand it back to remember Jackson all right so before we go any further I did want to point out some of the handouts

[00:12:00]
if not I will okay we got somebody who's going to bring around thank you you've been told so one of them the first one this one outlines the districts for goals all of them focus on improving student outcomes so our goal is the board is to make certain that our students are making strides in the classroom and our hope is to make certain that our community helps us to drive funding towards those goals which is exactly why we are here tonight these goals don't just magically appear you the community has guided guided us as we create them you have also guided us on the guardrails which are on the

[00:13:00]
backside of that document the guardrails are essentially a set of standards that govern how we reach the goals we see these measures as critical just as critical as the goals themselves and I do want to emphasize that the goals in the guard rails because we have those days are a watershed change and how we operate at APS the board support some I know the superintendent support some and I'm confident that the community supports them as well the second handout we have is two sided and it gives a little bit more detail on the budget so it's this one with the New Mexico on it gives more detail about the budget and the sum of the funding that APS gets along with a variety of the sources and then the third handout

[00:14:00]
is taken from the survey that hopefully some of you have seen and maybe taken the time to fill out there's a survey online right now but it talks about our budget and it lists some of the priorities that we want you to think about as we're ranking budget components so with that I would like to introduce Dr Gabriella Blakey to say a few words thank you and thank you everyone for being here this evening I have been the superintendent since July 1st so just a few months but I can tell you this we are working very hard at aligning APS to our community's vision for schools and the goals that were outlined by board member Jackson is a long process but is a good one this time is timeline is vastly different based on last year's feedback at budget that the

[00:15:00]
feedback was taken in March so we have changed this to do it now in October and hopes that we get more feedback before we actually start the budget process so what you're doing tonight is Central to moving our schools forward we want our budget process to be open and that's why I look forward to hearing all of the ideas that you bring forward this evening and here's our bottom line everything we are doing everything is tied to student outcomes that starts with our budget because that drives all we do each and every day regardless of the time of year and that's why we're coming to you this evening we want you to help us in this effort and your ideas will do just that for us it will accentuate or push to improve our student outcomes at APS I will hand this back to Secretary of Sturgis but if you get nothing more out of tonight please know that we are

[00:16:00]
very grateful for your feedback and your presence with us thank you superintendent Blakey so now we're actually going to get into some of the stuff I know that's what's important tonight so just some points for you all APS during the school year has a 2.1 billion dollar budget so obviously this is a very intricate process that we have to go through to make sure everything is where it's supposed to be one thing to know also is we won't be able to implement every single one of your suggestions because we do have funding that comes with strings attached from our funders mostly from the state and federal governments so you'll be here more about that in a little bit but that being said there is a pot of money that you do have some influence on as you should as taxpayers so we want to make sure that those are being implemented to the best of our abilities since the budget is so big we won't be able to discuss every single budget detail tonight

[00:17:00]
Apodaca are Chief Financial Officer and Melanie blea are executive director of federal and state programs are here to give you a little bit of background on how our budget is built and where the money comes from so I'll pass it to them thank you for taking time to attend the aps budget listening tour the aps billion dollar budget process goes through different stages until it is actually presented and approved by the Board of Education in May of each year however the most important stage is obtaining Community input the finance department is dedicated to listening to the community because

[00:18:00]
I love you provide insights into local needs that help the budget help the district with the budget allocations that align with actual priorities and concerns as mentioned the aps budget this year is about 2.1 billion dollars and about 1 billion of this is Capitol Building or renovating schools maintaining schools and we cannot use Capital money for operational expenses similar we can't use Transportation funds or food and nutrition facts for any expenses other than Transportation or food the budget process goes through different stages as a matter of fact we're working on it now

[00:19:00]
Mike Gathering data on previous budgets enrollment numbers Staffing levels and reviewing of course our funding sources every school and every department and APS must create a budget and we have a team in APS finance department that helps them do that schools create their budgets in collaboration with their instructional counsels leadership in the district and of course Finance later in the school year we will present this budget to our school board before the budget can go to the state public education department must be approved by the board next slide sources of funding

[00:20:00]
we have three primary sources of funding that cover the cost of operating the district the first one is State funding the state Equalization guarantee also known as seg funding is a funding mechanism designed to provide funding to the school districts in the state the funding for 8:00 p.m. is based on the formula that takes into account are enrollment funding units such as special education needs and supplemental adjustments such as bilingual education students a key point in the formula is what we call the unit value which is determined by the state

[00:21:00]
it represents the dollar allocated and is calculated every year in essence the unit value can fluctuate and has a huge bearing on how much funding we get from the legislature every year are legislation legislative session begins in January and will last 2 months one reason we're meeting on this fiscal year 2016 budget at this time is to get ahead of the game once we get your thoughts on priorities concerns we can use that information to align our resources of course already spoken for because it does cover fixed costs such as personal such as principal teachers education assistance

[00:22:00]
audience and often other costs that sometimes aren't fixed the cost of running things like that seem to just be getting going up and up every year we also have federal and state funding and grants doctor Melanie blea we'll talk more about this in a bit but we also get funding from federal and state government in the form of Grants and title funds we also take that money into account as we build our budget and then of course we have Capital funding which we talked about and that supports our building renovating schools maintaining schools projects are identified through the capital master plan process and these funds are specifically earmarked for those Projects please remember

[00:23:00]
remember that Capital funding cannot be used for operational purposes in other words we can't take money from a school rebuilding project and use it to fund extra teachers next slide please we often are asked how many gets to school of all there's no one size fits all for each school and how its fun of course we have some Basics we have a standard school meeting every school is going to have a principal they're going to have a secretary they're going to have a custodian and then from there depending on enrollment we allocate teachers educational assistance nurses counselors

[00:24:00]
Librarians I can't emphasize this enough enrollment is a key determining how much is school is funded but of course there are other variables and these variables differ from school to school so let me give you some of those variables they include statements in class size so for example a high school have larger classes sizes than elementary schools the needs of students is also consideration for instance in special education and of course how many special education students are enrolled at each school we are always looking to be in compliance with our negotiated agreements and also it depends on the

[00:25:00]
end of individual school for example we have Community Schools and we also have schools that we called top schools which feature longer school days we're also directing additional resources to schools that need extra support for the performance framework in order to increase student achievement student outcomes schools will get a first look at their proposed budgets by February principles and instructional councils will draft a proposed budget for submission to the assistant superintendents in the budget office and I just want to make sure that I emphasize that every school is unique so that means they're funding is unique also

[00:26:00]
and the reason each school is different is because their student population berries so now I would like to introduce Dr Melanie blea and she's going to visit with you to explain more about Federal funding and grants period so what does strategic alignment mean it means that

[00:27:00]
the district we are aligning the budget to our communities priorities with student achievement as our measure of success our federal funding comes through a variety of buckets that include titles 1 to 34 etcetera and all of these funds are dedicated to specific purposes you can see what each of those are targeted to fund on the handouts it is important to know on the handout describing the federal and state grants that this is money that is anticipated for school year 2526 and that of course is yet to be determined in some cases federal money and grants are targeted towards specific efforts and in others we is the district have autonomy over the allocation of those funds there are some schools that receive Title 1 funding as the result of the number of students who qualify as economically disadvantaged however all schools regardless of Title One designation benefit from grant funding in various forms such as health assistance

[00:28:00]
24 and 3 although this is a new office this work is well underway for the Strategic alignment of funds in collaboration with the Chief Financial Officer OK Google it really is a complex process to put this budget together and I hope that that 20,000 ft view really helped to get you a sense of that so now we're going to move to the fun part this is where we're going to do our breakout sessions so we did not create tables for you guys we figured you could create your own groups but what you're going to see

[00:29:00]
Secretary of historical mentioned earlier we do have bigger pads around the the room so what we want you to do is we're going to take about 20 minutes we'll see how it goes right now but about 20 minutes we're going to let you guys discuss in groups on one sticky note we want you to discuss what your top three priorities are what you think the budget what the district should consider when putting together the 2025 2026 budget and again one of your handouts gives you some options that you can consider and it's exactly like what you will see in our online survey on another sticky note we would like you to write what your three lowest priorities are or areas

[00:30:00]
do you think we can save money when we're considering next year's budget then on the third sticky note we would like you to write down any concerns you have about how the District budget is created or executed once everyone has finished at your group with your thoughts we're going to ask you to share your thoughts with your neighbor or with your group and board members will be around and members of the administration will be around to listen to your conversations for those of you who are watching on YouTube or asking you to please scan the QR codes on the slide so that you can share from home what your top three priorities are what's your three lowest priorities are and what you're concerned so it is 5:30 exactly so we'll give you about 20 minutes to discuss

I'm just going to give a 3-minute warning

[00:49:00]
cell can you bump back the slides real quick to the aps budget the basic slide that has the pie chart just real quick perfect thank you

[00:50:00]
do you guys still need that pie chart up there a couple more OK Google

[00:51:00]
can you help us with microphones hey Google I know that as we walked around the room we've been hearing some good good discussion so now we're going to ask each of the groups to share some key points and feedback the one thing that we would like to ask you to do is to hold on to your sticky notes so even if you as an individual wrote on a sticky note we want you to hold all of those and when we're done giving feedback what we would like you to do is

[00:52:00]
sticky notes on the easel pads that are around the room and then what we're going to do is we're going to capture all of those thoughts as we prepare the budget and when I say capture all of the thoughts I really mean all of the thoughts and what we're actually going to do is prepare a document that then will be shared with the public as well as the superintendent Blakey and the board so you guys will all be able to see what the public feedback ultimately comes to okay so now we're going to walk around the room so who would like to start I think the Double Eagle group would like to start OK Google

[00:53:00]
priorities include that we want research-based curriculum that is aligned with with the goals but also that's complete we feel like at least at some of our schools are budget I mean our curriculum is not complete we might get part of the curriculum but therefore some teachers with some of the money that's allocated towards their classrooms will use it to complete a curriculum but others won't so then the kids aren't all getting the same instructions so that would be one of our top budget would be the research-based curriculum that's a line and complete a second top budget concern of hours

[00:54:00]
top priority would be Safety and Security so I think that's always a big concern for everyone and then our third one is Wellness which really should be prioritized whether it's being thought of in terms of nutrition in terms of mental health supports and I think that can go across all all age groups do we need to go with the others so some of our budget concerns include facilities so like the HVAC systems and a lot of schools it's just it's not it's not great but is there a way that we can use or utilize some of the government initiatives like going green or something to that effect in using solar to help with some of our facilities and getting some of those rebates back

[00:55:00]
and then also one of our concerns is just looking at this budget that there's so little of the budget that goes to instructional materials it's only about $113,000 is what it looks like and that's that's a concern of ours and then with lower priorities 113 million it says 113,000 for instructional materials

[00:56:00]
1023 can you say that again for the people online sorry the fund that shows only $113,000 that is an old fund that the state has stopped depositing income Revenue into it they know use the operational fund the one that's the big won the 1023 the 1.023 million and there is 13 million in that number related to instructional materials it's buried in there the 13th is what is remaining from the fun that was active many many years ago what got cut

[00:57:00]
where did the money come from it's part of the unit value they just moved it from the individualized into the big pie so we didn't have to that is just the remaining of so it's not that they've taken anything away now instead of going into that little sliver it goes into the big pot so we still have 13 million which used to be in that little sliver but as now in the big sliver so there's 13 million within that one billion see the blue the blue operational fun

[00:58:00]
right here where it says 1.03 billion and then 48% in that blue sliver 13 million of that 1 billion is instructional material so I have a question is that then restricted so you know how you guys were talking about earlier that some of these these monies Can't Be Moved we can't really do anything with does that mean that that 13 million is restricted specifically for instructional materials is not specifically okay so then that part of that money could then be changed and used for

[00:59:00]
weather operational expenses correct correct because it's part of the formula that is CG okay okay so in theory it may not be 13 million then that actually goes to instructional materials it might be something like that or more so over here

[01:00:00]
we have this thing called genius hour and it's added on to the school day so you're getting these enrichment opportunities for these students especially students that don't have the opportunity to get those types of extracurriculars at home like going to summer camp doing that so a lot of that is coming through our school so that was something that was a top priority for us and then another one of the top priorities was having that Wellness especially with mental health especially for teachers for students having that opportunity to be able to reach out to someone else I feel like sometimes students feel like they don't have a lot of resources and I think it's important that

[01:01:00]
and then just a personal concern that I have is making sure that all of our schools are retaining teachers and having full-time teachers cuz especially for me I'm a new teacher at Hawthorne I'm trying to learn everything figure out everything and I want to stay at the school but if blending is not coming in there's a good chance that I might have to get split with another school and do twice as much work to make sure that all of this students are getting the education that they need and I want to make sure that all students get that full time one-on-one with every you know subject and teacher so that's what I have to say

[01:02:00]
so basically making sure that it's not just based off of oh well how many students do you have at your school but having rather than equality that Equity aspect of what do your students need at this school I guess is what we were kind of discussing here so oh and also college readiness as well and career thank you and thank you for thank you for being a teacher of the instructional council at El Dorado High School and I also teach English at El Dorado High School and some of the concerns that we have immediately have to do with College and Career readiness

[01:03:00]
in specifically HB 171 that's coming up that basically says that we have to offer high-quality electives in College and Career Readiness fields and we have so few teachers that are loaded up on a Core Curriculum classes that they can't be released for electives because since somebody would have to cover that Core Curriculum class and so we're going to have a hard time not only at El Dorado but also at Highland and Albuquerque High and West Mesa trying to address these needs of HB 171 because we don't have enough teachers because of the FTE funding requirements for each position and so like we're running into the

[01:04:00]
call and we don't know how to solve that like practically at the school we can't figure out how to solve it the next thing that we need is grants for high-quality professional development I'm a fellow of Harvard project zero I worked with the Mandela International Magnet School in Santa Fe and we had a private Foundation that founded our grants so that the funded our grants so that we could become a Harvard project zeros school I can't find a grant that would fund that for you know my my cohort group of schools for Aldo and so that's that's a problem and then also we are facing Wellness problems at our school we don't have a family counselor anymore we have kids who are in crisis and you know guidance counselors aren't there to address

[01:05:00]
that so we need to use that Medicaid funding to I don't know if that's what funds you know counselors and mental health but we're really struggling and they appointed a retired cop to run our Wellness room the wellness room isn't there for policing students is there for students who are in Mental Health crisis so anyway that's what we have to say thank you and go Eagles OK Google and the thing that I feel we really need is to address wellness and students in crisis because every school is the elementary school

[01:06:00]
have several students in crisis who are not ready to learn they perhaps have been they've experienced trauma or or they just have not learned the skills necessary to function in a school setting and so I propose that we Implement some kind of program where we can provide the support necessary for them to learn those skills to learn the skills of listening and responding to adult directions to stay in the area of instructional a lot of these students elope they run all over the campus and then somebody has to go make sure that they're safe they can't teach the other students so that's also impacting all of their classmates they need to learn the skill of self-regulation

[01:07:00]
you know instead of when something is not going their way not to tear apart the entire instructional environment tearing things up breaking things having the whole class have to evacuate to maintain their own safety and and they need to learn to keep their hands and feet and teeth to themselves because they are a danger to their peers they're a danger to staff I know of one staff member who had to go to the ER for a pencil in the eye the problem is real and the problem is becoming less and less uncommon and so we really have a deep need to have a safe place where we can teach these students how to how to function in the school and we need access to Mental Health Services as well as specially trained

[01:08:00]
teachers who can address Tom trauma-informed instruction and a specialized classroom where their sensory supports can be met I mean they're sensory needs can be supported and access to protected outdoor space where they can go outside but they can't run and jump over the walls into neighboring yards and and that sort of thing also literacy programs in College and Career Readiness group just wanted to make sure you guys were kind of talking a little bit do you have anything you want to share I'll put you on the spot sorry

[01:09:00]
hi my name is Nikki bomb I am a parent of a high schooler middle schooler in an elementary school in two elementary schools but I'm also a community coordinator at Marie Hughes Elementary School some of the conversations that we had is kind of all the same one thing I learned from Julian last year is all these are priorities right we can't cut one without looking at the other so how do we strategically look at all the priorities all the concerns we have and finding strategic solutions that can kind of bridge the gap or be the umbrella but I do feel like there are some things that stick out Wellness is one of those things mental health but also teachers if we can invest in the teachers having an extended day for you to have the professional development for them to learn and build and relationships trusting relationships with the parents that then also develop trusting relationships with the students we can start bridging some gaps that we see

[01:10:00]
in the family to the home are the family to school relationships school is extended Beyond The Four Walls of our buildings that goes into the home so how can we find Solutions again I think that goes to extended day for teachers they're already doing 8-hour work but they're only getting paid in 6 1/2 hours and their salaries so how do we do that and that comes with professional development when you have an extended day you have professional development coming in so I do feel like there is an umbrella strategy for that and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say that I think Community School coordinators are key and Community Schools are key to this because they do bring in these aspects looking for career college readiness when we as Community Schools are partnering with their communities we can pull in the resources for them to be like at junk professors coming in again there's a funny issue but we can pull in these resources for this aspect again Dion's has

[01:11:00]
amazing program that they do with their leadership for students coming in why are we not pulling them to do classes for our schools that are high schoolers so again this is all with the Partnerships that we are creating as a community school as well so thank you thank you okay anybody else have something they want to say do you want me to Circle back to you okay Google awareness and social emotional learning in all schools

[01:12:00]
on non-violent Crisis Intervention and helping everyone have the right skills and having verbal de-escalation skills to really address a lot of what was being talked about on that side I think the areas of need really come across for me the largest states with our students with disabilities they have more inclusive

[01:13:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:14:00]
and more relevant CTE to their interests and to the needs of the community so looking at our needs assessment and talking with Tori from career connected learning and really looking at the at that data that was collected from community members and business members of the community is saying something

[01:15:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:16:00]
let me hear about 12 years and the school system is so much different in my opinion better here than it is back home and I actually from my volunteer in my the principal in a couple of the teachers asked me if I would be interested in seeing about teaching so I'm actually in the fast track program at CNM to be a teacher but when I tried to ask me to start volunteering as a substitute because they were so short and when I went through Kelly Services

[01:17:00]
