[00:14:00]
that were disgusting the exit conference that we had with the audit committee back in October at this point those are included in the final report along with all of the charter school findings the report is quite extensive it doesn't include five volumes of information and so for those new members of the audit committee and board if there are any questions at any time please feel free to reach out to me again my name is Sheila and I am the partner with Adams thank you we'll go ahead and move on to item six and we're going to the acceptance of the ethical Advocates statistics for the period of July 1st 2023 through December

[00:15:00]
play first 2023 are presenter is TC Rider executive director of student parent and employment service center thank you good morning Madam chair members of the committee and superintendent Elder I'm TC Riser the executive director of the student parent and employee service center as a quick overview with a blur complaints are filed primarily through ethical Advocate which is an online format it allows for anonymous reporting I do receive a few reports by email and phone I follow the procedural directive when receiving reports I review the reports and send them to the direct supervisor and the individual that is one step up in the chain of command so that two levels of supervision are notified today I bring before you that at the call Advocate data for July 2023 to December of 2023 which starts on page 9 of your electronic documents as you can see we

[00:16:00]
Percy 40 whistleblower complaints during the July to September 2023 time frame and 34 complaints from October to December 2023 the reports in your packet provide a breakdown of the data by several different categories the types and number of complaints seen are typical to the previous report time frames over the last 3 years I stand for questions at this time miss right sir this is Courtney I wonder if it would be helpful just to kind of if you could review what it means if a complaint is confirmed versus not confirmed and open and unknown thank you member Jackson so when a complaint is confirmed it means that the complaint has been reviewed and we found that

[00:17:00]
when does how is is true in some format when it's unconfirmed we were unable to verify that it was a valid or it was a you know that what was reported was true and and what was the third one remember Jackson open an unknown basically just a tabs at the top okay I'm sorry so open means that it's still being investigated and unknown means that typically not enough information was given for the report to even be investigated or that it was of an outside agency where we wouldn't actually do the investigation ourself thank you for that I just thought that might be helpful for our new members to understand what the the tabs across the top or what information

[00:18:00]
Anonymous way possible yes member Jackson thank you or something to that effect would you mind expanding on that just a bit so if you look at the top of the page it does have the number of complaints by year and when we look at the overall number of complaints their typical each period has somewhere in the 30s there are some repeats usually where when one complaint is filed we might get five or six which did occur in the first time frame of July to September there were six repeat that I'm aware of everything falls in about the 30 range

[00:19:00]
any other questions I'm just curious how effective is this system I'm just wondering from from what you

[00:20:00]
what is reported through ethical Advocate and you know it's a format where people can report anonymously so it does let supervisors know that there is a concern in some area and so we do look into that so I believe that we are effective in looking into every single complaint that it's helpful to the to our system our APS system do supervisors find it helpful I haven't asked that question a lot of the reports that we get are similar to the complaints that we might receive in the service center I think anything where we find out there's somebody that has you know what an issue or a concert at brings it to the Forefront for a supervisor I believe that's helpful like

[00:21:00]
anything you'd like to add their board member Dominguez I would say that Mr Rodger gave you an accurate answer we do investigate everything that's reported and that's why you have it you have you have to have some sort of anonymous tip line for people to feel that they can report things that they're concerned about I don't have percentages and I you know we find a lot of these things to not be true and a lot of times people reporting something they see and they don't know the context of the full situation and so it's frustrating when you spend a lot of time investigating something and you know really wasn't anything there but the flip side is there was nothing there but that's actually a good thing right you know because you don't want to have you know about so it's important to have the line you have to have it but and when it when we did when we when we catch something that's unethical

[00:22:00]
sure and I'm just wondering how I mean it's great to have clarification when somebody has misunderstood Behavior or comments because they get well we don't know if they get contacts but if that person specifically because it's Anonymous right there's a lot of investigating and yet I understand why we have an anonymous tip line for purposes other

[00:23:00]
some of the complaints and whether there's a higher number of a specific topic that's reported more so do we look at those patterns and told me to see multiple complaints of the same topic or from the same school that I will work with the supervisor for some next steps thank you any other questions

[00:24:00]
thank you very much for this information we can come and see if we have any more questions thank you all right now let's move on to item number 7 overview of activity funds for Albuquerque Public Schools and our presenter is Joyce Ramirez manager of the activity fund support good morning Madam chair members of the committee superintendent Elder I did have a PowerPoint but I'm not sure that it is I wasn't sure how that worked but I wanted to take a few moments to explain what activities are also known as students or Student Activity funds next slide please but basically activity funds is the money that is collected at the school level they are separate from the operating fund that is run through the district's Financial system

[00:25:00]
the Lawson system and they are maintained at the school activity funds will roll over a year to year so if for instance the cheerleading club has a balance at the end of July or at the end of June of $1,000 then the next year they will start with $1,000 so we don't lose any money that way this is all student money raised there's two there are two different funds the activity funds are at the school level the operating funds come from the state of New Mexico and run through the district system on Netflix please every school has a has a an activity fund account they each have a checking account where they run their funds through that account we have Accounts at probably every bank or credit union in the City of Albuquerque we have 100 422 schools and three departments that we have activity

[00:26:00]
transport each one of those schools will need to balance that that school statement on a monthly basis they will turn in the statement to my office or a copy of that report I verify totals and then collect data for end of the quarter reporting through APS accounting we all use the same software the accounting software called apps and again I don't know what that stands for I've never been able to find out but we've been using this software since at least 1996 so we're all pretty familiar with it and then again with the schools all having checking accounts probably 95% of our schools will also have some form of a savings account if they have an account at a credit union it's required that they have a savings account so they may have a small savings next slide please these are a variety of ways

[00:27:00]
is that the school will raise money money that is coming in at the school level I may not have gotten all of them but these are pretty much pretty traditional for all the schools of what kind of funds they may be taking in pretty much daily next slide any money that is collected at the school level needs to be reseeded those receipts are then balanced on a daily basis and deposits are made at their Banks or credit unions on a daily basis we have armored car service that runs through the school year for the high school levels and everyone else has a school bookkeeper that will take or physically take the money to their Bank those receipts are actually posted every day on to the system it's required that we keep a running total

[00:28:00]
as current as we possibly can for these clubs next slide anytime that a club wants to spend some of their money they are required to get an authorized purchase order which is something that the EB system does create for them purchase order will be requested by the staff the PO will then be created by the bookkeeper using the app system employee then go make their purchases and then to the bookkeeper so that bills can be paid period fold we have a training side and an auditing side as of right now we have 10 schools that do not have a bookkeeper so we have one high school

[00:29:00]
3 elementary schools one alternative and the rest are Elementary's I think I might have said that wrong to Med schools one alternative and the rest are elementary schools and we have so those schools we are actually covering that position making sure the money is counted the money is going to the bank daily and also if the school needs some sort of purchase to be made that were creating the PO for them period we also have approximately 28 schools that have brand new bookkeepers so we also will handle the training of those bookkeepers we have a 3-month training process where we meet with the bookkeepers that new bookkeeper probably three times a week explain the process explain some of the rules and then over a period of three months

[00:30:00]
we will kind of back off a little bit let them do more and more of the work after that 3-month then we set up the audit side of things so we also do auditing of the activity funds so it's very mobile Department it's very possible to be at a school to do the work and then move to another school to do some training and then come back to the office and do some work there we're very busy but I just at this you know I just wanted to give everybody kind of an overview of what activity funds actually are there is a another little sheet of paper that kind of gives you a little more information but right now we're looking at about 9. 3 5 5

[00:31:00]
I stand for any questions I have a question and thank you for that report and shedding some light on I think some important numbers and facts like 28 new bookkeepers that's pretty daunting right how many how many of you are there that you go out for 28 bookkeepers right now I do have one open position but there are four of us a lot of what we do we can handle at in our office right now we're covering West Mesa Academy and

[00:32:00]
Wilson Middle School in our office so we'll swing by pick up what we need to pick up and we can do a lot of the posting and printing in our office and then we'll go back to the school so yeah it's very busy but a lot of your other schools the smaller elementary schools is an in-person deal the bigger schools we can do a lot of the posting and printing and and creating pose and that sort of thing at the at our office right but that's that's a lot of Hands-On for 28 new bookkeepers and for the 10th that have no bookkeepers because that's on top of then who's doing the bookkeeping it would be someone in our stuff we have each person is assigned a list of schools and so that one person that will be covering that school so they make an arrangement with the principal as to what days they'll be at the school and

[00:33:00]
anything that's available at that time will get current and so is 10 a standard number of year to year that you don't vacancies that you see or committee members know it's it's to be very honest since covid it seems like we've had a lot of turnover a lot of just a lot of turnover it just seems and and a lot of times it's hard to feel that position at the school level so it's taking longer to fill positions that are open people are not staying as long as they used to it's a it's a question I don't know well thank you to your staff for working so hard to shore up you know

[00:34:00]
my first thought was how much training is involved so thank you for clarifying that three months three months training process and I'm curious so I think it includes coaching as the person is training but what happens after that three months and can they follow up with you there's obviously an open line of communication could you just go into that little bit thank you yes our office is always open to anyone who wants to come in or call since we're out and about I'm mostly there I'm the one who's mostly there so I'll take any phone call that make him in but because there are open

[00:35:00]
it's easier to contact us through email but everything that we do is very is very we have a manual that has the steps of what how to proceed it's it's a it's a it's a user-friendly system the app system so a lot of it is done through email we can put the steps down on our email phone calls were available anytime somebody needs us we've been available to do training at the school level for principals who may want to go meet with their staff we kind of try to make ourselves available as best we can using our own schedules anybody online have any questions

[00:36:00]
well thank you very much for the time and for taking I was really amazed at how much money we taken so it was one of those things that well but I'm thank you for taking the time and thank you for your service Also let's go ahead and move on to item number 8 we're looking at the approval for the Board of Education to convene in executive session as authorized by the public meeting that section of 10 - 151822 in connection with activity funds do I have a motion to convene in executive session I will make a motion
