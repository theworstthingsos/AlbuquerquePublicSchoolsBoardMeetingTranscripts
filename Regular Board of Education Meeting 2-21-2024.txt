aps.edu in addition for those of you here to representative from our service center is here to assist you Mr Gonzalez thank you for historico our first Speaker tonight is in person Christina pop piano you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking them members of the board superintendent Blakey I am my name is Christina my fourth grade teacher at one of your Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence I am here to shed light on the challenges posed for a by our building schedule and limited 20 minute period unsuitable for elementary education in the needs of our students and doesn't prioritize their learning with a restaurant repair in the morning valuable instructional time is wasted when

[00:06:00]
repeaters enter the classroom alongside with their students as Educators we strive to instill responsibility preparedness and organization and our students so they are prepared for Middle High School and Beyond yet we cannot exemplify these traits if we're not given the necessary time to prepare before class it's disheartening that APS seems to rely on the assumption that teachers will continue to sacrifice their unpaid time to adequately prepare I devote 45 minutes each morning and at least 30 minutes after school to ensure that I'm ready for my students but maybe I shouldn't APS doesn't see being prepared as being a necessary or impactful the notion that a 20-minute recess is considered sufficient prep time is deeply insulting Elementary School Educators the only ones that are required to have 20 minute recess this change was quietly inserted into our negotiated agreement this year without elementary teachers prior knowledge Elementary educators are being

[00:07:00]
delete shortchanged in terms of prep time compared to middle and high school Educators despite being responsible for planning lessons across five or more subjects daily which lay the groundwork for all future education APS and ATF seem to believe that a mere bathroom break is adequate preparation time at our school a significant portion of Educators prep time 80 out of the 220 minutes is allocated to recess further limiting or ability to adequately prepare for a classes contact parents complete mlss plans that paperwork deal with behaviors Etc I ask that you please look at the 20-minute prep time that's to Elementary Educators and make a change to that thank you thank you man our next speaker is in the room it is Dr sanela I did want to point out there are six public forum speakers signed up FYI I think there was a I think it was three earlier but more people have signed up there at the end

play EDS dot org biological Integrity or the sake of our children's health and well-being thank you and God bless you thank you Doctor sell our next speaker is on Zoom Mr Verlander Mr Coker you there can you hear me Google it takes weeks to get transportation and often times parents are forced to keep their students at home I myself had to take my little brother on the city bus for weeks as well as walk him home or to his after school program which due to the way the buses are set up that's an extra mile of walking from my little brother as well there were students in his class that went without proper transportation for nearly two months mobility issues and

[00:11:00]
you just did not have the proper equipment to get them to school with the current obsession with instructional time I find it particularly insulting that are special needs students are not afforded the same treatment as other students are given usually the excuses that we don't have enough bus to the drivers or specialized Transportation but what does that mean functionally that means this is the budget issue conversation isn't high enough to attract more drivers we do not allocate the appropriate funds to have enough buses at the start of the Year according to the law this is unacceptable budget cannot be a contributing factor to whether or not any special needs students get the services and includes Transportation every year 1005 or ignored and there's no accountability for it and it'll happen again this spring we are out right breaking the law and Robin special needs students the valuable instructional time that they need the main issues that I see here is either with our contractors or with the state not providing us not enough funding we need to actually start looking at real solutions to this

[00:12:00]
it might include APS either suing the state or our own bus contractors for not providing enough services to provide for all of our specialty students there's no real way to get around providing for an IEP like these are federally mandated that you have to follow them and it's been a constant battle and as well as procedurally a lot of the solutions that even I preferred from my little brother have been denied particularly as far as I understand it by the Lea and more specifically through aps's legal and is determination of what is defined as a special Transportation if you want to reach out to me more on this feel free to get in contact with any of you do have my email but yeah I just want to bring that to attention because it is a consonant ongoing issue and I can guarantee you it's going to happen again next spring is in the room Lexie Caesars

[00:13:00]
you'll have 2 minutes once you begin speaking my mind and I have several issues with distribution of resources that people in my neighborhood my daughter supposed to go to Wilson Middle School they don't have a counselor I see other middle schools that are like in the Northeast and on the other side of Central and they have three counselors to counselors in school I don't I've heard that counselors can go where they want to that it's not distributed equally and it will soon we have a high number of homeless children people who have a lot of trauma in that area we have the Gateway Center a mile away or less a lot of homeless encampments people are scared like 30 have left since July

[00:14:00]
although I really believe every student should go to the school they're supposed to so that the resources and the parents and work together at the school but Jefferson had an amazing amount of things going on there they had all these music classes tons of electives teachers to counselors I mean it was unbelievable and then you go to Wilson let me tell you one thing I do really appreciate about somebody has funded some shade structures over there it's really beautiful now but like the people in the neighborhood need to know that it's that they should go there you know it's a good place and I don't know how we can work together to get people to go to the school they're supposed to go to the other thing is the Bandelier start time of 7:30 so early I think I was here last year trying to talk about it and I was like well we'll try it and I'm okay now because I'm having 5th grader and next year I'll be able to sleep but I feel so bad for all those people with

[00:15:00]
how did they get their teeth brushed their sunscreen on their clothes on their books packed the lunch is made and then they get to school by 7:30 I mean at Bandelier cuz it's mostly a computer school I mean not transfer school so everybody that's not buses that go there people are jumping out of the cars I saw this morning like five kids at the same time jump out of the cars on the street and run to school I mean I feel like something bad's gonna happen one of these days because people are just rushing rushing rushing trying to get to school so early I've been on a couple field trips where they fall asleep Mrs I'm sorry I've got to cut you off you go over two minutes please wrap up in one quick sentence about thing to I totally agree they need more time you see your teachers coming at 7:30 in the morning and you think shouldn't be here earlier but they're just getting to work when they're supposed to be there and so they announcements go on right away and nobody has time to log into their Google Classroom because you know takes a while to log in and that's it thank you for next speaker is on Zoom Sarah vogelman

[00:16:00]
nope you're on mute can you hear me now we can you have two minutes I have a third and fifth grader this year so I will have a middle schooler and an elementary school or next year and I'm anticipating a really difficult time with that split start time of 7:30 and 9:15 we'd really like to stay in APS we love APS but that's definitely been a factor in deciding what to do next we've had a really difficult time with the 7:30 start time this year my kids grade school performance movie due to the early mornings my kids have the same extracurriculars after school as always so it's not like we go to bed earlier in order to adjust for the school time we just sleep last

[00:17:00]
my kids are exhausted it's been a very difficult year especially the dark mornings and the party lines are very long at Bandelier yeah I'm one of those people that send my kid running into school to try to make that door that shuts now a little bit early so the teacher can make it to class the burden at the start time has imposed on families comes up without fail at every PTA meeting and relentlessly and conversations around the school incoming parents are worried about it and trying to decide whether they bring their kids to APS or other schools like I said we'd like to stay in APS but we are considering our options for having an elementary and middle schooler with very different start times so please consider changing the start time for elementary to 8:00 or later thank you thank you ma'am or less speakers

[00:18:00]
can person marrying him you have two minutes once you begin on February 11th 1861 newly elected President Abraham Lincoln Lincoln

[00:19:00]
call Wyatt bewell I think that's kind of fits in our times as well and then on February 22nd 1861 in a speech at Independence Hall Philadelphia presently can declared the Declaration of Independence which gave Liberty not alone to the people of this country but hope to all the world for all future time it was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance this is the sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence and he said at the end I would rather be assassinated on this spot and surrender it thank you thank you ma'am board members that conclude public forum thank you to our public forum guests the next item on our agenda is it considered acceptance of progress

[00:20:00]
country reports for goal one interim goals 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 focusing on early literacy or presenters or doctor Antonio Gonzalez Chief academic officer Dr Shanelle Segura chief of schools and Dr Richard Bowman Chief Information and strategy officer before we hear our presentation we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete so I will ask does anyone have evidence that the elements of an effective monitoring report are not present again these elements are number one the goal does it clearly show which specific goal and interim goals are being monitored number two the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods does it clearly show the current reporting period is it clearly show the target reporting period as requested during our last progress monitoring session the administration is working on

[00:21:00]
the interpretation does the progress monitoring report clearly show how the superintendent show the superintendents understanding of system performance relative to the goal and number three the evidence and plan does it clearly show supporting documentation that evidences the superintendents understanding of system performance if the school system is not at Target or the superintendent's understanding of system performance indicates implementation is not on track does the monitoring report clearly describe systemic root causes strategic responses and any needed next steps so are all the elements I believe that they are lots of head nodding so since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will turn the floor over to our presenters Dr Gonzalez

[00:22:00]
Bowman thank you madam chairman members of the board and superintendent Blakey we are here tonight to present our second round of goal 1 progress monitoring so thank you for having us this is an exciting night it's knew it was a new experience for us going from the initial progress monitoring and now the second round to have additional data first I would like to introduce to the board our associate superintendent for gold one of Mr James and our reorganization to align and create tighter focus on the goals determined moving from the zone model to the goal model to give that Creedence so I welcome Gene here he and his team back here has worked really really hard and we'll see that in the data with the principals at the elementary school for this

[00:23:00]
I also want to let you all know that her superintendent blakey's request we are working from a presentation model so that it is easier for you all to access and and to follow as well as the community so I want to state that but in addition you have the full monitoring reports in your packets for your reference Madam president

[00:24:00]
second grade 1.3 so the overall goal is based on the annual summative assessment mandated by the state of New Mexico Bonamassa assessment which all of our students take in their Elementary School experience we know that the goal has been set by the Board of Education to look at the percentage of third grade students identified as Jersey Martinez plus African American who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above and the ELA summative assessment really looking at it as the Baseline of increasing from 27.3 in May of 2330 to 37.3 in May of 2018 that's our goal that's the ultimate break it down and our first deals with kindergarten

[00:25:00]
specifically and when we look at kindergarten we are looking at interim assessments using the iStation interim assessment as the mark both the summative assessment and the iStation assessment are both informed by standards therefore we do believe we do hope the idea is that the interim assessment and the students progress on the interim assessment will inform the students performance on the summative assessment when they do take it in third grade the interim goal that we have for kindergarten is a growth on that internet from 22.6 in May of 23 to 28.6 in May of 2020 so there's some things to celebrate

[00:26:00]
as we look at our kindergarteners from the beginning of the year to our mid-year Ice Station interim assessment the first is the average proficiency rate in English language arts for kindergarten students district-wide grew by half a percentage point from 31.9 to 32.4 so we look at all of our kindergarteners in the district from the beginning of the year to mid-year based on this assessment we're moving in the right direction when we look at our yesi Martinez and African-American students only we see that they grew by 1.5% points from 26.1 to 27.66 therefore in both instances the charge that has been given to the district by the board we are seeing

[00:27:00]
word growth in both of these areas we do recognize though that there's work to do and one of the things that the progress monitoring Journey has really given us is themes and identifying gaps barriers and next steps in the work we are able to Target the work we're able to look at what's maybe challenging or classrooms in schools and how we are best suited to assist and support our schools moving forward we like to highlight two areas specifically for a kindergarten student group the first one is the proficiency rate for all other students notes in African-American students decreased by 3.9% points since the fall from 63.6 to 59.7 so just to add a little bit of context to that

[00:28:00]
concern is those students did not meet their projected Target so we understand that they started higher to begin with therefore their target naturally was that much higher they did not meet that as a student group so as we look at next steps in a moment we're going to discuss the plan that we have for looking and supporting those schools that perhaps saw that decrease with intentional root cause analysis and correlating that next step to their 90-day plan another area of concern in regards to our kindergarteners specifically we saw that 53 percent of elementary schools decrease in kindergarten iStation summative assessment scores for the beginning of the year to the middle of the year period

[00:29:00]
steps we know that those schools that fall in that category we know who they are and its fundamental as that may seem that's important so that we are able to Target we are able to tear with intentionality are supports with our district teams to be able to Target next steps in increasing and correcting that area of concern moving on to interval 1.2 is our first graders and with that it's looking at the percentage of first grade students identified in the US in Martinez decision last African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above as predicted by iStation will increase from 17% in May of 23 to 23% in May of 26th

[00:30:00]
can we look at that and this round of beginning of year to middle of your data we had a growth in the proficiency or above rate in English language arts for our first grade students of 1.7% points so they went from 27.5% to 29.2% when we look specifically at our yossi and Martinez and African-American student groups they grew by 2.2% points from 22.2 to 24.4 again an area of concern is when we don't see when we're seeing decreases and so we had 33% of our elementary schools who saw decrease in their first grade Istation

[00:31:00]
aware of that it gives us that information to work directly with those schools to identify what additional supports they may need and intervention time that maybe needs to be extended to to our students moving on to interim goal 1.3 our second graders again on focusing on iStation interim assessment the interim goal is the percentage of second grade students identified as a Martinez plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above as predicted by iStation will increase from 18.3% in May of 2033 to 24.3 per cent in May of 2026 a couple of areas to celebrate since the fall with our second graders we saw an average proficiency rate in English language arts for

[00:32:00]
you didn't scroll by 2.1 percentage points from 28.3 to 30.4 % so again a growth in the overall second grade student population when we look at our Yazi Martinez plus African-American student groups we see that they grew as a second grade Group by 1% point from 23.4 to 24.4 percent the area of identified next step or concern is we saw that with this group of students 36% of elementary schools did see a decrease in second grade iStation summative assessment scores from the beginning of the year to the middle of the year so I get these schools are targeted through identified for us to be able to work with moving forward so this graph shows grade level or above

[00:33:00]
Proficiency in reading the green line that's steady across is the goal for a third graders for the the namassa the state assessment that happens once a year when we look at the different colors here kindergarteners are represented in blue first graders in red and then we have second graders in yellow it shows over time starting in the year 1819 to their mid-year to their end of year so from that time we can see that there's been the ebb and flow that we expected given the pandemic and what I look at in this graph is we're starting to see that upward trajectory which means that we are getting closer to growth that are kids are growing and that is really exciting and hopeful

[00:34:00]
for us to see the lines moving in the right direction towards the green third grade graph in the next chart we have students who started in kindergarten in 2021 so this is focused specifically the previous graph was focused on different cohorts of students each year where this graph demonstrates a cohort of students over time the same cohort so we can see students who started kindergarten in 2021 they're beginning of your middle of your end of year again in 2022 beginning of your middle of your end of year and we're seeing the jump which is really exciting for beginning of your and middle of year for this school year was we look at the school in general and we consider

[00:35:00]
what's going well with this work we have a couple things we like to point out to the board so the first thing I think is a huge celebration and something to be really excited about is all of our teachers in these grade levels have access to high-quality instructional materials and interventions in both Ela and math and that's something to celebrate as we think about high-quality instructional materials lead to teaching of grade level standards to a differentiated approach so that's one thing that we'd like to lift up and really credit our teams and our district teams for the hard work they put into making that a reality if you recall the First Progress monitoring conversation that was very much still in place so it's fun to watch how to work evolves the second thing is all principals have access to monitoring Tools in other words based on some of the interventions for examples

[00:36:00]
our principles have access to how individual classrooms are doing how they can then support those teachers in supporting their students identifying strong points in their campus that they can then replicate throughout the campus and really look to find best practices throughout their school that they're able to then build upon and scale up the other thing that we spoke about at our First Progress monitoring conversation was the guardrail 3 walkthrough to continue the work that began last spring that has been completed we do have our walkthroughs tested and calibrated and I'm happy to share that next month we will be doing the second walkthrough to inform the progress monitoring number two of God Route 3 again directly in the area that has been charged for us in

[00:37:00]
these goals we also know that all of our elementary schools have gold one as part of their 90-day plan common language we're all working toward the same work and the same goal 95% of our kindergarteners first graders and second graders took the iStation interim assessment that's a big deal to be able to get all of those students to really engage in the ongoing continuous Improvement participation in the iStation assessment so that we are able to have the valuable data that we need to inform next steps and continuous Improvement and finally I'm going professional development to improve data literacy and continuous Improvement is Uncle with our teachers and our principles every month at our principal meetings and likewise with their teachers

[00:38:00]
when we look at what needs Improvement within the school we still there's still more support that is needed to increase and improve the use of the district adopted resources and we've you know we've said it before and I'll say it again we have really worked hard to refine the process of adoption of high-quality instructional materials and within the high-quality instructional materials the goal is to provide teachers what they need so that they don't have to look elsewhere they don't have to get on the internet they don't have to do spend their time looking for stuff that they have a strong curriculum that has been vetted that is free of biased that is culturally and linguistically responsive and has built-in tools for assessment and differentiation and so again you know we're just going to continue to work

[00:39:00]
are schools and our teachers to share and demonstrate that you know what it's it's a very positive thing and it's a tool for them to do their job well and it provides when you're using these high-quality instructional materials they are grade level standards that are being taught so it's not having to find a line and create and lesson plan differently it's it's a lot of it is done which is really nice another part that needs Improvement is that schools across our district need to unlock the same amount of time for ELA instruction we have too much variability across our district and how much time is allocated to ELA specifically and so are team is working really hard to make sure that in the master scheduling process they're building in that instructional time but also that

[00:40:00]
acceleration time to help all kids regardless of where they are be able to accelerate their learning when we look at next steps for goal one we are in the process of working to develop units of study in ela in mathematics and there'll be developed to support the quality classroom instruction a walk through tool will be used to support that quality classroom instruction that is aligned to guardrail 3 increase interventions during the school day for schools that saw a decrease in iStation scores so again it goes time and accessed for students to be able to work through and accelerate attainment of those standards and skills that they may have gaps in and then working to ensure that all schools include 120 Minutes Ela instructional block

[00:41:00]
for their 2425 Master schedules and what we're asking is that within that time that acceleration is embedded within that so it's not a pull out it's not a stand-alone that all kids regardless of where they are they might be gifted in advance and they're still going to have that opportunity to continue to grow so building that into the master schedule process and at this time we are open for questions thank you thank you dot we will now open the floor to our monitoring conversation as a reminder to the board we have already asked questions that are of technical or tactical nature before tonight's meeting so those questions and their answers are posted on the agenda materials for the public to see our questions during this meeting then

[00:42:00]
recipe of strategic nature meaning that we will ask questions to help us understand how the reality for our students is aligned with our vision before we get to the questions too I want to share another update on how we as a board and the district and the board Services office are working to try to support try to support effective question asking so there's three steps that we're taking one is we are getting some additional guidance and support from our associate coach Ashley pause once the questions have been submitted because she's going to do a read through to way in and determine if they are technical tactical and also in line inappropriate so that we're not sending inappropriate word but we're not sending misaligned questions to the district to have to spend time on answering so there have been some of those types of questions that have been submitted in the past typically they're framed as a question but it's offering

[00:43:00]
suggestion for a solution so it's like what do you think about this solution those are the types of questions that are out of line so and then you know specific data requests about specific schools or clusters of schools for example there's other examples of types of questions that are not the effect of questions that we've been coached to ask either in the meeting or in email so those questions are going to be once we've submitting once we've submitted them to board Services they'll be reviewed and sort of cold by Ms pause and then the district will be able to answer and respond that's one thing that hopefully makes us better question askers but also limits your need to answer ineffective or inappropriate questions the second is that I will work to moderate our question asking to keep us to strategic questions but I also asked that we moderate each other so if one of your peers has asked a question that appears to be out of line misaligned

[00:44:00]
get giving suggestions and advice or technical or tactical I asked that all of my fellow board members help to self help to monitor each other so it's not all on me I like to be good cop sometimes and then the last thing is that we do continue to have support from our coach Ashley pause one-on-one so if you need additional support or if you even want to run a question by her before the meeting is this question technical tactical strategic in line you can email it to her you could text her you can call her we do have that opportunity for one-on-one support as well so those are three things that we are going to start doing in order to help smooth the process and hopefully some more points so with that we will start the monitoring conversation we'll do it as we have in past meetings we'll take one strategic question for board member and then Circle back around so that we're not having any one person dominate the meeting with their questions

[00:45:00]
I will go ahead and start to my right with member Jackson will get it started first of all that that presentation was so much more informative we had we had all of the exact same information but I think to see it visually and just how you guys restructured I really appreciate the presentation and not only for for our benefit but again like for the benefit of the people that are watching at home to see exactly what it is that we are working towards to thank you for that my one of my strategic questions was actually already answered in your presentation so my second strategic question if I hope it's a teacher question mark in the not in

[00:46:00]
it's not working well section in the needs Improvement it said for all goals no sorry even the what's working well for all goals and what is working well I see that teachers and principals have access to high-quality instructional materials and tools but what strategy are you going to use to make sure that those tools are used to ensure Improvement on goal number one as well as alignment to guardrail 3 I've been working on it for a week Jackson if you if I might just explain a little bit about how we're going to approach that work period

[00:47:00]
in ensuring the use of high-quality instructional materials the teaching of grade level standards and differentiation which defines guard rail 3 we have worked for a semester with sreb to define a reliable tool that is going to assist the organization our district teams to go in and look for these look for these areas in our classrooms so we are going to be doing that March 4th through 22nd will be visiting about 40 School schools on this March and visiting approximately 80 to 9024

[00:48:00]
differentiated list of schools by performance throughout the city to send our teams in by elementary middle and high school to look for that they have also given us assurances that they will give us a report for each school to use as a tool for conversation with their staffs about hey guys this is what we're seeing this is not what we're seeing this is why it's important this is how we can support high quality teaching the spirit of teaching in your on your campus so on February 27th we have a principal meeting we are going over all of this in detail we are also encouraging our schools don't just wait for the official visit to use this on your own site Facebook continuous Improvement methodology going to your classrooms

[00:49:00]
this conversation independent of the district so that you can build a culture where these Norms are your reality District teams throughout the year through the work of our goal Associates are also going to be going in and having this conversation month after month after month therefore it's not a wait for an annual thing that we go in pull the data to give the board it's becoming the fabric of who we are and the way we do work so I'm really excited about it I also think that this work can be complemented with one of the next steps which is giving teachers the tools of the units of study as a resource to be able to connect the dots in these areas understanding fully that the teachers ability to

[00:50:00]
play the artist of their practice is something we celebrate in the district but giving a brand new teacher a tool and a baseline to work from based on our materials I mean it's a no-brainer so those are some thoughts that we have in response to abiding by the car Grill Jackson for president Gonzalez and superintendent Dr Gonzalez started to explain the teams of the elementary teams working this one of the things we've done is we completed all elementary school walkthroughs prior to December and within those walkthroughs we identified in the schools of areas of need that we work with principles to actually take a look at and then come up with a plan putting that into their 90-day plan and re-emphasizing with their teachers of the importance of using the high quality

[00:51:00]
in order to identify where some of those maybe areas that teachers might be thinking they're missing within the actual instructional material that they can fill those gaps so we're working really hard with principles like I said we finished all the walkthroughs before December before break and then we started the second round we're starting the second round on top of what we're doing at the district level we're going into schools as well and doing these exact walkthroughs having those conversations the team is also meeting with every school meeting with their 90-day plan teams their instructional consoles their their their their Community School consoles and also their staff meetings and having these conversations and have how to have these conversations with your teachers and working with the dial

[00:52:00]
Goosebumps like thank you awesome that sounds very promising and very well yeah on our way to Great execution my question is about the inequitable blocks of ela time that are not working what about those blocks of time is not working and follow up is what specifically is driving that in equity we started pulling school schedules

[00:53:00]
gas in the different schools with Howie La was being addressed but one of the things we did what we done differently as we put together a tights and loose schedule right basically for schools kind of an expectation for next year going into next year they finish budgets the next step for them will be to create their Master schedules with their La their map their specials all those things embedded with that the expectation is that they have 120 Minutes in their schedule to include the enhancement of the instruction intervention enhancement all of that will be embedded in that 120 minutes so at this point we've identified the schools that don't have it okay we know those schools specifically that will be working with up front and then the other schools that are already have it will be looking at it make sure there's Equity across the grade levels

[00:54:00]
how they're going to enforce that and put that into their schedules no I don't have any additional questions and my question is partially was asking so I got coach on a very beautiful question so I'm just going to read it all and you can just answer the last minute and also I wanted to reiterate with board member Jackson said that was a beautiful presentation very impressed thank you so my question for next steps on item 1.1 you mentioned that the team is planning to include 120 Minutes of yelling instruction as part of the Improvement strategy what are we currently doing and giving what you have learned from the status how do you expect adding these minutes will help cause improvements and what support do you need from us

[00:55:00]
can you put a chef's kiss in the meeting minutes right now currently the school's up front that we know they don't have 120 minutes and we're working on that process as we go through the remainder of this year to make sure that next year's scheduled reflect that as far as as far as the inequities in the schedule I think it was part of the question is that without the allotted amount of time for core instruction just the tier one level instructions that 90 minutes it's it's not going to help students improve their level of literacy in any way shape or form we know that through all the research we've done through all the information that we have we know that that first night is the key to Improvement in Reading

[00:56:00]
for those gaps are so our job as instructors and in schools and principals and schools and is District leadership is to really look at where those gaps are to make sure that we're addressing those gaps for students so that when we get to another assessment we've already addressed the Gap so we're not waiting for those those gaps to appear again and so that's one of the things that we know as we go through this process that we're making sure that we let our principals know the importance of this work and how important it is for them to use a 90 minutes make sure that solid and then the 30 minutes is how we intervene and or enhances for those students who need enhancement as well and support from the board do you need to make that happen well I think the support that we've been giving just by creating the goals and the guard rails is is right away

[00:57:00]
never mind the level that we need in order to make sure that we do this work right it's it's clear for us what it is we're being asked to do and now our job is to go out and make sure that it gets done so thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you all for a great presentation it was very easy to understand and it looked great and I'm continuously impressed by your professionalism and how prepared you are so thank you so much for that you should know that so my question is I have to do with next steps and it's regarding the work work with the schools to ensure that they have school boards posted in their schools to illustrate the progress toward the school wide which are wildly important goals aligned to go one by the end of March and so what is your strategy to make sure this happens and in the schools where it hasn't been done yet are you going to record them to do this board member benefits for Christmas

[00:58:00]
who has a scoreboard whether it's a digital scoreboard or posted scoreboard and one of the things we've done is really worked with principles to make sure they understand that what they're actually posting or what they're actually sharing with their communities and their Learners is what their goal is right so what they're measuring and what they're putting up is actually what they're tracking along the way and we were helping to coach them in making sure that those are added into their 90 Day plans so it's not just something we put up it's something we're actually living measuring and looking at every 36 and 90 days as we go through the process thank you everyone and I appreciate your presentation I love the pictures my question is a pertaining to pertaining to the Google one point one we talked about the 53 percent of the elementary school

[00:59:00]
high quality materials for teachers in the resources that were given what in particular because of the decrease are those teachers not receiving or what are you saying is it pertaining to equity is it pertaining to certain materials that haven't been given I just would like your response what president Gonzalez thank you for that question I think the diligence on the part of the charge from the board to the district to ensure that the Baseline of high-quality instructional materials for every classroom regardless of the school in the district has been one that we've been able to respond to and make sure that the inequity doesn't exist in other words we can now say with certainty we have updated High

[01:00:00]
play instructional materials in the areas of ela and math in every classroom in these areas that was not necessarily the case even at the beginning of the school year so we have moved with diligence and with very expeditiously system-wide to get that done to ensure that the inequity that was referenced or The Wonder of inequity that was referenced in the question is not the case so that we are now have a baseline to work from around professional development for teachers around how do we support our teachers in differentiating that curriculum to ensure that it is culturally and linguistically appropriate for all of our students and they can be able to tailor that curriculum to meet the unique needs of the students in their classroom so even talking about it is really exciting I think that the common language and the common expectation

[01:01:00]
that are schools are feeling is also being felt by District Personnel therefore we are able to begin I don't I'm not going to suggest that we're there yet but began to kind of connect that Gap in terms of what support looks like to schools and how schools are able to benefit from the support that our district departments like Language and Cultural Equity special ed curriculum and instruction Title One and so on are able to really wrap around these high-quality instructional materials with high quality professional development thank you thank you I have a question and then we'll run back through if there's any additional questions or any follow-up that's come to mind so my question is with this new focus on improving student outcomes and measuring them through tests there's the risk of narrowing the curriculum so hearing you speak particularly about increasing the yield a block for example

[01:02:00]
good be an example of excluding for example social studies and science curriculum because those are measured in our goals there's the risk of academic pushdown pushing content from 4th 5th and 3rd down into the early days and there's obviously the risk for risk for increased anxiety both from Educators and from students on the pressure to perform and so my question is what strategies are you using or will you use to avoid these unintended consequences Madam chair members of the board superintendent Blakey I don't think it's a one approach answer I think it's a system shift and when we're looking at how we are measuring are we are measuring student growth over time we have to make sure that our why is very clear clear to everybody in our community that these are

[01:03:00]
in time that give us information as a district as a school to be able to individualize instruction for students to be able to understand where students are so that teachers can craft their lessons in differentiate the way that they need to in order to fill those gaps but you know I know that there has to be there has been a culture shift assessment for the sake of assessment is not it's not helpful to anyone and I think for students it's actually they need to hear the why they need to hear why it's important for them to sit down and to show us what they know so that their teachers have real information to guide their lesson planning and their instructions so I think as a district looking at our goals looking at our guard rails and our strategic priorities we

[01:04:00]
are really pushing on those we're using the common language with our with our principles they're using that with their teachers and and it's it's permeating the classroom in a positive way I don't think we can ever get away from the feelings that we get I think every single one of us gets when we take a test and we don't do so well it definitely impacts the social emotional whereabouts with you and so I think it's it's how we approach it as a district that this is a point in time where we're trying to gain you know we're trying to make sure that what we're doing is helping kids helping teachers and if it's not and we need to have a different conversation but I think it comes back to our narrative and it's not coming from the chief of school or the chief academic officer or even the superintendent it's coming from everybody that we're in

[01:05:00]
collectively together and how we're using these assessments is important how the results are communicated to students and families is important when I think a lot of times just in my experience has to have been given and then forgotten and I think that's what we experienced with the state test when we get the results so late it doesn't help our teachers and our classrooms it doesn't help principles it doesn't help district leadership so with interim growth assessments that's more helpful and that's more targeted to help us grow and make sure what we're doing is aligned to meeting the outcomes that are students deserve boarding so the thing that we're doing at the school level is we're making sure that schools understand the celebration pieces of it right it's important for school

[01:06:00]
celebrate the outcomes for students so I was in a school the other day principal took me right out his door said hey I need you to look at the scoreboard right I was here this Saturday I was putting this up look at this increase right look what we're doing along with that we're working with principles to understand that when there are gaps right when there are things that maybe don't go so well that they identify with those are and work with their teachers to help understand what is what is it we can do to support you with this area but with students you know students are celebrating it I mean we're in schools now we're seeing more and more schools are celebrating the success so those type of things and I think that's really important to believe that anxiety that students might come with or have when we're testing the other thing that with the science and social studies is working really hard to make sure that within the scheduling process that we're looking at the integration because we know the high quality instructional material has embedded social studies and Science in that right so how do we help our teachers to

[01:07:00]
with that with those programs to make sure that science and social studies are not left out schools are using stem lab schools are doing all types of things to make sure that students are have access to science engineering technology all of those things and so we're making sure that those things are left behind and we're not forgetting about those areas because those are important and we want kids to be able to have that opportunity to learn all those things as well I think is teaching our schools and our students and teachers the importance of all four goals so angle for for example perseverance efficacy like understanding how that is part of the bigger picture of learning content as well so we also have to remember that the things such as things that are giving

[01:08:00]
children opportunities to develop other sides of their brain is helping in these areas as well I just had some data given me today that are elevated arts schools were outperforming the other schools by up to 60% in some areas so it just is kind of a key to how are we teaching those content in other ways that might be reaching students as well but really connecting it again to go for and how we're teaching students self-efficacy perseverance what it means to fail to try again I think those are all parts of this kind of package so that we don't get to a place where we feel like we're teaching to a test just to teach for a test president if I made very quickly superintendent and hearing that teacher voice in the building of these units of study so

[01:09:00]
we are able to make sure with a certain degree of certainty that these tools connected to everything we're talking about will be used so I think that's another thing that we've been working on I need to give a great deal of credit to our curriculum and instruction department for the work that they're doing as we speak to really ensure that we had a meeting today to make sure that this very issue is hitting home and we are able to connect the use of these materials and these tools to teach a practice thank you have any additional questions so I wanted to dig a little bit deeper when you talked about using the core principles have access to the tool and and I guess the resources that we have but how does the walk through form

[01:10:00]
accessing or achieving grade-level standards so not just using the curriculum or doing activities that are deemed high quality that work yeah thank you thank you and superintendent Blakey when we look at the shift to high quality instructional materials it's ensuring that those grade level standards are embedded throughout and that is what makes it I would say different from other other curricula in the past so when you when you get we would say we get the curriculum is the standards and how we teach those things has been hit or miss through different

[01:11:00]
companies that have come in to sell us the bill of goods that this is going to do this this and this when we look at the high-quality instructional materials it's a different they're called that for a reason and again it's because they have embedded the grade level standards they have embedded differentiation strategies assessment tools their free of bias and their culturally and linguistically responsive and so when they're using those things when we adopt as a district a high-quality instructional material we are making sure that it's hitting those things and with that there might be other high-quality instructional materials that some teachers may be using that are working for kids and that's okay you know when we see that and they can show us like look I'm getting student outcomes here my kids are performing and I'm using this but

[01:12:00]
do you have to really work to ensure a high a strong tier one first teach for every kid across the district no matter what teachers they want to enhance it they go to Ovid or AP conferences they bring back these different strategies like yes let's use them so that it creates greater access and opportunity for our kids to be able to perform at nearing grade level many times we think to ourselves this is too challenging for our students and maybe it is but our kids deserve the challenge and we're there to support them and high quality instructional materials give many tools to be able to do that successfully President we recognize that high-quality instructional materials substitute

[01:13:00]
quality teaching with that said we know that high quality teaching is going to be a heck of a lot easier with high-quality instructional materials so that's just an important piece I think to help us consider his we know that we don't have a silver bullet here but we know that we have a great resource and a great support for our teachers to be able to build from to celebrate their teachings and art form and it's when we celebrate in every classroom in the district but it feels a lot better from a point of view to know that we have given everybody in the district in every classroom the same set of tools to get the job Dot

[01:14:00]
earlier when I was getting settled and but you guys had already come out of the yeah ready to go so why are we seeing a decline in the 2023 2024 category of all other students so what I can say thank you for the question does not mean that students aren't learning but that in terms of the predicted proficiency at the end of the year it implies that there was some regression period

[01:15:00]
Blakey one of the things that I want to make sure that that we're clear on is that the that the standards being taught at the beginning of the year are not the standards that are being taught throughout that period And so sometimes students have you see a decrease but the idea within the school and how schools work is they look at that those gaps to ensure that those gaps are filled so that the end of the year data shows positive so if you look at the first graders coming out this year okay where they started in their trajectory is moving forward in the second graders we can see that that process is working right and what we're doing in classrooms by looking at that mid-year data and informing the teachers informing themselves and using lessons that help support the gaps how to increase and and so we will see that in the next data point as we do this work and if I make one other thing the

[01:16:00]
if you look at the year over year you'll see that the year over year is in a positive trend so I think there was some conversation that perhaps that was a technical question so I'll give you an opportunity to make it strategic so what is the strategy that that's in place to address the circumstance will work throughout this next period of time identifying the gaps and work with the students that they might have not done so well on will increase as they move forward and so that's how the classroom teachers will work moving throughout the middle school year thank you thank you

[01:17:00]
I'm sorry if I can just take you back a little bit on that this group of students is a much smaller group of students so when there is changes we're going to see greater impact changes instead of a larger group will see smaller changes and when we look at those all other students we can see that they're beginning of your assessment data shows that they outperformed the other groups and what we know is students that begin at a higher proficiency it's much more challenging to grow in proficiency we're going to see that students who are at a lower proficiency they're going to show greater games given the work that we're doing compared to those other students thank you for that I remember a story of additional questions

[01:18:00]
is it appropriate to ask a future question yet which if any of our budgeted strategies will impact the plan for increase

[01:19:00]
I'll try to take a stab at that board member Dominguez Madam president superintendent Blakey one of the things that schools are doing right now we just started the Monday I think was the first for elementary schools for new principals there's a toll embedded into the actual budget that they are able to figure out how much of a percentage they're moving toward certain things within the goal right as a look at things like interventions or intervention specialist in their school their schools that look at that in different ways and so there are schools are able to budget that we know that a lot of our schools have intervention specialist but again going back to the doctor who is the goal here is to really make sure that we're getting the chair won the first teach right so that that we have support in the schools to make sure that we're addressing those those needs as we go through but in the classroom the teachers can do that as well it doesn't have to be able to pull up system

[01:20:00]
within the school I think you mentioned both tight loose and also bottom up strategy so you spoke to at the school level how they might be a budgeting but I think there's probably perhaps embedded in your question a question for the district level 2 in terms of what changes might be made in the budget yeah it just seems to me that we have a lot of kids that need intervention I mean I understand about the first teach but most of our Martinez Jazzy kids need that intervention assistance so how do we have do we have the resources to to meet the need Madam chair board member Dominguez and superintendent Blakey we do have the tools so

[01:21:00]
we have them in Alan map and what we what we realized is the iniquity of time built into Master schedules varied from school to school so we determined that in order to create Equitable access to that time and and that first teach that we needed to be more tight on that and so with that we you know again are looking to in bed those intervention programs so that students can get on so that teachers can have small group within their classroom to help those kids we also look budgetary at our at-risk funds as well as our family income index funds to be able to if it's an interventionist that a school wants to be able to to use their money for that if it's additional tutoring time intervention time whatever that may be they do have flexibility

[01:22:00]
to utilize those funds according to their school communities needs and it is true we look at the majority of our students are Yazzie and Martinez students so as a district we're having to be more systemic when we change things we're having to tighten up on certain things to ensure that all of those kids have that access to these resources and opportunities but yes that is very much discussion that are being had during budget call about what do you have not only that but how do you know it's working and if it's not working now what so that's that's something that's changed in the budget process a president I think that part of the issue and what I'm hearing is not necessarily the monetary it could be connected to money it's the time so time as a resource I think

[01:23:00]
what were really struggling with you heard some speakers earlier this evening too so what's what I'm concerned about and it's it could be connected to money as far as paying teachers more for the time but the time constraint of the teacher in a day-to-day has this data now sees where the students are struggling understands that they need to regroup reteach reassess but that takes time and so I think what's happening is our teachers don't have time within the day to do that lesson planning to regroup students for the next day the next week that's where the biggest constraint is I think is knowing what to do but not having the time it takes to actually implements some of these strategies in a very sorry to say strategic way because of the time it takes to individually look

[01:24:00]
like to point out that through board approval we were able to use Esther dollars with intentionality to speed up our adoption of high-quality instructional materials in a way that we would have never been able to do so we were able to get two steps ahead of the game in terms of what would have regularly been allocated via standard cuz we're always underfunded based on instructional material State allocations another thing that I would just like to mention is it's the district obligation to make sure that interventions are provided at the church street level so that is something that we take seriously and we will always meet

[01:25:00]
for sure to part of your question that you asked is you'll see at an upcoming March meeting the budget presentation that it's going to now include a report from each department on specifically how it does aligned with the goals and questions from sosg and how we're meeting them and making the improvements towards that so I think that's going to help as we move forward yay that is exciting so are there any additional questions from board members just one presentations with progress monitoring for literacy I think it was in November I can't remember the exact date but specifically to our subgroup special education in there in one of your progressing report

[01:26:00]
what was not working was the eclipse curriculum for those children what currently do we have in place that we're using in Literacy for our children with disabilities and pertaining to not using anything before how do we want to make sure that we're increasing the literacy scores because of the lack of that we would see these steps intermittently preparing us not only for our children with disabilities and gaining what they need to but I'm hoping that one that were increasing those scores and they're not decreasing so how do you expect to do that when currently based on the new curriculum if you're using something but I'm just opening that question a couple of things so one thing is

[01:27:00]
estate support for the eclipse program has been inconsistent and because of that it is also led to the question as to the future of the eclipse program in general so where does it stand are we continuing this initiative which is a state initiative State identified schools must participate in this therefore they must also participate in the professional development and the execution of the work as well as the principal coaching Etc so that's a large task to take on at the state level for APS let alone the state of New Mexico so in the case of many of our schools we have had

[01:28:00]
teachers principals approach the work in good faith but when the response or the availability of coaches and professional development and opportunities to engage in the programming isn't there that kind of cause maybe some false starts or some frustration in the part of we want to get to work with this particular student group but we're not able to based on the scarcity of support from that lends it is definitely an ongoing dialogue that we have been having with our partners at the PED to be good partners in the work that we're doing and specifically with this any final questions right so thank you to our presenters again her lots of positive feedback about tonight's presentation particularly making it a little bit

[01:29:00]
thank you for that and thank you board members for the productive conversation as well now we must vote on whether we will or will not accept this monitoring report and so as a point of clarity we're voting to accept the report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the District staff and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them so at this point I will entertain a motion for the acceptance of this monitoring report I move that we accept this monitoring report for goal one Google one thank you we have a motion from Member Dominguez and a second from member is there any additional discussion or deliberations we have a roll call the police Janelle story yes Heather benavidez

[01:30:00]
yes Courtney Jackson yes Danielle Gonzales yes so the motion carries thank you again the next item on our agenda is agenda items 6.1 consider or review and approval of the 2024 2025 instructional calendar are presenters are still Dr Shanelle Segura chief of schools and Patricia Fox the director of school schedule design and system support you have the floor all right I'm getting organized

[01:31:00]
okay Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Blakey Patty Salas is here with me she has been a right hand person she does all the master supports all the master scheduling for all of our schools for the district as well as the reporting of all this all the hours and the changes that have happened with State legislation we have worked in tandem to make sure that we are meeting the rule of the law as well as listening to community feedback which has been a lot and we're grateful for that part of it is you know we want to please everybody but we can't and in a minute of an instructional calendar for a district this large is a heavy lift and especially when legislation is up in the air and there could be

[01:32:00]
so we decided that we are going to move forward with great optimism with a calendar to present to you all so with that we're not going to go through the presentation Slide by slide as we did last year but it will be available online and you will have it in your packet so I'm going to hit on just the major changes from this year to next year if that's okay so just looking at all of our schools to double turkey Public Schools we have 141 schools 66 Elementary's 21 top elementary schools 27 middle schools 28813 comprehensive high schools and 12th non boundary magnet schools calendar with current state statute which is House Bill 130 what that did this year was increase all instructional all schools

[01:33:00]
Correctional hours for the Elementary's from 990 to 1140 and secondary schools from 1080 minimum to 1140 the state allowed us to utilize up to 60 of those hours for Teacher PD as well as parent-teacher conferences and home visits and up to 30 hours for secondary schools which was difficult but we did in bed this current school year we embedded that PD but it what we heard feedback from the community was that it was challenging because of the constant interrupted weeks so as we move forward looking at what we are doing now versus this next year's proposal currently we have one start date and two end dates because of the tops calendar next year we're going to have one start date

[01:34:00]
and one end date pops schools included this year we have the is the 8-hour Pilots last year and next year we're not going to be able to continue with it because our Sr funds are expiring in September this year we have 182 instructional days and the 11:40 minimum of forced us to have a belt to Bell situation at the elementary schools felt it harder than everybody else and so next year we are proposing $184 instructional days to allow for a built-in 15 minutes a.m. or p.m. Duty for all of our schools K-12 this year we have the 788 within the 11:40 hours as the allowable from ped this next year

[01:35:00]
we are eliminating those PD days to be able to accommodate the ampm supervision that is built into the teacher 7 hour contract for all schools K-12 this year we have two parent teacher conferences for each semester for grades K through 5 and one parent teacher conference per semester for grade 6 through 8 next year we're going to have two parent teacher conferences each semester for all schools at 12:00 this year we have 1888 teacher contract days for non-top educators and $194 contract days for top Educators next year we will have a single contract of 190 teacher contract days for all Educators this year we had a 2-day Labor Day Break

[01:36:00]
texture were proposing a one day this year we have one and a half weeks spring break next year we're proposing a one-week spring break and then this year graduation week is May 20th through 25th which is right around the corner seniors and graduation for next for this proposed calendar will be May 19th through the 23rd we went we developed a community survey to align with guardrail 4 to get community input based off the current calendar that we had and any challenges or preferences that they would have so we build an instructional calendar that not only met statue of statutory requirements of House Bill 130 but also a line with the majority vote from the community service and adheres to guardrail for

[01:37:00]
So based on community feedback requirements of House Bill 130 as well as keeping student outcomes at the Forefront of our decision-making focusing specifically on uninterrupted weeks of instruction we are adding to instructional days of 15 minute a.m. or p.m. supervision built into the contract day for student safety and supervision we are starting school in August and ending in may we are minimizing instructional disruption throughout the calendar to improve continuity of teaching and learning for increased student outcomes so from us for semester one we're going from 130 weeks to 14 uninterrupted that's an addition of 1 and 50 week in semester 1 in semester 2 we were able to go from 11 uninterrupted to 15 uninterrupted or shortening spring break to one week as well as a

[01:38:00]
we're maintaining a traditional calendar without a balanced calendar option for maintaining tops instructional hours with no additional dates we're providing for parent-teacher conferences during the school year for all schools two for each semester and at this point you will need to know that you as a board May amend our proposed calendar with that open to great thank you for the presentation and for the materials shared in advance so again really appreciate you pulling out the main points that we need to know and be thinking about and so with that I will just open it up to the full board for any questions related to the calendar

[01:39:00]
can you receive some concerns about the April days that were off but and the testing calendar and you just tell us a little bit more about that and if we can potentially fix those days that doesn't interrupt testing sure so much like creating a master schedule the master calendar is the same way you do make one change it impacts different things and so we when we looked at trying to have the two parent conference days closer to the end of the third quarter we know that we need to allow teachers five full days to be able to prepare for those conferences so it would have put our conferences on March 31st and April 1st which would have created an additional interrupted week of instruction and that was the greatest voice that we heard was our students don't have continuity

[01:40:00]
affecting their productivity in school getting them on a schedule when there's so many disruptions so doing this and aligning it to the Vernal holiday we felt would be adding that additional uninterrupted week realizing that it is a few weeks out from the end of the third quarter I think with that one when we talked about it it was like a week in between spring break so it would be spring break a week of school and then a week off again so it was trying to balance but as Dr cigarettes said we couldn't we can adjust it was just kind of weighing the different options as far as students only being back for a week for spring break and then having another interrupted week thank you are there other questions from board members yes so how

[01:41:00]
teachers have weighed in and are asking we're losing PD during the year and so how and apparently that PD serve them well especially this year as as they were getting established with wig and and sreb so what are the plans to to provide teachers with PD opportunities we consider that this was the first year that we actually did the additional days of pdk 8 because that's what statue said we were able to do with that and looking at the many weeks of interrupted instruction that

[01:42:00]
pause realized that we are looking at every teacher having the same access to Katie and teacher prep days throughout the calendar so those 6 days are still there for every teacher but then also building in those four parent-teacher conference days we felt was really important because that is a predictable time that families can schedule to be there to engage with the school and the teacher with the student and their progress so when we looked at that we figured it was a great opportunity for us to do but it created a lot of interrupted weeks of instruction to have seven additional days sprinkled in throughout the school year I do want to acknowledge our curriculum and instruction Department because they had a heavy lift in developing those days for teachers and they

[01:43:00]
a fantastic job so I think that that's great ultimately we just need more time we need we need more we need more funds we need all the stuff more but when we look at it and we heard you know what was the greatest point of frustration it was our kids don't have a full like when have they had the last full week of school there's a day off here there's a day off here my my second grader has to stay home alone because they're high schoolers at school and I don't have someone to watch him on that PD day so it was weighing all of those considerations in the development of this and you know I appreciate that I appreciate that you listen to the community voice on that because I agree with you that was the priority and if I may I think there was a another so there was a PD oh parents

[01:44:00]
Thanksgiving the full week versus only Wednesday I got mixed mixed reports right so what I heard from schools is that tradition well at least for the last 10 years Monday and Tuesday have been parent-teacher conference days for elementary school what is the attendance at those been like when do they want having off or low high temperature and that is an option when we look at those additional days we're

[01:45:00]
directly off of the majority vote of the survey but like I said you all are able to discuss and navigate an immense the calendar however you see however you see fit I think when we look if we were to back up the Parent-Teacher conferences for quarter one that puts one two three four five six weeks 6 weeks after the end of quarter one before you have parent-teacher conferences so that's we got a lot of feedback from principals and I know from teachers that stated thank you for putting them closer to the end of the quarter it makes more sense so that was the week long was just an option on here because it's something we did this year but you know there are things that we could do to change that if we were to take those two days off on the 25th and 26th we

[01:46:00]
start school on August 7th for example what is parents say though well for president and member of Dominguez it's kind of difficult to answer what Dr singer is asking for what parents said because we didn't ask the questions in a weighted this instead of this so the question I think said do you prefer a 3-day or 5:30 and then it doesn't say or do you prefer August 7th start date it's not it's not like wait the questions are weighted so it's hard for us to know what parents would prefer as one over the other because they also you know want August through May and they want school to start stop before Memorial day but then we have you can see how many days in a year that we can put in and so there's it's just juggling all of these

[01:47:00]
trying to understand when they answered the questions what the priority would be is really difficult the parent-teacher conference we've had great conversations about and I think we are committed to this next year really looking at what does parent-teacher engagement look like because it's a little archaic in the way that it's done and I don't know particularly if we look at the students we were just talking about earlier tonight in gold one are those parents going to a conference having a direct impact on the students performance they're very traditional times that we offer and to take off work for a 15-minute conference isn't really doable for a lot of people and then at the high school level school they have six or seven different teachers so it's just that we just have to look at it so I think

[01:48:00]
play the team is committed to next year looking at parent-teacher conferences in a different way but we felt like it was a little too abrupt to just say oh next year we're not doing them without having a plan of how we are going to engage parents so and I appreciate that thank you so I'm going to jump in because remember let me get your question kind of aligned with my question and your responses your responses to kind of set that up so thank you so you sort of spoke to the challenges with prioritization of the different requests from different stakeholder groups and so if you were to use as your prioritization filter student outcomes how might that change this particular issue around Thanksgiving cuz I heard you just say that it would be possible to not have the full week for Thanksgiving and start on August 7th which seems like something

[01:49:00]
one of the things that we heard is concerned about uninterrupted time in our in no school November but we know there's also the issue of School meals during that week and I think it was indicated there was a preference from parents towards having the shorter Thanksgiving week versus the preference from potentially staff to have the longer week off so given that you said there's potential for the board to amend the proposed calendar I might propose that depending on your answer around the just prioritizing student outcomes as a as our horses that we make these decisions based on right I think in response to that the uninterrupted instruction is a key factor for me in the development of this calendar so eliminating those interrupted weeks we also

[01:50:00]
hold the attendance data for the 2 days that students should be coming to school on the Thanksgiving week and it was 20% less than any other typical day and so that means there's many things to factor in with this I think we just aligned directly with what was stated from the survey and kept the uninterrupted weeks as a kind of Northstar that we needed to really aligned with as much as possible but in terms of uninterrupted instruction you would have more days on that Thanksgiving week if you have them come to school Monday Tuesday so they'd be longer of uninterrupted on the front end of that so it would create two shorter weeks right now it would we have an additional so by keeping it on the 5th we have

[01:51:00]
one uninterrupted week we can move it to the 7th but that would create I mean it's the beginning of the year so that's really that Interruption well that's the thing cuz I saw there was also feedback that teachers prefer to start later we we brought that up but it was told to us that that is not the case board member Gonzalez and members of the board I think that what you're saying is that so doctors who was talking about that and the interrupted weeks however the Thanksgiving would add two extra instructional days in November that has less instructional days because it's so choppy and this year has a mandatory election day which is hard because it's on a Tuesday so everybody gets mad that we have a Tuesday off but there's no I mean unless we change so it would be you know the conversation really and we've had

[01:52:00]
long conversations about this the staff if you shorten Thanksgiving break to 3 days the staff comes back August 1st instead of July however many days are in July I don't that my Impact Staff might feel like going back to work in August is depending going in July I don't know and but then starting and went on the Wednesday has we've heard that that's a preference just and they would have their PD days right before but again it's probably hit or miss who you if you ask a room it's probably have to say Wednesday and have to say it doesn't matter I guess that's the trade-off question for me if it is around staff preference versus feeding kids for that week I would be on team feed kids have the shorter make Thanksgiving not a full week off

[01:53:00]
is that that has been discussed and I can save from on the calendar committee as well that food services particularly as pretty I don't think she would mind the same with adamant of having school those days to be able to feed students because we see such an increase of students that need food and they wouldn't have food for that whole week where we could send them home with backpack food on that Tuesday so in terms of Robert's rules in order to make that change with the calendar with the short and Thanksgiving week but starting on August 7th or how does this work technically I don't think because you're the president you are allowed to make a motion it has to come from

[01:54:00]
weeks correct as much as possible okay and so if I'm just looking at the calendar if you take off the 25th and the 26th of November so in that creates in November only one week that is continuous and three weeks that are blocky

[01:55:00]
but it pushes back to start date by a couple of days and then you said something about the the attendance on the 25th and the 26th you guys looked at the attendance and is it lower naturally or what we looked at because parent-teacher conferences used to be backed up to that Thanksgiving break we looked at the data of the years prior to that so I asked for to go back so that we can look at the attendance to see if that had a major impact and it showed that it was about 20% left on those two days and on any other instructional day because the parent teacher conferences used to be on like the Monday and Tuesday of Thanksgiving Elementary School only right okay so the

[01:56:00]
the high schoolers in the middle schoolers were going to school or not sorry

[01:57:00]
play have spoken with our Community Partners because this this year's calendar in particular caused a lot of stress because our outside Partners if they said if we have a block of time that we can plan for to create programming for kids then that's great but with those seven additional PD days scattered throughout they were like it's a struggle to do to help you guys and in those situations so that was a factor was looking at a chunk of time where we can have programming with our Community Partners they can plan ahead they're eagerly waiting to see our calendar cuz I know like they have spring break programming and winter break programming as well but I did hear you say that

[01:58:00]
if we do parent-teacher conferences on Monday and Tuesday it'll be K through 12 is that correct there by perhaps eliminating that 20% be but it would it would take one two three four five six it would be 7 weeks before or after almost an entire quarter after the end of the first quarter before we're having a teacher conferences and that was when we first took over this process that was something that they were really happy about that we heard from teachers was like thank you for backing it up as close to the end of the quarter it makes more sense it helps with our quarterly reports

[01:59:00]
Monday and Tuesday off Wednesday Thursday Friday and start earlier August 7th August 7th right right that's what you're proposing that's what I'm saying that that was the same clarification is so so that would mean that teachers would come back on August 1st and then they would have two days of the the PD or they would have 54 days leading up students would come back on that Wednesday the 7th and we would have two days we would have more days than November

[02:00:00]
which would potentially whereas we wouldn't have an interim we would still have kind of like blocky weeks but we would have more instructional time we wouldn't have no school November we'd have no school no school no more school November and we could feed them and they would have child right or at least a couple days and tell me where is the other parent teacher that is down in April the 16th and 17th and that is something that you guys can discuss we backed it up to the Vernal holiday to create just the one week of instruction versus on the 31st of March and the 1st of April and also as superintendent Blakey stated going on spring break coming back for a week and then you're off 2 days and then go

[02:01:00]
back to school it's kind of choppy but because I think with that one it's that the teachers need 5 days and the end of the quarter is the Friday before spring break so the earliest you can have it is the 31st yeah so it's problematic just want to have a question that was not Thanksgiving related so I want to see because there is the idea that we could change that Thanksgiving weekend so I wanted to see if there's any more conversation on that and then and then we'll go to additional thanksgiving-related questions so remember this I just want to make a comment that question number six what is your preference for Thanksgiving to the community 64% of the respondents said they wanted a full week for Thanksgiving and 32% they wanted three days off and so I just want to put that out there but that that's everybody so that's a lot of stuff

[02:02:00]
Child Care programs and the way like the new proposal is so much better than last year is it was hard not navigating all of the days out and making sure there was extra staff to take care of school-age children that were in programs so looking from that particular lens I do support the 3-day Thanksgiving break you know and just seeing like the additional stressors that it does put on because you could actually absorb those easier in the summer break versus having them broken out at various times it was this year was

[02:03:00]
Thanksgiving while I'm asking this question so this is kind of relating to the hours the 180 to 184 and broken up into two sections and potentially how it will affect the belt about schedule so the first question is maybe more for clarification but we went from 180 mandated to 282 because we had to do that in order to meet the 11:40 hours is that correct we actually went from

[02:04:00]
78 right 178 to 182 because we couldn't absorb the additional hours and the teacher contract days we had to add a few days okay so we had a few days because our teacher contract is 7 hours 6 1/2 777 inclusive of a 30-minute duty-free lunch okay but like other districts around us didn't have to do that because their contract day is longer potentially I mean and I think that's something that the state maybe didn't consider as much as should have is that there's that variable from District to District regarding teacher contract day and what that looks like District to districts so we may have a district that has a 7 and a half hour comma

[02:05:00]
we have a 7:00 so districts have had to really adjust what that looks like with the new 1140 requirement and board member Jackson if I made the the mathematical part of that is that we only have that time to work with so if we were to for example shorten the day to give even more times going from 990 hours to 1140 is a huge jump and that is the constraint that you're hearing from teachers as far as this bill to spell it's because they had to have a giant jump from 5 1/2 hours that they were having to the 6th how do you know so where is secondary

[02:06:00]
high schools already were doing that length of time so Elementary have had this huge like compaction because of the hours adding the only way to fix it is to either extend the duty day longer to add not keep the instructional day the same and add the duty day longer or add more days to give the time of of being able to meet the instructional hours and we hear a lot of pushback about adding more days and going longer in the year so we're kind of stuck in this you have to at some point either add more days to accommodate or you have to increase the work day of the teachers which brings me thank you thank you to the next question then going from the 182 to the 184 which was in your presentation it builds

[02:07:00]
time for that that 0.25 bills in that 15 minutes will that help alleviate the belts about issue that is waking us I think it's a valiant effort to give that time that buffer time so that schools and their instructional councils tend to determine you know what does that look like so if I'm a teacher and I have to you know I have to leave because I have a class I have to get to after school then maybe I'm opting for the upcoming 15 minutes earlier and leaving at the Bell or maybe I'm not a morning person I'm going to come at the bill but I'll stay 15 minutes later to make sure kids are safely you know off campus so that we heard so much we continue to take care so much about the consternation of the 11:40

[02:08:00]
at the elementary pushed them to have zero flexibility and that that's requirement and that it's it's not ideal it doesn't work well it's not good practice so we tried to build that in because student safety is a big deal and getting our kids safely onto campus and safely off campus is a big deal so we tried to mitigate that we did this year and that was an 8 million dollar allocation that we put aside with our funds but the logistics of it it was really hard on teachers it was hard on principals it was hard on our finance department to be processing all of that and so we were like how do we make this more fluid something that's built in so that's where Patty I'm like Patty can you make this work can you try that and so she would do her number stuff and say yes or no or we'd have to add an additional

[02:09:00]
here we have to do this or that so that's where we feel like we are we are trying to build that into what we currently have we wish we could have an 8-hour day I know that the union wishes we could have an 8-hour day but we don't have the funding to support and that's frustrating cuz we know that that would be great and give us a lot of flexibility to do great things with our kids thank you I have another quick question just going back to the April parent teacher conferences because as you updated me I was kind of like thinking in my head what can we do and I understand the reasoning behind it I also understand the concerns because I'm just reading the amount of testing that we have going on in April and trying to figure that out so what what can we do to help planner prepare our testing department for those days that we're going to have off right through that

[02:10:00]
testing window what are some of those plans I haven't thought that far ahead as far as you know the testing testing windows are always the testing windows and so if the if it's that it's in the middle of testing season which it is we can we can shift that you guys have the option to ship those days which would create an interrupted week but we were able to capture an additional for an interrupted weeks so then we're giving up one and we have three additional and interrupted weeks and said those are things that we can wait but we like I said we can we're coming to you all with the information that we have and what we think will be best for kids in this calendar and for our communities and families because it's been a struggle with all the disruption

[02:11:00]
around those parent-teacher conferences in April if there's any conversation or agreement about moving those closer to the beginning of April instead of the 16th and 17th April testing is 16 and 17 it's right before Good Friday so there would be three days off there instead of me it's a window of time that we're giving to be able to do these assessments federal and state assessments so it's very from like March 25th of May 10th and some and then April 3rd to what was the last one April

[02:12:00]
March 25th is kickoff of testing season high school is on March March 25th of May March school day is March 21st of April 26th so when we come back from spring break its Test season regardless of yeah and one of the one of the reasons to that I'm bringing this up is because there's iStation which we've just saw about the gold monitoring you want to make sure that our students are prepared for those tests if you want to see improvements so yeah just thinking about that as well when it comes to our goals okay so I ready is April 3rd through May 23rd Ice Station

[02:13:00]
did you say PSAT is March 26th so she said PSAT is earlier in October and October would you say was March 26th in October sat is in that I say April March April March 26th April 26th and the counter side to just be aware of in this just came to me while I was thinking of how can we add another month of the year you want to you want to try to get as many school days before testing too cuz we want the kids to be there for testing but then you don't want teachers to feel like they don't have enough time to cover all the curriculum so it's that's why we need

[02:14:00]
in between February and March is that what you're saying then is it would not make sense to move the April 16th 17th conferences to the 31st and the 1st because then it breaks up time to prep for test it depends so everything is kind of like weighed in different it depends on what is weighed as a priority so if more instructional time before the test then you'd want to move the conferences later if it's that it's too choppy and they're not having time to test and I think the concerns that doctors are brought to me that some people had said is that it's like the workload is going to be really difficult to try to get the conferences done and the testing accomplished so it's weighing the options and like she said

[02:15:00]
I think that all of the all everything will work and everything won't work but what degree of flexibility is there with the scheduling of the iStation cuz I know the state tests have a specific state required window open the expertise to test earlier in the window just because of makeups because you might think we test later we might do a little bit better on test it's really hard in that window to make that happen but the whole plan in the movie support is test early so that way if kids have any challenges we can make sure they have a chance to perform so I don't see any of this is being challenged just for

[02:16:00]
and right now it's April 3rd through the 23rd as the calendar for iStation and I already know anything else is looking at the 16th and the 17th but my concern is we only have six weeks and for those who may left for school how will that be time for parents if their kids need additional

[02:17:00]
and having that communication maybe prior to testing will ensure that parents also will make sure their kids are in attendance when they know that this testing is taking place I don't know that I'm just throwing that out there now that absolutely is a consideration to discuss when when we look at those parent-teacher conference days I think it's wherever we put them there's going to be pros and cons so it just I think it's more so when we look at students who are not performing well and I think specifically at high school where they're trying to earn credits and all levels family needs to be notified at the end of the first semester if their kid has the potential of not promoting to the next grade level or being reclassified as a high schooler so hopefully that's

[02:18:00]
happening and honestly our teachers should be communicating weekly with with families that's that's what we have agreed on and it shouldn't be that a conference is going to make or break it should be just a connection an opportunity to plan to hopefully celebrate kids and their growth and to problem solve together with the with the teachers regarding next steps and what that does look like if a student is not making it progressed so those are coming thank you sorry I appreciate that there are lots of trade-offs in this conversation I know that you all have already considered all of them probably inside and out so I appreciate you bearing with us as we're trying to get up to speed and all the work that you've done over the last several months are there any additional questions from the board on the calendar or emotion

[02:19:00]
no questions but I'd like to make a motion okay hopefully I get this correct so I would like to propose a calendar including the two days in November which are November 25th and 26th as instructional days starting August 7th is there a second any additional discussions

[02:20:00]
High School calendar that we are also asking for approval on theirs is different from ours because they align with CNN's calendar they have developed it and you all have it and asking for Google yeah I just had a question on that and it's whether there was any feedback either way from any of the college and career high school Community around the proposed changes it makes sense to me but I didn't see any feedback so I'm just I think they're pretty much in alignment with what CNM is doing and so there's not too much flexibility with what they're able to do just given that schedule so I remember a store has a question in the number Jackson I have a question just about the vote because I know we voted to amend but we have to

[02:21:00]
about to approve I think we voted to approve the amended calendar okay because I'm looking here and it only says move to amend instructional calendar we don't have an approved on a diligent for the voting results so that may just be something in the diligent typing I don't know do we need to vote to approve or did we vote to approve as amended so we do then need to vote to approve them and did calendar thank you for that so let's go ahead and do that and then we'll go to College and Career so I guess I need a motion to approve the amended calendar that includes know we would so we have a motion to remember top gyro and a second from member benefits can we have a roll call vote please Janelle Striker yes

[02:22:00]
Ronaldo yes it is yes I'm sorry so College and Career was not a question that was that was that was correcting us so thank you for that but then there was a question on College and Career from Member Jackson I moved to approve the 2024 2025 Career College and Career High School academic calendar I'll second that was Athena thank you we have a motion in a second from remember the Migos with King can we have a roll call vote please in Australia yes thank you so the motion carries and our next item is agenda item 6.

[02:23:00]
which is consideration of approval to reassign an attendance area from duranes elementary school which is being converted into an Early Childhood Center to cochiti and Regional Regional Chavez Elementary schools are presenters are Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey chief operations officer Moonlighting as superintendent and because each other and Jay executive director of the capital master plan who's joining by Zoom so you have before seeing if you just talking go ahead cuz you know thank you very much for president for us to approve administrative procedure Administration attendance

[02:24:00]
the reason for this recommendation is for the current duranes elementary school attendance area to be wholly absorbed by cochiti Elementary School and Reginald Chavez Elementary School respectively the respective Middle School and High School feeder parts for both the schools will remain the same that is called City to Garfield and Valley and Reginald Chavez to Washington and Albuquerque Highway converted into an Early Childhood Center of ongoing District right size in inches and with that you do have a proposal that talks about goes into details

[02:25:00]
there's one a minor typo that needs to be amended on the first page of your the second page of your packet It should read this change will go into effect when facility upgrades begin a duranes elementary school in the fall of 2024 and it goes on to say exactly where the boundary lines will be it has maps that show what the current boundary lines are and what the boundary lines will be and we've also have two meetings with a school Community the first one in December 2023 the second one in January 2024 and after this board meeting we shall have a comprehensive meeting for all involved in March so

[02:26:00]
with that I'm open to any questions and just to add to what was presented this is a reminder for those of you on the board in the fall we presented a bid for a classroom block at cochini that's to add for the additional space for the students so this has been an ongoing proposal since last year I think the school has been well prepared for it it also is this there are seven current Early Childhood programs at Duran's that were moved their last year those programs are staying at the school during the construction it will that the other part of the school will be demolished but the newer Wing is where the current Early Childhood programs are so those will stay at Joanna's for next year it's the K-5 students who will be going to

[02:27:00]
what does that look like so typically what we'll do with the staff is Mr Suburban his team and I see the principal is is here as well we'll meet with the staff to go over where the openings would be so that they are in like a priority fire so they don't all go with the students because the school is so small one grade level has I think 15 students so it's not enough to necessarily generate a whole teacher but when we did this with LA Luce it was all of the teachers were absorbed in either MacArthur or in another school that they chose to go to any additional questions yes I'd like to ask about

[02:28:00]
what are their concerns and how those concerns been addressed so again Mr Saavedra has met with the school in this process with Joanna started last year when we first went over the schools that are kind of on the right size list and so the schools have been I mean relatively open to understanding that this is happening and the the teams that have gone to work with the schools I think do a very good job and explaining like you'll have a full-time counselor like there's more stuff to wrap around to students and in the case of durin is there's actually one of the areas in the boundary is closer to cochiti than it is to dryness so they actually will be able to walk to school

[02:29:00]
versus passing to school but so it's just dependent and this is just the beginning of the process too so what we did with la Luz which we will do with duranes as well as we have teams that go out and meet individually with the families to talk about if they want to go to coach of the original Chavez or if they want to go to another school so we can do transfers to any of the other schools that they want to choose last year most of the students did choose to go to MacArthur but we had transfers that we approved for students has priority to elementary schools in the district so we give these this these families have priority transfer when they meet with them as far as what their interest is of where they want to attend and I think currently there are six students 866 and then there's 67 preschool students give or take their little that's cool so

[02:30:00]
the school now is heavy on the Early Childhood okay okay I love you like to offer in response remember that because this is in my district I have met directly with many parents School staff the neighborhood associations the government recover whatever this area as well as hosted a community conversation about this specifically with constituents and I would say across the board I heard support and agreement and no concern so for what that's worth so are there additional questions my question to kids with disabilities and the offering of transportation and also the changing of location on those IEPs are those all going to be done in a timely manner I'm looking at the team that's looking at me

[02:31:00]
and transportation provided if need be since we heard from a prior public comment of the lack of Transportation I don't think it's on the timers on a tree which generally received

[02:32:00]
are provided Transportation through the General West general education transportation and are the IPS going to be adjusted prior to them going with the change of classroom setting and all of those areas so the service levels are generally cross cap for all of those students so they can be serviced at the different sites my concern is just the written IEP and those things being created and all so negotiated with those parents that they know specifically that those services will be met at this new school will be able to meet their needs at their at their homes thank you thank you any additional questions or emotion I moved to approve the reassign and attendance Elementary which is being converted into an Early Childhood Center to coaching and Reginald Chavez Elementary School

[02:33:00]
Dominguez is there any additional discussion all right Miss King who have a roll call vote please don't tell me a Romero if you did a Mingus yes yes so the motion carries our next item is agenda item seven Community engagement at hoc committee report and our presenters are I believe primarily Courtney Jackson the chair of the committee but also the additional committee members and general store thank you madam president yes so as you guys are aware next week we have two budget Community conversations coming up the first one is on Monday and the second one is on Wednesday and my internet is not working so I can't

[02:34:00]
anyway so what we what we need right off the bat is we need to have make sure that we have two leads at each event I am happy to be the lead at one of the Monday events but we need to get confirmation on who which at least two board members will be at those other events so lbj's so we have is on Monday and on Wednesday is LBJ pick me the lead on the second on LBJ okay I can help with the LBJ okay and I can help on Monday too either way I can be there for both nights so I'll be there on Monday either I think everyone's able to attend on Monday member of this number to and so I was going to say I am available on Wednesday too

[02:35:00]
so I just wanted to give you guys an overview of what the format is going to look like so that you're aware and we are going to continue to do our review of goals and guardrails because even though we have been talking about it at nauseam we still need to train the community on what our goals and guardrails are then we'll move to a high level discussion of the budget again we kind of get into the weeds but we need to have just kind of a very high level discussion on what the budget

[02:36:00]
is Adobe a presentation on the actual but the actual budget will look like going forward for 2425 then we're going to move into a game and the game is kind of cool if you if you haven't done it before I highly recommend but it's through ERS strategies and it's a it's like a give-and-take game and so we're going to have scenarios that the community members will will work with where will you'll have a certain dollar amount and you have things that you have to have and then you will have programs or experiences that you would really like to include but there's the discussion of what can you take and what can you give and so the purpose of that obviously is to like allow the the community to know that you know we want to do it all but we can't and I think that has been a discussion that has been ever present today as well so we'll do a game then we'll move into like kind of a-ha's of what the

[02:37:00]
Community recognized from that that interaction and then we're going to have an opportunity there will be a QR code there will be an opportunity where the community can send in feed feedback on what they would like to see in the budget because again this is kind of a two-prong this is not only a discussion to the community about how the what the budget is and how you know what the trade-offs are but we're all so using it as the opportunity for the budget committee to get feedback on the budget so in order to streamline that process for them will have a QR code where the community can send feedback on what they thought they were there will also be the availability that if they just have questions right that they want to ask that they can send that in then there will be a kind of a closing where we're just going to tie it all back right it's just a constant discussion of

[02:38:00]
why are we doing it this way well it's to align to the goals in the guardrails in the streets strategic plan so we'll close with that kind of based on the timeline we're thinking that we'll be done by around 7:30 but we've allotted time that extra half an hour to really have the board members and the budget team stick around so that we can continue those two way conversations with the community so plan to be there definitely from the 6 to 8:00 the two things that I would like to ask the invitations have gone out obviously thank you again to the communications team for constantly supporting us with all of our communication you guys should have all received a social media image that you can post and you all should have received thank you Dr Albright for doing that we are going to as a community outreach and engagement committee create

[02:39:00]
Master document that has all of our VIPs elected officials Community Partners on it that we're going to just continuously add to I think right now we have four or five different spreadsheets and it's just it's too much so we're going to have a master document and this is where I remind everybody if there are groups organizations affiliations people that you want to be at these events it is your responsibility to invite them and so on that document as we kind of created and make sure that it is useful please go in and write your name like I will contact this person or I've you know I've already reached out so we will we will streamline that but for now please start making your your reach out if you haven't done so already to make sure that people attend and then I just wanted to give you a

[02:43:00]
calendar to put together a format for how we do community engagement and to lead through the superintendent Outreach Community engagement so those activities were completed and so with that I do want to thank the committee and say that we are going to dissolve the ad hoc Community engagement and its committee and its current form after these February events we will however reconstitute it in March to continue our community engagement work and so I did ask member of water to fill in for a couple of reasons one to bring new board members into this committee as soon as possible but also because we want to explore metrics and specific targeted groups for outreach and so thinking specifically about Yazzie Martinez population but also students and families and so wanted to bring that expertise to the table so again the community engagement ad hoc committee has done awesome fabulous work and will be dissolved

[02:44:00]
