[00:06:00]
my name is Julia Himes and my daughter goes to Bandera Elementary I'm here to talk about the proposed bell schedule changes the same sleep research used to make start time changes for middle and high schools also stated that children between the ages of 6 and 12 need between 9 and 12 hours of sleep each night bandoliers proposed 7:38 a.m. start means that some of our children will need to go to bed at 6:00 p.m. while it is still light outside I connected with the school community and made a petition listing our concerns and it was signed by over 200 families the 7:30 start time for next year is detrimental also for our children safety while getting to school many students will be Crossing busy streets like Girard and Carlisle in the dark in fact sunrises

[00:07:00]
for 7:00 a.m. for 61 days next school year are Children's Health well-being and safety are being exchanged for the convenience and monetary Savings of the bus schedule and the bus driver shortage we request that Bandelier please be put on the 805 schedule for next year thank you so much thank you ma'am our next speaker is Vincent you have two minutes so is brought to my attention that we're setting a 7:30 start time but we never had any communication about this there was no meetings high school students

[00:08:00]
now I did look up some procedural directives and I do want to commend Albuquerque Public Schools for committing to make decisions using data to inform their thinking that says under these procedural directives that it's the decisions that are in the best interest of the students with an outcome-based mindset however when we looked at these studies at early start times there was three studies from the University of Kentucky which directly studied the pre and post effects of later schools school start times on elementary students for both academics and behavioral and they concluded out of 7 718 Public elementary schools they looked at performance on Saturdays test on math science social studies and as well as Behavior their conclusions I'm going to quote this one other conclusion saying middle school and high school start times at the expense of making Elementary School start times earlier might be a bad idea of finding suggest that these policy changes may be simply shift

[00:09:00]
the problems from adolescents to younger children so respectfully I'm going to request that our students start times begin at 8:05 a.m. thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Zachary creamy the CDC as well as the American Academy of sleep medicine have strongly strongly encouraged younger children get more sleep this new time will change a lot of this

[00:10:00]
I'd also like to talk about transparency a bit I know we are given opportunities to give you back in surveys and there were things that are very important to our educational system like teacher development extending the school can calendar to to release new mandates as well as changing start times for the high schools and middle schools and there was a mention of possibly changing other start times however the specifics for the start times really hear those in the surveys said it could impact those schedules now you know our school specifically started at 9:00 moving back an hour and a half is a great impact to our community and our children's specifically so I asked you strongly reconsider the 7:30 start time and possibly push forward and 805 start thanks thank you sir our next speaker

[00:11:00]
is there a Vogel with 2 minutes 7:30 a.m. start time will be walking to school in the dark most of the year which is simply Crossing dangerous streets like incredibly small bus riding population could be serviced at a slightly later time while still maintaining middle and high school road and are unable to get children to where they need to be in the early mornings and unless Duty teachers are scheduled and paid to arrive

[00:12:00]
earlier and stay later than students our campus will not be safe for children at drop off and pick up many parents who have several students will have a split between multiple school start and end times elementary school should start at 8:00 Middle School at 8:30 and high school at 9:00 and I graduated order that would be less of a burden on families we have chosen to bring our children to an APS school despite many other options we believe in this district and want to continue to support it knowing that our voice matters and is heard concerned period families asked that you move bandolier to the 823 schedule as we have in mind the best interests of our students and teachers thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Jonathan Hoffman okay well maybe it's John Hoffman sorry I think

[00:13:00]
problem with the first name on this one sorry man you are 2 minutes once you begin speaking my daughter was violently attacked by another student on May 2nd at Manzano High School this incident occurred in the gym during a PE class with at least one teacher and numerous students present this attack was witnessed by many students with no desire to step in or help a young lady who was completely helpless in fact one student was clearly made aware of this Tech in advance for the purpose of recording this premeditated act the offender in this incident received discipline that enabled her to approach my daughter 3 days later on school campus from behind grabbed her arm and want to know if she was fighting criminal charges against her

[00:14:00]
I'm interested in discussing this matter with members of the district I have been for two weeks actively calling and emailing members of the board members of the district and I have not received one phone call back from anyone I've talked to members at the the Student Services Center who assured me that they would get this to the correct people I have talked to the assistant for the assistant superintendent in charge of our school I have not heard back from him I'm disappointed that incidents like this are happening in our schools I'm disappointed that it was handled the way it was handled I am disappointed that the members of the district are not able to

[00:15:00]
the situation in the way that it should be handled and that you have to become this crazy parent to get attention in this District about situations like this students as well as staff are not safe at the Albuquerque Public Schools are school board and our district is leading the city to believe that students are safe and protected in schools and a recent decision to have zero tolerance for firearms on school campuses is a great step towards safe schools in this crazy world we're living and however what is done to send a message to students and families that violence of any kind will not be tolerated on school campuses I am aware of I'm sorry please do something to keep these kids to take over and intimidate their teachers

[00:16:00]
and their classmates in the Albuquerque Public Schools thank you ma'am our next speaker is our next speaker is Judith Siegel want to make sure the names are right Judith is your first name hello my name is Judith Siegel and my son at 10:00 a.m. for the upcoming school year I am well aware of the unfortunate bus driver shortage here in Albuquerque and Nationwide and I sincerely hope that APS is efforts to obtain more bus drivers or successful because his parents we are told that this shortage is what drives is unprecedented 7:30 start time for half of the elementary schools for some families in schools this change is not significant but for us at Bandelier this is a huge change we are now being forced to start 90 minutes early from 9 a.m.

[00:17:00]
count to 7:30 a.m. there is a disconnect between how these two Elementary groups were created and their current and proposed start times let me elaborate of the schools that will now be starting at 8:05 75% of them currently start before 8:00 a.m. of the schools that will now be starting at 7:30 56 of them currently start around 9:00 a.m. why are the schools that are already starting before 8:00 the ones that will now be starting later at 8:05 why are the schools that start closer to 9:00 the ones that will now start at 7:30 was a mistake made when creating these two groups it seems that these two groups need to be switched and that current start times should be taken into consideration it makes more sense for families and teachers that are already starting at 8:00 to start at 7:30 it does not make sense for schools to start around 9 to start at 7:30 we've already lost teachers at Bandelier because of this change in many families are now considering transferring schools in conclusion

[00:18:00]
please shift Bandelier to the 805 schedule and not the 7:30 schedule thank you for the opportunity to speak today thank you ma'am our next speaker is Lexi cazares you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking Middle School the transfers don't get to school and the kids walking from the neighborhood walks school so they have one bus that picks up kids from Mesa Del Sol and then two buses for special education I'm just requesting a later start time if possible it will be dark when a lot of kids are walking during the winter months my daughter has to cross Carly and it's already crazy with the crossing guard and daylight I realized the issues with needing to stagger the buses and being able to get everyone to school I'm hoping that the few buses that transport to Bandelier are not

[00:19:00]
and somehow could be rearranged that we could have a Later Elementary start time like 8:00 a.m. at least I've heard that some of the teachers are not that excited about the new start time and maybe looking for other job opportunities Bandelier though not an official Community School really is a community school and I'm requesting a later start time for the safety of the students and the morale of the teachers I have another emerging issue at Wilson Middle School Wilson has had an outstanding gifted and accelerated program over the past decade and I just want someone to be aware that this program seems to be disintegrating and I'm very disappointed I have an upcoming fifth grader that I was really hoping would benefit from the didactic that Wilson has offered in the past years and it seems most upcoming Bandelier 5th graders have applied for transfers to go to Jefferson I just heard someone to look into what's happening with the administration and the teachers that Wilson because it's a good school thank you thank you our next speaker is Celeste wheat you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:20:00]
504 members my name is Celeste Tweed I am the sole owner of two steps I had child care we were abruptly shut down on May 10th less than 6 hours of notice my goal for our program is No Child would be left alone or left unsaid I wanted to provide quality affordable care and sell quality and fun for all of the children which means that whatever the teachers cannot do anymore in class like when you talk about a volcano you're in my day and in our program we build the volcano we watched it up more than just the textbook that they get in class

[00:21:00]
just shut us down we followed and complied with all contracts I'm feeding here today with all of you to please give us back our program I asked you to do what is right for the children and for the community that I have served on the West Side Sunset View for the past 16 years for me my staff and the children my parents nobody is giving answers I get phone calls to this day if I have heard a child if anybody ever heard a child if a child was missed inappropriately touched or anything for just the eruption so again I'm here to plead with you to please give us our program back thank you next

[00:22:00]
speaker is Crystal blocker you have two minutes on how this affected my son the night that the program closed from what we were told was indefinitely I had to break the news to my son that night and tell him that the two steps ahead program was shut down what tears in his eyes and a Frog and his throat my son asked me am I ever going to see my two steps ahead staff members ever again the last time my son was that upset was when my grandpa his great grandfather passed away so that doesn't paint a picture in your mind I don't know what will I started a new job with the federal government I have an essential mission to meet with my job and ever since two steps

[00:23:00]
it has been shut down I've been late to my job every single day and I just can't find the next thing was oh YMCA the YMCA wanted to charge me $2,700 for 9 weeks when two steps ahead would have charged me that in 18 weeks so just so you guys know I emailed everyone and their mother at 8 p.m. I can't get an answer from anybody I called Scott Elders office I spoke with his assistant who was very rude wouldn't give me any answers I also reached out to Amanda to Belle Amanda to Bell so would refuse to speak with me or my son's dad and said that when the program was closed down parents and students were not taken into consideration that they just shut it down she said she would give us a call back and regards to what was going on with the program we have yet to hear back from anyone at APS the only one that I can ever contact that will ever pick up the phone is the last and she doesn't have answers either another thing is is

[00:24:00]
two steps ahead program being shut down my son is now at the YMCA where he's being bullied for his snack because APS promise that they would give the kids summer lunch and they took that away from the kids now my son's being bullied and older kids are taking his food and eating his food I'm sorry you going to read 2 minutes can you wrap up in one quick sentence so I have a list here of questions I would like answer I will give that to somebody I know your guys's mission is to educate and care for our students and to collaborate with the community but everyone that I spoke to at APS says to do all of those things so I hope that you guys can live up to the mission and like Celeste said No Child Left Behind I'm going to fight for my son and what's good and conducive to his education and his well-being thank you something to give to work I'll take care of that thank you for next speaker is Alexandria Gonzalez you have two

[00:25:00]
thank you I would like to First say that what I have to say and and what happened to me and my student is going to take a little longer than 2 minutes to describe so I would ask that you know there'll be another time that I can elaborate more and what happened but my daughter was also a victim of a brutal attack at school on May 2nd and he was in a bathroom stall which was the only bathroom open at the school lunch time and was supposed to be being monitored by a student a staff member and it wasn't she was repeatedly stabbed in the chest with an object that burned across her chest and was slammed into a metal desk in the middle of the hallway a duty teacher was supposed to be at when she did try to escape I was on an open line with her the entire time she was experiencing

[00:26:00]
what happened and I was unable to call anyone or anyone at the school I after reading the student disciplinary Matrix and the handbook that you guys have out front of your office out here I'm just in shock that they only consequences that are really required of any kind of these types of incidences is just student contact and a parent contact conference there is no requirement for suspension there is no requirement that says these students are going to be safe in school and honestly what you guys have underneath your bench right there that says student outcomes don't change until adult Behavior changes I believe 100% we need to start holding kids who commit these violent crimes against other students accountable and getting them out of school and suspending them for these violent acts that they commit against other students my daughter is a straight A student who never missed a day of class for five years and to watch her

[00:27:00]
play heartbreaking decision to not go to school for the rest of the school year and miss out on all her 8th grade activities and celebrations because she's in such fear of what other students will do to her is just that it's so traumatizing as a parent to experience and to be try to be strong for your child when you know that there's no real disciplinary actions that are being enforced it's you feel defeated and these students that go to these schools this is awesome I'm sorry you've come over two minutes can you please wrap up in a very quick sense that you please start enforcing rules and enforcing the safety at schools because I believe that it will help with the other incidences that we see on the media that are you know very widespread and I ask that you guys start going to disciplinary action just doesn't work and it's leading to more violence in schools thank you man our next speaker

[00:28:00]
are next speaker is Elizabeth Carter what was your name again I'm sorry I'm sorry OK Google call text message on May 10th at 12:30 program was closing period it was frustrating because I sent all of you including the starter and Monica an email regarding this issue like an hour and a half later the only one I ever received a response from was Monica and that was six days later saying that her office had nothing to do with it and that somebody in the administration was looking into what occurred

[00:29:00]
in the email I sent I asked specific questions was this due to a safety issue why was in a survey sent out or parents asked about the choices at that school I have not yet to receive a response from anybody else at 8:00 p.m. just like everybody else here seems to be a problem and getting a hold of people and I just want to say like we as parents should know why it was closed what was the reasoning behind that I had the best parents scrambling trying to find childcare for the rest of the school year we had already signed up our kids for the summer program that they offered at that school the date that they made this decision all the other community centers registration for their summer program had already been closed so our children are waiting list me personally I have a job where their flexible where I can work from home or I can take my granddaughter to work

[00:30:00]
Play Alive how to send her with family members in Espanola just because of this child care issue post covid-19 it is difficult for families to get child care and then your take away another option that we parents have their two steps that are hours are schedules they open at 6:30 a lot of us that live on that side have to cross the river to work I'm sorry I have to stop this is why I believe that 8 p.m. enrollment continues to decline because parents are getting fed up and they're moving their students out to Charter Schools private schools are out of district schools or homeschooling them and I think that we as parents who deserve to know the reason why they were closed down thank you thank you

[00:31:00]
okay next speakers are next three speakers are on Zoom Kayla or nearly as didn't respond so I'm going to move on to Janelle or astorga Janelle are you there yes I'm here okay Janelle you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking please Thank you period bye another student however our goal should not be to wait and push

[00:32:00]
another student away from their education community and resources are goals should be to Institute policies and funding to support students and teachers before it even gets to that point of helplessness and violence we need to give students a space to vocalize their questions misunderstandings feelings and vulnerabilities we need to create a better Community we're all students feel safe in their schools before situations like the surprise not after I urge you to vote no to an explosion for life policy and start voting to protect our youth by solving the root cause of the problem which is getting guns off of our streets and allowing you to feel hurt and valued in their schools I also want to reach out to all of those parents that had made statements today about violence and their schools and the board not being responsive and let them know that there are Community organizations out there who will help them one of those is youth voice is an action or via thank you so much thank you ma'am okay Kayla or nearly as did respond Taylor

[00:33:00]
are you there are you there she's not like I might be able to hear her so I'm going to go to the next person which is also on Zoo today from attending

[00:34:00]
High School is a zero-tolerance approach that does not take into account any form of restorative justice Zero Tolerance processes are proven to be ineffective in creating safer schools and only further ensure that students are not able to learn and be successful in their Endeavors After High School Learning Alliance of New Mexico and our youth program youth voices in action firmly believe that you are the solution and not the problem and continuing to criminalize young people in our city is and will continue to do more harm than good I am asking the board to please take into account that this initiative does not mean to protect our students and with the students that you represent thank you thank you ma'am okay moving on our next speaker is Deborah Modesto if two minutes once you begin speaking thank you

[00:35:00]
thank you madam chair board members and superintendent my name is Deborah I'm a volunteer with New Mexico Moms Demand Action Moms Demand Action is a nationwide gun violence prevention Movement we advocate for data-driven solutions to prevent gun violence you all have been given access to the well-researched study keeping our schools safe we gave that study to you all know where in that study does it say that a zero tolerance disciplinary practice is an answer to gun violence specifically permanent expulsion as a consequence is not a practice that reduces gun violence has it been shown to deter a student from bringing a firearm to school adults are responsible for Security Storage in New Mexico

[00:36:00]
to prevent youth from accessing Firearms the heavy lifelong consequence of permanent expulsion should not be laid on youth gratefully the aps district has agreed to add more secure firearm storage language to their student parent handbook but the district can do more to prevent gun violence and put secure firearm storage information into the hands of adult student caregivers New Mexico Moms Demand Action recently met with the superintendent and gave him several suggestions on how to do just that we need to focus on prevention thank you thank you ma'am we're going to try Kayla Walmart our family was very fortunate to have such a positive

[00:37:00]
experience at 2:00 are the staff members missed the last Miss Gabby and Miss Lizzy have established strong connections with my daughter as well as the other children and they taught them valuable life skills they treat their children with love respect and kindness and they expect that to be throughout their program however my daughter was very confused when her favorite after school activity abruptly stopped and without any explanation the sudden change left a searching and for other Alternatives within our family and we don't have family here in Albuquerque additionally we are also disappointed that the summer program was also canceled and we had other programs available but since then just like the other parent had said had been open for such a long time there was no room for my child I also reached out to APS numerous times without any call backs and I feel that APS should have been transparent with their communication

[00:38:00]
closure thank you for your time thank you ma'am OK Google But ultimately would have a negative impact on students of color students with disabilities until

[00:39:00]
search and seizure on on expulsion and suspension which are much higher for students of color particularly African-American and Native American students but as a parent I can also tell you that I've had to deal with my own fair share of mental and Behavioral Health crisis with my own student when I was in that moment I was a mess I was dealing with so much emotions and guilt and fear on about my child and where I went wrong and on top of that I was also tasked with the navigating a very under-resourced mental and Behavioral Health System in our state and our schools that was more focused on punishing my student for her mental illness then to helping her get what the help that she desperately needed and not with extremely difficult and I couldn't imagine it's a lot harder for a parent that isn't as well connected in their Community as I am so for so many of us the school is our families first line of support students and families have gone these types of mental and Behavioral Health crisis

[00:40:00]
are often just pushed out and yes it's so much easier to wash your hands with students who are problem children than it is to figure out the solution but that doesn't mean that students and families don't care and that they aren't trying to figure it out and that they don't desperately need and want to help ultimately the district should invest our good hearts and intentions our time in our resources on Solutions at prioritize prevention intervention and support services we should be thinking about building Partnerships with mental and Behavioral Health Service Providers and Community Based organizations that support students and thriving in their everyday life when incidents like this does happen we should be looking for training APS police to practice restorative justice which APS could have committed to a few years ago and it is black and we should be working with families of care for children who have mental behavior health problems not pushing them out I really I've stopped you you could wrap it up in a very quick settings please yes that was my last sentence so I really believe that we can keep students say as long as we're not pushing out students and we're making the commitment

[00:41:00]
thank you ma'am our next speaker is Kathleen Mosley Kathleen I see you there yes okay you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you for New Mexico Moms Demand Action and a retired public health nurse New Mexico ranks third among states for gun violence death rates leaving many of us feeling afraid for our safety we need to acknowledge our level of risk and fear and then take extra care to make policy decisions that are based on Research evidence and outcomes and other schools experiences rather than what makes us feel safe the American Psychological Association guides Us by recommending a comprehensive and layered approach emphasizing primary prevention anti-bullying

[00:42:00]
for firearms emphasizing parental and Community Firearms storage using our New Mexico new Benny Hargrove act secondary prevention includes our school threat assessments that link agencies tertiary prevention includes alternate discipline that continues engagement excluded children must not get lost between school law enforcement CYFD when family struggle this make schools and all of us less safe thank you very much good evening thank you so much Madam chair members of the board

[00:43:00]
what are the opportunity to speak today my name is Jonathan what is I am a product first and foremost of your school system as well as a co-founder of fight for our lives Albuquerque a student-run anti-gun violence organization and I'm also a candidate for city council district 6 I'm here today to speak briefly about proposed disciplinary policy changes regarding students bringing firearms on campus that would result in permanent student expulsion now I graduated from APS in 2020 so this debate feels pretty fresh for me I understand greatly the need for safety within our schools and I personally bore witness to aps's attempts to ensure my classmates safety over the last 15 years I've endured multiple active shooter drills multiple times over the past six years of my education but I also remember the failures of many APS disciplinary policies and how they were applied unjustly and with bias from

[00:44:00]
how many Administration it took four years of public outcry to this board to release the statistics on disciplinary action and when that happened it was only public for 2 years before you made it private again because it exposed an overwhelming disparity where black and Indigenous students were expelled at a much higher rate despite making up the lowest demographics of your school district I asked that the board reconsider this proposed disciplinary policy and cases were violence towards students is not a factor and consider a more restorative justice approach restorative justice approach to students bringing guns on campus accidentally or without desire to do harm I do not believe in lives for one understandably major mistake and since graduation I've also learned that you know it's very important that we offer Second Chances and we should do this exact same for our students thank you so much for the opportunity to speak

[00:45:00]
our next speaker is Elaine Miller after laying will be Mr Briggs and after that will be Mr Cardinal you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking my name is Elaine and I'm representing New Mexico schools and entire Community are at risk are public schools in law enforcement departments have taken a number of important steps to keep our students safe once guns are found at schools but we need to focus on prevention of a guns everywhere mine said there are so many firearm

[00:46:00]
in our community that law enforcement and our schools can't even figure out where the kids are getting them from we congratulate APS for featuring secure Firearms storage prominently in your handbook adults bear responsibility for this crisis children should not pay the penalty of permanent expulsion thank you thank you ma'am Mr bricks you have two minutes and she was

[00:47:00]
interested in the fantasy a smile on representative Thompson's face when she said my son went to Community School in 2001 that was Grant Middle School where I was honored to be the Principal for 13 years as a principal Grant we were supported by Albuquerque city council Atlantic philanthropic many issues I see parents talking about tonight increased enrollment happened at the community school started increased student learning increase test scores to safety decrease in vandalism increase cultural pride and even increasing out also boys clubs and Girls Clubs and YMCA which would provide before and after school program for kids the five year plan I already passed High School assistant Middle School football

[00:48:00]
if you had below a 2.0 or you had two more apps you on grade monitoring every two weeks basically an IEP special ed style my background special ed we monitored over 3 to 400 kids the start of the school year they were not performing academically it's in the year we had 10 that's how you build success for the high schools if not middle school kids go to high school no work ethic and no no knowledge of credits and all said as a high school students say something fresh any kind of intervention you do you continue to community school and right Middle School which

[00:53:00]
yes we're still talking about yes Cody Jackson yes you're on the Monterey Cordova yes sorry next item is consideration for approval of the joint Title 1 title 2 and title 3 Grant application for the school year for 2023 2024 this discussion action and I'll just open it up for questions of board member me to go and you had a question I do have some so I I'm not sure who will be able to answer these I know you answered most of the questions that that we had but not not everything so I mean I have a question on I think it was on page 36 of the digital so the there was a salary there of 165,000 is that just for one person for the all directors is that just one salary

[00:54:00]
I will defer this question to executive director Gormley thank you good evening board member Mueller Oregon and board members in superintendent Elder and that is one person salary that includes the 6% raise and the cost of benefits okay that is I just found some other things out about some changes to the salary bands and all that question in a minute but just kind of point out that somebody with in New Mexico that has like an MBA gets paid like $68,000 the average Masters somebody with a masters and I'm not sure what the all director has for sure a masters in the United States is like under 70,000 and in New Mexico the annual per capita

[00:55:00]
per year is about 31,000 and the median household income is $54,000 so when we're paying $165,000 for one person and that is a pretty new program right that hasn't that's only been around the all programmed last year and this year right actually that that program is how I got my administrative license and that was and I think 2013 maybe 10 years ago so that program has been around at least 10 years since 2013 so the position is a is a principal support specialist level so that position gets paid the same level as principal support specialist and it's always been at that level as far as I am aware okay that'd be good to see how that's gone up from 2013 because that is a very high salary

[00:56:00]
that is benefits in etcetera I understand that and they do have to have principal experience I understand that quite a bit over the last few years so the base is gone up just based on what we've done at the state level in terms of increasing principal pay so you have to see a commiserate raise around that I understand that I just want everybody to hear that what's the percentage of benefits what is it like 30 40% whatever 30 377.38 so then I don't know who this will go to but I know we're talking about read 180 and I looked through the numbers that you sent the read one 80 data and I know that there isn't a third party review to you know just look at the data to verify things you know that this is

[00:57:00]
working well for children and student outcomes are improving and then I see some of the blame here going on to the children it's not it's not the children because they obviously are able to learn so I looked through and I think there was the 29 schools that were listed for read 180 I think it said 80 I think 80% of them were at basic or below basic and I think there was five schools that didn't have any you know had no children there so when you're looking at a program where 80% are at basic or below basic and then you don't have an independent review and I know you said that Michelle was going to you know start looking looking at that and then just talking about all these different barriers we just want or I know I just want programs at are going to work and that you

[00:58:00]
you can prove our working for the kids and I don't want to blame on the children so I just want to know if you are when we're going to hear from Miss Drummond about some of that review of read 180 and I think it's the same thing for Math 180 support member you are going if I may just interject a little bit here I think those things will all come as part of our progress monitoring because if we're making that investment and we're paying for those then when we get our progress monitoring reports and we're looking at the literacy call how is that all tying their I think that's going to be when and how we're going to learn you're absolutely correct we've not received that kind of information in the past but like right now you know that's a it's a strategy or it's an intervention that the school district is is planning to put in place and then for us as board members when we're progress monitoring and we're looking at it if we're getting to student outcomes that we like and that we're seeing

[00:59:00]
efficacy in all of the things that they're making Investments towards how long have you been using I know it's not mandated as well alright so you don't have to use read 180 how long has that been used how many years for the schools that do use a board member Miller gone wild probably can't quantify the exact date I know that I was principal at McKinley Middle School which was in the early 2000s some thinking around 2005 and then we were using in the high schools when I was at Highland in 2010 through 1418 is I completely agree with you it's not the children of the program when I was at one of the schools I had a highly efficient highly effective 180 teacher who drove significant changes in our students and she could measure

[01:00:00]
it gives you some scores that you can actually work with and gives you a sense of where the breakdowns are coming however when the program is not being utilized as effectively then you don't see the same results this could be one of the areas and I don't know this for sure and it probably isn't but this could be an area when we were talking about training and retraining this could be an area where we have to rethink who's doing the read 180 because in many cases and at one point it was basically the only intervention we have or high school students there's very few reading interventions for us I think there's probably more now and we can consider other options that was the best of what was offered specifically for the older kids nothing

[01:01:00]
so I mean when you're saying that it was I mean I thought it had been around for a while just cuz you know I was still teaching in 2005 so I know when you're when you're looking at how much data we should have yet and you know I've asked for this and asked for it and asked for it and we haven't received it and it could have been around for you know almost 20 years so it's a data is there you just have to give it to us and I mean if it's just not working and I think we should have an idea if it's not working so I'm just going to keep on asking for it and I understand we'll do progress monitoring but over the time when we have been using read 180 we should already have data on it the way I always say about foundations we should have a lot of data so I know you kind of went through I just wanted to do with a shout out to in in math one 80 some of the schools that have such you know high growth rate I just I want to shout out to them because Wilson

[01:02:00]
sixth graders it was like $243 their growth rate Harrison 7th grade was 157 George I Sanchez 8th graders was like $163 so it's obviously working and when we're looking at where some of these schools are you know we know obviously has nothing to do with who those children who those children are so but then we look at some of the and if somebody can tell me this I don't know if you can tell me this I was looking at the average quartile growth rate for Math 180 and it said 507 can you tell me like what what how did you get to that like what is the algorithm or whatever because I couldn't figure it out so unfortunately read 180 in math 18091 I have started to have conversations around

[01:03:00]
and I've also looked at the read 180 data recently to see where we can support Improvement in that program because this was also you know because the kids were doing this or the kids weren't doing that and like superintendent said it's it's about teachers being able to fully implement it or maybe the program is just not for our students and that's okay so then the other yes we have online let's see if we lost them we have aligned executive director for Taiwan Penelope okay sorry about that so the average girl just looking at that

[01:04:00]
average across the all the students that are in the program that have licenses and utilize the program looking at that average growth what the data doesn't tell us and we're kind of working with them to try to figure out how to show this data is students that maybe exit out of the program Midway through the year so both read 180 and Math 180 or set up so that when students reach proficiency or above proficiency their exited out of the program meaning that they go back to court and the data as we see it here it doesn't capture kiddos that have exited out of the program and so we're looking at trying to figure out how to capture that information because it is a piece of data that we're missing how many students are exiting out of program and this data to be 100% transparent and honest this data was pulled on Monday which is

[01:05:00]
the same and it was sent to you on our sent in on Tuesday so I'm just trying to pull the most recent data because end of the year data is just starting to come in and flow in so just trying to pull some of the quick data that we could so that you can see there are things that we're looking at and when we look at the data sheets you know some of the things that we're looking at are students who rushed through the assessments because we don't believe that we get a true picture of students academic growth when they take less than 15 minutes to complete that and the year assessment we are looking at teacher training and implementation of superintendent Elder talked about we're looking at our sites that have high teacher implementation quality implementation at that location and the outcome the data outcomes in those locations versus locations where we don't have programs fully

[01:06:00]
implemented so those are some of the things that we've been collecting through observations or resource teacher that oversees read 180 and Math 180 has been doing observations in classrooms and we're starting to put those pictures together so that moving forward we can look at and say is it a professional development we need teachers trained we need them released from classroom so they can come train we need to ensure that the for example read 180 can be used as a core replacement and sixth grade in 9th grade are we maximizing on that so that we can get a 2-year-old or you know whatever that individual student growth could be by utilizing this program that students are given that opportunity because it is something that we are offering so just to give you that information as well thank you and I know I'm sure you're going to be working on trying to figure out how to capture what happens at mid-year so

[01:07:00]
and I'm sure that's something that you can work on and I'm sure that would improve with some of these numbers look like and getting children to not rush through that is also something that is is on the teachers to make them show how important it is so it isn't also to fall at the beach of the children and blaming them because it's it's what the teachers are expecting of them so having high expectations is really important thank you for that and then on if you could I'm not sure who can tell me about how many students do we I know here it's at about the mckinney-vento that we had the average case load for each FTE was 440 students so if we have 23 I think 23 or something like that if he is and if each FTE serving 440 students is that really that

[01:08:00]
so is that how many kids were serving 10,000 children are going to have the program director online Miss Crystal Wilson that can support this ok

[01:09:00]
the work of an Outreach worker and in collaboration with a social worker so we it's not a direct association between the number of ftes and the number of students that are served however all students are served by resource teachers who work in Outreach and they do average high numbers okay so what do you think about how many students do you think there are as of May 1st we were serving 3,649 students for this past school year okay now we still got that still I mean that makes me not really feel better but I just think that they're just has to be something else that we can do that's like 3600 of our kids that is just okay I'll just go on also with the

[01:10:00]
and this will be too I don't know if Antonio is is on about the refugee and newcomer students newcomer students that we have 700 students but we only have two and a half ftes serving 700 students I mean how are those 700 students getting what they need I just this just worries me so I don't know who's there to answer that question I just think we need more that's just my personal opinion so if there isn't anybody here to answer it's okay go ahead members of the board superintendent Elder then number that I gave you their we were at you the question was in specifically to the two points 0.53 ftes that's only the ft's that are funded out of title one dollars and so there are several other staff members that are paid out of District operational dollars from the Kellogg funding

[01:11:00]
there are there are several other staff member that worked in staff members that work directly with the refugee students and so the number that I got from Mr backhoe was you know that that they're directly working their team is directly working with about 700 students so you know and then those individual ftes are working with about 80 to 90 students on a daily basis and so they're again those 2.53 ftes are just the ones funded out of the title one dollars out of their program dollars there's like there's several of those that are working above the best okay and then on the interventionists I saw that there's five schools that fell below the 74.5% and they're going to be held harmless just for a year so then after the year are those ftes going to go away if they are not

[01:12:00]
the level they need to be at next year they will remember yes yes they will so we have a whole harmless for one year class within the title one that we can do and we were holding five schools harmless at fell below the the 50% threshold for Title 1 funding in general and we're using that same we're applying that same role to our interventionist because that way they get two years you know they'll get the two years chances if they fall back on if they fall back above that that threshold and they'll continue but if they don't come back on and then we will have to pull that FTE on schools are aware of this so that as they go into budget planning next year you know they can make those decisions for their school to you know how many how they might be able to find those okay that's just concerned you know that's all so concerning because I know interventionists do a good job and if you just fall just right below

[01:13:00]
that's concerning for the kids so then the next question I have a little bit of a follow-up is on the teacher leaders so we don't really have a lot of information from what I read here about whether or not it's having a real impact on you know improving student outcomes you know if it's really increasing effective instruction and student outcomes so what are you going to do to see if it's you know if maybe the professional development needs to be something different if it's not so what is your plan to find out if this professional development is working for the teacher leaders or not and it's affecting student outcomes so the teacher leader network is under C&I and those positions are now being aligned to our goals directly and so with things like foundations

[01:14:00]
and the math professional development that were providing throughout the year next year will be able to look at specifically which teachers attending the professional development and look at the growth of their students versus somebody who maybe didn't get a foundations kit and and go to the foundations training it's hard to measure professional development because the the use of the program is not mandatory and so the reporting of its use is is a teacher is a teacher response so are you using yes how much are you using oh I use it a lot and I know we can ask better questions and we're beginning to ask a lot more specific questions and look at student data but so that that's what we're working towards we're not there yet we have a lot of qualitative information from teachers

[01:15:00]
have seen a difference but we haven't we don't have quantitative data yet okay and then there were a couple of a couple of questions that I had asked or several more that just somehow got left off of the questions so I know you guys didn't get them until I noticed when I was looking over them that they weren't answered so if you can I know I asked questions about the the district level administrators you know and when all these positions started how it's decreased since our if you know our enrollment has gone down and how those positions are affecting student outcomes and I think you I don't know if Miss King sent those questions if we can get those answers okay cuz it's important I didn't realize that there was well I Heard it Through the Grapevine that the new salary

[01:16:00]
Ellsworth we're done so I'm going to have some questions about about what the cost for those salary bands are how much more it's adding to our APS budget and how many district administrators did this I mean I'm assuming it affected everybody at District level Administration and just what the average income you know average increase was I'm assuming it was different for different people and then I'm just if I could just get all send those as well because that was an added in there so and then I know you have the other questions about the TSI schools I went through them and just kind of wanted to have a little bit more information about the CSI and the TSI schools as well I'm making sure that they have the resources that they needed and just to see how many work Community Schools so I will the other thing that

[01:17:00]
is interesting to me is about the software decisions and I don't know who would be able to answer those questions I saw like all kinds of different software BrainPOP vocabulary.com learning A to Z so there's so many different I just there's so many things that we're doing and I know some of them are probably really working well I just really like to know how effective they are I know the answer was that this request is you know it's allowable you can spend money on software but allowable and effective for kids is just not the same thing and I want to make sure just cuz it's allowable I want to know that it's going to be effective and showing data that will prove its Effectiveness so just because it's allowable doesn't mean it's you know that it's good

[01:18:00]
is that increasing student outcomes you know you're saying it ensures you know that New Mexico PD and sure that we are in compliance compliance is also again not effective enough and then I think the last question that I have is on the English language Learners said that they could get a second device but the answer to my question as I read it is that second device that they may use is in the classrooms is that correct it's not a second device that the kids have to carry one device and then have to carry another device cuz I know it's used for different things that could use for an iPad it could be used for headphones and microphones I just don't want to have the kids going around having to carry unless it's good for them to carry two of them I'm not certain if he is online

[01:19:00]
report title 3 application I'm here I will defer this question to her thank you and good evening a board member Erica and let me get my my camera there we are the device is just used if there are supplemental computer type of items then those would be used strictly in the ELD classroom students would not be walking around with two different devices they are solely to enhance what has already been distributed at the tier one level to every student okay I just want to make sure hopefully that works for those ELD kids so I just want to make sure that I just thought if they were carrying around two devices that would be a little bit difficult yes ma'am thank you thank you madam president

[01:20:00]
Play Barbra you're a thank you I think I remember after all this time just a couple of things I mean I certainly Share Board member Mueller out of guns concern about the the just small number of resources we have for Refugee and McKinney Bento kids in the problem with the title and so we end up needing to figure out other ways of insufficient covering things from the resources we have for insufficient but I want to go back to read 180 for just a minute because I think it's I think this conversation is sort of indicative of a bigger challenge

[01:21:00]
I have a friend who used to read 180 and she did the she has been receiving accolades from all of the read 180 people from her school administrators from everyone imaginable about the growth that her students showed on read 180 well the reality is that she did the absolute minimum that she could possibly do with read 180 and had students reading real literature for the rest of the time and engaging in meaningful conversation and did not follow with Fidelity so I think we need to be careful of what data and Fidelity show us that the process of learning is much more complex and all of these things were there or read

[01:22:00]
180 or the science of reading materials all of these things that we get are tools and if we do not give teachers the ability to figure out how to use those tools for the students they have it's all for naught there is not a curricular Silver Bullet and I have been listening a whole lot to some of the science of reading material looking at it it is old stuff it is not brand new it's stuff that we've known for a long time just like phonics and all of those things we know it's a matter of how do we Implement and that goes back to I mean we seem to be and I absolutely agree that it is not students to blame but we seem to be very ready to blame teachers for what they do or don't do

[01:23:00]
what what their lacks or or divergences from Fidelity are but if we do not set up a system respects teachers and gives teachers time to figure out how to use any of these tools well with the students they have there is not a silver bullet and I just I think we need to be really cautious when we look at it diving deeper and not just not just doing The Superficial 10 minutes or not but what's really going on and it's harder the methodology of non-existent but if we are going to serve our students well I think we need to build deeper into what the conditions are that are making some classrooms really

[01:24:00]
truly successful in which classrooms aren't and then not to shame blame or fire teachers but how do we make sure that every student in every classroom gets from their teacher what they need and that's a much more difficult and complex process but it's one that as we want you further to student outcome Focus governance I think it's something that we need to keep on the front burner all the time thank you bored member any other comments on this section or questions do I have a motion see I will move to approve the joint title on title to and title 3 Grant application for the school year 2023 2024 I will second this is Daniel thank you I have a roll call

[01:25:00]
Amelia Arizona I'm going to vote Yes but I want to make sure it's with the promise that I will get the answers to my questions Danielle Gonzalez Peterson yes the top of your email yes yes yes yes yes and this is consideration for acceptance of the resolution and Proclamation calling for a regular school district election on November 7th 2023 Alex school board members and vote on the public school Capital Improvement tax personal we can go into discussion I will move for approval of special issues 68 consideration for a sentence of the resolution calling for a regular school district election on

[01:26:00]
372023 electrical board members and vote on the public school Capital Improvements thank you Crystal all second it okay so we have motion from Gonzales and second from Tapia Romero is there any discussion I've got I've got a question for instance

[01:27:00]
language that includes instant runoff and right now by having multiple multiple candidates in any given race we can end up with someone with far less than a majority being elected to the board if the vote is split an inexpensive and straightforward way of addressing that is by having instant runoff and I'm curious about what what is it in our ability and sorry for background noise Mr okay thank you Mr Melendez for being

[01:28:00]
you have the floor president Montoya Court of a board members and Barbara Peterson board member Peterson the statute in question gives municipalities the opportunity to have their instant runoff the statute does not include school districts and we have double-checked that so school districts are not eligible to have a runoff the statute would have to be amended to provide for that provision that is strictly related to municipalities and that is defined in the Statue I think it's something that we should look at I think it would make for just more democratic party if if all members were like

[01:29:00]
and it would be more straightforward process thank you board member Peterson and thank you Mr Melendez for being here to to respond to that are there any other questions on the resolution already there is a school board election on November 7th for districts one two and four sadly two of our board members president are not seeking re-election you will be missed ordering for a third term in Good Luck candidates will run and voters will vote within the boundaries of the new school board districts approved through the redistricting process last fall District Maps or posted on the aps website along with additional information on the school board election and it reminders

[01:30:00]
is it in running for the school board must declare candidacy on Tuesday August 29th at the Bernalillo County Clerk's Office in addition to choosing three board members voters will be asked to reauthorize the existing two male Capital Improvement tax which helps pay for such things as maintenance security operations technology and musical instruments approval of the SB 9 tax would provide Capital revenue for the district through 2030 and I do have dot thank you for attending tonight thank you for your patience thank you for your statement about that is there any are there any questions so I'm actually just going to read it if

[01:31:00]
you don't mind but there are some questions in there that I think bear needing to be answered and this is in regards to the capital Improvement tax so okay the voters just approved approximately 230 million of capital funding in the fall of 2021 and additional funding with the mill Levy in Fall 2020 the enrollment at APS has been declining significantly every year for more than the past 10 years I believe their needs to be a moratorium on any additional property tax request until a thorough audit of all School Improvement needs can be re-evaluated and reprioritize based on the current enrollment decline so basically I think that the question based on you know lacking enrollment our current capital funding why are we asking for

[01:32:00]
why are we continuing to ask for the 2% or two to milk and I'm sorry I didn't send this in sooner I just got it but I thought it was a good question Montoya Cordova a members of the board member Jackson the request is actually to find what we use the funds for to keep as many operational funds to the classroom so these funds pay for basically all of our maintenance and operations all musical instruments technology and if we we even if we downsize as we're working on in the right size committee we still have current property that we would have to maintain and make sure that we're living up to providing adequate learning spaces for children so we wouldn't be we wouldn't be in this situation where we would be closing all of our schools and if we didn't continue the tax we wouldn't have any funds so they're so we would be

[01:33:00]
the operating with $0 for any maintenance and operations or improvements on our current facilities what's our current unmet need in terms of I know we have like a lot of unmeet repairs pieces that we need to do right so I mean I'm thinking obviously agree with the footprint you know we've got a lot of schools but even so I'm just thinking in my district alone the unmet need of just restoring classrooms so that they could be places where kids want to go and parents want to be seen its like but what's the need so what president the need for the district is about 7 billion dollars given we have

[01:34:00]
we brought the average age of our buildings down from 70 to about 49 years but the unmet need to bring everything up to standard including Technologies about 7 billion dollars thank you and raising Capital the way that we do is very typical of Royal urban districts correct I mean not but urban districts yes and we do it at a rate of about a billion dollars every 6 years old and without requesting when we go out to vote is it lower

[01:35:00]
is it medium or where are we at in terms of the amount that we request so it depends on the 10-year sale in some districts the property taxes pay also for operations and salaries but typically if you go on a metric based on greater City Schools we are currently funded I think up to I think something like 20% of our capacity so basically when the middle and lower in terms of the tax rates we haven't raised our tax rate since 2006 thank you just for clarification this is what's going on the ballet is request for the military and so then

[01:36:00]
how much do you think that going to save the district by buy a right-sizing program initiative in terms of the initiative of right-sizing depending on how far the board goes and obviously it'll take a few years for it to come into fruition we will cut the rate at which we have to spend in terms of bringing everybody up to equity it wouldn't necessarily reduce our obligations because it takes time there's issues of inflation and we shall be bringing an update report to the board giving that the longer we take in terms of a capital of obligation the price goes up because

[01:37:00]
just between 2020 and now price of Maintenance and construction has almost doubled per square foot for various reasons some of it being inflation some of it being covid some of it being supply chain issues and so this way we just hold in terms of rate will not necessarily bring it down substantially unless you close down half the district and even then maybe we'll bring it down by Billy thank you so then I know that there have been if I'm sure that you have kept track of this but there are other districts that have special elections already and there are I

[01:38:00]
a lot of them are many of them that it didn't their military didn't pass so they have another chance like we we if ours didn't we still are okay until 2025 is that correct so we'd have a chance to redo it because these are going these districts where it failed are going to have to have to do it I guess in November so about number of 2025

[01:39:00]
fail in November that's a concern so if you could just answer that that's my concern board president if the citizens turn us down November 7th the district through the board making a decision could ask the voters again in February of 2024 for an all-male in ballet vote to impose or continuing to text February yes okay so do you do you know I don't know you

[01:40:00]
how many districts did their mail in how many failed that did their mail in their special election by mail I mean I've heard of I think four but I don't know how many had one I think I I do not know the answer to that question I I only know of two districts that I worked on it would be good to kind of know what I think a couple I know I'm pretty sure it was Alamogordo and I can't remember another one that they did speak up to make sure that we tried to to learn from them maybe what we need to make sure that we do that maybe they didn't do and to the ones that did pass it what did they do well and there was some things that I heard that they

[01:41:00]
they would have done so I think that'd be good information to to get to learn from them and then I just always want to say is I know people are always going or you know this we say it's not going to increase our property taxes which it doesn't so that everybody kind of understands when they see their property taxes go up it doesn't have to do with this it has to do with the fact that you have this mandated 3% assessment values that go up and because of that your property taxes do go up so but it doesn't have to do with this and I just want everybody to hear that it's because the SS values just always go up so thank you board member Peterson you had your hand up and took it down just real quickly I look forward to seeing the plan for communication

[01:42:00]
for sharing this information with the community because you know the mill Levy in a lot of ways is easier to pass than the bond issues even because it does go to very immediate things like every time every time someone complains about HVAC we need to remind them about the mill Levy and the importance of it or you know musical instruments or software so all of those things I think we've done a really good job and I'd like to commend Casino

[01:43:00]
if we have to go to a February mail-in what does that cost us a lot last night and you don't want to go to a male inexpensive yeah right any other comments questions and a second on this yes Danielle Gonzales yes yes

[01:44:00]
yes Brittany Jackson yes Yolanda Montoya Cortes yes okay so we're moving on to our most important part of our agenda student outcomes Focus governance so we're going to have a presentation of updated student outcomes Focus interim goals and guardrails this is just a discussion and superintendent has the floor on this we did receive some information it was at the Dyess just today which makes me a little nervous because we haven't had enough time to to review so I just want to remind board members let's use this time to to listen to where you know where the updates are what they're planning to do on interims and then what I'm going to what I'm going to suggest is because there's I just have a feeling you know this is a process so let's not process on the Asus I think what we could do is let's ask

[01:45:00]
maybe you know one I might call on each person to ask like one or two very strategic questions and if we don't get there we don't have that there's nothing wrong with us going ahead and writing some questions and sending those in and we can get some information back because I think that would be a better way for us to digest this and plus we can always put this back on the agenda once we've got some some feedback and some some questions if we you know if there's still some questions answered but let's just like listen for this tonight and let's try to digest it that way I mean how do you feel about that I think that's a might be a better strategy for us so it doesn't put us all in a we're not going to solve it all immediately but we might have some questions that we could just send in is that fair I would say we would welcome that and if you want to put a little stall on this week we make the decision on this one I understand but we were not going to be able to present

[01:46:00]
June 21st and so that's and we promise to bring these by June I have had available resources offered to me that we've been trying to follow up on I've had some limited success but recently some of those resources have become more available at this time doesn't mean we can't do it two years now just means right now

[01:47:00]
thank you look at this as we go through the the goals I don't think much has changed in terms of the interim goals on goal one or two this pattern that you see sorry is pattern that you see kind of measured it follows a pattern that most every other District that's doing this type of work is following and it made sense to the supper team and the way they're looking at it will look at the interim assessments that are being given and we're looking at it District wide we know damn well there's going to be some changes across zones and so I'll have to do some some thought on that in terms of the monitoring pretty pretty pretty pretty

[01:48:00]
Play Ozzie Martinez subgroups and including the African Americans and we're looking to populate that first set of data pretty quickly as we complete the school year we're just waiting for the end of your day to fully populate so we can put something other than x in there but it's coming shortly so you may notice a trend here of a very different group of people here in the in the meeting we are very light at the senior leadership this week so I should have introduced him but I know y'all and in different ways and I will this is extremely good at what he does and I was on ceiling yesterday and he talked to me so I was comfortable with the language so looking at Gold 3 I think one of the issues that we have last time we came up

[01:49:00]
when is the high school students who drop out of school will decrease and the sapper Team feels pretty strongly that this is something that should be included and you know we look at if you look at the other ones we're looking at graduates right so really only looking at 80% of our class and sappers saying we need to also be looking at the other side of this so that we have a Vibe on who were missing and why we're losing them and how do we get them so that we can do how can we increase these numbers if we don't look at at least these kids as well and I don't know if you want to add to that or not cuz I was like that and he said no here's what it does for us okay so we're going to keep that looking overall at the percentage of high school students enrolled in these programs over three years

[01:50:00]
one of the points that was made I think board member Jackson was you that as we look at zones again we're going to see differences we're going to see in certain zones a higher number of AP courses and other zones we're going to see higher number bilingual seals and we know we're pretty much know where on industry certification at this time it's going to grow so that's sort of the disaggregation that will be bringing forward saying okay how are we going to work these resources to grow violent will programs and one of the concerns you've heard is it recently don't have a bilingual schools we don't have enough teachers right and so this is something we're trying to address and we're looking at a recruitment efforts on how do we grow that that work force through the work we're doing with the university we're trying to grow our own but it's still limited so and then finally on on that goal I think

[01:51:00]
we look specifically at 11th graders because that's where we're going to see the most growth that they take in 10th Grade some of them will take AP World History That's a classic and taking a couple of the real advanced math kids of course will be in in those courses but really it's not till 11:30 that we see the big burst of growth in April and that's when I be starts at Sandia and and bilingual still really kicks up at those last two years so at 11th grade is a key grade then looking at golf 4 we have are in process of finalizing deal for Panorama this year is a designer we looked at the Washington DC schools they created a survey that pretty much mirrors this language and so we

[01:52:00]
there was some concern about that we've now moved to 5th 8th and 10th rationale being 5th and 8th are transition years they're leaving Schools they're going to have a very different perspective and you know when you ask people are just getting there it's rather difficult to say you know how comfortable they are and the 10th graders they've got enough high school but they're not at the end so if there is an issue if there's really a problem in the high school we thought that was a great night and give us the opportunity if there's an invention that need to occur because they know what one thing I know about sophomores is it think they know everything about high school and they feel very very comfortable in their own skin because they've been there but there's still two years right there's still time to intervene should we need to so those are the interim goals as they sent today and if you want to ask a couple probing

[01:53:00]
in the interim guard rails for those are there any questions on the goals right now what you're seeing as a strategic question or go ahead remember my question is essentially could you answer the questions that we were told to ask you about the cancel great City Schools so what is the degree of correlation between the interim and gold metric I'm asking like could this be something that you can prepare as follow up there's one two three four five six seven eight questions Jim talking about it's in the he doesn't but I do okay on page six pages 638 that they provided for us and January yeah we have those I know that I would say that we worked hard

[01:54:00]
to try to align these things so that it does match what one the goal is asking and two that measures as much of what the student performance is I don't know that we've done the actual map to give you the 5 or the 23 or the 4 correctionville

[01:55:00]
show me the ability to change behavior that will change the outcomes and so like for instance like with the high school graduate one that's why we were strong about keeping in the idea of the looking at the Dropout rates with the idea that we're looking at the numerator as well as the denominator right so if we want to have more students demonstrate these things we want to have more students get to the end so that our denominator is growing so the number of kids are looking at and our schools most of our kids that do have struggled they tend to drop out after 9:00 period so if we had changed these internal goals we thought the correlation would not be as strong because you would be missing out a lot of those kids only looking at kind of more of a profile of statement that matches up to the values of our community that we that we listened to the same thing of course with the two with the gold wanted they are on the correlations on those range

[01:56:00]
statistic is between 0.6 and 1.8 if you know the number one being perfect so they're they're strongly correlated just because they're both measuring similar Concepts and then the Gulf War is the only one that's obviously been pulled by the consequences if that's the only one that's hard because it's students recording that they they feel that they can do these things or that they're confident that they have the ability to act in different situations but it's not necessarily a demonstration so that's cool for is only one that has that that kind of the questionnaire about what the students can demonstrate what they can do or not do so it does thank you any other questions or what will do is just like we can just email all the other questions and maybe just connect it to the sosg piece but I mean I think tonight is just an opportunity for us to start to wrap our heads around

[01:57:00]
180 and even potentially as the new MRI and CSI schools you know get introduced or get determined and I think the question for me is what about the others what about you know you mentioned about the zones what about how are we going to monitor how are we going to make sure that the others that are not specifically addressed within within these goals how are we going to determine make sure that they are also being monitored well we align the guardrails

[01:58:00]
goals to the or to the goals I mean none of that data will all that data is available but in terms of what we're recording on we needed to report on what the goal read right so when it says everybody so I think what made me think about this was you know earlier today we were just discussing about read 180 and we need data and we need to you know make sure that that this is being evaluated so it brought a question to mind if if read 180 from what I understand is the secondary program that we're using it's not going to address third grade so how is that going to be how is how were the kids that are not specific to this all going to be monitored so we

[01:59:00]
I think reality is is you all have asked us to focus on four goals and you've asked us to align resources to those four goals okay to me bees bees needs to an extent you are correct that there will be a lesson of our ability to support or to maintain you know full observation on some of these other programs Albert it's sort of like I would say we should feed kids we're still going to feed kids right we're not going to stop teaching reading after 3rd grade they will still be assessed they will still be passing and we will still look at those rates I mean we talked last time and this is where actually

[02:00:00]
Danielle board member Gonzalez asked the question last night about correlation rates because we wanted to do something with failure rates in Algebra 1 to see how that pertained to the increase in AP and the question was what does that tell us and what's the correlation we got it didn't seem to be real high so I'm kind of dropped it you know but we're still going to be doing research he would love it if I could tell him you only have to do this but the federal government in the state government require much more data than that all the special ed reporting continues and all that data will still be available and I think it will most likely have to be things that we bring in to these discussions because for example if I come in and say you know what else is going better and they really improved you say oh great I don't go well actually they did really great too and the gap

[02:01:00]
you're going to have to have that comparative data so I think it will be a component of the discussion one of the things we're learning on the for example on the monitoring calendar that we developed it did not have all the information that Council suggested and I think okay well adding some things to that and I think will happen is over time as we do a couple is like in July we're supposed to come forward and talk about College and Career Readiness and that's kind of our practice run my thought is that as this goes on over time we'll get more sophisticated and we'll have a better sense of exactly what you're looking for something or limited because we just want 100

[02:02:00]
location of percolated up of on paper this is the only thing that you're technically right we're supposed to be monitoring but through conversation there's so many other things that need to be monitored so we have to be aware of that the dental doesn't go away they're not in the Martinez but we have to know how they're doing you know the state reporting does not just say that we have to focus on that and this is quite frankly we are one of the few districts that is said we are going to focus on these groups publicly and put it in writing I just have one more question and I'm sure I can ask something else in the guardrail and just a quick question three point three is the percentage of grade 11 students earn credit and at least one

[02:03:00]
but the goal is for two is that because the one is an assumption that if they do one they'll do a second one in their senior year and board member Jackson Tennessee

[02:04:00]
play access to what they need for keeping them there we're making sure they're engaged or making sure they make it to these classes they're getting through their core courses when they get to grade 11 we're seeing okay now you've been there are you starting to make progress towards this and that's like like exactly what you said is that we're looking our goal is for you to do two or more but so do you have one right now so the idea there is we're just we're trying to kind of progress monitor them through so that when they're getting to the 11th and 12th grade year they're starting to think about what's next and so that's why we did have the one in there is our kind of our way of our chicken or to see are they going to then get a second one during that 123 year because we don't see them doing that in 11th grade year then we know we have a problem in terms of reaching the 12th grade Target so you're right that's a logic that we're following okay thank you I won't be great that if that progress monitoring report comes in and they're showing us this and we actually have a percentage of the 11th graders that are actually doing two or more by that point I mean that's

[02:05:00]
possibility so I think you know we're just setting at least that bench for at least the one but I think we're going to be able to see some some flows in terms of how it's going to go because but I think also looking at it by zones and who's being impacted more right what students are more likely to do that versus those that are not then it's going to come back to the strategy around if students in zone two are not you know at that level or their lower why you know what is it is it access but is it also Readiness to to go into to those courses so so I'm excited about just looking at the data because when we we talked about it but this is going to be able to I think the progress monitoring what I've noticed from other school districts as I've watched them as they're going through progress monitoring it's absolutely what the superintendent is saying first ones are like they're pretty rough

[02:06:00]
but it's by better questions from the board to that it also prepares the next progress monitoring report so everybody is in a continuous Improvement Loop not just the district but also the board well and it kind of thinking about it every time we do data presentations like that we include all groups and I'm pretty sure that the monitoring all the groups and just so you know like the aps dashboard it all the groups so I won't change it all but the girl like superintendent say we're because of your goals will be making sure that we're really focusing on the student groups that you've identified and then all so I will tell you the work that we're doing and also complaining it's also going to that next level so now that we have the grade three goal and the grade

[02:07:00]
it was just more than just want to make sure you get the full picture so we're trying to go to the next level so this is really helping us do that sounds like it's very exciting any other questions that we can jump into the guard rails and I just asked a couple of just to make sure I heard you correctly so the data on all groups is still going to be available and reported on it just won't be monitored like we won't it won't be part of our monitoring calendar is that correct it'll be on the week it'll be on the monetary report and then I I think I wrote this down wrong and I thought that I heard somebody say that this could lessen our ability to monitor

[02:08:00]
what I mean is if you are directing the district to focus on four goals and you want us to see you want to see things happen it means we're going to have to read every text and all this extra money that's coming and I showed you at 100 million dollars more we have almost nothing to play with because it's all spent already right materials utilities eat it up so we're going to have to take what resources we have and refocus them so that may mean that some programs are going to like can you keep saying well what about this what if this program doesn't prove to be effective maybe that program needs to go by the wayside

[02:09:00]
we may have to reduce our our focus on certain programs so that we can take those resources and apply them to these selected goals that's that's how it works because they're not going to give me more money and say Here's your money for your goals and then and this is just everybody knows what I already think about the gold and it should include every single child and your kind of telling me we're still going to be reporting on them so that's not going to go away so that's that's a good thing though I don't think it should be racist at all the thing that I hope that you're going to be watching is let's say you have a group that is not included here on one or two and you see

[02:10:00]
you know their profession is the rates are starting to to decrease we don't think that will happen but if it does happen what do you think what kind of I mean would you have to Pivot what what would you do there will be talking to you in these monitoring progress meetings and will be showing that to you and say look this is happening what do you think I mean what are does we can do this but this is your opportunity to provide feedback and thought I don't really believe that certain groups are going to suffer under this I really don't there are inherent advantages and certain groups have that are not going to go away and which means that that group called advantages that you call that means a gap could then go cuz they're still going to have the advantages

[02:11:00]
that's what I'm saying that's what kind of have to show you everybody because if I say hey these guys have grown but there's other groups grown more we don't know why we're going to have to figure that out and if other groups started to slip it would certainly be cause for concern and and some reaction but we don't see that traditionally that would be unusual okay thank you okay great any other comments let's move on to the to the guard rails okay so these are the really really really really really really really hard ones the ones that I've been calling people around the country and asking for some support I will continue to talk to these people and there may be times when you come forward and say more modification and you guys are going to have apparently some time to send feedback

[02:12:00]
School in our community based wrap around Sports we're going to try to increase those and we'll get our ex number in there and then we'll try to figure out why will be you know the percentage of students have access to sel program and I kind of wonder about this one maybe we can put this correctly I almost wonder if it should be a consistent Seal program instead of just seal programming because we've got SEL programming all across the district but what has happened is it's in Pockets so Avid does some of it I think this afternoon cuz I had a very wonderful special ed teacher at a small Elementary School send me a book period

[02:13:00]
good self-awareness and standing up for themselves and they had great stories and it was hard because I think it's probably 3rd grade special needs but it was a really interesting thing it's just people out there that have worked this into their curriculum I think we're really looking as this more consistent program so now we have Panorama what is that going to do for us how are we going to work that consistently across the district and then one last week we really were trying to make sure things were working we have invested a lot of money into our attendance this one took a while to figure out but we believe we can chart the average daily attendance rate but by September 30th will have identified a group of students on attendance and then we can charge them and see if that intervention is actually

[02:14:00]
and we'll see if their daily attendance rates improved I got stuck on this one for a while because if you're a kid who gets called then you have 15 absences by September 30th and the interventions going in the rest of the year you only have five wow you really improved except the way I measured it as you have 20 but absence is right so it didn't work for a long time but once we discovered that their tracking attendance rate and get a sense of that I think this will be a better measure of a program that is really trying to make sure that we are providing services that work for our kids as far as the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated and equitably we are going to continue to look at the fully staffed priority schools you mentioned the MRIs really trying to focus on making sure they start the year with not Nine's substitutes this Garfield

[02:15:00]
0% of this now and in 3 years we hope to be really 100% in 30 years but we know that we've got that in the Strategic plan exactly how that breaks down and we can be reporting on that too pretty regularly so you'll know the progress that we're making as far as you know getting that that process in place and then again and we'll talk about the resources and the same from the finance office they are concerned there are often times unspent unrestricted and operational funds and we're really going to be pushing on people to spend that money and not spend it on paper we've had this conversation because they want to get through the summer and they want to be prepped up for you know next year but really going to work with them on why that's a bad idea

[02:16:00]
number three so this one is is the next three are really fairly difficult because to know that we're doing it requires us to go in and look and so we sort of copied the model of the organizational diagnostic that attended a lot of classroom visits and we're going to reform those visits to meet this so are they using the instructional materials is there evidence that they're using we know that it at 30% so we started at 30% so we're going to try to push that to 100% in 3 years some of that goes with the training so it may not be a good job this year because we've got people like I can't use that stuff I know the old stuff you know I'm not sure we'll push on that Noodle and look

[02:17:00]
it won't be a 100% of the classrooms we look in we will look and selected classrooms because that's how it happens you go into 15 classes in the school and got five or six people looking and then somebody sees it there it is number two is really looking for presenting grade level standard work that was a big concern and how do I make sure we're getting the right side make sure it's aligned with the grade level standard that's a little harder you know because we're not all not all The Observers are experts on second grade show us your teaching here I will tell you that sometimes you can walk into a room and you go this is just obvious you know but sometimes it's a little little we have the tools to figure it out and then finally one of the things we measure

[02:18:00]
we were in the observation already is they they check the box in the observation as far as use of differentiation techniques and one of the higher ratings is innovating that they're not only just doing differentiation but they're doing it well this is something we can track in something that we can can look at we don't have the original number here but it is something we can look at doesn't identify anybody probably won't break it down by school and like that but we might do it internally just so we can help with our zone is Associates in the work they do with the schools but I think it's an interesting box that we can look at getting into the non-exclusively legal guardian student and Community voice I really did think having The Advisory Group for the superintendent was useful I think of the next couple years we can start to expand that they're not interested in meeting

[02:19:00]
all the time but I think four times a year seems a reasonable amount to build to benefit that turns out to be too much then maybe we talk about three times a year and then we'll figure that out if it's not enough then we can we can talk but I do think continuing with many of the people that you recommended or new people you know cuz some of those people didn't enjoy the experience or they really enjoyed the experience and why is it moved on you know I see that as a that was valuable for me I learned a lot from that group and they were very helpful and one of the things that engagement School operations so right now about 70% of the kids school staff considered their opinion we'd like to see that rise to at least 8 5 5

[02:20:00]
right now it's about 20% of our population so we're going to see if we can build that up to about or never going to get to 100% people just full stop sending me stuff I don't want to hear any more from you and so It's Tricky little naturally happen I think you'll see more people saying I'm not considered the numbers of parents that are responding so trying to drive it up at the same time is going to be a challenge so we're implementing programs without staff boys with high quality professional I can come and tell you we did this and here's how we did it I don't know how I write that as a guardrail so we are talking Mr West bills he can design a survey that will help us we're going to focus on

[02:21:00]
not very specific groups percentage of Staff who report receiving adequate professional development for new instructional programs they will increase from 0 and 0 because we're not asking now it's not that we don't get it but I'll try to get that up to 70% percentage of the other one was the percentage of Staff who report receiving adequate District communication regarding the Strategic plan so that people know where we are throughout the year and are aware of what the monitoring progress reports are saying we're really working on how do we push this plan into our departments the schools are listening I get to speak to the schools pretty regularly I have a very important we're going to start surveying them

[02:22:00]
and say did you feel you got input on site-based decision I hope people understand that doesn't mean that was always agreed with I think that's where people struggle I said this but we didn't do it right cuz the boat went the other way right but you did get to put in so that's what we're hoping will help us and so those are the guard rails as of today oh God I'm so cold I can't even think right now I'm trying to warm up any comments stop thank you talked about earlier is like I mean I think we're going to have some questions we could get those in and then we can get some responses back is there like a specific question and anybody would like to ask right now on the Internet or do you want to just

[02:23:00]
Holden Holt we can process I'm a processor I have to I have to think about it did we lose Barbara is she still Barbara and Crystal are you guys still are you still there okay I'm still here I am for processing period have some opportunity for us to think back but it's thank you so much for presenting them tonight so that we can kind of helps us to get our juices flowing as well so all right well that was easy I think so I'm going to damn if it was easy process was was incredibly I'm consuming and it was difficult but I really appreciate look

[02:24:00]
here are some resources think about these people and and it helped it got us further along and we did get some coaching from Ashley yesterday actually that broke a log Jam on at least three of these so that was useful as well so like I said when I when you say you want time to think about it I'm fine I'm fine because it's hard it's really really good will exist well thank you all right so the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday June 21st 2023 at 5 p.m. at the in the John Miller community board room of the Alison Bruce King educational complex 6400

[02:25:00]
play Uptown Boulevard or virtually at aps.edu and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on Thursday June 22nd 2023 at noon in the delayo Martin community room of the Alison Bruce King educational complex our next item is consideration for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section 10 Dash 15 dash 1 H2 to discuss a Personnel matter the superintendent's contract so do I have a motion I moved to convene to Executive session as authorized by public meetings act section 10151 H2 to discuss the personal matter the superintendent's contract I second okay so we had a board member Jackson and Gonzalez I was going to call you Dominguez to some times like that please

[02:26:00]
yes so I asked the board if you need to take a quick break we can get this we've been at the Dias for a while so we'll get the folks in the room and I'm going to start a little glow actually I'll need you to leave please thank you
