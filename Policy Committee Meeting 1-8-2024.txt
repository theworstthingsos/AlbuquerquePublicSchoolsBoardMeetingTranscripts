[00:03:00]
coach Ashley pause from student outcomes Focus governance welcome back I want to apologize 32 hours on of airplane travel has me a little a little over clubs but we are going to move through this and have a great conversation and especially with our new trustees at Walmart so I want to First clarify that tonight's conversation is about evaluate your future superintendent

[00:04:00]
the conversation about that the board has had with superintendent Elder for this year's evaluation is one that you probably should have already had and I think that you probably I believe that you all had that discussion around this time last year or maybe February or March so this is really discussing policy for superintendent evaluation moving forward it's really important for you all to have this conversation as a board now before you begin the process of interviewing superintendents it's much easier to have a policy in place that you can go into negotiations with saying this is how we evaluate our superintendent rather than the more typical path where you don't have anything going

[00:05:00]
I have a kind of the status quo policy you go into the negotiation and then in the negotiation you figure out how you're going to actually do it that usually isn't a process that is set it up for that really sets anyone up for success and can lead to a lot of heartburn down the road so we want to save you all as much heartburn as possible so we provided a couple of pre-reading materials in advance of tonight's meeting and before we get into it I want to ask did everyone have an opportunity to peruse those materials yes yes yes yes yes yes so really what this the document titled is coaching document titled effective superintendent evaluation process

[00:06:00]
really laid out why this why having a process for evaluating the superintendent is important and also it clarifies that evaluating the superintendent and the accountability process between the board and the superintendent isn't a one-time thing it's not a one-time event that happens each year that you build up all of this anticipation for it's actually something that you do every month when your progress monitoring so each of those progress monitoring conversations that you have they're all many evaluations of the superintendent where you are looking at District performance as it relates to your goals and your guard levels and you are having conversations about whether or not you're on track with the expectations are we in those conversations you want to know are we on track if we're not on

[00:07:00]
what do what do we know what is driving the current results that we're seeing and two does the superintendent have a plan for us to get on track those are really the three key conversations in the progress monitoring session and after the monitoring session is over the board will vote to accept to table or to reject the monitoring report these are not the board approving the superintendent strategies it's not the board approving anything that the superintendent has done or has it done you are simply voting to accept the report and it is a confirmation on the record where you say we've had this conversation we're satisfied with the conversation and we have a clear understand

[00:08:00]
what is what the current reality is for students and what is driving that reality so you have those conversations all throughout the year and then annually you'll have a summative conversation were you talking about the results from the entire year when you have this conversation annually it really shouldn't be a surprise conversation there should this can be a process that really has a lot of anxiety build up around it historically for boards but that should be the case if the board is getting to the point where you're about to evaluate the superintendent and no one really knows how it's going to how it's going to go that's not a process of setting anyone up for Success the board really should understand what the superintendent's performance has been up until that point because

[00:09:00]
as you have had those conversations every month you know exactly what district performance looks like as it relates to your goals and your guard rails so when it gets when it becomes time to evaluate the superintendent if you were evaluated the superintendent on the goals and on achievement of the goals and honoring of the guard rails and then it really isn't a surprise it's not a secret everyone is going to know how is that the board should be evaluating the superintendent on achievement of the goals and goals guard rails of course are not legally required to do that you can legally you can evaluate the superintendent on whatever criteria you decide this isn't a conversation about what is legal and what is not legal this is a conversation about what is effective

[00:10:00]
and we know that the most effective words evaluate the most effective words evaluate the superintendent the same way they evaluate the districts they consider superintendent's performance is indistinguishable from District performance that means that if the goals are being achieved and the guard rails are being honored then you are the superintendent is doing their job and if they're not then there is room for improvement the board really has to make the decision of how to move forward and what what criteria you want to use as you evaluate the superintendent I want to be clear though any criteria that you include in the superintendent's evaluation that is not specifically achievement of the goals and from goals and trumps is going to be an invitation for the superintendent to

[00:11:00]
redirect their attention from achieving those priorities so that is my high level overview of the evaluation process y'all don't want to just listen to me all night I want to hear from you what questions do you have about the process and how how would you like to make this process work for APS I think we should begin to veteran members and I'll start with well I'll let you chimed in so actually this is Courtney Hi how are you I have some hot tea here myself for my for my voice so so I guess that the my natural first question is is like where

[00:12:00]
how do we start writing this I mean obviously we're going to need to have something written down like where does sore or does do you guys have any templates or something that we can start from that have been effective with other school boards so that we we know what has worked well I'm going to go off of off of memory when I say this but it is the sample language that I shared something to the effect of the Superman annually the superintendent is evaluated on achievement of the student outcome goals and compliance with the guard rails or honoring of the card

[00:13:00]
is it it's not required to be any more complicated than that it's clear that says this is how the board evaluates the superintendent now remember this is the sosg like sample policy not you know you're bored should be identifying what what works for you but it is definitely strongly recommended the most effective boards do evaluate the superintendent strictly on achievement of the goals and honoring of the cartels thank you I see it I didn't click in to at the end but yeah this is very just black and white and very straightforward and try to keep it easy for you

[00:14:00]
I just want to clarify for her board member Astoria and Benavides at the end of the document that we're discussing in the digital packet there's a link and it's at middle link sample s o f g superintendent evaluation any other questions well I think that the next question you at the beginning you said that it would be really appropriate for us to have this in place prior to the selection of the next superintendent so and I see that you in here there's a process like a phasing in phase one phase 0 phase one phase two oh no sorry that's the evaluation process so we just need to work on getting an adoption of

[00:15:00]
contract negotiation and in particular around pay so should we decide to pay our next superintendent increases or bonus based on their ability to meet the goals that ought to be included in the contract and if that's in the contract that should align with the with the policy so that in particular this question of incentives of bonuses is not a conversation that we've really had yet as a board it has been part of our training about superintendent of evaluations in terms of you know bonus I think Ashley

[00:16:00]
the bonuses should be based on performance of meeting the goals and so I think that's the other thing too is just would appreciate your guidance on how best to align to the contract so if we move forward with some draft language change to the policy that we can then consider during our next policy committee meeting that's not until March so in the meantime we'll have potentially hired a new Superintendent at the end of January early February will be working on that contract negotiation so there is some interim work that needs to happen between there even before we can formally approve the policy so that's the other question of timing that I think would be helpful Ashley if you could speak to just on how do we what is your best recommendation for doing that and then what I said about pay and incentives and the contract is there anything else that we ought to consider these can be questions for our lawyers too about the contract relative to the policy so that's actually what I was just about to say

[00:17:00]
contract negotiations are really best left to the attorneys I'm not an attorney so I can't give legal advice but but I can't talk to you about policy and and best practices and how what is effective for school boards and so the way that your policy reads should not be in conflict with the with the contract and so if you know right now it's kind of a chicken chicken or egg you know do we do the contract and then the policy or policy and the contract it sounds like the contract will happen first which is fine usually the contract will be more details you can include in the contract how different elements are waited so if are we are we going to evaluate the superintendent on the goals and

[00:18:00]
and the guard rails are the goals going to account for 50% and the guardrails are going to account for the other 50% are we going to wait the goals heavier and the guard rails lighter those are all conversations that you all have and you can have those those in the I definitely recommend those conversations to be had in the as a board in executive session as part of the contract negotiation with your attorney but those are things that is a level of detail that can be included in the contract that you don't necessarily need and policy and the policy could be more high level so think of the policy or think of the contract is like an adult to the policy era an attachment to the policy is effectively I feel like there was another question there but I don't know that I answered another piece was just about the

[00:19:00]
play incentive bonuses that's just contract but it is a conversation that we need to have as a board I think absolutely absolutely is that a wise is that a common practice Ashley so if you have you know plus or minus half a percent or 1% on either side of your target for that year for each goal and if they exceed that then

[00:20:00]
have a have a bonus call it a stretch bonus you can absolutely do that you can also have it on additional criteria I don't so as your governance coach is not my recommendation that you include extra criteria but could it's just that every extra piece of criteria that you include is again incentivizing the superintendent to focus on things that are not the priorities at the board has has set and really the priorities at the community is set because these goals and these guard rails are based on feedback you have received from the community but yeah it's it is definitely common practice for the superintendent to have some kind of bonus but again that's that's a conversation that really would happen

[00:21:00]
in the contract negotiation before I weigh in no I just had to leave this to the members of the committee was for everyone to be able to ask questions because it is kind of the first the only time that you'll have to discuss it before you go into those superintendent interviews so in that case I do have a question so with this new evaluation process and I don't want to assume so you know that's

[00:22:00]
Play We ask this is obviously something that's being developed for new superintendent will Scott will we have any evaluation do we have to do that are we obligated to do a final one or everything we talked about is just for new purposes moving forward I just didn't know if we had to have got it sorry that was my only question to that which was this whole conversation is new superintendent evaluation going forward yes that's a great question but we can discuss whether we want to do any sort of formative evaluation for Scott going forward or anything like that because the contract likely says that will have a meeting in March or whatever but we could figure out if we want to do that if that's something that the current superintendent desires but the policy and the shift to students

[00:23:00]
evaluation poly policies forward-looking only for the new superintendent yes that's my only question and so board member benavidez do you want to weigh in I would love to weigh in but really the only thing I have to say right now I don't really have any questions and it's probably because it's new information and if they do come up I hope that there is an open line of communication where I can ask them but it seems pretty clear right now which I think is a good thing good thank you for that and yes absolutely and I will be reaching out to all of our new board members tomorrow to set up some one-on-one time to begin opening those lines of communication thank you

[00:24:00]
I agree with Heather it is pretty laid out pretty and it's understandable and I would appreciate yes having those 101 conversations and I'm just to look forward to what needs to happen but I know that we need to get rolling thank you I know I don't normally talking committees but I'm curious if you like a perspective on the bonus situation that I think from the superintendent might give you some thoughts but if you don't want it I would appreciate that you can do and you'll do with this whatever you want I understand that but the concept of the Merit pay and the bonuses for superintendents is actually fairly tricky because it puts a superintendent in a weird position for example if that had happened with me I got a lot of the work I make sure things happen but there's a lot of people under me that actually do the work so as the numbers continue to

[00:25:00]
change it's nice that is a superintendent you get some of the credit for that but when you as a superintendent received the money it's it's a little awkward because there's other people who did it and they're not getting the bonus Merit pay so a lot of superintendents they end up doing is just donating it to their foundations because it's it's just a attention inside the district now there's also some superintendents I'm sure who take it and enjoy their new fishing boat but I'm just saying it's it's it is a it's an interesting position for the superintendent to be in terms of so it doesn't really fit the normal educational

[00:26:00]
that was one of my questions and more of a concern I think our Workforce just because they are so poorly paid no other word for it phrase for it people pay attention to that and we're already bumping up the the salary by potentially 100.00 and so just I think it's important to take into account yes teachers got Educators well no classroom

[00:27:00]
educational assistance receive an increase but they're still making what 25 an hour a year 25,000 a year and so it's about perception and perception matters talking about the other thing I wanted to point out was a topic that came up during a conversation with Miss King and that has to do with the other models of of of of of of

[00:28:00]
put superintendent evaluation that may not be entirely 50/50 goals and guardrails but can carve out I don't know 10% 10 or 20 I don't know for other work operations or anyway just something we might consider an Ashley could you help us in that regard yeah so I mean my coaching is is going to be consistent every every every additional piece of criteria that you include in the superintendent of evaluation is going to be inviting the superintendent to focus on things that are not achieving the goals in the streets superintendent is going to have a lot of really important work to do outside of the goals and the constraints that's not a question but what is in question is

[00:29:00]
what are the things that the board is prioritizing if you are if you are including other things in the evaluation then you are you will be prioritizing things that are that are not your literal priorities that have been brought forward by the community so again the board can do however do it how the board decides to do it but my coaching is going to be is going to be consistent across the board that the most effective boards evaluate the superintendent on the goals on the girls they they consider the superintendents performance is indistinguishable from system performance okay thank you for that and I am told that board member and I apologize I can't see you board member but I told that you have your hand up and so we're eager to hear from you

[00:30:00]
thank you yes I just had a quick question I know for the new superintendent in the interview questions we did see a question in there that talks about what they would like to see in their evaluation and you know that process so I just had a question for Ashley what would be some good advice to leave that conversation when it comes to the next superintendent and thank you also superintendent Elder for your input on that because I was kind of the same thoughts that I was thinking so thank you so would you mind clarifying your questions so because I'm not I'm not sure I understand so yeah just so we have an interview question for the new superintendent maybe it might be better for offline because it is one of the questions that we're going to be asking a superintendent candidate I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm not sure that we should put that out publicly probably not that makes sense yeah

[00:31:00]
but and I will answer that in General Tso in general the board the board has to decide how the board is going to evaluate the superintendent and that's why this conversation is critical to have before you even begin the the evaluation process or the interview process because if you if you all have an agreement on how you're going to evaluate the superintendent before you start interviewing then you can be really clear with the with the people who you're interviewing and when you say this is how you will be this is how accountability works at the district and and know that because they need to be clear that the priorities that your community has set that you have set on behalf of your community are not negotiable the these are not negotiable these are the things that you're going to do and

[00:32:00]
that achievement of these items is the expectation so Ashley if I could just jump in here so it sounds like what is critical for us to be working on right now is a discussion on the superintendent evaluation document as maybe as presented through our online resources and then correspond that to the policy we have a policy right now obviously that policy is extremely out of date because it is not sfg aligned at all so what we all need to work on possibly tonight is discuss this evaluation tool as as presented in front of us and then maybe present some policy updated language to the policy that we already have so long as we agree as a committee what that evaluation tool is going to look like and then some of this other stuff

[00:33:00]
we really need to leave for executive session and when the whole board is present to have some of these other contract specific discussions is that accurate yes and so so with on that note I want to create a little bit of space for the board to be able to have this conversation without without the coach looking over your shoulder so if there are no other questions about the process I'd like to just go off camera and allow you to have the have a conversation about it and then I can come back for the next part any other questions are you suggesting that we have a conversation now about the language for the superintendent evaluation and it's

[00:34:00]
language that we found on where is it so you don't have to come up with your specific language right now but I think that it is worthwhile for you all to have a conversation about how the evaluation is going to take how you would each individually like to see the evaluation take place what is what what do you feel is going to work best for this board okay yes agreed thank you and I will I will be here if you need to call me back online great what do you think any go ahead and jump in if you don't mind like I love the I guess the recommendations we received from Ashley

[00:35:00]
because it allows us and reminds us to stay focused because I think we could easily get derailed and overall our goal is to support the next superintendent as best as possible we never wanted to feel like there's a surprise or we're making their job unachievable to be successful and I think if we stick to what the community requested with the goals and guardrails and it's very clear they know what the expectation is going to be because you don't want there to be surprises you don't want them to feel like they're focusing on too many items and it keeps us focused because again I think what we were trying to get away from and I believe we've been pretty successful is getting in the weeds of items that don't concern us outside of goals and guardrails and really allowed them to be effective in their job and to lead and be the superintendent they're called to be so having that reminder and saying let's keep the evaluation let's keep it narrow

[00:36:00]
not get too broad because again we want them to be successful we want them to hit these goals and to be achievable for me personally I'm not against a merit-based type of bonus I know that is a standard practice with any large top Executives that run any type of large business and ultimately we are a big employer because it does give some type of incentive to them to be successful and when we're trying it to these goals and guard rails it allows them to hit different Milestones throughout their time with us whatever we choose as a board I'm obviously will support it completely but I want to challenge us to think outside of the box of what we've always done and to really think that the type of person that we are targeting we don't want the same type of

[00:37:00]
I guess status quo of the way it was and really allow them to really thrive in their right you know unless that's something we choose not to but again I think it's up for discussion what we think may or may not be appropriate for our next superintendent and so I just want to clarify when you say that you you are in favor of keeping a very narrow focus on the evaluation tool are you talking about a 50/50 split between the goals and the guard rails I can't necessarily say without like has to be 50/50 it could be 640 but I don't want to add additional items that are not that are outside of Golden Girls like I guess that's what I'm saying but I'm open to percentages as we discuss and if we figure that there's more weight on certain items than others which I believe there are

[00:38:00]
you know cuz I think some do have greater substance than others we can discuss that as a whole okay so I hear some kind of split between goals and guardrails maybe waiting some of the goals some of the guard rails and you're in favor of a bonus board member I think because we've just initiated the goals in the guard rails that we want narrow it like you said Crystal when we're evaluating I know right now is we're looking at some of the you know the videos and all of that I was trying to think how are we evaluating these what are we looking for and it would be helpful as a new board member that those were in place and it was

[00:39:00]
when we were talking about evaluation and processes and then attaching it to the goals in the guard Wells it would be very helpful I agree there and what about the concept of a bonus where do you land on that let me think about it and the concept of waiting some of the goals to specifically these goals and guard rails and it's one more focused and it's one to us say that we are going to be specific because if this is our place as a board and this is what we want to take it Forward I think we have to really address those and the percentages would be adequate thank you I'm going to go to board member benefits thank you and

[00:40:00]
I don't know how to properly weigh or add weight to the golden guard rails upon you know first consideration the goals it seems to me we would have more weight because I feel like their goals and they're probably it's clear how to achieve them or it's clear when they are achieved but as I'm reviewing the guardrails right now I see that there's you know benchmarks in place and so I really don't know if assigning you know goals 60% in guardrails 40% or something even less even is appropriate so I'm sorry I'm just thinking out loud and throwing that out there for consideration and discussion where the bonus is concerned I really appreciate superintendent Elders feedback because I understand what he's saying any leader of any organization understands that the people who are really doing the work are the people that are

[00:41:00]
under us and I know for myself it would be very difficult if my board were to come to me and say we feel like you achieved these goals and made this much progress and we want to reward you for that with a monetary gift and it would be hard to accept because honestly it's it's the people I work with is my colleagues who are who are doing the majority of the work and helping us achieve these goals and so I don't know if it's appropriate I think that historically if it's happened it's a wonderful thing I think it's great that some superintendents decide to donate it to foundations because they do see the big picture and that it's all of us not just one of us but I think that we really need to take in consideration that because this is something that that happens and it's not unusual maybe we should think about doing it to be with you I'm not really in favor of it I'm just going to put that out there right now but I'll go with the consensus of the board

[00:42:00]
and I think that's really all I have to contribute at this time and I promise at some point I will stop saying I'm new so I want to feel it out and see you know what everybody else says and how they feel but that is my my input right now and I hope it wasn't too confusing and if you need any clarification board member to bring us please let me know thank you know you're fine I think we've all been we've been down that walk and I am being coached that the bonus conversation has come to an end because it is reserved for contract negotiations but perhaps you can weigh in by way of email is that appropriate probably so I'm going to I'm going to take care of people online because I'm afraid

[00:43:00]
do you want to weigh in on this conversation please minus the bonus yes I agree with board member Benavides I think that the guard rails are just as important as the goals and if anything they're kind of like the building blocks in order to make the goals right so we should be looking like at Cardinal Number One support systems that would probably help us get better post-secondary Readiness or things like that so I don't see how I mean I do see how we can one out way more than the other but I do think that we should all be held to the same standard when it comes to making sure that what we put in place is is happening for our students so I'm interested in having more of that discussion and what the Wayne options look like but right now I'm kind of seeing it all is

[00:44:00]
I would agree that we need to keep it very focused on the goals in the guardrails and just as big as some background to the previous evaluations included things like gets along really well with people in the community and like just kind of really stuff that is really hard to actually evaluate I mean I know our current superintendent gets along really well with people in the community but that's that's not really something that is very specific and is a way to really accurately be judged of how that is translating to Improvement for our students so I would prefer to keep it to the goals and card rails that you know the

[00:45:00]
is is I think something that can be discussed 50/50 or 60/40 and then I think the the only other thing is that I wouldn't add anything else to this the next part that will I get will probably move to next is how we're going to translate that into the policy language but I wouldn't go any further right now outside of the goals in the guard rails because it's it's fair to the incoming superintendent right to know exactly what they're being evaluated against thank you and remember thank you so I think I agree nearly entirely with numbers of making sure that the evaluation

[00:46:00]
they are evaluated on the goals and the guardrails like those other members I'm flexible whether it's 50/50 or 60/40 and I think that again could be part of what comes into contract negotiation conversations as well in terms of how the new superintendent wants to be evaluated I think in terms of the policy itself which was nice to see up that's what I was going to say I'm reading the current procedural directive that was in our packets and reading the guidance that we received from the Council of great City schools and it does seem to me like our policy could read with what sort of at the end of page 3 of their Guidance the annual superintendent evaluation so if our policy read the boards annual and the board will evaluate the superintendent annually

[00:47:00]
and then talk about the process here in terms of the phase one phase 2 phase 3 having formative and summative having 360 South Val and board eval including the data from the monitoring reports all of those things being included and listed in their as well as the timing I know the timing is included in the contract as well I think this is just a great starting point to almost sort of pull what's the end of page 3 into page 4 into the first draft of the policy itself there are some things in the current procedural directive like a couple of words that I think are helpful to keep like the mutually agreed upon feels important but I think this stuff around that we're going to use a set form for every year that's important keeping that language and so I think in terms of process if there was a draft policy that the policy

[00:48:00]
best way to work on that sort of pulled some of this language from the sosg guidance and kept some of the stuff around just standard form mutually agreed upon language and timing from the current procedural directive I think that would be a great starting point and I may have to come back to you about that is that the same is that the form that you sent me earlier the the document that it isn't the first link under 4.17 and evaluation

[00:49:00]
and then go all the way to the end it's on page 360 yeah where it says what is the superintendent evaluation process yeah so that from sosg but from our current procedural directive the superintendent shall be evaluated each contract year in accordance with the process outline below and then we pay for sosg in there okay and I don't think we disagree we're all in agreement about I'd like to see if a 50/50 and then further discussion on within that if if we believe it's Food For Thought for me to go

[00:50:00]
revisit the goals in the guard rails and see if any one of those you know would be weighted in any shape or form so but they all look pretty important so I'm inclined to stay with a pretty simple and direct narrow is the word that is appropriate okay do we need any further comments last observations and

[00:51:00]
so I get the sense that this needs to happen pretty soon like ASAP and and so just the the format for doing that does it require an executive session meeting of all of us Ashley are you there in March you will have a hired with the with the calendar that you expected but now that you've had this conversation I think you know what to expect certainly the board could decide to have to

[00:52:00]
expedite the process and move it out but I don't know that that's not that that's necessary I think that's correct I think that is correct in terms of the nuts and bolts of the actual process and the deadlines what I was suggesting was we already have an executive session on January 10th and January 31st those agent the first one agenda has already been posted is already set what what we need to have done before January 31st and we begin the contract negotiation is overall agreement on how we're going to evaluate the person overall agreement and how we're going to pay the person overall agreement on what the pay is going to be and that will be in the executive session on January 30th so the things that we need going into that is the draft policy which is I think pretty straightforward but I guess when I was saying deadlines like from Miss Martinez's perspective what's realistic for having a draft presented to the policy committee chair to to review and

[00:53:00]
turn back and forth with you and then to have in written format back to the board prior again to the 30th 31st is when we need to have Grist for the mill please our first read essentially right even going to have time for a first Okay so we've got the legislative session starting as of next week I think my question will be is how soon can the board work I think I can have a draft to you by the end of next week depending you know what I mean before the session really gets rolling the you know can certainly put in the work to get it done so I think the two things are there is the draft of the policy which I think we're in agreement on for the most part and so like I think that's just you have that to us before I don't know whatever the posting dates are for when we're talking about stuff prior to January 31st like we will talk about the evaluation that should be listed on the posting date for that exact session or whatever but the conversation around

[00:54:00]
the details we won't work out until we're in exact on the 31st and so then you can't do what if I have a draft to you by the end of this week then just working around some of the parameters that you define identified for now and then we can work from that draft that would be perfect that would be great sooner the better so I'm feeling and I'm trying to honor your preparation for the legislative session at the same time it's fine it'll be it's this is a good time for me okay and I think it's fairly straightforward I think so okay okay okay go ahead so in terms of also Expediting and respecting the committee and the committee chair period I think the committee can make

[00:55:00]
Visions to the doc without breaking Coram I'm trying to make sure that we can continue to move some stuff forward and I think we funnel we funnel that through everybody through the committee but also through I'll work with Johanna on that we've done this before right I believe yes we have but it was different because we have to be so it is just keeping it on the dock and keeping things public and keeping things posted but the committee members I think it would be you three who do the

[00:56:00]
then we'll make our own edits on that own document so that it's not a quorum issue she'll take all of the it'll open edits Consolidated and then create one of those people no more right and that's all I wanted or not for sure so it sounds to me like we are lining it up so that we will have this policy in place certainly before the 31st is that correct by 31st session on

[00:57:00]
do we have the 16th as in a closed session it's a possibility I think the thing that's important about the 31st and the week following is that the contract negotiation so let's say we find candidate who is amazing and we think we should pay them the top notch of the salary then maybe we're not talking bonuses or maybe we find a candidate who is like really into the bonuses and then we are talking bonuses we find a candidate who's not so I think it's going to depend on those

[00:58:00]
and the conversation with the attorneys the candidates attorneys and us so that's all going to be in motion so we'll have the draft to go into the 31st we'll have our conversation and executive in the 31st we're going to come out of that and be in contract negotiations so back and forth with the attorneys and that's going to influence the rewrite of the policy that we won't actually prove until next week okay so those conversations influencing the but the point of us working on it now is so that when we go into the contract negotiations at the very least the the the candidate knows like at the very least we're evaluating on you on these and so that's kind of what leads up to to that and then if we need to adjust during contract negotiations we have that ability because the policy won't be approved until March so we're still in like draft form yeah if that makes sense this is what we have

[00:59:00]
I think so I think this is a huge win like we're actually operating in like a solid committee we have action steps we're doing what we said we were going to do like I'm celebrating like inside here cuz I'm like yes we're on the right track we're doing everything we're needing to do we've been so this is fantastic so anyways just my side note OK Google on the revision to the superintendent evaluation process we know we're expecting address by the end of the week yay thank you and that will become that

[01:00:00]
will dictate our conversation on 31st so we're ready to move to the next topic which is 4.2 and the agenda next steps for policy review and diet and are presenter is Ashley pause or coaching the next steps so last summer review

[01:01:00]
all of the board policies and so in this policy review there was a process that you that what they went through was they identify which policies that you have on the books are required by law so that's one question to the next question is which policies are implemented by the district by staff and which ones are more more implemented by the board and then three which policies are more directly related to the goals in the guard rails and which ones are least influenceable of The Golden Girls so except for the required or not questioning the rest of the questions were based on a scale of 1 to 10 so the committee went through and actually I think the full board went through and rated

[01:02:00]
number of the policies or maybe even all of the policies of President Gonzalez you were you were the chair of that committee so maybe I should give you an opportunity to share those specifics well just that the committee did the rating and then presented and then Miss Martinez presented them to the board for review and discussion questions and so so all of the policies have been reviewed and rated and the board has been in the process of archiving all of the policies that fell within so remember they were rated on a scale of zero or from 1 to 10 so everything that was rated for and below is has been in the process of being archived so one of the next steps that this committee will have to have to take his recommendation of the board what to do with those remaining

[01:03:00]
raining policies that have not been archived yet that fall within that 0 to 4 or 1 to 4 and then so do you do you I guess that's the next question is what does this committee what what to do with those policies so the board is already gone through the the previous committee has gone through the process of writing them the previous board reviewed them so now the committee just needs to make a recommendation so I think that's the question on the first question on the floor is how do you want to handle these I think it's 47 policies they're that are rated between one and four that are outstanding correct and get this offer plate we're not going to have a committee meeting in

[01:04:00]
so I requested that we start sending sending these 47 I mean in chunks to Administration to review decide if any of them are going to get bumped back to the committee or to the board so these policies for administrative review can decide whether or not they want to include those policies in their manual as a as a procedural directives but they're not required to do that these policies to this this is a question of whether or not the board wants to maintain these policies on their on the books that the board on the board policy manual and so the previous board and the previous committee

[01:05:00]
say that everything that was rated four or below and the question of is this board work or superintendent work would be archived and that's and those are things that are not required by law there are things that some of the policies that are required by law go onto a legacy list and those are maintained on that Legacy list under board under board policy but there's still things that are just kind of routinely routinely updated but the board the board is choosing to not spend a lot of time on those things because they're not necessarily policy that the board is responsible for implementing so we are happy to recommend all four seven to yeah we're on board to Archive them but we're all so in conversation with our policy analyst and administration and

[01:06:00]
my master to come up so she can weigh in on this conversation hi Ashley so when we took the last batch of policies two cabinet for review just to make sure that they were confident that we could have aligned those procedural directives etc etc it only happened with one policy but we did have cabinet request that the board retained a policy that they felt they would really like to have the boards in put on that policy specifically was naming and renaming of facilities I don't anticipate that it's going to happen very often but I I would love it if we can leave the door open for administration to be able to say that they'd like to have board oversight on some of that work if they choose to do so yeah so if the board chooses to the board so this that would be a great time for the board to decide whether for

[01:07:00]
the committee to decide whether or not they want to retain retain that policy or if it's one that you want to recommend for for and definitely like hear the hear the administration's desire that they hear the staff say that hey or we'd like your feedback on this but the board at the board decides that they that they that's not something that they want to be their work then it's not the decision is not the administration of course okay and so there's a discussion on the table then regarding do we want to work with Administration on naming buildings or renaming them and just going to ask you to weigh in starting at the far right with the

[01:08:00]
sorry I know I know it's hard okay so so never mind sorry I don't mean to be particularly so board member Courtney Jackson yeah so I I think I appreciate that they would want our input into that but I think that is very clearly administrative work kind of based on the the fact of when this has come to

[01:09:00]
before we weren't actually ever included in that decision it was just brought to us to say we are renaming this building such and such and here's why and it's because the administration they're the ones that have that intimate knowledge of who has worked here who has done the the work that requires a renaming and that isn't something that the board would really ever have any input into anyway so as far as my as far as I'm concerned that's administrative work and I say that we are archive all 47 well it was a pretty in a previous yes it was in a previous so the board did I don't know when are one of our previous meetings but but on the discussion yeah so we that once passed it's already happened but what I'm saying is in the future if we have a situation like that come up again where Administration says you know we really feel like we'd like

[01:10:00]
play for the boards over I don't think it's going to happen a million times and I and I don't know if superintendent Elder would have any thoughts on that it did just happen with the one but while we're talking about the naming and renaming I actually had to review that one today for a department because even the procedural directive requires Board review why that hasn't happened to the past I don't know but you know that's that's what we've got down in policy and procedural directive so again though that once that should say and we're already through that one but if the board decides that you all want to just say no forget it we're just going to Archive them and let admin sort it out that's absolutely okay as well so the question sorry I thought I thought the question before us was was we have 47 that have that are still pending is that's the question right and so the question that we are you are asking the committee is do we want to Archive those 407 do you want archive those 47 but also do you want to leave room

[01:11:00]
for there to be a review by Administration to be able to say you know in this particular instance on this particular policy has happened in the past do we want to leave room for that or do you guys you know just want to go through and ask them and move on I mean I feel pretty confident with the work that the previous team worked on which I think was it was board member Peterson and board member Gonzalez I feel confident with the work that they did and I am happy to abide by their their recommendations for archives so I'm happy with with that remember also agree let's go ahead and move forward and then also support the community that did work on them and then they was going on member Astoria I agree on archiving all 47 however I do think we should have a little

[01:12:00]
my bedroom in case Administration does want to have conversations with us I'm just thinking about naming buildings and relating that to naming statues and possible conversations that might be brought to the board on that so we might want some leeway when it comes to those conversations but I'm fine with archiving them and I'm in I'm I occupy the same space board member astorga I feel I'm eager to you know I'm eager to get these off our plate and having said that I also want to leave some room for for conversation as long as it's not more than one or two just I want to be collaborative

[01:13:00]
right in the spirit of collaboration and a willingness to listen to another argument that the administration might present we don't walk in their shoes and we mostly don't want to but so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm feeling the way up here is that two two vote so I do want to emphasize that policy was very much an outlier it was very much an outlier and really I don't think that that type of situation is going to have we do like to make it a practice to take the policies to admin just for

[01:14:00]
they're sick to be able to say hey heads up this work is now going to trickle down to you I'll be very happy to to bid those those 47 I do at your direction as soon as you'd like to have that happen if I can just one other where there was disagreement from me or remember Peterson or anything sort of in the gray area we were like making a five and so they're five they stay for now and we can bring them back later but conversation on the naming of buildings was yes it's political yes it's related to the vision and values of the community yes it's related to our history colonialism slavery all kinds of issues but it's not related to student outcomes and goals and guard girls and so that's done that was the conversation that we had so I think it was a four or whatever I don't know but that one's done anything that was

[01:15:00]
is it similarly on the fence though like we were pretty consistently were like yeah I can find and there's not very much that's like that and I will say this policy as someone who cares about needs and understands the values of names and our history is already pretty good like it does say a lot about Community engagement and Community voice and respect for communities and so for that reason too it wasn't worth bringing up this was like okay so 477 good okay Ashley do you want to weigh in on anything so the next steps for the policy diet when when the board decides to

[01:16:00]
turn panel on a new committee to conduct the policy diet the next step is to have to take the policies that are remaining and review them and have a have a conversation so essentially the way that you go through it is you read policy and decide is this a policy that we want to keep is it one that we want to delete or is it when we want to modify so you can you can go ahead and have that conversation really whenever you decide that it's a priority for your board to have the policy to conduct the policy diet but it is and it's not my recommendation for you to do that for a while you got a lot of other really big work and going on and you just did a really big took a you just went through a really big process of floating a whole lot of your policies

[01:17:00]
so I would definitely not want to encourage you to get into that until after probably the summer okay and I'm just checking in with previous policy chair and does that sound about right okay and is there I think that is everything so I know that there was also a question about but I want to be clear that those are those are policies that really need to be reviewed by your staff because they are those are they really are policies that that the staff should be looking at and so they may bring forward a number of policies that the would be acceptable to be deleted

[01:18:00]
because they're the ones who know what the they know those policies best and that's their level of expertise so I would really encourage you to defer to them for those for those handful of Finance policies and I probably should probably also go through the finance committee if it hasn't done so already so we already yeah I reached out to our on the administrative side I'm a lot easier to get these on the March board agenda for approval to Archive so they're working on that in the next eight weeks and I'll let them

[01:19:00]
reach out to finance if they need to do so for finance chair reach out to them in that review but that's in the works Yes sounds good well it's great to see everyone tonight and I'm really excited about the work coming up with this board thank you and we will be talking soon again one of the first priorities of the committee is complete the policy or two well to complete the policy diet that began last year I have a question though so

[01:20:00]
how many more policies are there to review I don't have that paper period using policy committee to create a monitoring process and that's part of the

[01:21:00]
reconstitute the ad hoc committee to work on that and so that would be looking at the keep modified Elite and then sort of determining what happens with the keeps okay and how we modify and that's the thing that is not urgent since we're hiring a superintendent and we have a board members and we're so sorry later okay that we're going to have to go back and do I keep modified delete review of those okay great still it's exciting to purge so there you have it where will continue the process of policy diet work into the summer

[01:22:00]
May no longer be needed since the board approved its budget policy at the end of last year and so staff will be recommending that many of those policies be archived and that work should be finished by the end of February staff is also reviewing policies that the ad hoc policy review diet committee determined weren't bored work many of those the 47 we all agreed can move on to the March board agenda to be jettisoned well to be archived we also will be working to update the superintendent evaluation

[01:23:00]
so that that's really a final draft I don't know what the 31st will have a drafting enough that we can will that we can move forward with the executive session discussions scheduled for March 4th at 5:00 p.m. we are still working out the details for dates times and frequency of policy committee meetings but I think we're mostly in agreement that we're shooting for every other month and we also need to determine whether committee meetings can be held virtually I think

[01:24:00]
well we'll have more conversation about that but that sounds like a refreshing idea and if that's it then we are adjourned
