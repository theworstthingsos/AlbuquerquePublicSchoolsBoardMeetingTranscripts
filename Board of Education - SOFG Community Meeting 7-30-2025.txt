okay all right so I think we will officially go ahead and get started so I will turn the first slide over to board members Georgia great well thank you all for being here today for the in-person also the folks online I know that your time is valuable so whether you're an educator Advocate Community member we appreciate you being here just to learn a little bit more about 8 p.m. and governance so tonight we're going to explore three but very important questions the first thing why does APS exist the second why do school boards exist and the third is how much does a school board act in order to be effective and one quick thing before

[00:05:00]
do I pass it on so we can truly get started the questions are also up there there you go the three questions another thing just really quickly if you are wanting to speak we ask that you use the mic at the back of the room just so that it is recorded and folks from Zoom or online are able to hear you so with that I will pass it over to board member Jackson thank you so we will go ahead and get started with our first section which is the question of why does APS exist so the way that we're going to start with this is a very quick activity you guys should all have pens in a pad in front of you and what would you like to ask you to do is that you grab the pen in the paper and you answer this just basic question in 10 words or less why do you think APS exist

[00:06:00]
and while you guys are writing that I realized that I did not take the opportunity for all of us to introduce ourselves so I'm going to start from the left and I would like to introduce yourself good evening everyone my name is Crystal Tapia Romero I am bored member for District 5 which is West Mesa High School area code graduate and I am thrilled you are here welcome thank you and I am board member Courtney Jackson I represent district 7

[00:07:00]
pictures of my high schools are in El Dorado and then I have all of the schools that filter into that the current vice president of the board Janelle Astoria District 1 which is the South Valley area so I have a real grand high school and Atrisco Heritage Academy and I am right now period and board member Tom Morita would you like to introduce yourself

[00:08:00]
Mountain charter school as well as Sandia High School yes my district goes all the way to Chilean and includes Four Hills and it's a massive district and please try your attention to the booklet Thank you period I think that is all the board members that are here okay all right so hopefully that gave you guys an opportunity to write down in 10 words or less and why you think APS exist so now what I'd like to do is just ask a question did any of you write anything that has to do with buses

[00:09:00]
budget or buildings anything like that very handsome in the are no okay I feel like you guys might have studied before we came here what did you write who would like to share and if you'd like to share with us that you please go to the mic at the back of the room so I wrote to help students achieve strong lifelong Equitable outcomes awesome awesome opportunity inclusivity Children's First Community

[00:10:00]
wonderful thank you okay anybody else who would like to share okay go for Megan and I wrote down to fulfill the promise of a free and fair education for all kids love it wonderful anybody else I don't want anybody to not feel like they have the opportunity to educate our youth by providing meaningful and relevant learning experiences good afternoon

[00:11:00]
I wrote down to educate students which we've heard but I also think it's to prepare them for the future which I think I am going over here because I think that's important anybody else and just so everybody knows we have lots of time kind of built into to the training today so that there will be lots of opportunity for people to get up and share and share their thoughts so I just so thank you all of those all of those responses all of those spots are are completely correct right then I think what what I noticed is that a lot of you are hitting on the fact that Albuquerque Public Schools exist to improve student

[00:12:00]
that it is what students know and are able to do that is really the definition of a student outcome that when our students while our students are here we want them to learn we want them you know to have a wonderful learning experience but we also want to them when they leave that they have the skills that habits in the mindset that they need for live success so appreciate that you guys all touched on that I'm going to go into it just a little bit more because a lot of the conversation that we have as board members is what is the difference between student outcomes and what are some of the things that are more inputs or outputs into the whole system so the way that we kind of think about it is like is in this way so if I was hungry I would want to make a sandwich in order to

[00:13:00]
fulfill that hunger so the way I would do it is I would get ingredients I would have bread peanut butter jelly probably a knife and a plate right and those are all inputs inputs into how I'm going to make my sandwich the sandwich itself once the sandwich has been constructed that's the output that is the results of the inputs that I gave to making the sandwich but the ultimate goal of the sandwich the ultimate outcome of the sandwich is that I am no longer hungry and believe me I realize that this is a little bit Elementary but we're doing that on purpose so that we can really delineate between what the difference is between those three items so if we could pause again and I just want you guys to think about this and this is another opportunity for feedback what do you think

[00:14:00]
community in general we talk more about if you are out in the community and you're hearing about APS do you think that we are talking more about inputs outputs or outcomes in general we would like to share yes ma'am so when you were just out in the community and you're having coffee with your friends and they're talking to you about APS what do you think they are talking to you more about are they talking about the inputs are they talking about the outputs or they talking about the outcomes outcomes

[00:15:00]
in your opinion yes Jackson

[00:16:00]
one of you be willing to walk around and I think I think that might be that we can capture okay thank you okay who else would like to so we've heard we've heard from one side of the room that we're hearing from more of outputs we heard outcomes and the Mike's coming your way thank you I'll try not to be too loud probably don't need it at all as a random number of the public who doesn't represent anybody except my children grandchildren and great-grandchildren I would say that though it's true in the media we hear a lot about the outcomes that from it feels to me like from the board we hear a lot about the inputs and not

[00:17:00]
what the outcome is really are going to are actually from those things thank you okay you're going to get your stuff done tonight I hear your response and I'm like wow I don't hear that at all because as a parent I hear less of what is the input of what actually is being put into the classrooms and I feel like we missed that completely that's not a conversation I feel more outputs in terms of what's the test score and are they passing but not actually the outcome of how are they what are they actually learning and how are our students is demonstrating that they're gaining knowledge or you know and I even think of like

[00:18:00]
with the some of the security things that you're talking about that to me seems more of an output as well because it's just it's stuff that comes out of the school but it's not an outcome in terms of our kids learning at the end of the day if you look at work here to improve students outcomes and improves what students know and are able to do if that is the outcome that we're focusing on I hardly hear any of that that I think that's a big part that we're lacking all the other stuff that we've talked about I feel is more outputs of things that are just coincidental from APS and the the ingredients of going into how are we creating these outcomes for students and insurance what they know and are able to do there's little information on what are those strategies I have some teacher friends that they like oh yeah we're going to all this training

[00:19:00]
but how does that training translate into the classroom what are they working on how are they teaching the kids what are those things that are going into that learning environment I feel like outputs is a huge emphasis and not the other two thank you before somebody before we have another comment which means I wonder if this definition would help so inputs are something like teachers the budget the curriculum the facilities those are the things that APS puts into the schools the outputs are things like our attendance rates are course completion or test participation our graduation rates graduation rate is actually an output are outcomes are what really matter which is whether or not our students

[00:20:00]
whether or not our students can write whether they can solve problems and whether they can succeed in life so does that kind of give more like definition around what inputs outputs and outcomes would be from our perspective still you're saying we're here in less outcomes but maybe the conversations are more about inputs and outputs yes okay so before we move to the next slide I think your point is is clear is we as a board or the reason that APS is here is to make sure that when our kids graduate their outcomes are successful they have the ability to read to write to solve problems and to have skills when they move on post graduation so I am going to

[00:21:00]
move to the next flight if that's okay anything from my okay sorry all right so that then brings us to I think we've discussed why APS exists it's to improve student outcomes and so how does that happen why why do we even have a school board why does the school board exist the school board's job is not to run daily operations we do not hire the teachers we do not hire principals we do not create lesson plans we do not decide the color of fences the superintendent and her team decide that the reason being is that the superintendent is the educational experts so what do we do as you can see on the slide the school board exists to represent the

[00:22:00]
90 by setting the direction for Student Success that means that we work with the community and the superintendent to decide what outcomes should we prioritize and what does success look like for our students so just to kind of bring that home here's a difference we are all saying that we want to improve literacy right we all want to do that or we all want to improve math proficiency but it's more important that we set a clear goal around that which could be something like by May of 2028 we want to increase third grade reading proficiency from 45 percent to 60% that provides directions it provides accountability and it provides urgency so done more conversation if we have a clear goal from the board how might that help

[00:23:00]
pictures are principles our families and our community members to know where to focus anybody to help set the direction of the outcomes right and hopefully and if you if you don't know you can look in this document right here that has our four goals so in 2022 the school board went out to the community and had extensive conversations about what does the community what direction does the community want us to go and what we heard very clearly was they wanted us to set four goals for those are those are outcome goals they are early literacy math proficiency

[00:24:00]
but those four goals were decided not by the board they were decided by the community they came through the board because we are representatives of the community but it was the community that helped to set that that direction so the question is let's think of a time when maybe there were not for very particular goals within APS how might that have deterred the work of the principal's the families the schools or the clear goal so I think of it like a map right you're telling me we need to get here right and I'm a teacher and I'm also a parent and so

[00:25:00]
I'm like okay we need to get here it's my job to now figure out like how we get there because I know the needs of my students because I'm with my kids all day long and you guys are not so it's left up to me to figure out to navigate on the map how are we going to get there and it might be different from classroom to classroom it will be different from class in the classroom because my classrooms will be very different from the person down the hallway who's in a dual language classroom she's going to get there in a very different way and so it provides us a way of like okay this is where we need to go and then it gives us as Educators the ability to make decisions to get where we need to go and it also holds us accountable because we're working towards something instead of all working in a different direction we're going in One Direction now we all may take different detours and we may have something like oh we have to stop here for a while or whatever but we're all trying to get to the same place

[00:26:00]
so that's what it does I think just saying that we want to improve Literacy for instance is a great and Noble goal of course but without a goal or a road map of you know what Improvement means it's when we've done this for decades and we haven't seen much improvement because we just have people with different strategies and different you know going in different directions when you actually have a clear goal on on what that means but it should end up doing is getting people pointed in the same direction to be able to achieve that goal so I think it's having the the four goals is absolutely critical for actually meeting in the criteria that your community is asking you all to do thank you when you say that

[00:27:00]
these goals were put together by the community what exactly do you mean by that what percentage of the community was taken into account and is there a disaggregated information as to who that information was gathered from yes ma'am so actually if we when we get a little break and actually I turn the slides over I'll run back to my office because I did bring that we do have the data on where how many people were touched how many participated in surveys all of the organizations and and people that we went out to but this started in 2022 and we did at least four large large large area Community engagement events there was one in each quadrant of this city we had individual board members who went

[00:28:00]
how to organizations who went to a particular councils within APS including the newcomer Council the special education Indian education and we had a we had a pretty significant reach thank you for that and so we we feel strongly that the community goals that were created were done with a with the Albuquerque voice Incorporated okay that sounds great of course using words like large insignificant but I think what I'm searching for here is and what you said you'll grab for me is a little more like part numbers I want to know how much it is in comparison to the community as a whole number of students involved the parents involved and what percentage is that and how regularly

[00:29:00]
is that feedback reassessed or recollected because it has been several years since 2022 things have changed so I'm just wondering how up-to-date and how current are those goals in in reference to the community input be made public cannot be made public yeah it's it actually is public it's on the aps website and was public from from the get-go all of that information is is on there so I can certainly direct you to where it is one thing to remember is that when we did set these goals we set five year goals so even though they were you know they were set in early 2023 I believe is by the time we finally made made the call these are five your goals so these will go through 2028 but what we do do is we have events like this we have Community engagement events we

[00:30:00]
add over I think it was 53 or 55 community engagement events so far so that we can continue to gather feedback from our community but I think one thing that's really important to remember and and one thing that this the school board is working on is that we're not going to shift Direction at the you know at the drop of a hat these are five years we're going to remain committed to them and then when it's time for us to go back out and reassess we will start that process all over again and really make sure that we are doing our best to incorporate as much Community voice as possible so Daniel you're getting your stepson now so I hope that this isn't taking us in a different direction but I'm very curious I love your map example I would have used the exact same example but the reality is if we put you know 60,000 people in a car or 60 different cars or whatever

[00:31:00]
some of us are going to drive recklessly some of us are going to go the wrong direction to us may hit a tree or a deer or decide that the best route is through Puerto Rico like you know like we get GPS directions all differently right so we all know if the school board is setting the goals and we all know here's the Finish Line we're going to San Diego how do the the districts goals or metrics measure up to make sure that we are all taking the best route to get to the Finish Line that's a perfect board member question that's something that we definitely ask when we have our progress monitoring us and those meetings that exact question these are the trainings that we're doing the coaching the coaching

[00:32:00]
this is what I believe is the best route for us to take in order to get to that goal so we have our different assistant superintendents that are directly talking with the teachers the principals and administration to really put in those strategies so that's a perfect forward question that we would that we always do and I also wanted to kind of circle back to the data right I know board member Dominguez is a champion and asking questions of like so we have these strategies who is it touching right what type of students are we actually reaching with these types of strategies so yeah I hope that gives a little bit but I'm going to go back to you thank you for that I'm going to pick up on what you just said so one of my favorite questions is how are we on honoring culturally and linguistically relevant curriculum because you're right not everybody is going to go in the same direction and it doesn't mean that

[00:33:00]
chaotic it means that we're being very deliberate or rather the questions are designed to make us more deliberate about our delivery of instruction toward a goal and standard I want to throw that in we are married to standards at the state level but they have to be relevant and appropriate for our children with disabilities our English language Learners which are not going to be the same you can't take the same road and also Native Americans have to be taken into account we added African-Americans into language so we're on the state is under a commitment to the Martinez Yazzie decision so children that fall under those targeted population

[00:34:00]
require us to be very deliberate about the delivery of of instructions thank you I'd like to thank you for holding this and thank you for always being an advocate for those whose voices are not heard I was I'm a parent and I was at one of the listening sessions I have a lot of friends who are teachers they're called listening session but they don't feel that way what we are asked nobody nobody in the community no parent no student nobody's going to argue with hey we need to raise literacy that yeah we all want to read like it's a great thing but what we are out there and what I felt and what

[00:35:00]
I found continually from APS is okay the question is are we going to raise it by 5% or 20% or 40% in 5 years and the wrong questions are being asked and people were not heard there was a group of students from Cibolo and the surrounding area they were speaking their truth about every day what it's like that wasn't taken into account my kid couldn't even the last year of school he couldn't get back on campus literally these are like on the ground things we call as parents we call the offices we don't get answers they're like really like nuts and bolts things that got to be taking care of cuz we can talk about all these goals to wear blue in the face but until parents getting their Staffing and kids are safe and parents are answered when they call the schools and teachers are heard

[00:36:00]
when they they know what's going on until this goes on I don't I'm just so tired of these goals because what does it mean thank you for your everyone thank you very much of making sure that the equity the voices and the perspectives are not being dropped in some of the comments that you made and what I was noticing as was reading through the documents what I think is a really important step for the oversight in the direction that the board puts in place is not just the goals but the guard rails and as I was reading those and hearing some of the things that you said about you know and their framed kind of in the negative and I was out of listening session where we talked about that

[00:37:00]
remember like did they be positive or should they be negative and and one of the things that strikes me as a leader of an organization myself is thinking through the clarity that those guardrails set for superintendent in the way that you approach the work and it's I appreciate that because I think those guardrails are really thoughtful and bring up a lot of the considerations that you mentioned here and I think it's a really important compliment to these large goals and certainly want to acknowledge you my friend in your comment and realizing that the tension between Direction and outcomes and then thinking about the many challenges that are their day-to-day and the people on the ground you know fighting through those challenges in any big system that's very complex thank you I'm not sure if I'm supposed to stand or not but I'll just turn around

[00:38:00]
couple comments on what everybody was saying to and I would like to Echo I don't remember your name was I attended some of those sessions back in 22 and I think there were a couple of them and we were over at El Dorado High School the place was packed and we had the same feelings that the the community input that we had heard and that we had shared it really felt like the board and APS already had their four goals in mine and they took our information and made it there for goals which wasn't necessarily what the community's input was so I'm curious to know when you come back and show all of that because the crowd that was at El Dorado a different ideas second thing is since we are with these goals and if this is the 5-year plan I think the biggest concern

[00:39:00]
speaking for myself is this is great that you're opening this up and we have an opportunity to speak to you but I feel like things always get stopped then at the board and we never actually get answers from the school from APS and the superintendent as to how does that translate into what that training is how are they implementing it at school what are those outcomes how are they going to assess those you understand what I'm saying it's like we get we get to have feedback here but we don't really get anything from APS in terms of how does that look like with in the classrooms and within the schools Etc it just seems like it gets lost and then we don't get that feedback and then you had mentioned the guard rails and looking at them and honestly I think they're only going to work if

[00:40:00]
actually working and and to include you know when you have parents and teachers who take time out to sit on like interview boards and then there are recommendations are made and then they're not listened to it really feels like we as parents don't have a voice because whatever recommendations were making whether it's you know in a classroom level with hiring principles you know speaking about I have a special ed kid except for when we go when we talk to people at 8 p.m. that's when I feel like we're not heard and I know I have you know I've talked with board member before and it just feels like things get lost in the translation and I just I feel other people's frustrations as well and so I know you're supposed to listen to the community and then you take it to the superintendent but the feedback coming back is

[00:41:00]
hacking and the the clear picture of okay you've got these goals but they're big and they're lofty and they're very broad how do you how does that translate that's I feel like what we're missing right now I'm missing piece good afternoon I'm sorry I'm late to the party I'll stay after Barbara Medina and I have the honor of serving as the board president for Christine Duncan Heritage Academy or a K-8 dual language I'd like to speak briefly to the goals I've spent 19 years in the classroom and the last 20 years as an administrator retiring as College president and what I want to share with you about your goals is first of all I would like us to measure growth that students making their progress rather than status in the Square State up north where I served as the assistant commissioner for Innovation and transformation for 6

[00:42:00]
we moved Colorado to a growth model we also had a read act and in that redact we moved from a 7 or 13% Proficiency in Reading to Colorado was now 7th in the nation in Reading how do we do that we communicated with one another about what reading is and how it's taught the students who are dual language Learners not just monolingual English speakers and you have to be attentive to that so measuring reading in English is rather problematic because any Test in English is a test of English my favorite author Stephen crash and says we spend so much time in this country weighing the cows and feeding them we have proven that Christine Duncan Heritage Academy that give me a focus on instructions and I'll have to admit it's through the pressure that we got for turn around and I'd like to recognize that find a road map back to

[00:43:00]
performance success success we are outperforming APS in a dual language K-8 that doesn't happen overnight it takes years so my second comment is that's why a growth model is so much important than a status having been a classroom teacher long ago and spending 7 years and 7th grade I can tell you that the purpose of assessment any assessment is to inform instruction when you're teaching in March and you give a test in April but you don't get results until September it's pretty hard to inform your instructions the purpose of assessment is to inform a teacher's instruction of children those large scale assessments and believe me I have so many committees it would make your eyeballs roll back your head have to confess that I served and testified before Congress when the nclb law was coming into

[00:44:00]
I'm older than dirt I've seen States like Iowa Alice they never gave the test of Iowa basic skills we had a Calamity because no state in this country other than Massachusetts was going to meet the standard for leave no child untested or nclb we had to change the whole Federal framework because none of us were going to reach that homework why because we were looking at large-scale assessments that only part of the story of A Student Success I told you I'd be brief and so I'll go on to that in mathematics mathematics is a way of thinking it doesn't matter it's sort of language independent we can get students there but they need a lot of manipulative manipulative cost money and teachers need Training Center post secondary Readiness that square stayed up north to

[00:45:00]
diploma from high school you have to have 12 credits earned of dual credit so putting something very very specific into graduation requirements I think is important that's my point number for skills habits and mindsets we need those for teachers as much as we do for students and I would add the fifth goal respect every student's cultural and linguistic Heritage our kids are gifted they're gifted into language this may not always express themselves in a standardized test I meant an old teacher I think you might know the name McGraw-Hill and I met a young man and Grand Junction Colorado and third grade and he said he didn't think McGraw-Hill was so mean and I asked him what he meant and he was talking about Tim McGraw and Faith Hill but all he could read on his chest

[00:46:00]
does McGraw-Hill so when I met Mrs McGraw at the company in Monterey California I told her that story and she said to me as a former classroom teacher they never intended it to have the kind of power that states put into it and determining kids Futures so I would just cautious great to have goals make them smart goals make them specific make them measurable make them attainable and put a timeline on them that's what I would recommend thank you for your willingness to listen to the community because we don't always feel that now so before we get ready to move on I'm going to tell you like I love every word you just said and I love that you are not only speaking from experience but you're speaking from the heart and knowing that we have people here that truly care not just want to be here to for lack

[00:47:00]
better word raise a stink because I think it's easy to always say what's going wrong but to be part of the solution is critical and I want to acknowledge what you said I wanted to let you know you were heard and I admire you for your expertise the experience you bring to the field the way you have honored our students and our families and the outcomes that you are producing at your school should be congratulated should be recognized and I think you for your service and that was going on about Community engagement and not feeling heard and want to just point to our community engagement ad hoc members that we have here to I know there's a lot of intentional work going on because we do hear that a lot that we don't feel hurt as a community or a student or as parents so that is something that we are working on we have some

[00:48:00]
booklet that we put out and superintendent and board members are finding a way of how we can make that work where our conversations about how we represent our community and our constituents are being put back into the community so what is that next step so hopefully we will get that all figured out soon but it is something that we're working on and then the next thing that I wanted to just quickly touch on back again is our progress monitoring reports so how do the strategies and the coaching come back into the classroom that is what the team tells us in our progress monitoring reports and those are on the diligent website which is different from the aps.com website but we can stick around and show you how to get there but if you go to board meetings and board meeting notes and minutes it's there and you'll be able to see the progress monitoring Report with the strategies the root cause analysis that the team does as well as what their next steps are in order to not only help with what's going on if there's a problem

[00:49:00]
remember why they're successes when there is successes so just wanted to flag those things for you all I think we'll take one more on this topic and then we have we have we have a few more slides to get through so I'll be briefing about it again so I want to make sure that whatever space we're in individuals out of here in person or online still have access to understand what is being said and I know that's a priority for you all too I want to be mindful of the cute a few things to just question no answers requested student and family engagement is up to four period period period period period period period period period period how do they remain engaged throughout yes we said these schools being informed them but where are those places to pause to reflect to Pivot as needed

[00:50:00]
Maps we should based on the progress that we're seeing separately at the end of the day school leaders and campus teachers are our bread and butter leadership matters of the school level so once I'm buying right what is that buying and if they're not there how can we provide them with the skill set the networks the PD that they need so that they can be effective regardless of the student profile that they're serving whether that's Jen Eid special pop by lingual you name it like we're here for that and we're here to support that an advocate for that accountability essential right so this is a question yes for you all but like are you Dr Blake you too like we are here it's a community support the people that care show up at the end of the day and then lastly there's an election coming up their seats up for election within the APS school board how do we ensure that there's continuity and sustainability should there be

[00:51:00]
new voices and individuals in this space and how do we bring them on board to this long-term Vision no answers requested but just things to consider thank you thank you will you actually just gave me the perfect segue to our next slide which is how do we have continuity and given the fact that these are you know long-term goals and I think that the way that we have continuity amongst the board whether there are board members who stay board members who go new board members that come on and the way that we do that is that we have to make sure that we are acting effectively as a school board and so you can see up on the screen the way that we can really get to the heart of it and how the board is going to act to make sure that we improve our student outcomes is by these three clear practices and we've talked about it we have mentioned it but I just want to

[00:52:00]
kind of bring it back to a point that the way that we practice being effective as a board is to first set very clear goals ma'am over here you I mean you hit it smart goals our goals have to be measurable attainable realistic time bound strategic right like make sure that our goals are smart and so we have set very specific goals and again they are listed in in that pamphlet that you have and the reason being again it's about the the road trip hopefully none of us are actually going through Porter Rico to get to to the goals because that seems a little out of out of out of bounds but we want the entire system to be working towards the goals the next way that we do it as we establish guard rails and the guardrails are all listed in that document you have on the guardrails thank you over here for for mentioning our guard rails is that those are really where

[00:53:00]
we kind of we give the opportunity to the superintendent to say we want you to attain these goals but there are really certain things that you cannot that you have to stay Within These boundaries some of them are Equitable resources some of one of the goals is culturally and linguistically relevant high quality grade level material and those are things that you as a community have told us are important to you and so we have said in your attainment of these schools superintendent you have to make sure that you stay within the community's values in order to to reach those goals so we have we have established five guard rails and then board members store good point it out how we the the way that we make sure that we're reaching these outcomes is by monitoring our progress so we regularly review the data to track progress I don't know if any of you watched board meetings I don't know during covid they were long they were

[00:54:00]
TDS and didn't didn't really really focus on student outcomes so what we do now is we make sure that we are asking very specific questions to the superintendent to make sure that she is meeting Meeting those goals and that she is using strategies and that she is staying within the guardrails when she does that we think that discussing student outcomes is so important that we have actually set a board guard rail so there are the five guard rails that you all have listed in that document but within the board we have also established guardrails amongst ourselves and one of those guardrails is that we have committed that we will spend at least 50% of our public meeting time will be to focus on student outcomes because we want to make sure that as a board we are really focusing on what matters the most we don't want to get

[00:55:00]
did with what are the color of fences how many I don't know how many are buses things that are very important those are inputs but we have to make sure that we're focusing on what matters and that is what students know and are able to do so we're going to have some more discussion time which I think some of you have already pointed to but if you would like to add to this please let us know what do you all think it says about the board priorities if it's been more time on contracts than on student learning as an example and some of you have already pointed to it that you hear you some of you have said that you hear a lot about the inputs but you don't hear a lot about the outcomes

[00:56:00]
think about it we'll come back okay so I think some of you have probably heard that this whole model that we've been talking about it's really a way for us to be effective at the governance that we do to make sure that as a board We are continuing to focus on the outcomes and it's called student outcomes Focus governance it's making sure that we're focusing on on our students and what it more importantly means is that we do not act as individuals when we are on the board it means that we act as a unified board that is representing the whole community and that we are committed to long-term success and not just short-term noise so with that I'm going to turn it over to my friend so one thing that I really loved that Dr Blakey and her team have done is they've been very intentional about speaking of some of the positive success

[00:57:00]
things that are coming out of the district and when I see that I get butterflies I get really excited because as a product of APs myself and my girls I know amazing things can come out of our district and there's a lot of things we are doing alright so before we dive into that we want to show you a quick video that actually highlights some of the major successes we are having throughout our district growing up has always been a struggle for me so it hasn't been something that comes easily personally depends on what we're doing Mondays I have like a love-hate relationship with that the hardest part I honestly feel like it was some of the lessons and Financial

[00:58:00]
probably just like if I were to miss a day because of how much work we did in class every single day so we've seen quite a few students that have gone from you know two or three grade levels increase our sixth grade definitely showed the biggest growth improvement from the beginning of the year to the end of the year we always keep the bar really high and there's a certain expectation you know even when we talked to students from 6 to 7:00 to 8:00 you know we tell them the bar just keeps going higher and higher grade to sixth grade is like pretty much so I kind of just like just I think it's the the environment from the admin

[00:59:00]
listen to the staff to the students and to their families we you know really have everyone involved our teacher Ms toschi helped a lot so maybe that's part of why we got a big game we did a really good job of implementing the curriculum that was adopted by us this year and really relating the content to real life problems and then we just have a really strong culture and awesome teacher teachers are constantly doing things outside of the school day to make sure the students are having a good time feel welcome and get the best experience and I think that is a big contribution I wanted to understand

[01:00:00]
I don't like being confused in my classes and I don't like feeling like I'm behind and I really wanted to be ready for high school and high school they take algebra geometry and you know if we have students that are proficient in 8th grade math and the data shows that they're not going to be successful at Algebra 1 we want students to graduate high school and we want them to be successful Beyond high school and the program at least me to prepare myself to going into high school and college and like the real world it's not so hard for me anymore I feel like the beginning of the year

[01:01:00]
it helps me to understand how I would personally benefit from this other than just numbers on a page try and ask for help even though you're scared cuz asking for help helps you more I definitely grown to more not exactly like math but to understand it and tolerate it some credit like they will they will rise to the occasion I didn't know what like how to do anything stupid this year I learned how to do all of those things were really celebrating their successes and when you celebrate their successes they want to do better it's a lot more easy to follow and makes a lot more sense I feel like I'm a lot more confident on Spotify

[01:02:00]
it's hard to pinpoint one thing that we learned because we really did learn so much over the year that was a pretty powerful video when I saw it it just it brought it back home again why we're here and knowing that success is possible you know we heard it at the beginning where we always tend to hear some of the the negative output but seeing that we are seeing our students Miss Abby Miss Adeline actually make significant progress and not feel as a defeated as they did at the beginning of the year that reminds me why we do what we do you know so as you see that I want you to all think like why do you personally or what do you think really contributed to the improvements that we saw last year period why do we what

[01:03:00]
what do you think contributed to the Improvement we actually I think that's the question a lot of parents are asking that we would like to know when Mr Benavides mentioned their curriculum is that a curriculum that only that school adopted is that a curriculum that the entire district has adopted I have no idea you know are those teachers getting training in a curriculum are they getting the materials they need for it I don't know I couldn't tell from that video at all it was real cute but no it really didn't have those answers not up to us to say why do we think they succeeded it's up to you to tell us and and if those things are being when one school is succeeding are those being then transferred to other

[01:04:00]
that's one thing I don't hear a lot I hear stories about one class or one school that is having big success right she's mine but then I'm not hearing that that's being transferred to other other schools when something is working great questions and then before Raquel speaks her question is and I think you're probably going to go what we might say here my district for example I represent West Mesa High School and we have the schools in our area have not always performed the best and one thing that I have appreciated that doctor Blakey and her team have done is when we are seeing some schools that have been successful in getting some really positive results and outcomes they are now sharing their tips their techniques their strategies with the other schools and collaborating on a level that wasn't happening before I am personally seeing

[01:05:00]
some great outcomes from the schools that have been struggling because prior we were seeing a disconnect from one side of the district to the other and believe me it's very personal for me when I see my schools for I was raised where I live where I have my girls and not seeing the outcomes that I would want them to produce and just as recently within this last year I'm seeing Dr Blake in her team be very intentional with the strategies they're putting into place to ensure that we're no longer having those disconnects and Raquel will if you don't you could probably add to that as a teacher oh sorry Sean so this conversation has been really interesting to me being a school leader myself I think there's two different things right I think we're talking about goals and growth and that's one thing but I think the other piece is relationships and trust and I think that's the piece that is Maybe

[01:06:00]
seen and I don't think it's missing across the district cuz I see it like I see schools that are implementing the community school of strategy that are very open and but then there's other schools that maybe aren't as open and it's a it's a hard balance being a school leader being an educator because the day go like believe me there's not enough hours in the day but I think what I'm hearing just listening to everyone is there still this relationship and trust issue that is kind of putting a negative taste in people's mouths where the goals I think are you need goals right like you need to know how to get from point A to point B and then you need to know that not everyone's going to get the point A to point B in the same fashion but it does make sense to have them using the same method to get

[01:07:00]
like if we're all using Ferraris to get from point A to point B then that makes sense doesn't make sense sometimes to use the old Volkswagen bus and five other teachers are using the Ferrari and that's the curriculum right but sometimes we don't know I think what I'm hearing from the families and Community is that they don't know what that curriculum looks like what is what is that what vehicle are they using to get from point A to point B so I think that's important to maybe like start like yeah getting that information out there so and maybe even have an informational sessions at the schools where families and Community are welcome so that they can see which vehicle is going to help their kid get from point A to point B but yeah going back to some of this I just think it's that relationship and Trust

[01:08:00]
I think I mean I think for many years we didn't have goals so I think these goals are giving that framework and are they perfect probably not but I also don't think we I don't think you get rid of them like I think you keep you you stay the stay the course you may be a just because a lot of times what I've seen as you throw the baby out with the bathwater and you start over and then you never get you never make progress so that's just what I wanted to say so as a as a teacher and even as a parent sometimes like first thing first I do want to do what you said because I have noticed since our new superintendent there is more positive stories coming out on social media which is where we get a lot of our information from or family see what's happening in APS and I want to ack

[01:09:00]
Edge Dot and I'm like oh my God like that's so awesome that that's happening like I saw that don't already had this really cool taco truck thing last year and I was like oh my God that's so cool I love that you know and I would have never known that right families don't know that if if they don't know what's going on cuz they're not in the schools and so I do appreciate the leadership that we're going in that direction with putting more positive stories out there because there are wonderful things happening in APS but I do want to point out that we are still working with humans and it's human behaviors very hard to measure and their little humans and some of them not so little right but I work with little ones cuz I'm in elementary school but sometimes it's not always 30% growth I've had years that I've had 30% growth and then I've had other years we've only had 18 right and and some some years I'm taking the Ferrari and then some years I'm like you know what like we're barely going right like

[01:10:00]
running on empty and so it's I think I think just keeping that in the back of our minds is that it's important for us to have goals but not everything is always so 2 + 2 equals 4 we can't always measure success on i-Ready we can always measure success and are you know in the state test and so as teachers that's where we and I feel like the union and even our superintendent and the leadership has given us his teachers the ability to kind of build what that looks like and I apologize if your child's teacher has not made that clear to you because that in my opinion is a huge disservice to the family and makes me really upset because I know I go out of my way to make sure that my parents know what's happening in the classroom and I think that there is it's hard

[01:11:00]
because again we just it's not everything can be measured in the way that we would like and you know yeah but he taught them long division I'm like oh my gosh I don't even want to look at this test because I taught them this fraction you know here and there they don't perform right and maybe that day they had a bad day maybe they were just you know I don't know and there's lots of factors that we have to take into consideration because they're humans and it's not always linear learning is not always linear which is the issue that I have a little bit with the outcomes because it's not always when people tell me oh like you know that didn't you hear that and it makes me upset because I'm like I work so hard and just because my kids did not perform well on the end of your assessment does not mean that I did not do my job all year long right and I feel like sometimes that's the way it seemed because we

[01:12:00]
and I understand the need for looking at data there is a need for that and I'm really interested in more than what you have to say about the growth but anyhow that's all I have to say is that as teachers we have to use within our toolbox and every year that's a little bit different and we have to figure out what that is and their little humans so let's be kind of stuff probably a lot of parents would really know I understand that even if you're in a Ferrari you're going to come to stop signs a lot of times and you have your teaching the students that you have in front of you any given year so what happened the year that you have students that are performing the way you would like them to and and are struggling what resources do you do you get different resources in

[01:13:00]
to support you in those kids a lot of teaching is I feel like I'm a Puzzler because I am one year the puzzle comes out exactly the way I anticipated it and then the next year I'm like holy smokes like we this puzzle did not work out exactly the way I planned it and we didn't even finish half the puzzle but you know what the next year for me is always a new year so intense your question directly the district does provide us different curriculums to choose from and but the union gives us Authority in the classroom to be able to make decisions that are standard focused they have to meet the standards and they have to be rigorous like art material but we get to decide what that looks like and it can look like one year it could look like what's in a textbook in the next year it could not

[01:14:00]
do you have to as a teacher it's it's my job to figure out okay what went wrong and then like how can I make sure that doesn't happen again and so take us to answer your question you there is lots of support I will say there is lots of support for a different curriculums if I'm having a hard time and we have lots of collaboration in schools happening where we're like oh my gosh my kids are not getting long division and she's like my kids got it and last year this happened there was a wonderful strategy that this teacher found but that like was in China and I was like oh my God like because our kids were just not getting the long division last year and it was just last year like I've been teaching long division forever and it's always worked but last year we were having a really hard time and that strategy worked for those kids this year I will introduce the strategy the long division strategy in the way that I know and if it doesn't work then I go back to that toolbox and I pulled out what else I might know and so we do get support from each other as a community

[01:15:00]
I'm in schools but the district also provides support and that looks lots of different ways as well thank you for calling I think we have David that was next time I go back to I think the original question was what we thought contributed to the Improvement I think based on what I've heard from some teachers is that it's teaching to the test and that's something that their kind of stuck in the that's the only option really they have when it comes to meeting goals and to sing Improvement in their data and I think another thing which I think we should be more upfront about that I could quickly look up is that Grant Middle School has 11% in the gifted status in the gifted program and that's relatively High compared to middle schools that you would see in District 3 would have like

[01:16:00]
so I think understanding where it's starting at and they are a Title 1 school knowing what kind of supports they have they are a community school so they do have access to other resources anything taking all of that into account and really seeing how their basic needs are being met is important and it's definitely a part of what's what is being seen here and I think it's not a one-size-fits-all situation so I think being a little more up front about what is happening in the background instead of just saying here's this great thing that's happening like she said it's a cute story but I don't think it's the truth for a lot of kids

[01:17:00]
be the truth for a lot of kids and I don't think that we currently necessarily have an equitable distribution throughout our district I will say I will push back just a little bit though cuz Grant is right down the road from me and I know the types of kids that go to Grant Middle School and I know what they're going through they're awesome kids they're a lot of struggles 11% in the gifted is not high it's not what I heard from you this though and I'll recognize that this is a grant and this is not everywhere else but what I will recognize what I heard on that was I heard there's a high bar okay I heard that there are high expectations all right and when you when you hold kids and this is a high standard there it's amazing

[01:18:00]
are we need to believe in our kids in every school and I think I'm supporting what you're saying here I think we need to we need to support all of our kids in it in all of our schools believe in all of our kids and hold them all to a high bar to a high standard and it'll be amazing what they will achieve we need to have this equitably to this gentleman here so you were talking about you know the use of I think they use a lot of the term high-quality instructional materials for for curriculum I want to know if my kid has the Ferrari curriculum or if they have the Volkswagen right we we don't we don't get to know that there is a current list of high-quality instructional materials that are available on on the website but we don't know necessarily which schools are getting it and I have a hunch that it would be a little bit that the map would probably if you looked at the map of the district it could show you where certain schools have that the

[01:19:00]
Ferrari curriculum versus the Volkswagen curriculum parents need to know that so we can make the right decisions for our kids things by saying is very much in draft form and just to my friend over here more of a thought and a just a draft comment so please bear with me but so you mentioned earlier like relationships and trust and I've been that's really stuck with me as I'm listening to this whole conversation and then you mentioned like your responsibility as a teacher about keeping her parents informed and like you were very passionate like that's my job and as I'm listening to the discussion I wonder in a complex ecosystem like like this District that is very big and serves such a diverse constituency and you know where at what levels does relationship does relationship and Trust come into place and who's responsible

[01:20:00]
I'm like what does that look like at a level so hearing you talk about as a teacher what does that mean to your parents as a principal as assistant superintendent is superintendent is the board right like I don't know that even that narrative or the definition of relationship and trust is a one-size-fits-all idea at every level of this incredibly complex organization and I wonder as people who all care about the success of our students in this District like how we can help inform that and think about where those gaps are interested in relationship and also think about like what is that at the board level and really I think I appreciate this conversation to think about the role of the board the role of governance and like that answer might be a very different answer than like for somebody who's an individual teacher and so I'm just thinking a lot about that in the complexity of moving this incredibly important institution forward with students

[01:21:00]
Center of that energy and so I just wanted to share that thought because I was so touched by what you were saying about relationships and trust and then thinking about that in relationship to goals and outcomes in progress and how do those two things work in harmony I have no answers but just really want to share that like piggybacking too again the trust thing so I'm not an educator I work in construction and like our job as a general contractor is to build trust with project owners Architects like finding out what it is that that works for them what are we doing well what are we not doing well and this kind of goes back to to remember Jackson your question about is it like is how does it land that we're spending 50% of our time talking about student outcomes so we spent a whole lot of energy as a general contractor trying to build relationships and trust with decision makers only to realize subcontractors are where it's at if we don't have trust with electrical companies if we don't have trust with h

[01:22:00]
AC companies and site Constructors like then all of the work we're doing to build trust with decision makers Falls flat because we don't have trust at the other direction my point is and I don't have an answer either just something to think about you know we change I actually I was inspired by the 50% thing that you all were doing and I was like I'm going to spend 50% of my time doing you know building relationships and trust this way only to realize I was doing it wrong so perhaps it's something to take into consideration you can't spend 50% of the time talking about student outcomes without talking about Community engagement like parents I am like I'm leaving I'm the stereotypical mom who everybody thinks has it all together and I don't I'm sorry to wake you I love you I'm following you off a bridge emails like I don't I don't go to the meeting and I don't you all the things that were saying this is what we do to engage the community and I'm tired I don't

[01:23:00]
I want to do it so so what I do in subcontractor relationships when I don't know how to how do I how do I build a relationship with you I asked them what is what are the other General Contractors doing that you like what what are they doing that you wish all General Contractors were doing and by asking those questions of of you know the people in my industry they're building trust I'm building trust and I'm getting in like I'm learning from my neighbor so really like I would say how are successful school districts engaging parents and teachers I know that Union is complicating a lot but like you got to build trust with those with the teachers and the family because we can't talk about how successful our students are without the other two legs of the stool wasn't sure it was my turn yet or not you know it's funny you say that because all night I've been thinking

[01:24:00]
look at the size of this room look at how many empty chairs there are and look at the size of the aps population and if we had parents and teachers and Community I mean this place should be we should meet need a much larger room so building relationships is huge it's me and you are the exception to the rule or any other other teachers that are in here are the exception and you know we look at that I'm kind of all over the map of my thinking but the video it does show to schools that are having success and then you had mentioned that there's starting to be some more sharing among programs and I am I'm a former middle school math teacher from Indiana I'm a military wife we finally have settled here I've seen a lot of different School corporations run a lot of different ways I have kids

[01:25:00]
vote on the gifted Spectrum I have a severely special ed child who just finished the transition program I have experience amongst the whole thing and yes I'm also and I and I cringe when I said I'm a liquid mom and it usually comes with like this black X like oh you you don't have a voice because you don't get it and I'm sorry I get it from the standpoint of my experience and my background and our school is not perfect it has a lot of its own issues it still needs to have better communication better support Butler leadership there's Improvement needs everywhere and it goes back to that very first question that you have and I think back and I go you know what why does APS exist why does any school corporation exists and my mind it was to provide an exceptional learning environment

[01:26:00]
promote excellence in all children and so when I hear that we're starting to share ideas I'm honestly flabbergasted because if that program is working at those two schools that should come from the top down that this is what needs to be implemented if this is what we see success and yes I get teachers as a teacher I have you know you have I understand it's not always that way but that's the standard and the expectation that we need to set and that we as a community need to expect from APS is where are the weather in APS Middle School whether it's in a Colorado school weather wherever it is where are we seeing students meeting these outcomes and how do we replicate that and how do we share that with all schools in APS because yes do I want the best education and teachers and resources for my children absolutely but I want it for all the

[01:27:00]
is an APS all the kids in New Mexico because my future is dependent on these kids having good outcomes so it should be shared so anyway I want also be mindful of time cuz we are based on what we had announced we only have 5 minutes left of today's session but we are also going to stay at the end and we will stay as long as needed to be able to answer any questions and you know walk you through any additional thoughts that we didn't get to cover but I also want to be respectful for everybody who expected to end at 7:00 and just be mindful of the time so what I'm going to do I'm just going to run through one action step that we have here and then we will open it up again for questions so people need to leave I can be respectful for their time as well okay so one thing you'll see two on your everybody's tables there are these little cards

[01:28:00]
these little yellow cards at your table and it asks for what we what we're calling are the three days so what we invite you to do tonight is we want you to reflect on these three different options and to jot down a response for each one so the first one we have here is we want you to be able to ask like what's one question you still have that's pressed that you've always had and you need an you need an answer for it this is been priority for you and we want to make sure that we address this as quickly as possible for you secondly what advice what's one suggestion you would have for APS I like how said to where she said we're doing with humans that's the same thing for everybody within the district within the board within the cabinet and superintendent and her team you are dealing with humans and sometimes there's because we deal with human nature we may miss the mark and we need to know too from you

[01:29:00]
is people who are in the community who are directly impacted by the choices we make as a district what is what's one particular suggestion that you have for us at APS another one this was it this one's big for me is I asked you what's one way you can partner with us because I think of many times when I address my girls and they come to me with an issue or a problem I said okay I heard you now it's also talked about how we're going to fix it and what's the solution because I want them to be critical thinkers I want them to be able to problem solve for what's happening within their life and be able to make proper Life Choices my girls range from 9 years old to 26 and it's very broad they think very differently and it's critical that I'm raising humans that can also problem solve and be able to be part of the solution versus just the problem so when we ask you this tonight what's one way you can partner with us we truly mean that I am committed

[01:30:00]
to changing The Narrative of people feeling like APS never listens I remember when we joined the board just a few years ago that was my concern as well that was part of the reason why I said I wanted to be part of the change and not just be part of the problem that continue to happen and we want to change that narrative it's not happening overnight it's not even happening in a year because these are habits that have been established for decades so it's going to take a moment to change this whole ship and get it on a new Direction but we do it together we do it by partnering we do it by listening and and I'll tell you this from from me and my fellow board members here we never want you to feel like we're just having these listening sexist sessions just to check the box cuz I don't want to waste my time and I don't want you to ever feel like you're wasting your time and if that is ever happened to we have made you feel like that I apologize because we are a team we're here to do what's best for our

[01:31:00]
children what's best for our district and to point it in the right direction we shouldn't be on opposing forces by any means we should be able to come to a common understanding and always always do what's best for our students so I will give you just you know just another minute or so to finish writing your final thoughts on there and as we wrap up is there anybody who wants to just share what they wrote on their card on either one the ask the advice or the action go ahead and did you want to OK Google I just want to say this to all of you who are here especially to parents really sorry for not listening or not taking your concerns your hearts and I hope moving forward

[01:32:00]
that your voices are heard but we need you at the table we need your voice because I can tell you as a parent I had my children in the richest school district in the nation and it was Fairfax Virginia the opportunities that that District gave me as a parent and what they taught me I took that and carried on to work for the biggest school district and to have my children in Denver Colorado and Jefferson County Schools the opportunities for parents there help me learn and help me to dress and help me to realize that we have to change our bullying policy and I got help from a principal on how to do that I apologize for not giving parents the tools they need to be the voice and to stand up for their children

[01:33:00]
being heard I've worked in special education and the heartache of so many parents when they come crying to you when a school district is not doing the right thing it's sickens me parents voices are valuable they are part of this team my mother told me and she and she worked as a door manager and a boarding school she didn't have college but she said to me the only way you're going to influence a child is through the parents you cannot leave them out so I hope moving forward has a board member that I create that position for you to sit at that table because you need a voice Community yeah but parents need that voice and I

[01:34:00]
cuz I sit at this table and I want to include you too because we're not going to shift this paradise for these children until we hear your concerns until we hear what's going on in those schools because I'm hearing a lot and it's hard strictly because an advocate for kids with disabilities for the years I've been that when the idea says that part parents are available part of an IEP the law says that as it says that all the laws in education say parents are viable it's now time we shift that but I'm sorry as a board member or not valuing that voice the way it needs to be so thank you

[01:35:00]
as we get ready to wrap up I just want to allow one or two people just to be able to share on what we had on our postcards and then we're going to get ready to wrap it up for tonight thank you Ronaldo thank you I haven't written anything yet but I just want to say this is such a great start because these are open-ended questions you're not guiding what we need to say it's not yes or no it's not a scale of one to five like this is how we can voice what we need to say so thank you this is huge so thank you for these three simple questions that's another I'm serious like this is the first time I've seen this from APS so maybe that's my limited experience but thank you for this and I just want to say one little thing about going back to curriculum it's not just the quality of curriculum it's

[01:36:00]
my son went through three different curriculums in grade school it was impossible for him to learn math and he had a math mind but the curriculum changing and I'm not sure if those were the forces of in a private Enterprise trying to make money on our school system I'm not sure what it was but the curriculum kept changing sometimes it's just go with what you got and work work is special thank you I'll take one more over here yeah this is fantastic thank you guys for this I am a community impact coordinator on the west side and so I think one of the things talking about relationships and Trust that's already being done on all the schools it really is but that is the center of what community impact coordinators do is building relationships and so I encourage you guys as board members to partner with the community impact coordinators because we are on the ground we're Gathering data we're talking to families

[01:37:00]

let me hear your voice and make sure that you feel heard and as you've seen this is very emotional work right this is not just a check the box and we're done and we we gave you the information that's it these are our students right we feel that way we feel like every single one of the person that walks into a school we have to make sure that they feel that they're accepted we may have to make sure that they're actually learning something and when they leave those schools that they have the tools needed to actually be able to live their life to the fullest right and that can mean career that can be in college that can mean whatever it is to that person but every student is our student and it's difficult with so many students to make sure that gets done the way that somebody might want it to look so it does come in different shapes and sizes so that's why these things are so important and you coming to events are so important and there's always public forum that we want you to come and speak to us and please please reach out to us because we come to you as well
