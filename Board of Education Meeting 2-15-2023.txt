[00:08:00]
expecting different results when we have the empirically proven strategy of restorative practices within our reach how much more harm to students faculty and our community will it take for our priorities to shift all of our students deserve to feel like there are people in their communities who hear them respect them and care of respect them and care about them by only increasing security measures in our schools and not addressing actual root causes we communicate a message to our students that they are dangerous and untrustworthy we teach our students that they are criminals as we make their schools into prisons it's no wonder that so many students are acting accordingly thank you thank you for next speaker is Ruth Porta

[00:09:00]
go to 2 minutes once you begin speaking man this afternoon Spanish Immersion preschool in New Mexico and also the first to be nationally up by the National Association for the education of Virginia in 2021 New Mexico was ranked the 499 in education in 2022 it was New Mexico early childhood education Washington so the question is what is that description

[00:10:00]
cool choice that in your early childhood education there is a mixed delivery between private providers and public education parents can choose which early childhood education center can go if APS is if APS bills the 1400 Sports in early childhood education what is going to happen there's going to be a Max Exodus of our Educators from private providers and that will make a child can increase so I'm coming here to voicemail about the early childhood education center at 8:00 to build so what is going to happen we are going to be a things as a private providers city of private providers give our New Mexico children will be extinct and then I want to go

[00:11:00]
go back to APS to rank 15 in the nation instead of 10 please consider not approving those 14,000 US Postal APS 692 to open Facebook thank you man or next speaker is Sarah Newton you have two minutes once you begin speaking I have been a mother of APs students for almost 20 years my oldest girl graduated last year I have a girl in high school and speaking today in regards to what I believe is failure to comply with New Mexico education laws from 2019 title bullying prevention policies less than a year ago my daughter was threatened by assault with a fellow students

[00:12:00]
we went to the school on Monday and were given a safety plan a week later she was beaten and assaulted while having lunch in the cafeteria which was what she was told to do according to her safety plan there were no adults in the cafeteria this assault was filmed and shared online it has traumatized our entire family we were told there would be a secret hearing regarding the outcome with no questions answered this is against the law my daughter transferred high schools and had one good semester before the video resurface suddenly she was viewed as a Target by bully students students she did not know sent her messages all weekend telling her to kill herself again I want to the school administration and was told I am not allowed to know anything my daughter's advice was to not go to the bathroom by herself and that mediation cannot be forced up on the police I have been told APS can do nothing about fight videos taking on their property this is a dereliction of

[00:13:00]
I believe it is Criminal and I am demanding that all of you as the authorities do something about it I plan to speak here today last week on Sunday in New Jersey girl so much like my daughter named Adriana killed herself because of the humiliation and lack of Justice regarding the fight video that she was a victim of this child suicide is for National debate and provided many appalling statistics I expect you to take down any internet videos of children being beaten and bullied on your property I believe it's criminal for you to do nothing which is what you're doing now I plan to be a regular attendee of these meetings thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on zoo Stephanie Maelstrom when you begin speaking you'll have two minutes members of the board thank you for listening my name is Stephanie walstrom I'm a teacher at Whittier APS child

[00:14:00]
find is a gift for students if utilize properly it is the way to identify are struggling Pre-K students and begin early interventions even before they enter kindergarten for many students this early intervention could be the difference between them one day graduating high school or not Title 1 schools such as Whittier and Emerson have a costly problem students and families often miss child find screenings which leads to missed early interventions this year I've had six students I have appointments for variety of valid reasons screeners lost over 12 hours of screening time with these missed appointments and Emerson has had even more students missing their screening multiple times poverty is real struggling families black transportation and when they missed work they lose pay this is dissuading homelessness

[00:15:00]
what is also a very valid problem facing our families I know that if students wait until kindergarten to begin this that process it takes years for them to begin receiving Services APS made a decision to not send child find screeners to our schools I think this was a very costly mistake as when screeners have no shows the district loses money what is worse when Pre-K students don't get screened students lose out on much-needed interventions research has shown that every dollar spent on early childhood education is equal to 10.00 in remedial savings later I recommend we consider this policy and begins sending our screen size with multiple students needing to be screened I think we would identify more students remove a burden for our struggling families say lots of time and money and most importantly make sure our students receive the services they're entitled to and as early as

[00:16:00]
possible if screeners go to school sites I promise you will not only help children but you'll see ample cost savings and eventually I believe a higher graduation rate thank you for listening and I hope that this feedback helps you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Donna Fletcher you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you thank you for having me president thank you thank you I'm talking about the right sizing issue and I was astounded when I opened the Albuquerque Journal and the Articles stated that APS was considering repurposing and renovating some low enrollment schools into classrooms for 3 and 4 year olds I was shocked

[00:17:00]
before APS starts adding new young children don't you think that APS needs to improve and focus on the educational outcomes of the current Albuquerque Public School students don't you think APS should focus on quality education instead of the number of students we have many low performing schools and families are transferring their children to better schools whatever better means why are these schools low performing why do the schools have low enrollment I am sure there are several reasons but we need to know those reasons so that we can problem solve and fix these low performance to transfer to other schools is not the answer we need to find Solutions and fix the problems and all the kids through 12s APS needs to focus on the existing 12 students to ensure

[00:18:00]
play a reading by third grade and succeeding with all their learning adding three and four year olds is not the answer to improve an educational outcomes for children in APS and when I say we I mean we parents family teachers it's not all on the teachers it's all of us because we need to make some changes thank you thank you ma'am or next speaker is on zoom and it is Gail Stewart when you begin speaking you'll have two minutes thank you so much I wanted to speak to you tonight I feel like I have talked to the board about this before but it's time for a reminder

[00:19:00]
images of 5 and 14 in the United States Tourette syndrome is a neurological condition characterized by involuntary motor and vocal tics which may include coprolalia the utterance of socially inappropriate phrases ticks are the result of a neurological condition I want to repeat that ticks are involuntary that's what people need to understand students who have Tourette's Syndrome or tic disorder attend every single campus in the Albuquerque Public Schools Albuquerque Public Schools staff are uniformly not knowledgeable about as a result of the failure to mandate training for staff with excluded from classrooms and School attendance consider that these students are intentionally disruptive and willfully non-compliant and neither one of those things is true

[00:20:00]
Albuquerque Public Schools has been institutionally aware of the need for staff education about Tourette Syndrome since 1999 almost 25 years and my personal experience yet APS staff continue to not understand the condition and the students are routinely being punished for text they are routinely being excluded from classrooms and Public School attendance for ticks which are involuntary and are a part of their neurological condition this is in violation of federal discrimination laws and it's harmful to our community it hurts these kids to keep in mind that there is an Albuquerque Public Schools for the adults in charge to understand disability many disabilities

[00:21:00]
including Tourette Syndrome because those kids are being excluded thank you so much thank you our next speaker is in person Gabrielle wheeler you'll have two minutes after you begin speaking hi greetings this is actually the second meeting to 3 and 4 year olds and take up these 14,000 slots I'm not sure if you're aware but that could actually decimate The Early Child Care Centers in Albuquerque who just recently survived covid you would also and I think it would be unintentional but probably are employees would migrated over to the centers and it could cause us to go through another

[00:22:00]
prices of not having enough employees I come from an early Child Care Center that I took from a two-star to a five-star our kids are reading they're writing in at 4 years old we work hard at our program and we're producing results and I just don't understand why they would take the three and four year olds from from us now this happened in Oklahoma where they took the three three and four year olds and put them in the public schools and what happened is 40% of the private centers close so what happened is you lost infant and toddler care and that they still have not recovered that back another thing is that we don't understand just looking at my notes is that there is a no touch policy for APS when you have three and four year olds they need a nurturing environment if a teacher can't change him or touch them that's not going to

[00:23:00]
conducive to their to their upbringing you cannot compare Early Child Care teachers to K through 12 they are entirely different and we cannot Rob these children of their childhood just hearing these testimonies of so many high school students and so many parents I think APS has enough on its hands that they don't need the three and four year olds thank you thank you ma'am next up is Laura Vickers 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening I work at West Mesa High School as a 9th grade teacher and we still haven't really seen any changes on our campus we keep asking for more security

[00:24:00]
there are still things happening on campus that we as teachers have no control over masses of people in the bathroom smoking you know 20 one person trying to correct 20 people it's just it's not safe we did get some police officers from the City of Albuquerque to come in and I guess they briefed today but I don't know we were teaching class so we really couldn't be at the briefing but I'm glad that they're there thank God for them last year we had five security guards one SRO currently we have three security guards and two Westeros and close to 2000 kids kids are leaving you are losing them to Charter Schools because they don't feel safe and it's just we just don't have enough manpower we keep

[00:25:00]
asking and we keep not seeing anything and people keep saying you know what it's just not possible but I think it's possible because I don't see that APS is done anything to advertise or to make it appealing to come and protect children and staff 16 bucks an hour to come put your life on the line it's just it's ridiculous we need a full-time Crossroads counselor which is a Substance Abuse Prevention intervention and harm reduction program for APS high school students oh yeah we have definitely drug deals going on and we don't have anybody there we need help we need it now and this like I said it's been 6 weeks so where is the help that's all I got to say thank you our next speaker is a Franken

[00:26:00]
the first name is bhaji did I get it right 2 minutes when you begin speaking now hi good afternoon thank you so much for this opportunity to present my name is a badger Rankin I hold a master's degree and a doctoral degree in early childhood education and I've been in the field for 50 years my wife here testifies to the length of service I started actually when I was 5 years old when I got a baby brother but in any case I am here to speak also for the right size and issue and to talk about the importance of parent choice and the treasure that we have in New Mexico and in Albuquerque of the mix delivery system when Pre-K started it started on the spirit of equal 5050

[00:27:00]
between public schools and community-based early childhood programs a partnering together where where ped and then CYFD but now the Early Childhood Department can learn and share with each other I think that is a treasure of New Mexico especially in the whole state but and I'll speak about Albuquerque right now the diversity that exists in Albuquerque of languages and cultures and people with who would choose different things for their parents who will choose and want to choose a place where they feel is best of the best fit for them for their family for their child so we are blessed in Albuquerque with this Rich diversity of indigenous people African-American people Asian people white people Hispanic

[00:28:00]
people this and more the whole diversity of the state with a different languages and cultures and that to me needs to be represented and and made full by a strong mixed delivery system where parents and families have the choice of what Center what program what school they want to put their children in so thank you again for the time to express my opinion and I I look forward to keeping the next delivery really strong thank you so much thank you ma'am our next speaker is Adriana Solis you'll have two minutes once you begin to a shelter in places on campus for the time being and

[00:29:00]
when the gun went off in class on campus police presence increased again how often will this happen before something is done about it in my eyes to be safe at school would be to have more security and better cameras having more security and having better cameras would help benefit the schools because then we wouldn't have so many unseen places on campus there's a lot of blind spots that the students go to do drugs by drugs do illegal things on campus and if we have more security and more cameras then that's more coverage at schools I have four younger siblings going into High School very soon I don't want them living in constant fear of having guns on campus they deserve a safe for learning environment I don't want them I don't want the same feeling my mom and many other parents feel when they get the call please change starts here in this

[00:30:00]
take into consideration my peers and Educators and please help make our schools safer for future generations and not just us thank you thank you or next speaker speaker is Leo Puerta Karen Hill is next to 2 minutes here and I want to look at it from the perspective of security right now you are being given red flags about security issues at the schools that you are currently in charge of securing kids are coming here to give you this red flags you know historically if we look at Columbine the single point of failure

[00:31:00]
what is the adults who failed to listen to the kids please don't become that same single point of failure right now if you cannot secure 617 year olds who are comparatively easier to secure let me tell you you cannot you are not ready to secure three or four year olds they have to be secured at a much higher level because I don't think anybody here with you three or four year olds not only could face external threats but potentially left to the wrong devices they are a threat to themselves because of lack of experience much by massively well-developed sense of curiosity and adventure and so please listen to what is your name they are running red flags of people do not ignore them and do not bring them for years because you are not ready for that thank you thank you sir

[00:32:00]
connect speaker is Karen vigil 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you period

[00:33:00]
everyday thing it's just part of what it is change change change change change change and I'm hoping that sorry I'm hoping that that sorry but that would be a great thing to cuz I know they have as much emotional and physical insecurity with all the challenges they've had

[00:34:00]
issues and safety and yeah so that's all I have to say but thank you very much thank you thank you our next speaker is Francisco Francisco

[00:35:00]
visual dialogue that spans from pre-columbian times to the day it is an epic composition that depicts the people and the history of the Southwest it includes people such as Soledad Travis Tacoma who was the first woman to be governor in 1924 I graduated of Albuquerque High School and it also has people like Demetria Martinez it has Valerie web how to meal who happened to have been the first position that tells the whole what's happening in the southwest for the last over 500 years I would like to see if anybody if you haven't seen the mural I would like to invite you that I can give you an interpretation of the bureau and I would like to also maybe

[00:36:00]
play include some other friends of mine who are very concerned about this project being halted it should have been going on since October and it's already going to be March and I have not put a brushstroke on that wall in the beginning I started in 1976 this project I did it for free for for and then a few years a few years back they they did some Renovations and they included more wall space and I've been working on it now if I was to get paid a dollar for every brushstroke that I put on that wall I would be a billionaire or maybe a trillionaire but here's the point is that I would like to see if maybe we can set up a time so we can have this discussion while we look at the mirror so I can give you an interpretation and translate with the images about thank you thank you sir our next speaker is

[00:37:00]
Teresa good morning myself

[00:38:00]
the reason that I became involved with organizing against gun violence or you know campus safety whatever this is taking on with the section now Group is because I love my students and I want the world for my students and I want them to go out to be able to accomplish whatever it is that they set their minds to and as I sit here in the audience and I always start like rooting for everyone that's in the audience because everyone takes their personal time out of their evenings to come up here and speak their hearts and speak to the things that they're passionate about and I'm hearing that there's just not enough Staffing like there's just not enough people to be on the ground with her kids loving and caring for them and putting forth the effort that are students deserve you know the absorption of early childhood education into APS like great but where is the staff going to be on that you know like right now you have a skeleton crew working at the majority of your schools and they're being run dry

[00:39:00]
play you have like I have another 20 years cuz I'm going to retire from West Mesa right but I will lose all the teeth out of my head I will lose my sanity I lose everything because there's just not enough support we need security guards we need a full-time truancy social worker we need a full-time Crossroads counselor because that's what our kids deserve and I understand that there may be a shortage of money or funds or whatever that is but you have students and teachers and staff and community members that are coming here every other week to speak on their own time because they want to sit down and they want to work with APS they want to be there with you coming to a solution discussing some of our issues and it's not going to be a short-term immediate solution it's going to take some time and you have people that have dedicated like years and years and years their careers to this and they want to make it better like there's no teacher or staff member student that really wants anything like negative or bad we want Solutions and then like

[00:40:00]
that breaks my heart but that shouldn't have happened right there should be systems in place that are working and effective and because the staff isn't there like how are we going to solve this and I'm sorry I hear you I hear you telling me that I'm good but yeah security Crossroads counselor full-time full-time truancy social worker and not pulling it from other schools and robbing them of their resources making sure that we're making this you know appealing to the public because these are their kids hi my name is William poker I'm here to talk about fate today was my little brother's IEP he has Down syndrome and we were informed there was a

[00:41:00]
Asian policy in October that now limits is a tendency to 4 years after he gets his diploma unless he has specific needs that need to be met by Highland campus this is directed violation of Faith what a guarantees is that anyone with a certain set of disabilities is allowed to stay through the age of 21 and this is a right to stay and continue education whether or not they have a diploma the only time where this is an exception is if they receive a general Ed diploma which requires all of the proper credits and test to pass a general education diploma Charlie cannot do that and so this is this policy change is a direct violation of Fate I highly recommend looking into it because this is a fairly major infection these students do have a right to be among their peers for as long as it's guaranteed as well for I do want to give thanks to all the other speakers here and one thing that I do want all of the mind is that

[00:42:00]
a lot of this is money Focus this is why this happened to my child is that they want to push him out because they don't have the funds to adequately support special needs that is the purpose of this and this very specific instance has the higher legal whereas the others are simply effective this is why we're doing the right sizing which is functionally downsizing this is why we don't look at the outcomes because in order to actually fix what's going on in our classrooms it would cost a lot more money than it would be to just close the schools down in general this goes in with security I don't know if you've tried to be stoned for eight hours a day I sure you it's not fun the only time you would do it is if you want to mitigate the pain of being in your current environment and so what does this means that these students are acting out doing other things smoking in the bathroom you know for 20 minutes at a time because they'd rather do that than be in your classrooms and what in order to fix this we as a district need to actually reassess what it is that we're looking for in our classrooms how does the teaching whether or not wearing our students to be creative and allowing our teachers to help them be creative

[00:43:00]
all of this is is interconnected and a lot of it flows in the budget and we're heading towards a fairly large shortfall due to climate change and oil money running out we have got to figure out how to get all these things under board with a sufficient budget because we're not going to have all the money that's why we're in Early Education we're trying to get them the funding from them as well thank you keep in mind that there are meetings on the redistricting I was just at one please show up if you do need a protest do protest because I assure you the board doesn't really care thank you thank you sir our next and last speaker is Evan videos once you begin speaking

[00:44:00]
hello my name is Evan Barrios I'm from West Mesa a sophomore and I would just like to say that what we need in West Mesa is more security guards because since our school is like getting less more training with other students were in kitchens and just start hurting each other and that just puts lives at risks for another for another one we should add is full-time social workers and full-time Cross Road counselors and that's all I just want to say thank you sir and board that does conclude public forum thank you I just want to say

[00:45:00]
thank you to the guests for coming here tonight and speaking to us as it snowed in the policy directive you get to we get to listen to what you say but we're going to continue on with our with our agenda so thank you so much for coming in tonight so our next item for consideration it's going to be approval of our consent calendar items but I believe we're going to pull out item be too and so why don't we go first to the discussion on item B2 and then we'll go with the consent calendar pieces so I'm just going to open it up for a conversation on B2 I'll go first okay okay okay and yeah so the the reason I asked that it be pulled from consent is because I had some Community feedback this morning and I thought that it was important to just to kind of discuss this because it is

[00:46:00]
such a large amount of money and I feel it's very important that we are diligent with the taxpayer with our taxpayer funding so I think what would probably be most helpful is if we had and this is certainly for me maybe a refresher on the the procurement process and specifically I was wondering what kinds of questions are asked during the procurement process that can assess whether or not the taxpayer funding is being protected and used wiseley okay so I can answer that and I'll at any time to renette okay so we'll start with the Karen is renette in the room yes she is oh you

[00:47:00]
beginning with advertising the project also getting proposals in and having an evaluation method for construction we actually have the evaluation factors spelled out in the New Mexico administrative code and they have evaluation factors such as past Performance Management plan

[00:48:00]
project Staffing and crafts labor capabilities health and safety and then we can add to them Financial capabilities project schedule and contract warranty so all of the proposals that the contractor submit they go through this evaluation by different committee members so I want to go through the evaluation their ranked and whoever comes up with the highest ranked is the successful contractor okay sorry did you have anything you wanted to add before I ask myself so I guess one of the answers that I that I received back is that there are Prov

[00:49:00]
to protect APS against General conditions project timelines and that we do not pay for services until they are completed verified and approved is that that's correct in any of our projects there's always going to be risked so we always try to mitigate the risk to the best of our ability so we are asking for different types of bonds that the contractor has to have on material bonds also in the contracts we put permissions for timelines there's also Provisions if there's a breach and also a cure for the breach we never pay for services until they have been completed verified and accepted so we do have like I said in the

[00:50:00]
and in the bondsman Insurance to protect the district and in this particular procurement process because we're using the Department of Defense is is in on it how does the Department of Defense do they participate in the procurement process or in the selection what is what is their role in the selection of the vendors so we have to ensure that we follow the uniform guidance which is very similar to the procurement code and then they also have also Provisions that are part of the RFP documents which become part of the contract that also mitigate the risk so when they give us the funds they want us to ensure that we do follow

[00:51:00]
the Federal Regulations okay so they they participated in the sense that they were following their own set of regulations that we follow theirs that you that we follow their regulations okay okay so I guess like the the big the big overall question is that this feels like the board is being asked to approve a huge 42 million dollar contract right but what is the actual role of the board in this instance do are we approving the entire contract policy you are proving these funds the actual contract and awarded the contract is in compliance with the procurement code and the federal regulations and

[00:52:00]
the contract selection is through those processes so the board is actually approving per the for policy is the expenditure of the 40 million 424 429 okay so so our role the board's role is only to approve the funding and then what happens just playing this out what happens if the board does not approve the funding do we go back to we go back to the drawing board to go to the next person on the list what happens if we followed it and evaluation and ranking actually shows the awarded contractor

[00:53:00]
so if you didn't award the expenditure if it doesn't affect the outcome of the evaluation committee because that was the outcome of the evaluation per the factors okay and if so if this again very much feels like we play a particular role where the governance role and we leave the management role to you right so if community members are members of the public had questions and not only about this but even going forward about procurement issues who can they contacted Communications office and put in a and everything that we do is public record and her the procurement code we have to keep certain documents and document

[00:54:00]
so I guess for all of you do you feel confident about the selection process that you had all the information you needed to have to award this contract through these procurements for many years all of these are laws they've been held up in court of law and we follow the letter of the law when we do these selections these Awards thank you any other

[00:55:00]
discussion I do so then bottom line is everything went according to the right the right process everything was followed and if we would choose not to approve the award it would still go forward anyway if we didn't vote to spend the 47 million dollars it would still go forward because the process was followed it might not go forward because the funding wouldn't be approved even though the process was followed okay well I mean I would just add I mean in terms of like procurement rules and laws so we have to follow them so if if it's if it wasn't approved essentially the only thing we're not approving is the funding for the project and the

[00:56:00]
protests that would be an opportunity for for some push back because we did not it's it's kind of like a failure it's a breach because we actually followed the procurement process in this and so that would open us up for that kind of of an opportunity with the contractor at this point to to sort of take us to task or to to say to cry on that and it would be it would be good for us to know exactly what would happen from the legal perspective I think that's something that I would want to know because everything was followed and so what would happen if it wasn't approved legally what can happen to what can happen to us so I think that's something maybe that we need to have a discussion maybe at another time but then I just have a follow-up to a couple of the questions that I had asked and

[00:57:00]
didn't have a chance to probably get some of them answered so I know we're going from 65,800 square feet to 88465 sq ft and that 65000 is inclusive of the Portables that are on the campus right now so we're adding 22,845 more square feet in a time when we're supposed to be right sizing and so my question was why and that was kind of answered but the question the follow-ups are that because we were going to save money in efficiencies so I would like to know what those efficiency savings are you know even an estimated monthly how are we going to save as compared to what the building is doing now and I know that's a really old building so I'm assuming a lot of the savings would come from utilities

[00:58:00]
that's just my that's just my assumption so I would like to know that then I was also told that you know they looked at all the schools and said this one was going to be slated for you know a rebuild and that there were inadequate inadequate spaces so what does that mean which spaces were in adequate at that at that bill you know and that building that's currently there and so I didn't get an answer to that and then also that one of the other reasons for the why you know adding 22,000 more plus more square feet is that it didn't mean aps's square footage requirements that we didn't meet them so do we have what are those requirements for an elementary school okay so I think we got three questions in there so I was going to say can we start with like the first one

[00:59:00]
why are we going to why are we adding the additional square feet and I think go ahead salary so Madam chair members of the board the the current facility is inadequate it doesn't mean our current design standards nor does it mean the department of defense's current standards for education and the Department of Defense is basically as you alluded to basically they have done a study of all the US school buses across the world and have ranked them and this one finally the number came up and so they're trying to get some sort of equality right so they want to be able to

[01:00:00]
do any military person stationed anywhere has equal some sort of equal or comparable the adequate schools so when they move from country to Country the schools are all pretty much on par physically with each other and of course they have different security requirements for their schools as well and then in terms of the actual facilities so our guidelines have changed a lot right now we have full-time art and music and most things are in this

[01:01:00]
not so great kitchen cafeteria even though we had done some work on it about 10 years ago I could go on and on the square footage of the classrooms are probably not adequate they probably don't have specialized Tinder or Pre-K classrooms that meet the current standards so this will definitely needs an overhaul you know it's built in the 50s so then somewhere it's been what the square foot requirements are that APS has so is that bass on is there a square footage for each Elementary School students middle school high school is that how it's done or if it's based on their square footage is for each type of space and those are reviewed annually and we work closely with the curriculum side when

[01:02:00]
we look at them annually and we work with the school so for instance one big change that happened recently is that essentially we don't really need computer labs anymore because we have basically a one to one ratio every classroom is now a computer lab so instead of building computer labs we're now going to be doing Steam and stem Labs where they can do more specialized curriculum in those spaces so yeah we we have guidelines that we update period so is that just similar to what they do and different states or ours look really different than others I couldn't address what they do in other states I think

[01:03:00]
cars look pretty similar to what we do throughout the state because psfa also has their guidelines which track with ours ours might be slightly more robust but they pretty much track so ours are more robust than because of the size of our districts I think we probably have more programs specialized programs and other school districts do so they require maybe some different spaces okay and then I know this is this is probably difficult but I know I was told another another reason to the white question I asked is that I was told we speaking in efficiencies so

[01:04:00]
speaking down about utilities cuz everything will be built I mean we're hoping better it was well it's mostly utilities it's mostly utilities air quality different things like that but the biggest thing is utilities and you know we're going to be getting a better more efficient HVAC system and with solar installations we've been able to cut our electric bills down at all of our schools so it's going to be mostly in the utilities and in other areas of Maintenance and well I mean we won't really know what those savings are until after the school's been running for a little while so that's an impossible number to to come up with and I do understand that and so the only other thing is that I think it's a member Jackson really alluded to this is when people out there are expecting that

[01:05:00]
Ouija board do everything we don't so it's up to APS to follow the process for procurement getting everything done that they're supposed to and up to the board to just approve the expenditure which things won't get done without that money so I just want to make sure that you know the public does know that and then the other thing that I thought was was really important and I think that we need to make sure that we do look at aps's expertise when it comes to knowing you know what works you all know what works you know what doesn't work you know I mean you know way more probably than what we do we just know when something breaks and you know when it has to get fixed and that's when we usually hear when everything is going well we don't we don't hear that we hear when things are not going well but you all know what works and what doesn't work and so

[01:06:00]
concerned that that I have had is that we don't have you know you should not use this HVAC system because it is so costly to repair we have to have certain with certain and I won't say I know some of them that only certain people can work on them so many times are own employees can't work on them so that makes it more costly and then we have to wait on them to you know be there because I'm not a big labor pool for a lot of people out there and so my question probably is are you prevented and I don't know if this would go to miss Apodaca or to miss alarid from having such a do not useless because sometimes I see things and I'm like oh my goodness I mean I'm looking at Coyote Willow that HVAC system and my opinion should have never been used something should not be

[01:07:00]
you all know that break down I'm sure you have a list of everything that has broken down but are you are we kept are you all kept from having a do not use lift list for products and vendors and systems that you know have been problematic so I can answer that from a systems point of view it's interesting that you should bring that up because we just had a meeting with maintenance and operations and they are wanting to change what was their preferred HVAC system which was and the reason that they want to change it is that the technology is is Generations

[01:08:00]
technology they're now at Phase 3 technology and those computer boards don't talk to each other so they're having a lot of problems with it now this is a system that checked all the boxes as far as maintenance and operations was concerned right and they that's the system they wanted and we've had it now for 15 years and now we're seeing kind of in the short term yeah it checks all the boxes but in the long term not so much so we're getting ready to make a change to our standard based on our experience and we do that periodically I mean we work closely with maintenance and operations the Capital Construction program basically we we design and build the buildings and then we kind of take care of that building for a year and then it goes to Amazon and they have to take care of it for the life of the building which as you know some of our buildings are incredibly old right

[01:09:00]
this is what happens there's a back and forth and we we talk to each other and this works that doesn't work and all of that goes into our design standards when we update every year so yeah we we've got a lot of lessons learned out there and so then I guess the answer to my question is you have that list I mean you have a list of things that are not working products that are not working etcetera vendors at you know maybe so far so we have those do you use that expertise do you use that information that you have board member Let It Go remember the board that can get kind of tricky it is a tax money we have to go through a process of new apartment

[01:10:00]
suspension and that is the only way that we can kind of exclude anybody and it is like a due process for them however when specifications are written for a purchase those specifications need to be written in a in a way to help alleviate all the products that don't work so there's certain technology or certain teachers or certain capabilities that don't work then they need to be addressed in the back riding to put in what does work because that's how we're able to get a responsible responsive offer that meets the mandatory requirements when stop having so I mean I read a lot of the you know the specs and it seems like they do put everything in

[01:11:00]
some of these problems with some of the newer Coyote Willow I'm assuming that we do the best that we can to have that in the specifications so I would just say let's just look and see maybe there's something that we're missing there cuz you I mean you know Miss Apodaca coyote will is a really new school and my concern is just that you know our kids and our teachers are the one suffering in a learning environment that isn't working often times with HVAC plus we've also seen at schools were there are things that go wrong with the flooring in the gyms they're just those kinds of things that happen that make a dangerous for you know students to use those areas and so it's not just it's like you find out after you know after the fact or the month after you aren't under warranty anymore and they don't have to come back and fix

[01:12:00]
the taxpayers are kind of stuck there too so just just something to just kind of you know look at me thank you thank you board member Dominguez you have your hand up so I just have a question to you do we write the specs and go ahead well we do have some guidelines we do have some guidelines for them about certain products or systems

[01:13:00]
because we want certain things for ease of Maintenance and various reasons so the Architects that we contract with right the specs okay I thought maybe there was a statute that governed that kind of thing but okay and all this takes me back to I'm having a Deja Vu moment especially when the question was what are the legal ramifications of not approving this item on the consent agenda and her calendar

[01:14:00]
lie to us ever again any of our decisions but all this this conversation takes me back to a moment at our September 2022 board retreat when we embraced student outcomes Focus governance and I think the pledge was to trust the administration with with these decisions and I think it's hard for for the public to or constituents I guess need to be reminded that this is a new model of governance

[01:15:00]
that's what's the only observations in questions I have thank you thank you I just want to remind the board too that remember this conversation on this particular construction came up before us before it came here for approval for the funding so we went through a whole discussion where we received some information about you know what the vision was for the school what it was going to look like the fact that it was going to be a partnership with DOD and the need for it and you know what was what was going to happen at that time and so it's we had that conversation I think about the why in terms of why the school was being picked and selected we were really excited about the fact that it is a partnership with the Department of Defense who's you know actually picking up the majority of the cost on this which is great and it's an opportunity for us to create a learning

[01:16:00]
environment that is over 50 years old and to modernising it into something that will be much more efficient and much more effective for those students that that are attending that so I just remembered this coming before us before tonight so I think tonight the only conversation is is now they went through the bidding process they did all that closed bids did the awarding and this is what what came up and they're just presenting to us what that RFP process looked like in what the procurement results were so board member Peterson I will move for proof of I will all right thank you I have a roll call please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

[01:17:00]
okay so the next item for consideration is just consideration for approval of the February 6th 2023 policy items which is weird because it's not just the policy items as the approval of revisions to board policy to for special education do I have emotion on that so move this is Barbara okay I'm sorry I have a real call on Netflix for consideration is consideration for approval of the February 15th 2023 Board of Education meeting items should be be one and be three I move to approve the

[01:18:00]
February 15th 2023 Board of Education meeting items number 1 and number three I will call please email it again yes Danielle Gonzales yes yes yes our next item for discussion is a student outcomes Focus governance on this is a report on strategic planning process and I don't know do we have superintendent Elder was he able to connect if not we also have do we have Dina I can't say her last name is with a tuned education how are you I can't see your last name that I'm terrible at that how do you pronounce it give me

[01:19:00]
all right so and I don't know if superintendent Elder he was traveling he had mentioned to me tonight today that he was going to be traveling and that he would do his best to connect but if not he felt very confident that I think I see that doctors say Buddha and and with Dina kodas on that we would have you have the floor so you're going to give us a report on the strategic planning process and I believe tonight is to present the diagnostic report so you have the floor and I don't know how you want to start a WordPress president members of the board I believe that Dina is going to start us off okay just pull up my presentation when moment

[01:20:00]
all right good evening everyone it is thank you for having me and letting us join this evening to share some key updates on the strategic planning process we hope to give you a few key elements around objective where we've been and where we're going specifically around the process share some of the overall findings from the organizational Diagnostic and give you some insights into some emerging priorities that the Administration has identified at this stage so Dr Segura yes thank you Dina and I do believe that superintendent Elder is on and so superintendent did you want to take it from here do you want me to take it

[01:21:00]
I'm trying to get him in the room give me one second period

[01:22:00]
our of this trip so they managed to misplaced my bags for a while so but I am okay okay so I believe I'm starting off I'm glad you guys have met Dina you met her before she presented before we're glad to be here I think what's important to just get into this is that we've been working together with the tuned under their work to build a clear Direction and a road map on how to change the goals that you guys are setting for us and of course you guys began working great City schools on your process around your Governor's School System and at the same time the administration began working with the tune education Partners to develop the Strategic plan which is going to outline the key actions the school system will take to make progress towards the goals identified by the board and then together with the gold and the guards along with the Strategic plan we can set the directions

[01:23:00]
yes for sure superintendent thank you I'll take it from here so I shared I am Dina haciendas with a tune education Partners just want to take a moment as I don't know if I have individually gone to speak with each and every one of the board members but thank you for having us I am one of a team of four individuals who are really working directly with the administration in different elements of the strategic planning process and I'm grateful for the time to be with you this evening but a tuned just you're aware as a National Organization that supports school systems across the country large and small on strategic planning and other elements of school Improvement efforts and we've been really excited to get to know Albuquerque and the senior leadership team in District share a little bit about just a high level of the process and where we are before we get into some of what we've learned given our time working in Albuquerque

[01:24:00]
but our project is sort of in four phases the first started when we initiated our work with you in September to kind of think about the project who we would work with and how we would partner with the administration in doing this work in the type of Engagement efforts we would undertake some of you may recall back in September that involved also recognizing how we would kind of follow along and be informed by the work of the council as you're working with them on your government initiatives phase two of the work is where we spend a lot of time trying to understand some of the core strengths and challenges of the school system through a lens that we know is never perfect but one that we hope is insightful and so we spend time in October in December doing performance conducting interviews and focus groups looking at artifacts related to your instructional plans and also visiting classrooms so to help us kind of diagnose and generate some key findings to help support

[01:25:00]
January through April we are working to support superintendent Elder and his team and thinking through what are the right strategic priorities and a key work under those big areas of focus to help achieve the goals that you all have set for him and his team in in pursuit of better supporting students in Albuquerque and so we will be in this phase through April and then towards April and May sort of pivot to the idea of thinking through how best to track that we know you are working with the administration in the cancel on interim goals and guardrails which flow into what we call progressing construction but we will work to make sure that all of these things online and just said and much Support over the five year plan is something we will want to support on and also thinking about the resources in early implementation but as of now we are in

[01:26:00]
phase 3 and excited to start to think through some of the core elements of the plan to get there though there's many individuals who have been a part of the planning process thus far and will continue to be that I just want to highlight a tuned just to clarify our role for everyone in the public we are the external facilitator from our point of view and helping gather this information and partner with the administration on reflecting on key data points and helping facilitate meetings of central teams and others towards building the plan so we also a key role in this process are your stakeholders who we see as your students families your District staff and your Community Partners we have and will continue to want to engage with them in a variety of ways to help inform the planning process we do do a lot of work with what we call the steering committee in this design process that is superintendent Elders cabinet and through that

[01:27:00]
the plan to sift through the data and the Reflections in the feedback to help chart the path we also have established which we are grateful for the contributions and suggestions you all raised for an Advisory Group which and we actually had a meeting this evening before I got here so it was great to connect with so many teachers principals committee members and parents it is a group that is helping sort of run alongside the broader stakeholder efforts to continue to give very concentrated feedback on what we're hearing the diagnostic and what could be emerging priorities initiatives for the work ahead so it's been exciting to get to know that group and continue to engage with them and lastly you all as a board play a very fundamental role in you set the Direction with the goals and the guard rails and also your feedback in this process is extremely valuable to superintendent and his team so just to give you a sense of as we're going through those four phases how we see the key roles many individuals play

[01:28:00]
in January just kind of see where we're going we there was a draft of sort of draft strategic priorities that were identified in response to the diagnostic we're in early in February so there's been some work to reflect on that diagnostic which I'll share with you and to think about what those draft priorities will be in February and March this is just an illustrative example of what we hope to get to around once you identify those big Focus areas and feel good about them identifying what is the key projects multi-year work that would happen underneath them to make progress in those areas and that's something that will focus on and also helped the administration ultimately build clear work plans for year one to help them really make good progress in these areas and then ultimately as I said in April we will move to sort of making sure all the systems are in place to help the administration that makes sense along the way now the diagnostic

[01:29:00]
we spend some time in that phase to as I said I'm trying to collect lots of pieces of data to help inform a set of findings around what are some of the strengths of APS right now and where are some opportunities for improvement to do that work we reviewed a lot of publicly available data on APS student outcomes related to testing outcomes also looked at some things around disciplinary outcomes in that area we also conducted an instructional quality review which is also on the line tonight who was lead a team of individuals who visited 24 schools and nearly 190 classrooms in APS to get a sense of what was happening inside classrooms between teachers and students related to your instructional programming on Cross all the Learning Zone and then also we did specifically in Albuquerque a set of focus groups that sort of followed along and behind the work you were doing with your broad survey work for the board goals with

[01:30:00]
District leaders principals teachers families and students and other community groups along the way to help us gather some insights again on what are the strengths and what are the opportunities for improvement and those findings are synthesized these key areas in the report that we've created and tonight what I'll do is just share the high-level major takeaways from that and then pivot back to superintendent Elders talk about sort of potentially the directions to priorities and response to that in your board goals so in terms of the key strings and it is been really wonderful to spend time in Albuquerque and see many of the wonderful things happening in your schools and also in your school community and while there are there's many things that are wonderful but Evergreen that are not like going to come up in these two or three points we have we did want to elevate what we saw as the loudest themes when we look at the

[01:31:00]
performance date of the classroom observations and constituent perspectives that sort of meant that sort of were the loudest throughout our listening process in Phase 2 so one of the the first strengths that that came out in our work was that folks are very proud and feel like APS has a strong commitment to celebrating the unique cultural diversity of the district and its students and families who make it up specifically they feel that the stakeholders including students this means parents students staff and at the school level in the district level all call out that this is something that the diversity is an asset and it's also something that we feel is valued and that feels like a strength to build upon within the aps Community we also heard that folks are very proud about the schools they attended the schools their children go to and sort of the communities which they feel most connected in with within APS and so there's a

[01:32:00]
lot of cultural pride and sort of Community Pride in in what APS is what people are interacting with your community second we heard that there was sort of a loud and kind of Kee strength around the availability of District offerings and resources that are provided to students and Families First being that folks were kind of very happy about the amount of extracurricular programs that are available to students now this does not mean that folks don't think there should be more and that not all schools may have everything that every others have every other school has but it was pretty consistent as we sat with students when we sort of the first things that you was a strike that your school or with families that they feel like there are opportunities at their schools for students to connect or find interests which was positive to hear we also heard that Stakes take a lot of stakeholders take a lot of Pride and appreciate the bilingual and do language programs that have been established

[01:33:00]
APS overtime again recognizing there's always room for improvement but this is a strength that many thought stood out in April to potentially other systems they may have been in before or aware of and also stakeholders called out the sense that they feel like there's a lot of variety of resources that schools in the district provide to families in need in particular students raised frequently in the conversations that we sat with them on that you know the school has opportunities for students who may need things that are not related to their academics it may be about problems at home or if they're needing other needs met related to sort of their personal and physical safety or mental health needs that schools are there and that there's resources that are available in a way that felt notable among them especially for families not just students but families so these were just two of the loudest themes that came up as we thought about as we

[01:34:00]
mute those sets of data now I'll give it to some of the challenges that we heard the first being a primarily rooted in the academic data that we reviewed that there's inequities in student outcomes within and across zones and that there's lots of variation within that but fundamentally you know that we looked at looking at the state testing data one out of every four APS students are achieving Mastery and math and then on average in total and one out of every three or achieving Mastery in ela so there's a baseline need for additional Improvement in those areas but then you dig in another level around issues of outcomes across student groups we did know that there are significant inequities in those areas with white students typically outperforming their peers of color on a variety of degrees AC

[01:35:00]
play some different outcomes but consistently outperforming things like math and Ela Lake outcomes graduation outcomes lower Dropout rates Etc and then as noted we did also see some considerable variation in math and daily not just across zones but within them so there are pockets of Excellence of course happening in classrooms and zones and schools across the district but there is a lot of variation that we identified in the data which then therefore leads to sort of lack of overall positive outcomes for the system as a whole related to academics on state tests second another finding that we heard that was that there was sort of a lack of coherent Vision at the district level but sort of where we're going and how we're going to get there and a consistent follow through to implement that work

[01:36:00]
and so there was senses from multiple stakeholders that it would be helpful to have more clarity and where we're going and also increased accountability from upper levels even down to students to make sure everyone is sort of being held to doing their best on behalf of everyone and themselves in the school system next based upon those classroom observations that we were so fortunate to get to go in and see as you may could note from the academic oh comes we saw when we visited classrooms a lack of instructional rigor and often more inconsistent academic expectations across schools in classrooms so ultimately there were an inconsistent experience we observed as we've visited those classrooms and on the whole more often than not students were not being provided with grade level

[01:37:00]
content to wrestle with in those classrooms so we saw things as you can see here that only students were only provided with opportunities to respond to grade level task so making sure that they're doing the type of work that would ensure that they are mastering standards expected at let's say a fourth grade or a 6th grade or an 8th grade or 10th grade level and only 38% of the observations and also we saw in certain situations to that you know that students in particular raised that they actually want to have that rigor and sort of that push in the classroom as well beyond just what we observed in the classroom when we asked them sort of what's what would ways to improve your classroom experience more often than not they raise that they would like to kind of have a more rigorous experience in terms of how they are pushed or their classmates and also engaged more so in their classrooms and

[01:38:00]
also we there was noted kind of loud theme around stakeholders thinking that there was some inconsistencies in what's happening across schools around curriculum that may lead to some challenges as soon as may move across the district or to ensure that everyone is getting on the same access to the rigorous content that they may and an instruction that they need to master those State Standards so when you put just sort of this finding around instructional rigor and also the one around academic outcomes you can see that there's overall sort of a theme and a connection between some challenges around all students getting access to grade level content and then therefore some grade level teachings of how rigorous the instruction is beyond just the materials that students are accessing and then therefore leading to not as much grade level learning as you'd like to see overall and those are the connections we can see between those two big findings and also I think to know here

[01:39:00]
and when you think about all those pieces coming together there was also within the data a high level of chronic absenteeism which we identified for about 40% of students overall have been noted as chronically absent this past school year and so that lack of Engagement to you know it is related to potentially these issues of what's happening in the classroom and expectations of students and how they feel connected and engaged while at school and lastly there was just some challenges raised around consistent coordination of communications and supports to schools within such a large school system so teachers and families did raise that there's challenges sometimes with consistent and coordinated Communications from the district schools or within schools or across zones that sometimes you know people get the information about me not the same time and is it is clear or is it is accessible as everyone would like specifically families in particular

[01:40:00]
I'm sure to think about how do you increase opportunities for All Families to engage and receive Communications in a way that is familiar to them and also related to language barrier accesses to make sure that those things improve moving forward so those are the main themes overall of what we saw some of the challenges and I think I'll pass it back to you superintendent well thank you you know what I think it's important to know that you know those those visits were really really how you guys are in town for a week right and how long were each visit to the classroom each one range probably from about 10 to 20 minutes so it was it was it these were snapshots I will say so that they're for sure is not sort of a perfect review of a full day or a full classroom but yes again just snap shots but but you saw some pretty consistent

[01:41:00]
what are some steps we can take to really start improving things and of course you guys have established your goals and I'm not going to read them to you cuz I think you guys know him very well but we did want to say that the work that we've been doing really begin to dig in once you establish these four goals and and got clear on what we're supposed to do in a tune really back to the whip I will say since then and we've been doing quite a bit of work around these these goals after we reviewed the diagnostic at that point we need to identify draft strategic priorities and these priorities are going to help focus our our work we begin to work towards in the next five years so the priorities we've shared with you before but I'll just review them quickly one is clear expectations and I think you heard that need to mobilize staff around and clear plan

[01:42:00]
and creating a culture of high expectations and accountability to achieve Student Success looking at rigorous instruction and again you heard the concept of trying to create a way to support our leaders and our teachers that we have a rigorous culturally sustaining grade level instruction across the district and consistently using those high quality instructional materials and that has the ability to respond to students progress and then again from the kids the concept of an Engaged student really trying to create safe schools in classrooms to keep students engaged and learning making sure they have access to the academic that they need the social emotional learning and the support that they're looking for and of course extra activities and then finally the concept of responsive and coordinated systems making sure that once we get these establishments

[01:43:00]
to make sure that they're supporting this work and that's a really important priority to make sure that we have infrastructure built that make sure we can do these these initiatives and is this me Dana the next five years we've established the priorities in 23/204 over the next couple of years we begin to see how the priorities are working obviously using interim goals and and then we have to just course but if that's the case we make adjustments across time so that by the end of 2720 so

[01:44:00]
which means consistent engagement with stakeholders so we are this month and into March going to be engaging again with the different focus groups and entities we've engaged with together feedback on the plan ultimately finalize that plan which is codifying the priorities initiatives and then how it is sequence over time right there's a lot to do but the work we will do is superintendent Elder and his team is really to Think Through what can you what needs to come first and how do you start to have the right sequencing so that things can get rolled out in a way that makes sense and not too much is overwhelming either the administration or most importantly teachers and school leaders as they're doing that work at the ground level I'm trying to improve

[01:45:00]
continue to plan for implementation once the plan is finalized for starting next school year and when that I think that concludes our presentation thank you so I'll just open it up to the board for any comments or discussion who would like to go first are there any questions or comments I guess I could ask go ahead I wonder and I'm not sure who can answer this question but if you can go back you did highlight that there were outcomes that varied across zones and you you mentioned it twice and so I'm wondering if you couldn't just kind of expand upon what that signals to you that Within

[01:46:00]
The Zone there are also discrepancies and outcomes because you mentioned it twice so it seems like it's important you want me to take that one yeah I can if you want I can answer it as well as variations in terms of economic situations family stability a lot of the things that we know that impact student learning so there's that and then I say again as it kind of goes back to the initiative we've had around the principal leadership the ability to really give our principal some tools that they can have these sort of conversations with staffs for improvement you know like for a long time the states

[01:47:00]
I've been doing training around this concept of the turnaround school and the turnaround principal who they they send to a school they really need some support and they trained them up on these specific skills to to help really look at data to really have critical conversations to really look at that Solutions and unfortunately I think the reality is that should be the training for all our principles now I don't think it's just you know the turnaround principal that needs those skills so some of that is is is is is been a need for cohesive sense of what is being instructed really trying to get a clear scope and sequence and pushing that message consistently out and some of it is just the reality of of of of of issues inside the zones that that everything is not homogeneous and maybe you have some Dad I think the only thing I would build upon is exactly those things in that related to when you think about principles when we when we look at a large

[01:48:00]
play bedtime folks must say we may think that oh well this this region versus that things are very you know what outcomes are one-way versus another and I think in highlighting the variation within and across and just to show that there's there's similar challenges across the district 2 right now around providing a consistent experience to students and that there's likely potentially opportunities to learn from that and think about how best to support how you can provide more consistent experiences for all students regardless of where they're sitting so so the next question and just bear with me I really liked the Strategic priorities that that that that relate out so but my question then naturally went to so how do our goals fit into that so can you just kind of give a framework as to how the goals like the very concrete goals that the board

[01:49:00]
that are going to fit in with the Strategic priorities that have been put forth by superintendent I'll just offer since we do a lot of this work across with different school systems is I don't see them fitting into I think we see them supporting the attainment of those goals so it's not about sort of retrofitting it backwards that is why we waited to sort of see what goals you all set so that we could reflect with the central team on the board has set these goals how do you think you can get there especially in light of what we've identified as some of your core challenges and also strengths so that the priorities really are meant to serve be in service of the goals and helped organize the administration's efforts that thank you because I was thinking like where I'm thinking of an outline where does it go underneath and and I couldn't see it but

[01:50:00]
sounds more like there's two parallel processes that are going on each and support each other no maybe you looked up I think they're very much aligned right now the planning process may feel a little bit parallel because of the timeline that you all were hoping to get all of these things together but ultimately when you look forward the work that under the priorities and I'll let you take over in a minute but I think is to you should be the hard work that the administration in your schools and your educators are taking to help attain those goals so I see them kind of working towards not alongside or never Jackson all I would say that is like the only concern I would have with using the word parallel as they never touch and I do think these have to be intertwined okay I like it so good

[01:51:00]
I'm happy to see that I'm sorry my eyes are kind of going and just one more time that this I'm looking at page 7 of our packet but it's specifically reviewing this discussing the curriculum and instruction you said students were provided with opportunities to respond authentically to grade level tasks in only 38% of observations could you explain that again what does that what does that mean when you walked into the classroom what did you see I will let my colleague Lindsay Smith who you may see on your screen who led the site visits it's just to speak more specifically to that Lindsay absolutely good evening everyone it's great to be joining you all virtually myself and a number of my colleagues were the site review team that Dina and superintendent Elder reference earlier and

[01:52:00]
what I can say is far as that percentage that you'll notice the 38% we're looking at a couple of things there first of all we're seeking to establish whether the kind of the the task on paper or the content on paper so to speak reflects grade level standards reflects College and Career ready standards for the grade level classroom and then from there we're seeking to assess to what extent is teachers like facilitation of students engagement with that content upholding that intended level rigor and tended level of challenge assuming that that content is grade level and then last of all you know where we're going to assess and with what's success you know what to what degree are students then engaging and writing speaking reading you know about solving math about that appropriately challenging content and engaging content 38% you see is um

[01:53:00]
the opportunity where Not only was the content great appropriate but how the teacher kind of facilitated or delivered instruction maintained that grade level rigor so that students had a chance you know had an opportunity to produce grade level work and the specific kind of more detailed look for us that we assess in each our little bit different by is it math or La you know depending on the grade level and whatnot but I'm broadly speaking that's what we're seeking to determine you know did students have an opportunity to do a great level task during that period of time that we were in the classroom 20 minutes or so on his team to mentioned so by my skills of deduction does that mean that 622 percent of the time where were kids receiving below grade level instruction

[01:54:00]
kiss me I'm the short answer is yes and in some instant in what we observed of course which is superintendent elderly pointed out was a moment in time right so in in the the moments that we observed the short answer is yes in some instances the actual like task on paper like the the you know this task that was in front of students or the Texas students were asked reader whatnot in and of itself did not mean grade level standards in other instances what was on paper what was in front of students did reflect grade level standards or appropriately challenging content But the teacher might have like lowered the the rigor of what students were actually asked to do with it or like giving you know very very very very happy if that makes sense yeah okay I I think I will let my board

[01:55:00]
play fellow members asked her questions but I will leave with a comment because this just punched me in the gut when I read this that our sense of accountability is from the top down and it extends to our students and that just punched me in the gut that our students are feeling this and that is affecting them so this thank you for this I really appreciate this this analysis and I'll wait or not I'm going to go to board member Dominguez Who's online do you have any comments or questions I do you know I have to say I looked at that same comment board member Jackson and and it took me back to September when

[01:56:00]
and it's it starts with us and you know we're going to make a difference and I think we're engaged in that now but when I say it starts with us it starts with the board I'd like to go back to if I may call you deny

[01:57:00]
into account with that comment I think I can answer that just by I think looking at the academic outcomes that we analyzed at its core show that you have discrepancies across different racial backgrounds in the district within and across zones right and so there are variations there I will note and I think this type of inconsistency in variation is not unique to APS we support school systems around the nation in this especially I'm supporting majority low income students across the country and therefore like these are challenges that exist and consistent inconsistencies and experience and outcomes is the biggest challenge of our time is Educators and what we hope to Aspire to to diminish so I think from our perspective the greatest we saw was through that academic results and

[01:58:00]
killer that you can see the variation in those outcomes so I mean that gets to my next question a lot of the grafts are general information which we already knew right and so on page 21 of your report and I don't have I'm afraid to navigate to give him my limited abilities at the moment but on page 21 it would be helpful if we could have if we could disaggregate this graph because it seems that it would be important to disaggregate trying to get to the you mean by by the students with disabilities

[01:59:00]
yes yes okay that I type of disability in particularly because I mean I have friends so I come to this 30 years experience as a teacher and I have friends who are PT's who deal with some of these children and you know this number I just want to comment that it's a disservice to it would be more helpful if we could just aggregate that 5% and that 8% who are we talking about here right numbers

[02:00:00]
because I think it matters and I think the same could be said I've got the same question for page 24 you can look at each of these zones the high-performing the lowest performing schools and and again I think demographics matter knowing the details because in the end I think it's going to impact or it would help the the Strategic plan be more effective and then on page 25 what are the reasons for Dropout rates and taking into account all students subgroups page 27 why do elementary schools have the

[02:01:00]
is absenteeism I think it's important again to disaggregate that and and so I guess my question is are there plans to to to to to to be a little bit more detail about these numbers thank you for there's lots of ways to look at data so it's always helpful to know what what comes to mind and how to further disaggregate I think you know I know superintendent Elder your team has a lot of great data capacity and work and I think as part of this when I think about the goals you are outline is a board and then work around interim goals and guards to the importance of disaggregation and one knowing where you're going to thinking about specific strategies is one that we definitely can take back to the steering committee and think about where it makes the most sense as we're trying to identify the right types of actions to take to support certain sets of students are made progress towards your goals for sure and so these are these are that's a good

[02:02:00]
people who may not understand what it means to be evaluated what it means to be evaluated in 10 to 20 minutes

[02:03:00]
so there are lots of students out there who would I think say that I was pretty tough and I definitely had high standards but On Any Given Monday or Friday you might come into my classroom and I probably fall into that category of sub par that somehow I was not teaching to up to was important I might be laying the groundwork and and you know I was pretty traditional teacher but I'll Embrace that because I came at it from an English language

[02:04:00]
Mariners perspective who had to figure out that there was a structure and a system to taking achievement tests and unfortunately I figured that out after college but I committed myself to teaching that structure to disenfranchise kids but I want to warn whoever is watching to 20 minutes it's hard to really do justice to an evaluation of what is happening it can certainly help but in the end what matters is what kids show me what they're writing

[02:05:00]
and ultimately that was my that was my measure of what I had accomplished as a teacher with kids show me what your kids are riding and and that'll tell you a bit and also tell me what your kids reading and what they're saying about it what questions are asking about it with their wondering about it and that tells you maybe even more thank you for all your work thank you

[02:06:00]
that I am concerned about what is that I'm curious in with these classes that happened for 10 to 20 minutes what else what was observed what what were the people in the classroom looking for and looking at and how was how was that information gathered Phoenix Arizona so we were seeking to observe what I would describe as a representative subset of classrooms across contents in grade bands across the district across all four zones as I think Dina mentioned and so we weren't seeking to evaluate any teachers IND

[02:07:00]
play we didn't capture any individual teacher data were really looking for district-wide Trends across that roughly 200 set of classroom observations in total and so we look for first of all grade level content or great appropriate content aligned to College and Career ready standards secondly instructional practice or facilities teacher facilitation of student engagement with that content that that upholds or maintains that kind of grade level learning opportunity and then thirdly to your point board member is exactly like you said we look at what students are writing what students are saying you know about content questions there posing or or discussions that they're having drinks small group or turning talk moments so we're seeking to gather certainly qualitative point in time data but qual

[02:08:00]
save data about the extent to which students you know are cognitively engaging with those Reading Writing math tax tasks etcetera whatever it may be I mean so we score those as kind of quantitative like yes no indicators based on the preponderance of what we observe during the course of that instruction we also captured qualitative notes so that at the on the back end we can sift through those qualitative notes and and you know try to identify Trends and beams across the district and part of the reason why we seek a high volume of observations is precisely because like all of those are point in time data points so with the you know we want to good inside of those point in time in order to be able to notice anything that seems to be a significant significant enough Trend you know to lift up in a district wide of the future so you're looking at classroom artifacts not just the interaction between student and teacher or

[02:09:00]
peer-to-peer yes ma'am that's exactly right we're looking at a number of artifacts that the district was kind enough to gather and share beforehand and offline including things that were like not present in the classroom the moment we observed we're looking at classroom artifacts that are you know like the the papers in front of students the instructional materials being used in classrooms and then also observing those interactions like you said both teacher to student and student to student depending on the you know depending on what's happening in the class while we're in there if it's the classroom say with students that work on portfolios did you look at all at any kind of more historical reflection of student work new me and we only looked at student work on which students were like actively working like it you know in the class that we were observing certainly and in some opportunities we were able to see like students employers posted

[02:10:00]
but we we didn't do offline review of student work samples if that makes sense and we sort of triangulated our observation data with the student outcomes data that Dina mentioned earlier did you look at all at school structures for things like collaboration time and prep time and just how those daily daily forms were organized yes ma'am we were able to analyze some artifacts from the district pertaining to collaboration structures time things like instructional leadership and instructional support and then we also were in many cases able to hear from folks about those structures in interviews and in some of the focus groups and in the survey

[02:11:00]
we did not observe non-classroom we didn't observe for example like a teacher's like collaborative planning time or like when a coaching meeting between a teacher and a coach so we didn't our observations were only like of classroom instruction and of you know just kind of incidentally of whole school culture moments but we did both hear from stakeholders and then have a chance to analyze artifacts pertaining to those kind of like off stage instructional support components that you mentioned if I could just add two real quick I think I'm related to your question is in our conversations with teachers there was a desire for you know stronger support structures be it from the district to help them gather some professional development that is to help them but also recognizing sometimes their feedback structures on campuses and and opportunities to collaborate on campuses and cross is something that teachers are you know were interested in having

[02:12:00]
play Stronger support systems around in particular too so we recognize that there's a connection between all these these data points are on how do you like tighten systems of support and planning to then better support students in particular to but we did hear that from teachers to that you know that some teachers have those strong structures in campuses and others were wanting more I'm I'm a little concerned period

[02:13:00]
economic status only only ethnic and racial in the lights I'm sorry and I'm just curious about why I want to check my notes we do all of the cuts of data by that I think here there was probably the the data probably showed itself to deliver those areas than not but we can also gather that day but like if I believe correctly and I'll double check with one of my colleagues before we get off with you today that there was variations based upon economic status across the district along with the racial variation and I can just confirm where we saw that or not for you in particular but we did run those

[02:14:00]
and I'm not disputing the validity I'm you know I certainly acknowledge that there is no debate about test scores and that they are the we've got to do better by our students there's no debate about

[02:15:00]
that's not what you were tasked with so I'm not laying this at your feet but it's something that we is a district have got to really grapple with that looking at data doesn't do anything to truly analyze root cause and so looking at this it would be very easy to say Well they're horrible teachers horrible program and and kids that aren't learning or kids aren't learning it's only the the rather than really doing the root cause analysis of what the barriers are and I mean I have the perfect example I said Community School calendar

[02:16:00]
first answer was I was sick and we know that kids low-income students with less access to Medical Care in poor nutrition tend to get sick or more often and so legitimately those kids it's something that we as a community need to figure out and solve but there's a real reason why there's a higher level of of absenteeism the next highest reason that students put down for why they were absent was they were home taking care of someone else in the household either an elderly parents and grandparents or a younger sibling and that was the next highest thing and after that there are things like I'm bored my teacher is mean

[02:17:00]
or I'm getting bullied and they're real specific things that we can do is a district inside of schools to address those concerns and that's really at our feet but if we don't look at all of the data holistically and start really saying this is more than just what's at the feet of our teachers we're not going to be able to solve it and so I and the other thing is high expectations is the teachers do not have time when you have a large number of students that are language Learners and a lot of our language Learners don't even show up his language Learners because it's dependent on whether the families come with not

[02:18:00]
hammock language they come with wonderful experiences but it's not but it is a mismatch with what the expectations in the school are for language experiences for other kinds of you know going to the museum going to the Planetarium doing all those things so my question is that we've got to look at all of this data from an asset base what do our kids come with what do our teachers have that we're going to build on and a lot of it is the amount of time when a teacher is material but knowing that they are within a day it takes thinking collaborating time to figure out how am I doing the cognitive demands of grade level material

[02:19:00]
because that's why everyone from our language Learners to our special ed kids probably feel bored is that they're not getting the cognitive part of the instruction in a way that's letting them enter into that understanding and that's what I mean I'm always concerned because people want cookie cutters with how are we going to do this and it's not a cookie cutter it's teachers having time to really figure out where are those gaps what do I need to do to fill in the gaps and still keep my students moving forward and so it's just we've got to address that we've got your address instructions from English language it is not cookie cutter it is not simply translating it is fun

[02:20:00]
mentally different with the way Spanish language Learners learn Spanish literacy or how anyone learn Spanish literacy it is different and we've got to build on the experience and strengths of our teachers along with the assets of students to get them where they need to be and it's not going to be cookie cutter and it's not going to be simple thank you board member Gonzalez but my question I think is for superintendent Elder and Dr Segura and it's just we're there any surprises for you in the state of yeah I think some of the percentages of materials and the grade level and I and I

[02:21:00]
physically am I experiencing is mostly Middle School 6 through 12 so I was kind of curious about those those those those data points I would say the overall themes were not terribly surprising that came back but what's been good with the having the data that at least begin the conversation about how do you begin initiatives and where do we start and so with these priorities that we developed and now we're trying to sort of align those across the next five years and don't push initiatives across five years that's I don't know if it's surprising but it was helpful and and like I said there was something you know what I thought was interesting honestly was when the kids said give us you know a little bit higher we'd like to do that that kind of caught our attention and was nice

[02:22:00]
because you know a lot of that I think is some of what related to the pandemic in that we're very concerned about over stressing kids and they're aware of it they're very articulate they'll talk to you about it and so it was interesting to hear some of them at least say we can handle it that's that's move on and Madam we have a lot of work to do we've done a lot of work and I don't want to discredit the work that's been done up to this point we've come back from a pandemic and that has come with its own challenges and I think in hearing students say we want higher expectations were bored we need more rigger we want to be engaged

[02:23:00]
that is ringing in my ears right now and so I think in looking at that we have taken that approach because we're as Educators were nurturers and when our students come out of this pandemic situation we want to cuddle them and support them and I want to challenge us to think now more than ever we need to raise that bar I have two teenagers in school right now and they share some of these sentiments and not just right now in APS it's been through their other schooling experiences as well where they would bring work home and if we look at task predicts performance I struggled with some of the stuff and so I think this emphasizes the need for our district to really re-engage and create visions of Excellence for math

[02:24:00]
LA to make sure that we are investing in high-quality instructional materials in every single classroom that is one equalizer that we can do as well couple that with high-quality professional learning and so we have been working on these things we have everything we need to do to achieve the goals in front of us I think we just need to all like board member Josefina mentioned you know it's really lifting up the mirror to ourselves and saying it starts with us and so what can we do as a district in looking at this data to inform our decision-making these priorities that have been identified were informed by the goals that you all established or informed by the diagnost

[02:25:00]
and when I say we have a lot of work to do it's exciting work like this is doing good things for our kids and so and for our teachers I don't want to hear teachers saying they have to look on the internet for resources our teachers shouldn't have to do that we have high-quality instructional materials that have been adopted maybe the process hasn't been perfect in the past I can't speak to that but from this point moving forward it will be better and we will have that investment from our teachers and that input from our teachers so they don't have to spend time and time and time building lessons that are already provided where they can just collaborate with their grade levels or their content to like teams to annotate plan together that's my dream that's what I'm working toward and teaching and learning for the district so I don't want

[02:26:00]
I'm actually glad that we have some data so we can move forward period thank you and I wanted to thank you and the iTunes team for this work particularly in the instructional quality review and I do think we could all I agree with you we could all sit up here and interrogate the data or interrogate the process or interrogate the findings or request further information but at the end of the day I think no matter how we slice your kids we are feeling our kids and this is damning I mean it's it's a tragedy I mean like my heart breaks for for the kids in the district so I think I really do hope that we use this as the wake-up call that it is because we have a lot of work to do and we have to be better for our kids and I think you know it's been acknowledged there are challenges that are students face that our teachers face and it's just in

[02:27:00]
I want us to not let those challenges become excuses but I do want to thank you for the work and for sharing this and just say that I'm really excited about all that's going to come next thank you board member Mueller Oregon thank you so just to kind of go back to some of the things that board members have already spoken to when it comes to the why or when it comes to the root causes that's not what you were supposed to do so would you say Dr seguro superintendent Elder that that analysis is in the district's house so when you're looking at the why why is this happening what what are the root causes for this this isn't what a tuned was supposed to be doing they're just supposed to be there to gather the data but what you're going to be looking at is the wise

[02:28:00]
Muller Eragon the route we do root cause analysis at the site level every year with our schools they conduct 90-day Dash plans where they are looking specifically at Tier 1 instruction School culture leadership very clear Focus areas and so that does take place at the school site level and I think again this just gives us the opportunity to refine that process and align it to make sure that it's working we're all working in the same direction okay so you think that there is going to have to be some refinement though okay and then the other the other thing is just to speak to it it looks like you all took representative samples that you looked at you know high volume to find to find Trends and I trust

[02:29:00]
that we we can all trust the viability and that would be a question to Dr Segura superintendent Elder that you're going to really trust what attune has done thus far and did you think we have a pretty good representative sample of what is going on in the district and in the classrooms remember it's not the only thing we're looking at you know we're doing a weekly and Associates their teams and working with principals so there's a lot of things data points but yes this is work this tool this data will help Drive some of the initiatives that we push forward and it certainly is given us just some guidance as far as where to begin because there's a lot of different things

[02:30:00]
we could do is and I think I think one of the things you probably are very much were a board member Eragon is sometimes we overload we try to do too much we try to do it too fast and then we get frustrated and and we switch to do something else and and you know that sort of been things we've done in the past I think this will give us the guidance over the next five years here's the plan yes we may make adjustments but this will help establish what we're going to try to do over the next five years and and to meet the goals that you guys are establishing I do hope so I think often we just to do too many things and then we don't know what really isn't working or what really is working so I am hopeful that this will give us a real focus and just because I feel a lot like that our kids are wanting rigor they wanted

[02:31:00]
they're asking for it and they know they can do it and I don't think any of us are surprised that that's what they want and the fact that they believe in themselves which is a really good thing that they believe that they can be at grade level and they can do more than what they're given and so when I know when Dr Segura said that tasks predicts performance so if you don't give grade level work what are you going to get back we are not going to be able to get back grade level work and so we need to give our kids what they can do and I mean honestly that will make me cry because as a teacher I just saw what kids could do and it's sad that so many of them are not even given that opportunity you know given that opportunity

[02:32:00]
and I'll try not to cry about it but that one was the most upsetting thing that that I did that I did hear I'm not a couple of other things that we need to kind of look at and I'm not sure if we need more data I think we just have enough data and I think probably we just need a lot of the wise behind it but a question that I did have on page 24 and I think I probably read it somewhere or just it came to me is when we look at the percentage differences and this may be root cause is what do those percentage difference is I mean truly indicate at each of the zones so we all say this you know this has less percentage points and this one has more there's a great is a difference between highest and lowest performing schools and so I mean I would like to to

[02:33:00]
play know what those Point differences really indicate their their numbers but are they really telling us about proficiencies because they sometimes question if that is what those would really indicate and then another question that I have is somewhat and this will probably go to doctor or superintendent Elder we have the more participation AP participation rate but then we only have 50% that have passing scores so we increase the participation rate but that didn't help to increase the passing rate so that might be another why probably because if we're just increasing participation but not the pass rate will how is that really helping our kids anyhow so that's that's one and I don't know if this is information that you have or not

[02:34:00]
at when it comes to college-bound students do you have the information on you know there are certain zones obviously that have higher percentages when it comes to College Bound do you know the percentage of parents in those zones that attended college that might be interesting to know I don't know I don't think that's something that's not something that we usually see in other districts is something that's available for this type of analysis at times usually you're you're free and reduced lunch population is served as a proxy for that potentially but it's not a good one in terms of your exact question

[02:35:00]
okay I mean I know it's in the census but that's hard I would assume we can dig down to the Zone maybe with that data I don't know if we do or not but one thing that I thought was good cuz I was like to shout out like good news is when we are I was looking at the on time graduation rates on page 15 and we had 70 on time quite 84 Hispanic 73 and black were also at 73 so I thought that was you know was was a good thing for for our kids showing that we can all do it and then probably maybe the last question that I have I too like remember Peterson would like to know the wise on dropouts and when it comes to Chronic absenteeism for two years we told the kids and parents to have the kids stay home when they're sick and now that they stay home and they're sick then they're punished for

[02:36:00]
we should have seen what was going to come and a result probably this increase in chronic absenteeism so us adults or some of us adults did not do right by kids by keeping them home for so long and then I I just want to ask this question to attend is when you broke all this data up and you broke it up by zones yet each of us represents and my district and the Zone they don't exactly you know look the same so I was just wondering why it was broken up since we do represent districts why it was broken up that way and then when we also my strategic plan representative that's part of The Advisory Group knows my you know knows my community because you know she happens to live there and so

[02:37:00]
I'm just wondering you know what input she really give if she doesn't really know the whole zone so I'm just wondering why you broke it up that way sure we entered the analysis that way I think just to kind of make a connection to a previous comment on there's many factors at play related to how overall the system is supporting student outcomes and success in the long run and be it one of the being how does the system structure and support schools to to support students and so those the zones giving that is how you all have broken up a lot of really like the way oversight Communications and sort of just execution of responsibilities in those areas was why we went that way it also represents some Geographic diversity within your school system even though it's bigger than your your electoral board members own so that's why we landed on on that

[02:38:00]
thank you all right thank you I get to go last so lots of great comments I appreciate the board and their responses are questions and responses that we've had from you I just want to say thank you I think a good Baseline like Dr Segunda mentioned is always helpful tool I'll tend to look at this probably from a more resilience base or the more on the strength base because I think it is an opportunity for us to really start to chart a really clear path in terms of what we know it is just a snapshot in time our kids are subjected to snap shots and time all the time because we do it through tests you know to these high stakes tests and so on and so forth so having a snapshot in time of our district is not a bad thing so I think it just tells us you know where there may be some gaps and I agree there could be more to that

[02:39:00]
sorry there's always more to a story behind some data I think I was happy with seeing the increase in AP because I saw that there was an increase especially in zone two which was really helpful we do know that students that participate in a pcso a great opportunity for them to to you know to just experienced more rigor and also just gives them that opportunity they tend to graduate they tend to have you know just greater outcomes so yes we want to get to a higher passing rate but I was really ecstatic to see the AP participation going up the phone to make me so happy to see that so I looked for all the nuggets for places where I saw that there was things that we could build from because I agree with board member Peterson is like what are the things that we're building from it's not it's not like a just a gotcha to our entire staff and everybody that's working

[02:40:00]
so hard we do have work to do and I agree that you know their there is a lot ahead of us but I think you know we're definitely setting the path forward and you know as our student outcomes focused governance Says student outcomes don't change until they'll be here change and a lot of this is about the adults in the room and the things that we need to do so that we can make you know some greater we just help help our students to achieve those those greater outcomes that our communities so badly once and See's and I know that we have the capacity to do I think the capacity is going to come from strong leadership and Leadership to me is not just about sort of grinding down on people but also loving the people that we work with and I think we have to put some love into this to to really understand that we've got a staff that is also hungry I think for some

[02:41:00]
change and for some support and the things that they need so that they can we can get to to the to the great outcomes and to the vision that we all hold for for the district so attuned I thought it was great thank you there was definitely a lot of enlightening moments for me and it sounds superintendent that the diagnostic has worked really well for you and Senior cabinet because it's giving you all some opportunities to to sort of set your course and the work that you're doing so I appreciate whatever everybody's done up to this point because I think it's been it's been a left we've put you through a lot you waited for us on our goals and rails everybody's been working really hard and what I see for my first time you know being here with the district my sixth year is I really see this real coming together around pushing ourselves towards a vision that we all have and I like it because everybody's doing it together the board is doing it

[02:42:00]
along with the community along with the staff I mean it was great even in public forum tonight to hear just even a person talk about our goals and our guard rails and saying you know we want to work on that it takes the community to do this and so I think the more that we can just continue to be on that and you know stay this course you know that we've made this commitment to work to get this and it's not just about gotcha governance or gotcha this is horrible but really about where we're setting a path we're going forward and like Doctor Who like you said from this point forward this is where we know we've got our Baseline and we can move forward and so it tuned I really appreciate the efforts that you all have done on this so thank you all right so I think we're ready to move on to our next item

[02:43:00]
going to continue to be the superintendent tonight and thank you all for your comments I think they were very helpful and appreciate it talk to you know thank you for signing in all right so our next item is going to be a government Affairs update and this is a discussion we have Dr Joseph Escovedo and TC Riser from Mark avenue government Affairs team thank you very much so tomorrow is the last day that legislation may be introduced and so we we actually added about 20 bills today that needed analysis the session ends on Saturday March 18th at noon so again about 900 bills introduced to us so far the

[02:44:00]
little on the the Lower Side of 60 days usually we see about 1200 to 1500 bills that are introduced we do expect House Bill 2 the general appropriation actor budget to be debated on the house floor in the next couple of days we hope to have a budget update to you in the next week or so and we're actually starting to sift through some of the language that the bill got released tonight so we didn't want to go over some of the bills in that we see as you know priority and over you and then we'll take some questions so how spell 102 is the healthcare insurance for educators and this bill would actually pay for the first 10,000 of insurance cost for for employees and then after that 60% of their insurance cost after 10,000

[02:45:00]
currently we're actually covering 80% of the health insurance premiums for employees earning less than 42,500 silver really what they're trying to do is trying to get some parody between the state insurance program for all of their employees and the education of employees so it's been an interesting conversation we don't expect they're actually to be funding in the general appropriation act for the 90 million dollars that needs to cover this so I think they're going to you know go a little bit something less than something that all Educators get 80% of their premiums covered so we'll be monitoring that and really looking we're working with our finance department and our chief finance officer to do some of those calculations okay Madam president members of the board that's going to talk about House Bill 1266 to the graduation requirements in the number of units from 24 to

[02:46:00]
22 eliminating the requirements that all students take Algebra 2 and adult credit advanced placement owners or distance education courses if this bill were to pass it would allow you to make some local decisions on the aps board policy on graduation requirements and we would work with Dr Segura if it were to pass it does not go into effect until our current 7th graders go into high school so we do have time to look at that if it passes House Bill 127 would set a minimum salary for educational assistance at 25,000 and the current minimum is 12,000 Hospital 130 is called the K12 plus program but this bill really does increase the increase our instructional hours to 11405 what an instructional day is and what professional work can be included for educators and the weekend

[02:47:00]
60 hours of professional work additional schools additionally schools who had days Beyond 180 would get additional funding so Madam chair members of the board finally just a couple more bills House Bill 199 that's a significant Bill to us it's actually a huge has a huge impact to us so that would increase the school at Risk Index only by 0.05 but in that since we have such a large number of identified students we actually would generate an additional 14 million dollars at that change so instead of generating 866 really looking at that combined with the increased amount of funds coming for the instructional hours there is some there is some Statewide positive budget

[02:48:00]
a couple more bills house bills Centerville 3 would provide some changes to the family income index and we do have several of our schools who who are do qualify and are executing this program so it'll provide a little bit more flexibility on how they can spend the funds and then sb4 would provide healthy Universal School meals and Dr Blake he did work with the sponsor Senator Padilla on making some changes that actually makes it a little more friendly or for us to have a Central Kitchen instead of an onion that they were originally wanting and set up 1 3 1. 0

[02:49:00]
you have a question about we can let you know when we all right so I'll go first with the board member Gonzalez do you have any questions on presentation or concerns on bills sure sure I mean if you could just kind of give us an idea how do you think each of these bills that you just spoke about their chances of passing are so I think the insurance is going to come somewhere between to really move towards the 80% coverage instead of the 10,000 coverage so it would provide parody of what we provide to those earning less than 425 High School graduation requirements I think is is going to be debated on the house floor I think the big debate or the big debate that is going on around that bill is really around financial literacy and Algebra 2 standards and so

[02:50:00]
you know I think that's really the that's really the kind of where they're going to see if there's any changes in the in the Senate the educational assistance salary increase was fully funded and so I think that'll pass the instructional hour increase I think has a lot of support although there is some contingency of Rule New Mexico who have some concerns and so you know there might be some amendments but I think that won the at-risk index I think is a real it's a real big response to Yazoo Martinez so I think that has some has some legs and I think the rest of the bills that we mentioned family income tax Universal School meals and public school changes with their offset have really good one thing I will just share with you this year more than any of the other 12 or so years

[02:51:00]
I've been up there they are really focused on certain real big priorities graduation requirements structural hours insurance benefits those are really like the big Focus so like in committee there's just some smaller bills that are like you know dual credit pilot projects that they're looking at so it's just an interesting more focused session that I'm wearing thank you board member Jackson so I guess to get into specifics if we could School graduation requirements I see that you the analysis is that we APS administration supports this bill because it gives local control but the bill is about lowering graduation requirements and so I guess I'm and when we had this discussion when when you guys first came to us

[02:52:00]
I don't think that's what we want so at least I said that I shouldn't speak for everyone I said I do not want to lower the requirements and I don't understand why we are allowing requirements so I guess I don't and I would like some clarification when this was decided that APS was is this an Administration decision to support the bill because I don't think it was a board level decision to support the Bill Clinton president and board member the process that we use is as those come in we send out to the cabinet members who are the experts in the field they make an administrative recommendations to support if it's not part of the legislative agenda so the offset Bill specifically was passed by the board as one of your priorities and so we're glad to work

[02:53:00]
the the next question I had was about the HB 130 the K12 plus program my understanding is that there's like competing bills up there and that this one that you've highlighted has the 11:40 but it has the 60 hours embedded within it so really the instructional hours to the kids would be 1140 - 660 correct okay so where where is the other bill in the process that it was the 1140 in addition to the 60 so the reason we highlighted this bill is because this is the building that's actually moved on from one committee the other that other bill has not received a hearing so there's no political backstory as to

[02:54:00]
who's getting credit for one bill moving out of the other you know the governor's proposal also included and there was no bill introduced that would require 80 hours being on the 11:40 and so that actually was never introduced you know there was a house version of the Senate version that competes with this this is the bill that's currently moving forward and that budget language is tied to and that there's funding to actually execute the 4744 to 47 million dollars that it would cost us to go to 1140 it is funded at a 2009 price tag in the current budget is that answer your question yes it does and then maybe my final question and I see on this chart there's a lot of analysis requested probably to what you said that so many bills dropped right before the deadline so who's doing the analysis

[02:55:00]
how's the bill is coming up in committee we make sure those analysis go out and we reach out to the different departments that the bill pertains to so as we see them coming up we're reaching back out and we will get that information before typically a bill goes through several committees so we do have time together the analysis before the time before it gets to a second committee if we haven't received it yet and yeah so I guess just in finality I I do not agree with reducing our graduation requirements at all I think it lowers expectations for our kids and based on the discussion that we just had we need to be raising our standards and I'm just looking at you because you guys are right there and and that's why we will work with doctors if the bill passes the bill does have a lot of support around the state so if it does pass will work with Dr secured to see what needs to be done to support APS

[02:56:00]
board member Dominguez do you have any comments I have a question that clarification TC or or Joseph from is there a local option to that reduction in credits that the bill that reduces graduation credits it does give local control which means then that APS can review and bring a recommendation to the board if they recommend changing the number or leaving it at at what we've got is that correct are there caveats follow the state guidelines or we can recommend to the board to increase the graduation requirements and so that's what will be looked at after or if the bill passes okay so we're not I mean

[02:57:00]
we're not going to reduce the state the bill would reduce the graduation requirements across the state if APS wanted to increase the requirements we would bring that recommendation to the board to determine the final requirements for APS so it's it's a more nuanced conversation and a blanket requirements so my other question is about the offset what do we stand how much do we stand together

[02:58:00]
36 million I believe so okay so we don't I don't have my calculator that just won't be counted when we apply for it so when we apply for it last night because they said hey you have 36 million dollars hanging out there thank you that was my follow-up I mean are we going to be penalized in any way but good good good

[02:59:00]
get a reduction in debt and those are my only questions thank you thank you both for all your work up their board member Peterson time consuming back and forth to the work that was done with the partners to because I think that it really is important to realize how beneficial a relationship with the nmsba and the superintendents Association the teachers unions and the leadership I always forget what the

[03:00:00]
principles Administration Professional Organization is education educational leader anyway I think it's really helpful when when legislators say that there is a real united front on the part of Education Advocates and workers so thank you for all of that and it does seem like there's some good news in in the legislature this year so looking at the 180 or 140 hours 60 hours included does that include a salary increase based on the additional time so the total cost to increase the hours between 44 and 8 million dollars and there's 47 million dollars at a total Statewide

[03:01:00]
couple couple days or hours added to the contractor will be an increase and hot off the press it looks like about an average of 5% salary increases is what the house is proposing so the expectation though for you know they're being very clear in the in the language I was reading for the educational assistance you bring them up to 25000 and then the 5% is what they're prescribing stuff 25,000 minimum salary

[03:02:00]
folks battle for this year or the other classified folks so we don't leave them behind and just I'll do my editorial comments about the graduation requirements I think this is really exciting that we could come up based on our goal for what we want kids to be able to leave high school with I think we could increase having for other things that would be more foundational

[03:03:00]
peaceful math for students and I think if it does go through the thing that it's going to put it on our feet is to make sure we do good pathway counseling with students because we have to make sure that those students that want to be College Bound know that they have to take two language classes know that they've got to take Algebra 2 you know it's going to it's going to be on us to really make sure that they have the information that they need so that they leave High School ready for whatever their next step is but I think it opens up I mean we can increase to 28 credits required and do it partnered with all searches of you know job experience and I just just to open up what what it could look like for graduates I think it's really exciting and but it's going to take work on our parts so

[03:04:00]
thank you but thank you for all the work that gets done during this session board member Gonzalez I'm good thank you for the time to text you already went so I think we're good all right no thank you I agree it's a lot of work having had a chance to run around with you guys a couple of days it's been pretty fun and I just want to say it's unfortunate that the high school graduation requirements is getting sort of mired in this weird debate about losing rigor because I don't think that that's what it's about I like the opportunity that it gives us to really and I think Dr Segunda had said that at one point is to really sort of come up with that pathway so if you're on a career pathway what is the minimum requirements that you need and how do you get there because there's a lot of things that you would do on a career pathway that are not

[03:05:00]
credit bearing so that our students can get that work-based learning opportunity they can do that pre-apprenticeship work and actually be in partnership with some of our trade unions that are ready to do pre-apprenticeship work but because it's not in the classroom classroom instruction gets lost their so so I think it gives us an opportunity but I also agree that for those students that are going to go College route we need that rigor and they need to understand the the minimum credits that they're going to need in order to get that so that they can be admitted into into into into college and be ready for college to with the right kinds of courses and the right kind of rigors so I just wish that the conversation had gone a little bit better I don't think they've done a really good job of describing what that LSC study was about home because the study was really good looking at that and the you know and the the back the backbone or the back story about that also puts us in alignment with her nearby State because other states

[03:06:00]
22 credits to but they've developed those really important Pathways to get there so and I really would love to see APS have that that it's really clear to our students in terms of the pathway structure and what they need to do and what high schools about in terms of the credit pieces that you need to get to the next piece is so thank you so much I appreciate all the work that you're doing and the trips back and forth to to Santa Fe I know it's it's a it's a big task I know that's good and you said what time is are they going to hear it tomorrow on the is it 9:30 a.m. we can send you a link I've been I've been tuning in so I kind of watch but I just want to make sure I've been going back and forth between 7 and house just trying to listen to where they are on on the bills but and since we have this created we will be faster on getting up there okay

[03:07:00]
sounds great okay so our next item for discussion is with board vice president Peggy Miller to go and giving us just an update on right sizing I think all of us I think yeah almost everybody will be more for for us people that are out there listening so I'm trying to go through this quickly I'll probably just read it that way I'm not going off on you know attention so the right thing discussion group one of the important things I want to make sure that everybody knew they were going to in engage the community as it concerns these proposals they went through each proposal and they want everybody to know that Dad was driving and informing the decision went through the timeline wanted us to know that Equity not just economic factors were being considered the redrawn boundaries will go to the community before voting by the board occurs so some of the things they first started out

[03:08:00]
where are schools really over are they overcrowded or under enrolled and what steps do we take that you know we know we are in declining enrollment according to the LFC evaluation report saying enrollment fell by like 17% in the last decade while APS square footage did grow by 21% so some of the proposals the first proposal was for Corrales Elementary School to be turned into a small K-8 school with about 500 students that's been Community Driven Corrales students will no longer feed into Taylor but we'll stay at Corrales for kindergarten to eighth grade right now 60% of Corral students leave APS for other middle schools and so this will help me be a way to retain them Corrales already has a funds to begin changes to their infrastructure and of course there will be an increase to their FTE in the first year so everyone knows there will only be sixth grade in single room classrooms and

[03:09:00]
grade level is added first year likely will be 50 to 60 more students number two proposal was attendance area change recommendations for Janet Kahn Belhaven and Apache proposing to make Janet Khan a pure Magnet School open District district wide with hopefully some super stops to get kids to Janet Cohn the first priority transfers is going to be for current attendance area around the school and the singing area neighborhood and this priority can be on the five years if there's interest it'll be evaluated and adjusted with the singing area neighborhood singing arrow neighborhood perhaps also being a Super Stop so the singing singing arrow students will attend a patchy so everybody knows that the remaining Janet constant attendance area will go to Belhaven for middle school Apache will feed to Kennedy and

[03:10:00]
Belhaven will feed to Grant and for high school Apache will feed to Manzano Belhaven and Janet Kahn to Sandia the third proposal if I'm going to fast just go I'm sorry I'm trying I'm trying to get us out of here tell me to stop Slow Down slow down the recording sorry I'm taking after remember Gonzalez here so she's taught me the next proposal is the Northwest administrative School attendance area changes to balance enrollment at the theater in Seattle this won't go into effect until the build of Seattle Vista classroom block is completed estimated time is probably fall of 2026 so right now the students got better okay is students currently living north of Irving Boulevard who attend get on the wall or Sunset View will be reassigned to Seattle Vista that won't affect

[03:11:00]
feeding pad the feeding patterns into middle or high schools students who attend Theodore Antigua and the east of universe will be reassigned to Sunset View at the same time as the sunset view to the Sierra Vista reassignment it will not affect the feeder patterns to middle high schools all the schools will become 100 feeders to their middle and high schools of note approximately I think and I could be wrong there was going to be about approximately 200 students who now attend Seven bar that go to Taylor that will now attend James Monroe so that'll help them not to have to cross cross the river and make seven bar a feeder into James Monroe I think that was right okay number four I didn't go back to listen to the recording so taking notes the Southwest 4th proposal is a Southwest administrative School area change recommend

[03:12:00]
directions to balance enrollment at Navajo to go for Anaya Dobie acres in Barcelona this won't go into effect until phase one reconstruction of Harrison is done hopefully fall of 2025 and then Barcelona should be finished the following year there's going to only be one change that affects the feeder patterns to middle school but it won't affect the rest of the feeder patterns to Midland High School so that one change to Middle School feeders is going to be the pocket south of Dennis Chavez Rio Bravo that feeds into George I will be reassigned to Adobe Acres these students will now will then feed into Harrison instead of staying at Georgia Eye but they'll still feeding him to Rio Rio Rio Grande so it's going to leave Jorge Sanchez the area Jason to Navajo in route to Adobe Acres on the west side of the dish is reassigned to Navajo ditches are really important so we know

[03:13:00]
the area east of currently attending Rudolfo Anaya is going to be reassigned to Navajo so that will relieve results for Anaya which is pretty big the area north of Blake and east of the drainage ditch will be attending Adobe acres and Navajo is going to be reassigned to Barcelona and then the area south of Dennis Chavez and Rio Bravo attending Navajo is going to be reassigned to Adobe Acres I'm hoping correct me if I'm getting any of these wrong on the 5th proposal and the last one that we heard on Monday was the North Valley attendance recommendations that won't go into effect until Taylor phase one is completed in the fall of 2026 on the proposed dual language into Taft is possibly going to be facing in 6th graders and fall of 2024

[03:14:00]
Taylor will be a pure feeder into Valley feeder patterns won't change except for as I mentioned James Monroe students will no longer feed in to Taylor Corrales moved to a KH and so they won't be feeding into Taylor either half becoming a dual language pure Magnet School Coronado Elementary students will automatically then roll into Taft as well other dual language programs East San Jose Longfellow Reginald Chavez I don't know if that's all of them they will have priority to attend Taft there was definitely a concern voice about having the native needed certified teachers for this duel language program at Mid school with everybody who is teaching a Content area having to speak the language so there may be teachers who may have to transfer so this is a serious concern then the Garfield stem becoming a pure Magnet School students incarnate attend

[03:15:00]
Siri will have first priority to attend those who don't want to attend the Dual Language School can go to Taylor and there will also be likely be super stops for for Garfield so some of the questions and concerns that were raised is when is the school too small is it when it's too hard to offer all programs and electives or you know a full complement of services which is hard to do at a small school when is it time to school clothes school is happening we see across large districts across the country and then should we be reimagining and redesigning middle schools remember Gonzalez said people are talking with their feet and there's a leak in the pipeline somewhere so people are leaving middle schools and why we need a fiscal impact report how can we find naturally support all our schools with declining enrollment

[03:16:00]
and then already spoke to having the bilingual staff for Taft creating welcoming spaces for kids that meet their needs and wants are they really kids out there to recruit and retain we have to look at birth rates in state migration rates housing demand for certain programs in school looking at the increase in homeschooling families choosing private and charter schools and as we've heard a lot is safety issues with boundary changes and families wanting to keep the kids at the school they're currently at they can but for their younger children who aren't in school will have to follow the current the current policy so that's just what we have to do that I know will make some people not very happy about that we're obviously going to meet with Community about boundary changes and try to solidify to the extent possible the changes spoken about is it regards Janet Garfield and Corrales

[03:17:00]
there is a request to really listen to the Early Childhood Center providers at one of these right-sizing meetings look at concerns as it concerns as it may be relates to closing schools and redeveloping some of that some of those areas into residential areas that are landlocked or leasing schools to Charters that need building looking at of course again the fiscal impact report and the cost to taxpayers to repurpose the school buildings versus selling or leasing what is that cost going to be to taxpayers to build Early Childhood hubs and a facilities plan would help with that reducing you know square footage footprint looking at that anticipated budget deficit due to declining enrollment and I think that's it and that was a three-hour meeting I think I did it really fast but the next

[03:18:00]
everything is going to be held on March 27th and hopefully we'll have some public input meeting scheduled for the public to voice their concern about or questions about all of this hopefully soon and if you have any questions I'm not sure exactly because they're all the maps that we all got so if there's a way that the public can kind of look at the map so they can see what these changes are because I'm I'm sure I didn't cover every single thing that's on the map so if we can make sure to let them know where I just shared that presentation with you and we are working on trying to get that information out by posting it but I shared it with you just now so okay thank you all right any questions for board member to the very first thing he said so is this the Corrales is that a done deal

[03:19:00]
is that going to happen is there a proposal OK Google when will when will these proposals be brought to the board for approval that will likely not happen until probably April it just because our next meeting to allow time for public input so our next meeting the right size and discussion group isn't until March 27th so the soonest we probably be able to get it on for us to even vote on would probably not be until April we put a urgency on bringing forward to the board those things that require us to make a decision quickly so we're not going to be like deciding all of these things but just those that need to come before us for a firm decision things that can happen quickly like the boundary changes and and just those things I think Corrales I don't have the money for the infrastructure already so it's already there but

[03:20:00]
board approval for it to come for us over to us that we could do that okay so around April okay and then I guess just kind of and I'm sorry I wasn't there my husband was out of town that's okay that's why you're doing this what what are like the goals moving forward does does the does the committee like have set goals is to like not yet not yet working I think what we're doing is we're taking it and bite-sized chunks so the first phase of this is really around those boundary changes and those things that we can do the other discussions like we know for example The Early Childhood hubs piece is going to require a whole lot more digging deep and more Community engagement so that we can really get our arms wrapped around that so that that is that's going to be

[03:21:00]
we don't have a firm timeline for all of that yet because we still have to figure out the work that needs to be done to get to that point I think what what the district has heard loud and clear is just the feedback they're getting it's not a it's not an easy thing we're going to have to get some more Community input on those pieces okay I don't remember Jackson are you talking about like goals for this discussion group or goal for goals for the right sizing committee that is presenting to or for the committee like how how how how is the right season committee what is the plan like each month or your meeting and and like have set goals oh okay because we hit talked about that too we're going to there's some Community input and feedback that we need to get so we've got to build those pieces in there as well so so a board member Jackson we are meeting weekly as a right sizing committee to look at

[03:22:00]
each of these plans and bringing together the academic and facility and fiscal impact to each of them I met with some Associates today to discuss some of the documents that we have to try to put together miss the Bell has put together a nice flow chart of your by year for each of these but we want to also include what are the Staffing implications program implications and you know what what does that look like each year so we're working on those pieces but we do meet weekly and then those pieces you will discuss with and then she will set the sorry I'm speaking for you but I'm trying to understand it so then you will then set the agenda for the committee moving forward I'm guessing right I hope

[03:23:00]
that wasn't going to have a big fiscal impact really right and some of these recommendations you know will impact some communities more than others and some will have a greater fiscal impact than others and so we're trying to prioritize which changes and recommendations would be less impactful that could benefit for example of the Corrales K8 is less impactful the community supports it we know that already and so were tasked to look at what does that look like and what additional Staffing would possibly be needed awesome thank you I think the rest of us right there

[03:24:00]
all right all right so the announcement of upcoming board meetings the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday March 1st 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Miller Community boardroom of the Alice and Bruce King educational complex 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or virtually at www.aps.edu and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday February 22nd 2023 at 5 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee meeting John Milne and also online and with that we are adjourned thank you
