this event is all about taking a look at what's been happening in APS under leadership of our superintendent Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey and getting a sneak peek at West to come for students families and our schools will celebrate the progress we've made be real about the challenges still face and hear about the plans that will help make APS even better to get things off I like to introduce someone who has been working hard to make sure our schools are moving in the right direction for president

[00:13:00]
please join me in welcoming board president Danielle Gonzales welcome

[00:14:00]
and not present today from District 4 Heather Benavides from District 2 in All the Time Warner to and from District 5 Crystal Tapia Romero I also get the distinct privilege of welcoming all of the other dignitaries is there if you are a signature

[00:15:00]
city council president Brooke bazan from the public education department deputy secretary Amanda DeVille from the City of Albuquerque Kappa Sandoval and we want to celebrate all of that progress but I do want to remind us a little bit to set some contacts and I'm going to remind us back to the beginning of 2023 that was when in January of 233 after multiple listening sessions throughout the second half of 2022 the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education

[00:16:00]
adopted for 5-year goals the goals are and sharing an increase in the percentage of students from our Native American black and economically disadvantaged communities English language Learners and students with disabilities who achieve grade level Proficiency in reading by grade 3 So reading proficiency groups the second goal making sure that more of our students from these same groups are doing math at grade level by 8th grade the third goal preparing are high school students for Life International Airport

[00:17:00]
habits and mindsets for Life success these are things like perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness now in addition to these goals we have also formally adopted some rules of the road which of these are the things that you as our community told us are important to you as the district is going about implementing strategies to reach our goals these things we call guardrails we're at the halfway point of this work and I can unequivocally say that has fundamentally change the way we're operating as a district we are now

[00:18:00]
at the administration level and importantly at the school level all of our interim targets have been set to keep us on track superintendent Blakey who is just over one year into her term as superintendent and her team are reporting to us the board and to you the public regularly on the progress toward achieving these specific measurable achievable relevant and time bound or smart goals we've reviewed and we have adopted more than two dozen monitoring reports on these reports are keeping us the board the district and the community laser focused on what matters most students they're enabling us to know what is working what's not

[00:19:00]
tough strategic questions about next steps and we're also receiving a root cause analysis whenever something might be off track as a district also I am proud to say that we are leading the state with our approach our focus on goals and allocating resources to improve the education of the students who are identified in the Martinez Yazzie case that's pretty cool welcome

[00:20:00]
paying attention to what we call non-academic measures so these are things like student sense of belonging social connections interpersonal relationships between students and teachers physical and psychological safety at school and this includes bullying violence and the availability of support for our students and all along the way we are celebrating our students staff and our schools when they need their targets I'm a big proponent of the student outcomes focused approach because of the school board member as a parent and as a community member I've seen first-hand what a difference and focusing it on what matters most students the fact that we're holding this event today to report

[00:21:00]
this board has been consistently meeting with the community to provide information to listen and to get feedback now yes there have been bumps along the way but we are being transparent and we're working past those while we as a community and every member of this board wants are students to be proficient in reading and math we want our students to be prepared for college or career of their choice After High School and we want them to have the life skills that they will need to succeed in the world these are the skills that you the community told us matter most we adopted these goals because we knew the aps had to do better for our kids for our city and for our

[00:22:00]
this work is personal to me because of my family's long history with APS and so this is what I get to give a shout out to Valley High School go Vikings make no mistake increasing academic achievement at a large Urban school district is hard but none of us are shying away from that challenge often in education systems they try to start with the accountability at the bottom level with the teachers and with our government's model we are reversing that and we are saying that accountability starts with us the Board of Education we are proud of the work that we've done and we are excited for the work ahead thank you

[00:23:00]
reading Gonzalez I'm now excited to introduce someone whose Story shows just how far education can take you Dr Michael Richards often talks about how as a student he wasn't sure what his future would look like but with encouragement from his teachers and the opportunities he found in school he ended up doing things he never thought possible today he's the Executive Vice President for the UNM Health Services Center and CEO of the UNM Health Center on the way he's been a doctor in the emergency room medical students and a trusted voice in shaping Healthcare in New Mexico what makes you so powerful is that it started just like many of ours with teachers who believed in him and a commitment to keep learning he's living proof that the goals to incredible

[00:24:00]
Futures please join me in welcoming Dr Michael Richards well thank you so much Gage so I'd like to start off this morning telling you about a really good friend of mine his name is Dr Michael Hubbell and he's a semi-retired college professor in North Carolina and so you just heard that I am early in my career I was an emergency medicine physician and actually what I really special Hurricane Katrina in 2005 for the students

[00:25:00]
the largest most deadly powerful hurricanes in the history of the United States came into the Gulf of New Mexico Gulf of Mexico hit the Southern States but especially hit the City of New Orleans very hard displaced a million people over 2,000 deaths 1225

[00:26:00]
and then finally another team could come in and backfill us that was a little after 3 days and so as we were getting in the vehicles and I was being relocated to Shreveport where we were going to open up a field hospital called home then I called my friend Mike and I said Mike you are not going to believe what I am doing Mike said I know exactly what you're doing okay

[00:27:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:28:00]
who was a technical community college in my community that created my first entry into higher education and then from there I went on to become a paramedic firefighter working full-time and I was encouraged by the Educators at Guilford Technical Community College who said you know Mike you've got some aptitude my undergraduate degree I went to Winston-Salem State University which is a historical black University about how to create educational opportunities for working adults University

[00:29:00]
and I went on and got a graduate degree from UNC Chapel Hill and then from their medical degree from East Carolina University but at each step along the way there was a teacher who encouraged me to keep going now I also have kids many of them who are not much older than you right here in facts about my kids

[00:30:00]
Elizabeth and so Elizabeth this was shortly after I had just done a period of time when I was the interim dean of the school of medicine and Elizabeth interested in a career in healthcare and so we give lots of advice and discussions around Healthcare careers and college and so Elizabeth tells me you know Dad I was talking to Grandma and I think that you may not be right about I think I really should have a 4.0 if I'm going to be competitive for medical school

[00:31:00]
early on in my career was that I didn't dream big enough but I'm grateful for all those friends and teachers along the way who helped me reset that and then reset it again and then reset it again so in the case of Elizabeth you don't have to have 4.0 GPA you have to be academically prepared and you have to be committed so be careful not to create barriers be careful not to question yourself too much thank you were never more than 12 hours

[00:32:00]
your life changes few things rival education in its consistency and its power to change individual lives economically socially psychologically while education may not be the only transformative force it is arguably the most reliable and scalable and I think about one of our secretary of education is under President Obama who said educational

[00:33:00]
13% growth faster than almost any other industry recession-resistant diverse well-compensated but what really sucks the healthcare career part is kind of like what I said at the very beginning I didn't do something special opportunity of something special

[00:34:00]
one of the top 100 grams and our school of medicine tops of many things especially around primary care so there's lots of opportunities for you to do that so I encourage you to think big doesn't matter where you start there's more than one Pathway to get there but you know there's another thing that I wanted to do and closing I want to acknowledge the Educators that are in this room you heard me talk about

[00:35:00]
half of the hundreds if not thousands of other people like me that you've inspired throughout your Years thank you what you do is actually very special and it makes a difference thanks so much for the opportunity to talk with you today thank you so much we are so grateful that you took time out of your busy when you believe in yourself and when teachers and mentors believe in YouTube

[00:36:00]
I am excited to introduce our superintendent Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey she is starting her second year leading APS and in that time she's been working hard to make big changes that put students first from creating a clear path to help us all succeed in reading math and life beyond graduation to making sure students have a voice and shaping the future of our schools Dr Blakey showing what it means to be a leader who listens and takes action our district before Dr Blakey takes the stage please watch this very special video

[00:39:00]
thank you Luke I am proud to say that in just 9 months Luke and about 4,000 other students will be graduating from Albuquerque Public Schools and every time that I see that video I get goosebumps it's a powerful reminder of our responsibility to prepare students for the world that awaits them after they walk across the stage in their caps and gowns to receive their diplomas that they work so hard to earn and behind the every cap and gown is a student living a year that comes only once in a lifetime one year to be a first grader one year to be a 5th grader one year to be an 8th grader and that year is fleeting and if we don't give them our best the opportunity is gone and that's why we do

[00:40:00]
play everything that we do every lesson every interaction every decision is about making that one year a foundation for future success we have worked with urgency to challenge the status quo and to lay a strong foundation for lasting progress with bold steps and a Clear Vision we are setting a course for Meaningful change that puts our students first Albuquerque Public Schools we're building critical thinkers problem solvers and good communicators we are holding our students into engage citizens that are driven by a growth mindset we are pushing them to be Innovative collaborative and socially and culturally aware we are teaching them to persevere and at the end of the day we want them to be advocates for themselves for their families and for those in this world who cannot stand up for themselves that ladies

[00:41:00]
gentleman is our profile of a graduate and if our most recent graduating class is any indication we are doing a good job living up to those high standards take Abraham Lincoln graduate who was born and spent a good part of his childhood in a rural community in Egypt he is now a freshman at the University of New Mexico and plans to be a doctor to help underserved communities like the one where he was raised take Haley and El Dorado Lake weather forecast created an administered by the Navajo Nation Kaylee wants to become an indigenous wants to become a court reporter

[00:42:00]
and take Manzano high school graduate Gabriella McCarthy who never missed a day of school her entire K12 career she is studying political science at the University of New Mexico and Cody Pittman a Daniel scholar who led 110 Cadets as the Battalion commander of West mesa's JROTC he graduated with a 4.5 grade-point average and is pursuing a civil engineering degree at Colorado School of Mines these are the remarkable graduates we have graduating year after year and that's certainly something we're celebrating of the world it's all about who have completed High School portion of their programs it continue to have

[00:43:00]
transition needs for employment postsecondary education training independent living and Community connections Jared and Isaiah were among the inaugural class of students who received on-the-job training at outcomes coffee a small beverage shop we opened last spring to teach students the basics of holding down a job in the real world setting Beyond making the Beverages and handling the cash register their importance of skills like communicating with customers and managing difficult situations and customers like me these students are modeling the aps profile of a graduate they are working to become problem solvers good communicators collaborative socially and culturally aware and ready to adapt and persevere but this profile isn't just words on a page it captures the knowledge skills and mindsets that we want every one of our APS students to carry

[00:44:00]
beyond our classrooms are graduate profile begins shaping students from day one from the moment a child enters our schools we take on the responsibility of helping them grow into the person that they become as a leader of one of the largest school districts in the nation I take tremendous pride in the work of our public schools and what we do to serve every child because public education is a powerful promise that every child no matter their zip code their background their language or they're learning needs deserves an excellent education and it's a promise to prepare students not just for the next assignment but for life it's a promise to our communities to bring people together to build understanding and to create a future better than the one today and it's a promise to our staff to support Challenge and Empower them to do their best work

[00:45:00]
I am in awe of our staff and the breath of services that they provide from our Pre-K programs for 3 and 4 year olds to our transition service programs for students 18 to 21 and every day they make that promise real for our students for children with profound special needs there's no better place than the Highland complex and our Stephen Moody complex these schools are designed to support our students with autism and other needs that can't be met on a typical campus and this November you will have the opportunity to help us expand this work through a general obligation Bond on the ballot this Bond includes funding for a special needs education facility on the west side so that students will not have to be busted across town to access these facilities this Bond will also find critical upgrades to our schools over the summer our technicians have been working around the clock on air conditioning units

[00:46:00]
Rising temperatures and aging systems that are often barely holding together and with this Bond we will be able to convert 20 schools to new refrigerated air systems in addition we will be able to complete 13 essential School building projects that have been delayed or made more expensive with Rising construction costs and we plan to build a Hands-On career lab that will prepare students for high demand careers so please vote on November 4th and we are very proud to be able to say that we are not a one-size-fits-all district take San Diego High School for example San Diego high school offers one of the most rigorous High School educations through its International Airport to this pathway

[00:47:00]
it's among the many choices that we provide offering something for everyone including all students and families we offer a K12 environmental stem pathway called sustaining the future at Los Padilla's and Mountain View Elementary Polk Middle School and Rio Grande High School this pathway focus on inquiry-based learning experiences and environmental stem curriculum provide students the opportunity to obtain certificates from partnering universities such as drone flying agriculture sustainability clean energy and sustainable farming are engineering the future Avenue Garfield Middle School in Valley High School's to real world problems through Hands-On learning experiences incorporating project-based learning and Community Partnerships and our

[00:51:00]
I proudly point to the depth and variety of the programs we have to offer to our students our motto I choose APS reflects the many opportunities available to our students and we are proud of what we've built and excited to keep growing and expanding our opportunities but first few reasons why our students and staff choose Albuquerque Public Schools there's more than her I could reenact it I can't see anybody anymore but it only matters

[00:52:00]
students are in school to take advantage of it that's why attendance is so critical well the rate of chronic absenteeism is slowly improving still about a third of our students are missing too many days and with each absence we lose the chance to reach our students who need us the most and this isn't just a high school issue 30% of our elementary students are chronically absent missing out on crucial foundational skills that set the stage for everything that comes next in their education and we can't teach students if they are not in school and every day is a missed opportunity to help them grow and succeed but improving student outcomes also means raising our proficiency rates in reading and math a couple of years ago fewer than four students were proficient in English language arts and only about one in four students for

[00:53:00]
Denton mass and we must do better that's why we are so focused on the goals are Board of Education set in 2023 and I am thrilled to stand before you to say that we are on track to meet all of our goals but first I would like to highlight some of our schools that are making their way on real progress Barcelona Elementary School Barcelona Elementary School is leading the way on improving reading proficiency from challenges and instead focus on building the skills that they need to succeed by teaching to their highest performing students they raise the bar for the whole class teachers collaborate deliver consistent grade level instructions

[00:54:00]
add John Adams Middle School John Adams Middle School is driving growth in math proficiency through smart targeted strategies using i-Ready and unit assessment data teachers pinpoint the skills that students need to succeed on grade level material they build those skills with quick start class activities small group instruction and after school tutoring for extra support students also practice explaining their thinking their understanding of mathematical Concepts principal Kenneth merge please stand to be recognized Valley high school and other opportunities and show them how these

[00:55:00]
set them up for Success after graduation at Valley High School they promote these programs through social media teacher conversations and weekly parent and staff updates and they even hold an apprenticeship Signing Day much like athlete signing days these results speak for themselves more students are taking AP classes and earning college credit and more joining internships and apprenticeships and enrollment in the engineering the future pathway is growing at Roosevelt Middle School we have seen impressive games and skills habits and mindsets they are strengthening perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness by building a culture of belonging well-being and growth and it starts on day one of school with where everyone belongs or what is an orientation programme that welcome sixth graders and helps them feel at home at their new school this program started

[00:56:00]
cancel of middle schools including Roosevelt where they were already having success and this year we expanded it to every middle school because we saw the value that it brings in helping our students feel like they belong in day one of their new Middle School Roosevelt also offers two electives each semester and academic support through their what I need or win class giving students the tools and confidence to succeed in making them excited to come to school every day and I also want to recognize a teacher Keith janeski a committed science and math educator at Cleveland Middle School who inspires his students through leadership roles and bustling athletic programs guiding them to build confidence teamwork and school pride as he left he Champions a wide range of sports and as a leadership teacher he helps students plan memorable events fostering communication responsibility and engagement

[00:57:00]
dedication also plays a role in academic improvements with Cleveland Middle School receiving recognition for significant gains in mathematics and I understand Mr janeski is here today with many of his students will Mr janeski and his students please stand to be recognized the games that we are seeing in these schools in classrooms didn't happen by chance we've committed to strategic initiatives that turn Vision into action from elementary through High School we're rolling out changes that meet students where they are and help them to grow at our elementary schools nearly a dozen campuses are part of a redesign initiative a few years ago when the state was pressuring us to close struggling schools we took a different approach we redesigned them

[00:58:00]
created a new vision for these schools it is a model that is centered on teacher collaboration genius Our Community Partnerships and coaching and we continue to refine and Improvement using it as a model for other schools across the district and in middle school we are partnering with Arizona State University on a boulder model to rethink the Middle School experience too many students have been lost in the jump from 5th to 6th grade leaving middle school students struggling to provide the engaging environment that our students deserve the next education Workforce initiative launching this year at 6:00 a.m. structures to create a student center learning environment teachers collaborate on individual needs and interests and at our high schools we're launching the

[00:59:00]
a modern purpose-driven approach to learning this model connects students with real-world career Pathways designed with community and Industry Partners at the Academy of Albuquerque students will choose Pathways aligned to the New Mexico workforce needs from engineering to health services and engage in core subjects through the lens of their chosen academy career exploration Hands-On learning internships and strong Community Partnerships help students discover their passions and graduate ready for college trade school military service or straight into the workforce and that's why I following the state of the district this morning we are excited to host the powerful Partnerships convening organized by United Way and facilitated facilitated by Ford NGO a nonprofit that partners with communities to turn high schools into Career Academy

[01:00:00]
there are opportunities that can change lives just look at Dr Richards whose story we heard earlier students who receive encouragement mentorship and chances to explore their interests can achieve things that they never imagined his path from an unsure student to Executive Vice President of University of New Mexico health science center and CEO of the UNM Health System shows the transformative power of education and Partnerships and exactly why we design experiences like the Academy of Albuquerque to prepare every student for success and just as we plan for their Futures we also take time to celebrate the Educators who bring all of these plans to life are school district has a lot to be proud of we have the largest crop of National Merit semifinalist in the state a designation reserved for the brightest students

[01:01:00]
Ventana Ranch Elementary School was designated a blue ribbon school by the US education secretary and four of our teachers Tara palomares Kimberly Connelly Lisa Rupert and Christopher Speck received to the presidential award for excellence in Mathematics and Science teaching this is the highest award K12 Math and Science teachers can receive from the United States and this year's International High School to support our Refugee and immigrant students to ensure they feel they belong we are meeting the moment we are taking bold action to give every student the opportunities and support that they need to succeed today and build a strong future we know that doing things the way we have always done will not prepare students for the future and we have taken steps this past

[01:02:00]
to change the path change the focus and change the trajectory for many of our students we have a lot of work to do ahead of us but I am certain that we have taken the steps forward to plan A New Path so president Gonzalez members of the Board of Education students families APS College community members and distinguished guests what is the state of the district Albuquerque Public Schools is strong and we are building on the momentum that we have created I am certain to be able to say that we are APS rising and I'm just going to continue

[01:03:00]
Investments that you have made for our students thank you to our board of education for the goals that you have set thank you to our parents for entrusting your most precious asset to us thank you students for your curiosity for your willingness to explore new ideas and for your trust in us and thank you to the taxpayers for investing in our kids and most importantly thank you to our APS staff for the hard work that each of you put in every day to guide our students from their first moments in pre-k and kindergarten to walking across the stage as high school graduates receiving their diplomas so at this time I'd like to invite our board president Gonzalez

[01:04:00]
what are yours but today we are going to turn the tables and here to ask us a few questions is Jensen Wyatt a senior at El Dorado High School Jensen the floor is yours good morning everybody

[01:05:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:06:00]
and on the flip side if I didn't have a connection to my teacher that was my least favorite class and so I don't know if it was really a subject but really my favorite teacher would encourage me to not want to miss that class more than the content that I was learning that's a good point I think a teacher will shift your perspective on a classroom activities so I participated in a lot of different activities

[01:07:00]
I was involved in an orchestra so I started playing violin when I was in elementary school and then I played all through middle school and high school and so that was one of my major time commitments was being in Orchestra and I played basketball for a week specifically

[01:08:00]
started my path on wanting to make change I actually was a political science major for a long time and that was one of them and so I think that that is the best part of being a school board member is being able to see all of the success in the community and then being able to bring that back to the administration back to the board to try to make Improvement said it's been exciting

[01:09:00]
to hire a new amazing superintendent and all of that is really based on feedback from the community so I love being able to hear directly from the community that's the fun part among some stuff that's not so fun to access to because you say you're from and it's a little bit late

[01:10:00]
I would get really frustrated with like not having what I needed to teach my best and so I wanted to go into Administration to become a principal so that I could help what I was facing as barriers as a teacher and then when I was a principal I was like wait there's still there still problems and so I think one of the drivers behind being a superintendent is that I still think of myself as a teacher and how I could break down the barriers that were preventing me from being able to do my best work with students so I kind of approach it as I wanted to be the superintendent so that I could help break down barriers of the system however I think the reason

[01:11:00]
turn on is because I actually did spend my whole career in education and education policy but I'm also a parent comma so I'm a parent to four kiddos who are in APS schools and it was actually during the pandemic as a parent observing how these kiddos were navigating I think they were like for 10:13 and 12 maybe at the time I can't remember but I know that there was an opportunity to make it better to make it better for kids and I think I recognize that a lot of students throughout our community didn't have that same level of privilege and I thought that I needed to do something to contribute

[01:12:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:13:00]
the superintendent says the leadership for the school district so the system of schools so the principles we have you know 140 principles and so those principles then I support the principal so that they can support the students the school board is the governing structure for the district so they sent policy they approve the budget and they hire the superintendent and the principal and the superintendent

[01:14:00]
whatever that may bring and we want them to have the life skills necessary to succeed in life and so that's where we talked about things like self-management and being able to work with others being able to solve problems being able to think critically being able to be on time for stuff that the community what advice would you give somebody for someone who's my age right now so my advice

[01:15:00]
I'm so my advice for you would be to really be proud of who you are and everything that you have as an asset to who you are that everybody is unique and with each of you you all have different gifts and talents that you will use to give back to your community and so as of 17 is really don't think about what you are what your friend is that you're not thinking about your own assets and your own gifts and how you can draw a nose to give back to other people awesome I think there's a lot of pressure around you and everything that you do from

[01:16:00]
social media to having to do your chores to having to dress appropriately right kind of makeup right kind of shoes are kind of clubs to join words to say all of those things and I would encourage students just to not stress and have fun period

[01:17:00]
my favorite musician is probably Bono from U2 if you've ever heard of Oz number three
