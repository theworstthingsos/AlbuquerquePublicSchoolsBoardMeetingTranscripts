Video ID: YcYbFw_iZZI
==================================================

[00:00:00]
85432 1 okay so I wasn't quite ready so let's say we are coming back into a reconvening of the board is ready to reconvene and to open session with the Board of Education met in executive session pursuant to the open meetings act and MSA 1978 section 10 Dash 15 dash 1 H2 for the purpose of a limited Personnel matter regarding the superintendent's contract the matters discussed in the executive session we're limited only to those specified so now we're going to go back to our regular scheduled meeting and our first item for consideration is approval of the consent agenda item for consideration for review and approval of the 2023 20/24 work calendars and pay schedule this is a discussion action

[00:01:00]
I don't know if we had a friend Apodaca Chief Financial Officer Mark Turnbull I think is here unless the board members have any other additional questions to this what president I think it's a consent it's a consent yeah I mean discussion shoes I will entertain a motion I move to prove the consent agenda items I second on Savannah's yes Barbara Peterson yes Crystal issue is consideration for approval of the preliminary official statement relating to the district

[00:02:00]
General obligation bonds series 2023 this is a discussion action and we also have Mr Mark Turnbull here from from accounting so you have the floor unless there's some additional questions I know that was some information that was sent to us I don't know if you want to present some information or if the board just wants to go straight into questions there was a lot of information that was forwarded to us on this Mr Turnbull I don't know if you had any else any other information you want to share at this time or I know you answered lots of questions probably and concerns so the boards on zoo movie

[00:03:00]
he was a prepared the preliminary official statement so he's also available for questions are there any questions from the board on this go ahead so I mean this is just a I know a lot of my questions were answered and things were you know updated as we were told they would be but I'm still looking at some of the numbers of students were on the digital page 54 it said that we have 90240 47th Street on another page it says that we have over 8900 so does that really not matter as long as we're close if the two numbers are different does it make any difference

[00:04:00]
the language of similar to Prior years as we're saying over and over about that we did not give an exact numbers in prayer so we went yeah cuz one of them just says we have yeah we have 9,247 charter school students and then another page it says that we have over $8,900 attending charter schools so as long as that's okay with everybody who's doing it I have no idea cuz I don't do this stuff so I just catch that kind of stuff so as long as it's okay with that okay or I mean yeah and I will say when board member Jackson and I will sit when we have to sign all of those periods of papers and art does a really good job of bringing the the information to us where it's pretty consistent and correct but if there's any other

[00:05:00]
but it's pretty much an approximation is what I'm looking at and everything that they do in the document that they put forward and there's been this is going to be my second it'll be our second year that we get to do this so I know the first year when Mr Melendez set with us he gave us great because secretary Jackson have so many questions and so but it was a great you know it was a great overview in terms of the how and the why so I'm feeling really confident with the way that the documents are set up and I think that's that's how I looked at it okay you got a good one when it comes to us is that there's a lot of approximations that are giving in that because it's a legal document okay and then the last I think the last thing on the digital page of the proposed document not the final document on the outstanding debt

[00:06:00]
who were the 2023 let me check 2023 B bonds it's at 47 million but then on the updated one it said 43250 43,250,000 but none of the others were changed so if you look at the 2009 it stayed the same the 2010 all the way down except for the 2023 be once it went to from 47 million to the official official official one it's at 4 3 3. 5 5

[00:07:00]
running bonds will change and so the the number that you will actually see in the final pricing results will be different from this number and so on on the on the front and on the maturity schedule we try to get an approximation of what it will look like come the actual pricing but in the other component of it it will change it once the final official statement comes out the 2023 bonds will be corrected for the exact Paramount that was sold for the refunding throughout the entire documentary and that's just what I that was just my assumption I just wanted to make sure and and I know that you did answer this question when you were saying that if we see that the interest rate is not going to go lower than we won't do the refunding correct that is correct it we plan on pricing on Wednesday of next week between now and then if interest rates were just shoot up

[00:08:00]
and you know significantly the refunding does not generate 3% present value savings similar to last year if you recall we were looking at refunding the same bonds with taxable bonds at that time because it was an advanced refunding rates digit of we did not execute the refund because it was not economically beneficial for the district okay I think that's it thank you what is the timeline for adding specificity that actually goes to the voters and and this is really more of a board process I think then necessarily the general

[00:09:00]
of the bond I don't know the answer to that one so Madam president and I can kind of attention so so what is being issued is 70 million of the 200 million that was authorized by voters in November of 2021 so voters have already taken action to authorize those bonds we're just now in the process of issuing what voters have already approved the District Attorney's office

[00:10:00]
a second I have a roll call please leave me alone Aragon yes any other Gonzalez yes Robert Peterson yes Crystal Tapia Romero Dominguez yes yes yes yes our next item for discussion thank you gentlemen next item for discussion is the government Affairs update and here comes our team is Dr Escobedo and Jessica Martinez hey hey good evening Madam president from our government Affairs team which will serve as our final report for the 2023 legislative session the governor had until Friday April 7th to sign

[00:11:00]
legislation so tonight we're going to go over some of the highlights from that action and will be available for your questions regarding hb2 the governor did line item veto some of the budget items with no major changes otherwise one of those being an included mandatory 6% raise for all employees the language that was vetoed in that item is the average 6% raise meaning that there's a 6% raise for all employees across the board on the governor did sign house bill for the Voting Rights bill which has a clause that prohibited school or professional development to be held on Election Day this will not go into effect until 2024 in our teams are already had some conversations with the sponsors of that legislation and the pet to have this highlighted his priority for us for next session the governor also did veto the school dual credit test for saying that there was already a group that existed that could serve the same function and purposes that

[00:12:00]
as a task force did or was going to she also surprised of vetoed House Bill 126 the school graduation requirements we know that this conversation is going to be ongoing and will continue so we welcome any input from the on the district's position for this policy moving forward so I'm not a president of the board superintendent Elder the governor did sign House Bill 127 which minimum 25,000 minimum for Education license educational assistance additionally she did sign House Bill 130 which is the increase of instructional hours to that 1,140 the charter school expenditure plan and that would have required us to disclose in detail how we utilize the 2% administrative fee from Charter Schools she did

[00:13:00]
find the capitol Outlet projects which has 13.4 million in Appropriations and we did include a packet for you of those Appropriations and the governor also signed the universal lunch program Bill and again we're meeting I believe next week with the Chief Operating Officer Dr Blakey and the governor's office about implementation what are your priorities bills the capital of Outlet offset bill it's going to save us about 12.2 million to reduce our offset by a third which is a total office about 37 million and finally a couple quick bills sp33

[00:14:00]
provides a track for vocational teachers to get certified as a full-time license teachers and then I just wanted to call out the language in the budget in your packet around expenditures and how the states really identifying how to evaluate expenditures in the budget so as we come forward with you and the budget season with those Charter School budgets kind of relating that language so Madam president members of the board superintendent Elder I do want to thank our government Affairs team for their work this year they put in a lot of hard work so we will Begin work on implementation and begin attending interim meetings and we stand open for questions at this time are there any questions from the board go ahead board member Jackson so I sent this earlier and I think is this where it's going to be addressed the HB

[00:15:00]
so I noticed the HP 7 was not listed in here and so I was wondering if we were going to get an analysis of HP 7 and how it how it affects current policies that we have how it overlaps with the children's code I am getting a lot of questions from the community about what HB 7 means for the schools and so I am wondering if we're going if you if you have that analysis ready to go or if that's when we will kind of kind of have some talking points available for the can for the community because I think there's fear whether its rightful or not but I think that we need to know how does it affect any policies that we have within APS so Madam president Jackson regarding hb7 there is not we did not track this particular legislation because there is no action for AP

[00:16:00]
included their I'm going to respond from the question that we gave to the board but first I'm going to put my glasses on cuz all right so the question is relating to your relating to your question so the ACT outlines discrimination not what can or cannot be taught or discussed in the school related to you know health education sex education Federal content standards for health education and benchmarks American School Counselors Association standards and the New Mexico department of health school health manual are followed for pregnancy or reproductive Health Care prevention and schools all those school-based Health Centers and I think that's maybe where some of those questions are coming from our subject Provisions in the actual health centers are not considered an entity of APs they function under the rules and guidelines of HIPAA and their governing organizations so

[00:17:00]
does that include like nurses like nurses fall under APS but School base Health Centers fall outside they fall under different medical entity School nurses and school counselor counselors function under the HIPAA I'm sorry under the FERPA governance in other words that is not it's not going to impact APS it's a non-discrimination legislation that's just simply stating that any of the non-discrimination laws that currently apply should continue to apply whatever you just read will you before doing to us I believe they have it it's in the board was in there okay so I appreciate that the other question that I had was oh I had two more so with each before going back to what you said at the very beginning

[00:18:00]
but you said we are going to be focused be highlighting that are we for that or against that the language that will go into effect for 2024 day for students or staff so this year we use the election day as a professional development day and it works great ideas and then the if we can go to the EA salary I think it's HB 127 I I did receive a question and I think I forwarded it to the finance people but you guys might actually know this

[00:19:00]
all right let me go to my email real quick if you don't mind so the question was do we have any idea if the new pay scale will it be will it also be tiered or will everyone go to the flat 25,000 regardless of Education and Training I believe that needs to be negotiated salary schedule which is for Educational Systems has different levels of college credit hours so the answer is it will need to be negotiated but current G1 schedule has tears for college credit so for example if you're level one if you have to 7 hours

[00:20:00]
40 we can send you this link and then 90 Plus hours gives you an additional $2,000 and met a president Jackson just to highlight emphasize that that that that that raise does apply only to licensed educational assistance no thank you I'm okay I was going to say something about it okay great I just want to make sure any other board member Miller going so then I know that you did say that we're going to get that you're going to be meeting a little bit more about the universal School meals so you'll have a little bit more information about it so when I was looking do we does APS

[00:21:00]
not maximize access to the federal funds for those for the cost of the breakfast and lunch so do we or do we not remember so then do we have any idea what the cost is going to end up being if we already maximize access to those funds now when it's going to be Universal what is that cost going to be so Madam president official conference last week the way I understood that the payment side of the business side of it is any any any difference between what the district would receive in the actual cost would be paid for by the legislation so one of the things that were we would like to meet with them on is the implementation of you know sight base kitchens and having them understand our Central Kitchen and how we have a mission and

[00:22:00]
so the money is is there to pay whatever right that difference then kind of maybe I believe that the high end so that was that was a very liberal estimate because that included some facility I hope it is but we get unfunded mandates and so will figure that one out in a while and then the other question I have and I lost it was about the studying and I don't know if you have any information on this about studying the high school start times the house Memorial so I don't know if you know anything about it so they're going to study the high school start times even though we just implemented different High School start times so if this study comes out can they mandate that we

[00:23:00]
resume again so Madam president and board member Mueller are going to the study actually came from one of our students who was at Albuquerque High and what she was modeling was the California model of implementing later stop start times so you know in California they studied it for a year and then there was a three-year implementation and it's a pretty complicated system year old he's he's excited for his senior year oh yeah we're hearing a whole bunch about that and a lot of it is not very happy so then I just have like some specific questions and I don't know if this would be better if I just sent them to you and it's also about the house bill 7 and then just some like really specific

[00:24:00]
big questions that that I got that maybe you can if you think that these are better answered in a different setting I will just give you the three questions that I that I received that parents wanted an answer to not a president yes definitely please you're more than welcome to send it to me will make those responses available to the board yes I was going to say as long as we can all review those I think it would be really helpful yeah that way we just kind of know what because I don't know how to answer the question and you guys probably know the house bill better so I'll send the questions to you and get answers then thank you just want to say that a lot I think we cannot underestimate the level of stress and fear that the project Veritas is in those

[00:25:00]
attacks on transgender and LGBT students have had and they are real and their students are feeling them and so I am very happy that house bill 7 pass to a lot of those fears and to say we will take care of our children hey any other questions I do have a question about the I'm happy when we take the lead on changes that are we know are coming legislatively like a later start time or high schoolers however at least in my district that has created some difficulty because

[00:26:00]
it impacts bus schedules right and it means that kids in the East Mountain rural kids are having to jump on the bus considerably earlier and then it also impacts after school programs and so I just I worried about that situation and I understand that we're implementing something that is coming I just worry about the timing of it and if you can please send during these interim committee meetings it would be really beneficial if Wendy's great ideas

[00:27:00]
I'm up calendar changes right or hours that we have some planning built in to any legislative I'm trying to be politic here any big Ideas bold ideas were a big District if you can impress upon them that planning I mean families and they have put us the district in a horrible situation so some lead time it's not that you know we needed that this was the desire the 1144 would be greatly appreciated and while you're at it

[00:28:00]
having a budget that goes out 2 to 5 years would be really exceptional and just keep saying is Howard Gardner once said the way you get rid of a bad idea is you talk about a good idea Lots so thank you any other comments questions thank you so much for your update and all the work that you did period I think we're moving right along and we're going to now spend our time on student outcomes Focus governance which is which is one of our goals one of our commitments so the next piece is the aps Board of Education student outcomes Focus government itself evaluation for year 1/42

[00:29:00]
and we have our board coats on Ashley Paz for the council great City schools good evening president Montoya cardova and superintendent Elder and Board of Trustees how are you doing tonight I think we're hanging in there good good so I really appreciate everyone who took a moment to complete the self-evaluation in advance of tonight's meeting having done that will make our conversation tonight much more sustained and allow us to get through our business much more quickly so I wanted to start off and just so everyone who completed the self-evaluation came up with the same score that's 0.6 but that's it but don't don't let that discourage you I don't smoke with one of one of you to today and said this is

[00:30:00]
this isn't cause for alarm because you did actually managed to get out of so for the Publix wayfinding in the student outcomes focused governance manual there is a rubric and it has categories that are red yellow red yellow green and blue and so red identifies all of the areas that are that we want to get the board out of and into more effective behaviors the behaviors on the rubric are aligned with what research says is more effective for school boards who are focused on improving student outcomes so these aren't these are things these are behaviors that I came up with or that any one of my organization came up with they actually identify them through research and aligning what are the behaviors that are most consistent for school boards

[00:31:00]
that serving districts that where student outcomes are continually improving so that's what we're doing tonight we're actually just looking to see how you have made progress on your behavior changes you got the the sign in the front of your diet which I love student outcomes don't change until adult behaviors change bored my first question for you which adult has to change first so starting with the board and then hopefully trickling down throughout the district so in the major areas where you have made changes they're going to be under on page two on page 3 of the student outcomes Focus manual that is going to be page 2 is specific to vision and goals and page 3 is specific to

[00:32:00]
is and guard rails we're not going to go through every single line item like we did when we went through this process together in February 1st just would like to ask because not everyone was able to complete the evaluation are there any areas where you believe that your board may have gotten more than achieved a score or greater than 0 I actually did and I filled it out in I thought I'd share it but apparently it didn't go back to you but you did but everything is the all of the criteria are you so we're back at 0 9 0

[00:33:00]
absolutely absolutely and that's not the conversation that we're having today you certainly have been working so the so in order to achieve so under let's look at the section vision and goals so the first the first section in the red is pretty straightforward it's and identifies behaviors that are not at all aligned with boards that improve to not come those would be the boards don't have adopted goals that the governance and Leadership teams are unable to differentiate between inputs outputs and outcomes that you're not smart that goals are missing a population measure Baseline Target starting date or ending date and that the organization has not identified who their Community is or a process for gauging their Vision you most certainly have done you have had a very robust process of engaging with the community you have adopted goals

[00:34:00]
and you you all have demonstrated the ability to differentiate between inputs outputs and outcomes there is still kind of a hanging question in the air around one of your goals and its ability to be smart so I know I want to be clear all for all of your goals you are still missing a Baseline and a Target but I'm giving you credit for that because you you have identified everything you're still waiting to determine the Baseline because you're waiting on State Testing that's outside of your control so that's not the question and the question is on your golden number four what is the measure so do you have a measure that has been articulated for goal number four I reviewed the

[00:35:00]
interims trying to pull trying to get clarity right yeah and all we have stated is that we're going to use an SEL program and for me that is not enough and I think I wrote If let me find my I had to go back and and highlight these boxes and red magenta rather it sounds better I think I wrote if it were to appear we were measuring period behaviors right students acting on something that we could see and measure trained X number of

[00:36:00]
students in peer-to-peer restorative practices then that might work as an example of selves would be so that is those are things that we talked about for the interim interim goals but this is at the high level the goal because the board doesn't actually adopt the interim goals the board only adopts the goal so the board and the board has a responsibility to be clear and what the expectations are that you're setting for the superintendent so the should that be could that even though I was addressing the interim I think it was an interim guard rail too I don't know I don't remember but would that work as a goal so all that gold number four is missing is a measurement it's missing it is the thing that it is missing is

[00:37:00]
how you will measure how will you know whether or not progress is being achieved so but what tool will you use to measure that goal because the only thing that it states it's very vague it just says is measured by an evidence-based and a line tool and that part hasn't come to light yet board member Jackson go ahead so I think this might be a question for the superintendent and the last time that we talked about this doctor gutierez was in was in front of us and I haven't like it has she been working on this is this does Dr Gutierrez have an idea as to what kind of evidence based on a line tool she would like to use cuz again I think this is where like the expertise falls back to you right so we already in the process of moving towards our I have to be a little bit cautious and how

[00:38:00]
answer this one because I can't indicate that we have a preference towards one vendor or another before we go to RP but it is something we're bringing forward and I feel we're in a pretty good spot as far as going before and I think it is been difficult a little bit in terms of it does I guess the question for me is does the tool Drive the the measurement or does the measurement Drive the tool but we we listened and we've been working on this and we are like I said about going to RFP I just don't want to I don't want to soil that process by getting too specific at this time publicly okay so you're saying that when Ashley is saying is that it's it's kind of the evidence is very vague what you are saying is that as we move through the RFP process you are getting to a more specific tool that will be used

[00:39:00]
yes I believe that you guys provided quite a bit of feedback I've learned a whole lot more about SEL over the last 6 months tonight dot dot dot I needed to know and I sat with the number of these vendors just personally and I do feel we're in a pretty good spot right now but again as we move into the process I got to be careful not to ruin the procurement so it sounds like Ashley at some point pretty soon we are going to have that end for and it seems I guess superintendent this is Yolanda is the the goal is to have something that would be in play by the time the new school year starts yes so this will be part of the Strategic plan remember it's a five year old out so I don't remember where SEL sits in terms of things but we've got a lot to roll out and I do believe

[00:40:00]
the curricular issues are going to be in terms of next year's mostly design and begin of implementation so and I'll talk about that in a little bit so I can't remember exactly where SEL lined up but it yes we'll have some a tool certainly by next year and then I'm trying to figure out how to integrate it into the system over the next few years so Ashley from your perspective then we're still this goal is still kind of like iffy I mean it's a good one to have it's one that's out there but we just don't have it well stated enough so that even to go into like a monitoring calendars where I'm where I'm at it's like it would be hard to to set it up for monitoring because we just don't really have all the things in place or in play to really get us to that point yet that is correct okay and then my question Ashley do you know you work with lots of districts

[00:41:00]
cat want to do a lot of the same thing that we want to do with goal for have you found some districts that have found a tool that is really successful in measuring the student outcomes not with the adults are doing for the kids but rather the outcomes that we see have you seen that so I have not and I'm visiting with my colleagues at the great City schools and a few other organizations that are kind of peripheral to our organization this is really been a challenge that many districts have face and the direction that the majority of boards have gone is to actually turn that their SEO priority into a guard rail because really at the end of the day what they do want to they are most interested in measuring what the adults are doing looking at the conditions that adults are creating for

[00:42:00]
events looking at the things that the adults are doing surrounding SEL and and looking at how that is impacting a student outcomes which is very much a guardrail but it is still very a very high priority I mean it is one of the highest priorities of the district that's why it's it's been articulated as a guardrail so that is that's been the the path that most boards have gone and it's not so I think that they're still and this is something that I've seen across the country where they really want to be able to measure it as a student outcome it's just been really hard and so the boards have determined to go ahead and make it a guardrail until they can figure until the districts can figure out how to do the measurement actually looking at what the students know are able to do when they could turn that priority into a goal

[00:43:00]
and mainly it's a matter of timeliness and understanding that if I want to measure the social and emotional health of students and I can look at what the adults are doing today or if I have to wait two years from now to be able to create and create an instrument from scratch and then administer the instrument and then create a baseline looking at that overall timeline they have across the board said we're going to make this a guardrail that doesn't mean that it's not possible and it doesn't mean that I don't have hope you have some really bright people in Albuquerque but it is something that I'm going to continue to to bring up with the board until we do have a solution so that's just my obligation is your coach okay any other comments or questions on that no okay so moving right along

[00:44:00]
and I and I hear what you're saying is that it is an important piece for us I mean it was for the community as well I heard it over and over and over again about what students should be able to know and be able to do around their social emotional wellness and their pieces there how to get there could be hard but I'm going to hold up some hope here as well to see if we can be the first district that sort of cracks that code too cuz we could we could do something really Stellar here but we could also stumble on it and I think we just need to understand that we wouldn't be the first that would be stumbling with it yeah you definitely are playing to my competitive spirit so this group competitive no way all right so where are we moving to next all right moving on so and that's really the the big the big the big thing for y'all to move to move through

[00:45:00]
for this first section of vision and goals once you get through that you not only get out of get out of the zero but when you've adopted so when you've identified as soon as you have will have identified a measure then the superintendent can have all of the interim goals that have been created and there we know that they are focusing on making sure that the last two bullet points under approaches Focus that that is the executive leader has adopted no fewer than one and no more than four interim goals to progress monitor each goal and each interim goal is smart and worded just like gold and the so that's the the second to last bullet point in the last is the status of each and from goal is able to be updated at least four times during a fiscal year so those are things that you're superintendent and administrator team have been working diligently on so once you get that once

[00:46:00]
measure has been identified then you're going to knock it out of the park and I really I believe that not only to complete approaches Focus but moving into the next phase which is meets Focus all goes all goals pertain to outcomes that are related to advancing the purpose of the organization or in this instance student outcomes because that's why school systems exist is to improve student outcomes and addition to their ending Points each internal will have an annual Target leading up to each day so that means that you'll know what the not only what the over five years or three years for interims should be achievable but also have benchmarks for each each year along the way next

[00:47:00]
all all interim goals pertain to student outputs or student outcomes the goal the board included the input from the community and the gold development process all goals last 3 to 5 years and all interim goals last one to three years and the and the goals and interim goals will challenge the organization and require a change in adult Behavior we already know that you are working towards that so again I don't think that you'll actually get out just achieve approaches Focus I think you'll actually get into meets focus and then the next step is the board used to process for developing the goals which included their community in a way that achieves Broadway of their respective goals and influenceable by the leadership team with at least 80% autonomy that of the inputs that influence the output and the board

[00:48:00]
add on a root cause analysis yada yada yada all of those things are are already true so you will not only go to approaches focus and meet Focus but I really do believe that you will at the point where you have that measurement identified you will actually Master's focus in that area so going from you will so going from 0 to 35 on this is going to be a really good feeling when it happens and I'm really excited for you to be able to to experience that and know that it is a lot closer than it may feel today so then looking forward at the next step which is the values and guardrails you're kind of in the same position you're really just

[00:49:00]
you're really just looking for the interim guardrails once the interim guardrails have been identified pretty much everything else is going to fall into place and you will again go to Masters Focus so are there any questions about these first two before we move on okay and so I want to be clear as soon as you hit as soon as you are able to identify the interims you not only you not only go to 35% implementation of this of this entire framework you'll go to 50% because you will have mastered focused and both sections one and two visioning goals and values and guard girls so then moving on from that

[00:50:00]
the next section is monitoring and accountability so under monitoring and accountability this is where you have where you're not you haven't just adopted your goals but you go into the next the next phase of actually monitoring the progress that your district is making toward the goal so it's great to set goals but just setting goals isn't quite enough you also have to you have a responsibility to your community to continually monitor the progress that you are to which your aching those those goals so every goal should be monitored at least four times per year and every guardrail should be or interim should be monitored at least once per year notice I'm saying at least that doesn't mean that you only can only do it once per year you actually can monitor it as many times as you want it just has to be able to work out on your monitoring calendar because we do recommend that you only look at

[00:51:00]
two goals per per month and that's that's really just a matter of how your allocating your time and making sure that you're you're not spending a whole lot of a whole lot of extra time in school board meetings and that your time is really being focused on monitoring progress toward achieving the student outcomes so under under the monitoring and accountability this is where you adopt a monitoring calendar once you've adopted a monitoring calendar it gets you out of the red and then one of the items is the board does not track its use of time and board authorized public meetings I actually will be working with your lovely board secretary very soon on how to do that and it will be a very I've created a really simple process for being able to do that

[00:52:00]
No it should take maybe maybe 15 minutes generally on on assigning looking at your meetings and assigning time for your meetings and I think I can't remember is it by the end of this month or the end of next month that we have to get that done Courtney you don't have to have the answer it's definitely by the end of next by the beginning of next quarter time line and yeah it looks like it's by the end of next month okay perfect and that will actually not only get you into meets Focus but it'll get approaches focus and this section but it will also help you achieve approaches focus in the next section which is community or communication collaboration so we've got approaches Focus once you get your monitoring

[00:53:00]
that'll be great and then once you start your monitoring 10% of your total board authorized public meeting minutes monitoring your goals so that so adopting a monitoring calendar and then actually starting the monitoring process and we're going to help you get to that a lot sooner by doing practice monitoring we call it practice monitoring because you're not actually going to be looking at the progress that has been made toward your goals yet because that really won't start until next year when when your budget has been adopted and everything is really getting into the implementation phase but what you will be looking at is the plan and how are the plans coming along and the strategic planning process and whatnot so and it's really just about building up the skills that you need to be able to effectively ask questions and focus on student outcomes during those monitoring sessions versus identifying

[00:54:00]
inputs or essentially articulating what the superintendent is supposed to do these are more of the accountability conversations about what has been done and what the plan looks like moving forward so for everything else you actually have identified by the end of the summer so the end of the summer is the next kind of that that is the next like I can't I can't think of the word that that's your next Benchmark for being able to move up to the next level after you've hit meets focused under monitoring and accountability so I wanted to give you the option we can we can go go on and look at the last two sections or we can be we can move on with this conversation tonight it's really up to you I'm happy to do either way or answer

[00:55:00]
is there any questions you have about yourself evaluation I think we're ready to just move on to the next section for sure so we could go ahead and get started on the I know there's a lot of excitement around the alignment on Golden Girls with the District budget so are you yeah so are you voting to approve are you adopting this self evaluation tonight I believe we are do I have I mean are we do we have to vote on it or we just have to get head not so we have to vote on it yeah so you're voting on a score a score of 0 and the goal for 50% at the next episode of the aps Board of Education student outcome Focus governance self evaluation for Year One

[00:56:00]
this is Crystal I will second all right let's have a real color that are gun yes to 0. 0 0 5

[00:57:00]
School Board here in Fort Worth Texas this was always kind of a nerve-wracking conversation for me to go into on my board talking about money is never fun talking about the future is is always scary because there's a lot of uncertainty in it and there was just a lot of I think a lot of just my own discomfort with with finances and my own personal financial Acumen so if that's true for you I would like to say welcome to the club and let me give you a another way of looking at the budgeting process so you just done a whole lot of work as a board with your community with your district and with each other to identify the priorities that you're going to that you're just going to be focused on for the next five years we call these the goals and guardrails the budget is really where the rubber hits the road this is where you ensure that you're actually

[00:58:00]
resourcing those priorities you are aligning the resources that your that your district has with the attainment of improving student outcomes while honoring the non-negotiables of your community so the first thing what is the budget the district so I want to I want to be clear the district's budget is not a governance document in the government's role we have a financial oversight of the budget we have to adopt the budget but really and it doesn't matter if it's a school board if it's not profit board if it even if it's just me and my personal for profit business my budget is nothing more than a management document it is a strategically aligned plan that says this is how I'm going to achieve my goals for the next for this next year so this is a plan that does just set at articulates how the district will

[00:59:00]
it's educational program over the course of the next fiscal year so in many states New Mexico included the board is required to adopt this plan and this is simply just to recognize the financial oversight and the legal obligation that you was born as a board have to the to the district the most important thing for birds to understand in this conversation is that you have an obligation to the community to ascertain the level of the alignment of the budget to the achievement of the boards adopted student not come goals and the adherence to your adopted guardrails this is how you properly ensure that your priorities are being adequately resourced over the next year now this first year because you just adopted your goals and guard rails the first year is going to be probably the

[01:00:00]
Lisa line that the budget will be over the next 5 years and then the year after that it will be a more aligned in the year after that it'll be more aligned typically about the 2nd or 3rd cycle is when you start really start to have full alignment of the budget and that that means the resourcing of your priorities to the priorities that you have already adopted are there any questions about this or would you like to have any dialogue or conversation among yourselves before I move forward what do you guys think I mean I think we've heard a lot about I think even the superintendent talking about the adoption of the new way of doing budgeting is still going to take time to implement as well he's talked about that and then we've talked about you know getting you know the budget to to get people

[01:01:00]
what sort of comfortable with that and we've just rolled out our goals so I for me it makes sense that it's it's going to be incremental that it's not going to be just a slam dunk initially and I think there's always going to be room for continuous Improvement as we look at that because I think what we're all going to be evaluating is just how well we did that as well because I think we're going to do the best we can around I think what I like what we've done this year is push it out to the to the schools and saying so how does your budget aligned with the goals right now around the things that we've talked about and we've asked we're asking you to do how are you thinking about how that how that lines up but I think they're all going to be getting feedback to and we'll be looking back over the year and saying did it match up did it not or hopefully not even waiting for a whole year but maybe even doing an evaluation maybe after the first semester and saying

[01:02:00]
oh you know we really need to to shift out and do something different I mean I could see how that could also occur maybe even at the site level and that's just my thoughts but that's just me speaking about that I don't know what you guys think you have a question so would you recommend like obviously before we have our monthly Finance meetings I meet with the the team prior would there be any specific questions you would suggest that I asked her that we asked just to keep us on track and to make sure you know where we are aligned properly like what just so we're doing what we're supposed to you know what I want to be off so I'm going to that's a great question and I'm going to do something really really aggravating I'm going to push it back and say what would you ask okay how what would you ask of your CFO or your superintendent or your leadership team to to know that you

[01:03:00]
have greater alignment between your budget and and and and and the expenditure of funds the allocation of resources to your goals and your guardrails what would you ask well obviously like when we look at each other like wanting to know which one it's aligned with but I guess finding out to if they come with something that's not necessarily related to the specific goals is it just scratched halted pause like what I guess what would be the following through at that point or do we try to fit it in one of those squares Stars yeah so so my recommendation are the coaching that I get to boards is to ask open-ended questions because those are going to that's where you're going to get

[01:04:00]
the more the more deep conversation and more information from your team so ask me a question how how is this item aligned with our with our goals and and maybe it is aligned with one or two maybe it's aligned with a lot of them it really and they are the ones that should be convincing you of that alignment and then if there if there is no alignment ask what is the plan for for sunset or is there a plan for sun setting this and if so what is that plan you know there the the district is going to there are things that the district has to do that aren't your goals and nowhere in this framework does it suggest that the district should not do things that are not explicitly goals or explicitly guard rails but pretty much everything will be associated in some way shape or form

[01:05:00]
if it is an expenditure related to food service that you've got to keep kids bed so that they can learn if it's if it's related to Transportation you have to make sure that kids get to school and they're getting to school on time and that they have bus drivers to take them there so there's I guarantee that there's always going to be some kind of way that they are aligned but that alignment you know sometimes it will be a stronger alignment and sometimes it will be a week or alignment and they should be able to articulate the level to which that is and we're really really matters have you ever seen like on a board agenda like you know where we have like the summary of what the topic is going to be and they have a specifically already outlined what goal that is that's Ty to so they start getting in the habit of yeah okay yeah and that's actually so that that is something that you're

[01:06:00]
that your support team Johanna and and her entire group have really been working on getting getting that information to you all and so I know that they're they're kind of right on the cusp of being able to do it but there again waiting waiting to get the complete set of priorities for both your your goals and your guard rails but yeah and to that same note your budgeting team so renette has been incredible to work with and she has really been putting forth a lot of effort to make sure that the alignment even though it's still in the early phases of implementing this framework she really has taken the tasks seriously about getting a lineman and making sure that your budget is accomplishing your priorities and I'm really excited for you all to see her presentation next

[01:07:00]
okay thank you I have a question a couple of questions and Ashley so right now we're at those incremental first baby steps at the school level so that's where we are right now so we're not at zero so that's good so now we're going to look at it and and it could be related to what they're doing at school and they're saying okay we're going to put this you know this amount of our budgets and so then they will have to figure out in the end did that did it work did it improve student outcomes okay so I guess I get that part but when we're talking about like goal one and I I understand there will be stronger alignment at you know the elementary level to go one but really not so much

[01:08:00]
at the high school level cuz we're talking about third grade third grade reading so I I I I just don't know what that would look like for that at that High School Middle School level and then how would the you know go 3 with high school graduates you know how do you align out at the elementary level and for them to really understand that you can't really meet all four of those goals you know I mean it's just not possible at each level right yeah so that's actually a great thing that you've left it up not every single one of your goals is going to impact every single one of your students we when we talked so when we went through the goal setting process we talked about however high levels to focus on however it's in high impact is actually the terminology that we use so where can we put our resources that is going to be that's going to create the

[01:09:00]
biggest splash so we talked about like throwing a rock into the water a bigger rock is going to make a bigger impact whereas a tiny little Pebble may make like a little splash and you don't you want to have the biggest the biggest rock that's going to make the biggest impact when you throw it into the water so that it can reach out and touch all all aspects of the pond that's kind of the same way with your high level high impact areas of focus for students for student outcomes so you've identified a third grade reading and third grade math as areas to focus on for two of your goals these are going to so there are things that need to be addressed in the early years so kindergarten Readiness and first grade first grade reading that scaffolding the fundamental so that they can be successful in the third grade we talked about up until the third grade students are learning to read and then after the third grade

[01:10:00]
reading to learn that's why the third grade reading the third grade literacy is so important so you have to do you have to do the work and make the investments in the earlier grades the earlier years so that's how that's how it's going to address the younger grades the older grades are going to be more specific to that 3rd and 4th goals that you have that are around College and Career Readiness and building soft skills or the social emotional health of your students those are going to so the social emotional is really actually all of them they can there can be ways that they impact those goals and all of the grade levels but the question for your for your superintendent is not necessarily going to be does it does it work is it aligned question mark

[01:11:00]
and this is actually a really great segue to the the next piece of this so there are you were given a document prior to tonight's meeting it was called school boards versus superintendent school boards superintendents and budgets did everyone have an opportunity to read that document you don't have to pull it up but just a head nod will be a sufficient I don't remember getting it on my downloads yeah I don't think we got the document at the homework if I board member Jackson is sitting right next to me and she did ask me she said we did we have homework for tonight because I'm thinking about the sog cohort and all that but I don't believe we got this one Ashley okay so it should have been sent out with the at the same time as the self-evaluation but it's okay if it wasn't

[01:12:00]
superintendent Sports and budgets and it talks about the budgeting process and how to basically how to do this work of alignment and then what is the board's role in the budgeting process and so it lifts up for four different elements so the first is the planning the board's role in planning for the budget is really simple you adopt your goals and your guard rails that reflect the vision in the value of the community once you've done that then you have you have done the heaviest lift for for the budget you've identified what the priorities are for resource allocation so that's the first one the second one is the draft review so all along all along the way throughout the district is working on their budgeting process and I know that this may sound crazy but even now

[01:13:00]
is there a wrapping up this year's budgeting process they're already starting to process for next year so they know what the what the priorities are that you just adopted and they're starting so next year they're going to be able to start from that so your priorities will be the basis for next year's budget so the board should be given an opportunity to review and discuss the Budget prior to your final adoption most words do this over the course of a few meetings I know you have a finance committee and they I I'm still kind of learning to process but I think they are primarily responsible for that oversight of the expenditures during the year of executing the budget but even beforehand of asking some questions about the budget this would actually be a great job for that since you're required to have a finance committee already this actually would be a great

[01:14:00]
job for the finance committee and I'm sorry board members happy Romero I feel like I'm adding a lot to your plate without talking to you about it first but it doesn't have to be if that's not what you want you all have to be the ones to decide but but that could be a great place to kind of funnel some of this work to make sure that it's being done but without taking up a whole lot of capacity from the full board so during the during this review process it's really important for you to look at it and to understand the level to which it's aligned with your priorities and I want to be clear if the board doesn't like the superintendent's draft budget it's your responsibility to discuss why you think it doesn't align with the goals and guard rails and then just don't approve it any form of modifying or mending or riding the budget

[01:15:00]
that's going to destroy your ability to hold the superintendent accountable for accomplishment of your goals so it's really important that the superintendent be the one that selects the inputs so there's not something that you like on the budget if there's or that you wanted to see on the budget or if there's something there that you didn't want to see there's definitely a place to have conversation about that but you what you absolutely cannot do and should not do and this isn't this isn't even specific to sosg this is just governance in general the superintendent has to be the one to select the the strategies and the resources that are going to be implemented the board has a responsibility to ask questions to understand alignment and then to either adopt or not adopt so Ashley have some questions on that in terms of how words handle this from like the administrative side of it because I think

[01:16:00]
two things that happen and what I've seen happen with the district is that there's a budget request that we need to make and we need to send up to public Ed the state level to just draw the money down which is really important to not miss deadlines and timelines and we have to approve just that request and then there's like a budget I think historically our district is just done both of those together which I think makes it hard so it's it's like how do other urban districts delineate between those two functions because I think the first function of just setting up our paperwork up to the state so that we're on time and we're going to be guaranteed the funds that we need to get down first and foremost is is really critical but I also agree we need to have a budget on the back end in terms of how that's going to be spent how do how do other districts do this yeah so let me I think I need to understand a little bit more about your process there in

[01:17:00]
Mexico so is the board required so the budget that you submit to ped is that or is the board required to approve that yes okay so if that's the case then I have a strong strong recommendation that the conversation with the board happen sooner rather than later so you don't want to wait till the last hour the final hour to adopt the budget if there's a possibility that it could be approved and the only needs to talk on that because it's an issue for us and our state because of just timing and it has a lot it's just awful so go ahead superintendent yeah that's a great best practice and the reality is we bring the budget forward as quickly as we can but on this year when you have a 60 day session and we didn't get the unit value until about two weeks ago which is good unit value you know it

[01:18:00]
definitely limits the amount of time that we can put a budget in front of the board I think this year I hope the board members Miss up a doctor or team have come forward every month pretty much to say this is what we're doing here's how we're trying to move forward so yeah there's not a lot of specifics of course in terms of how the money is being spent but they have tried to talk about process I think looking forward you know we'll see how well we can do that but it's some there is a limitation on just a logistics of finishing in mid-march so and it's and it's usually due by when superintendent usually will bring it to the end of May because we have to turn it in in early July 1st July and that's what I always remember is that it's just our process in New Mexico

[01:19:00]
seems to be kind of messy freaks happen I've been confused by it since the whole time I've been on the board because it is there's a couple of things that are happening there one is where juggling the need for us is Bored to also be really responsive to the fact that we want that money we do we need to send up a document to ped that's aligned to all the PED documents too which is draw down on the money but there's also the back conversation about how that money is going to be utilized which seems to me is like the different conversations happening but we're trying to we're trying to Crunch it all in one big meeting and that's what makes it really hard so for me I always just look at it I don't want to miss a deadline with ped because I don't want the I don't I don't want the the the complexity of the district not

[01:20:00]
are you able to draw down money on time because I think that's also an issue too terms of getting started with payroll and getting all of those things completed so I mean I'm just really I always worry about it especially when we have a 60-day session and you know it's coming down to the to the 11th hour yeah so so ultimately the important thing here is that conversation be had you can have a conversation as a board with your superintendent about alignments the alignment of spending your resources to achieving your priorities that's what the conversation is about you know getting the getting the budget to ped and all of that that is mostly an administrative function you don't and really you know the you understand as a board that you have a deadline that you that you have for ped and that you

[01:21:00]
you have to achieve that deadline the conversation has to begin in enough advance that you can that you're not waiting until the last minute and I understand that the timing and everything but ultimately at the end of the day all of the excuses in the world whether they are you know valid or not if you're not achieving your goals then you then you have felled children and I know that that's harsh to say but that is the reality of the situation that we're dealing with and so your conversation is a board with your superintendent should not be one about p e d and the deadlines and all of that it is how are we accomplishing our goals and and resourcing those goals so that we can best serve children may I put it less harshly than sure before I pass it off to Barbara are monitoring process is going to begin that conversation and so

[01:22:00]
I think that will just be a natural outcome so Barbara's been wanting to get in so I'm done in Johannes defense we did get that document it was sent out along with the self-evaluation and I completely missed it because I was looking at self-evaluation probably what we all did was look at look at the email and miss the other document that was attached so her job we just missed it and you know the other thing and I just have to say I mean the fact is we are talking like we've never prioritized goals or students when we developed budgets before and

[01:23:00]
that's just totally absurd I mean as I look back at finance committee agendas in the past you know we always put core beliefs and goals in that and and a huge amount of our budget is is mandated we have no choice their salaries salary that can be achieved without prioritizing the human beings that budget is tied to I mean I think the only difference is saying you know what it's not like we're completely starting over schools have always analyzed what their needs are and you know what are we going to put the money for a community school coordinator or

[01:24:00]
are we going to have to spend it towards the reading intervention teacher I mean those are those are difficult conversations and and achieving those goals will be different from school to school based on their community and their specific needs I mean I think that what we're saying is let's do a better job of really analyzing root causes let's really do a better job of how do we align the budget with with what is possible and how do we make prioritize because it's not it's not like schools having struggled with that very question for as long as they've had any say in budgets and it's not like the district has its finding it so that we really have an impact and I think that's that's the difficult thing because

[01:25:00]
it's hard choices because the budgets are tight the budgets make you have to sometimes outright cannibalize your your staff and it is not an easy process so I just I just want to say we need to give credit to the work that's been done over many years by staff let's see if we can make it easier in a way by sharpening or Focus yeah that's really I love the way that you that you phrase that because this isn't a novel idea this isn't new this isn't something that your district is probably even been doing the difference here and I can't even say what's true for your bored I can say in general with most boards the big difference in this process is that the boards have stepped back and said

[01:26:00]
not going to tell the superintendent how to how to align the budget we are we are just here to ensure that the budget is aligned it is it is inappropriate for the board to tell the superintendent how the money has to be used what is appropriate is for the board to say these are these are our goals these are our guard rails essentially these are the priorities that we've set now superintendent it's your job to align the strategy with these priorities by putting resources in the right places he has to be the one to decide which FTE is is going to get resource in which one's not and this the schools I think your you have mostly a site base budget the schools have to be able to make those decisions and we often say what happens in the boardroom can be seen in the classroom if you expect for

[01:27:00]
schools to be able to to to to articulate how they want to spend their discretionary funds then you also have to give the superintendent the autonomy to make the decisions and how the budget is a whole will be allocated all right so again great place to transition so we talked about planning we talked about reviewing the draft the next and really the last two is the superintendent has to convince the board what's the draft the draft budget has been completed the superintendent must then convince the board that the budget the first priority for the budget the resource allocation of the district is the accomplishment of the goals and honoring the guardrails once that has been once once he has successfully convinced the board of that then

[01:28:00]
you get to move on to approval once the board has been convinced that the superintendent's draft budget prioritizes accomplishment of the goals and honoring of the guardrails then and only then will it be appropriate to adopt the budget are there any questions about that before before by final piece know I mean I think I'll go ahead go ahead we haven't called on you that's okay it's fine I'm following and I found the document so it's good it's not a question it's just a request do you have examples of budgets from other districts that demonstrate how those budgets are aligned to the goals and guardrails so that we can get a sense of what it looks like in other places so yes we do have examples but I do actively discourage boards from looking at examples from other districts because what alignment looks like for Columbus Ohio

[01:29:00]
go or St Paul Minnesota is not going to look the same as alignment for Albuquerque New Mexico the format so you mean like the the presentation format what does a budget look like the format to show you that it's aligned or maybe it is the presentation but yeah so again I think so it's really important for your District staff to to do their own to do their own homework and to do their own work of developing their private developing their presentation because it's going to look different for them than it is going to look for other communities once once once they have done that once that has been achieved that I'm happy to to share some other examples and I'm also happy to share more like videos from board meeting from

[01:30:00]
is there a district if you'd like to watch their actual budget presentations and see kind of observe the questions that board members have asked but it would not be appropriate at this time to to share because what they what they are presenting and even the format they're presenting it in is going to be very specific to their communities and isn't necessarily going to fit the the needs or expectations of your bored I was going to say because what I was going to say is what's going to be really different I think this year for us as a board is that we do have goals and guardrails I think last year in the budget because we didn't and it was just sort of like all over the place we weren't really quite sure how we wanted it aligned it really hadn't been agreed upon and there wasn't there wasn't kind of like how it was how it was set up I think it was what made it difficult last year

[01:31:00]
so I think going into the budget discussion this year because we have identified those goals and guardrails we have identified priorities then it makes a whole lot sense there's a lot more ease in terms of the kinds of questions we can ask because I think we're all going to be looking for the same things because we have a same set of goals we had to do that work I think is a board so that we could be more coherent and we could be consistent with the staff so that they know what we were looking for and it wasn't just like what one board member is looking over another so I'm excited about going into this budgeting process I already have seen some tremendous changes because you already seeing renette and her team shifting out how they're thinking about the money the shift out to the school so that they're starting to align themselves that way so I feel like it's going to be a much more organized conversation this year than it was

[01:32:00]
for the sport last year any other comments this year that's a baby step and I think it will be helpful to work with the schools and ourselves as we still kind of see crossover you know like one goal sometimes it wasn't just a line to one goal but they are attempt to really start to try to show how the money aligns and that's that was already and her team's work so that will help a little bit and then I think because we move forward we'll get better at it at that alignment

[01:33:00]
and I think the other thing too superintendent what I like about aps's budget is that because we get updates regularly right I know that there's like it's kind of like a living document as well right so always assessing where money is going we're savings is what's happening or what's being spent or what's not and then trying to figure out how to redirect funds I know that that happens frequently and but now that redirection hopefully is going to be taking into account the goals in the guard rails as well in terms of how money is being redirected if it needs to be redirected that would be a logical Next Step yes okay so my final piece is really this is really kind of the uncomfortable part of the conversation that a lot of words don't like until they've actually done it the first time so we encourage boards to go into

[01:34:00]
this is really the only time that we that we advocate for for this perspective but we encourage the board to go into reviewing this document with a high degree of skepticism we want you to start with the with an assumption that there is no alignment and at that point it is a superintendent's job to convince you that there is alignment this is this is not because we want to be up on the superintendent or we think that they have done a bad job and this isn't about gotcha governance that's that's something I always want to make very clear this isn't about having a negative or difficult conversation this is about insurance for your children that you are responsible that you have taken the responsibility of educating to make sure that the priorities for their education is

[01:35:00]
what is the first and foremost thing in this budget so again start from the place of thinking that there is no alignment and then having the superintendent articulate to you how alignment exists I know that's difficult but once you've done it and you've gone through the process I think you'll really understand why why and how it can be a really gratifying conversation so how are how will the board know we actually recommend two questions and they're very similar the first the board President should be asking are there any board members who have evidence that the budget does not address accomplishment of gold one go to go three or go for and then the same thing with the guard rolls are there any board members who have evidence that the budget violates number one number two three four and five and again I want to be clear this is

[01:36:00]
are there any board members who have evidence not any board members who think or have a pit in their stomach or a gut feeling this is do any board members have evidence that there is a non-alignment or a violation of either set of priorities all right that concludes my my presentation I'm here for any questions any other questions that was good I mean I really appreciate that because I think it was really helpful we're coming up on budget review and adoption so it's a good it's a good reminder for us on the homework that we need to do so any other nobody has comments questions Ashley thank you so much thank you and I'm going to be checking in with each one of you in about a week from now to see if you read that document so that you have

[01:37:00]
student outcomes Focus governance so where are we superintendent is going to give us a quick report members of the board thank you for the opportunity to speak so since last we met two weeks ago we have continued to work on the Strategic plan period I don't want to do it all in one night because it will take

[01:38:00]
I will give you part of it on on the first meeting of the month and then the second half and the second meeting of the month so now if you want to go ahead and Advance the screen I'm going to kind of zip through the first couple slides yourself so this this has five buttons out five times to analyze respond to organizational diagnostic so are steering committee has been meeting weekly and then they're having small meetings throughout the week we meet at the community the whole once a week we've also been hosting advisory committees are most recent was last night I will say that it was Spirited and there were some things that were said that about the process that were very positive and then there were some that said they were not sure what they you know that we got into what they wanted so it was

[01:39:00]
play positive useful meeting and we're going to continue to move forward there's also some talks about communicating the Strategic plan when we move forward and they had some interesting ideas on where different ways we could engage with the community that may not necessarily just be in our Spectrum but maybe outside and other avenues with other organizations you know showing up at local fairs festivals that sort of thing and having you know the ability to discuss with strategic plan with the community at large was a great good meeting next slide please help and there's just a PS priorities that we had identified a movie in go ahead and talk about those so I wanted you to see this is just a typical slide of the format that we're working on her cell for example strategic priority 3 which is engaged students the concept of cultivating in which you can see here is there

[01:40:00]
initiatives underneath that and the majority of these are have central office leaders in partnership with school and staff to strengthen implementation of whole school systems and routines and we use an example of positive behavior intervention support that promotes a welcoming engaging and culture where students want to come to school every day and what's interesting to be bad at some notes here for you to kind of see how we took the feedback from each of the groups that we met with as we did all our focus groups and we put notes on them to really show where we were focused and how they affirmed or told us not to work down so there was a few initiatives this is just an example I just wanted you to see kind of what it looked like so that you'd have an idea of what the plan coming next month will look like let's see and again they were really it's a great one

[01:41:00]
36 the reason that's purpose we added that after a number of focus groups because we had a lot of students families expressed their desire for more communication about existing resources so we added that some of the language changed on the on the feedback so we really did try to listen to what the community and our focus groups are giving us let's go on one more slide so I can shoot the next this is sort of gives you an idea of the next step of what happens under that so what you see is an initiative we have a work plan and what we're trying to do is lay out each of the steps that will occur and I I don't know if you can see this I can't it's pretty small and my screen her ability to get a good light in her room I feel like I'm speaking to you from the Crypt my face up a little bit but only so anyways these are as you can see there's a

[01:42:00]
step under each of these and then we've identified the the the the the the the person that's responsible for it and we're beginning to put in dates for that work to turn this is just a draft this may be a this may be a little old these dates may change please don't be taking pictures of it and saying haha but this is what we want you to see that we're going to present to you over the next month and this is sort of how it lines out for the work to be done over the next few years so let's go one more slide so so go ahead and click this one I think about four times now so we were really trying to clarify how this will work so when we look at the boards goal the identify where we're going as a system and the Strategic plan outlines how we get there so how we get there the next five years in order to achieve the goals and identify the four major priorities for the district implement

[01:43:00]
partnership with schools and then the rules of the road the guard rails are implementation norms and importance of execution which we talked about quite a bit it's a book study we've been doing are all different flavors for how to effectively go about implementing it and then of course knowing how far we have gone the intervals and the guard rails and measures to help us know if we are on track so this is how we're sort of trying to align the Strategic plan to the work of the sfg and and make sure that it all makes sense in in the in the end one more slide so it actually yeah so that's what's coming next month will be rolling out the big the big plan and we can continue to work on the internet bills like I told you last time we met due to the budget graduation the Strategic plan coming kind of to ahead we've had to slow down

[01:44:00]
a little bit but we are still working on the interim guardrails is requested and we will have those I believe I said last month in June so just trying to keep those timelines straight and make sure that you all are aware so that is what I have for you tonight and I stand open for questions if you have any so superintendent one of the things that I do want to clarify is that next month as the board is only meeting on the first Wednesday because we cancel the second Wednesday of my notes that

[01:45:00]
do we have any more specificity around that overall time frame will we begin implementation over the summer in the next year so that's like I said when you look at the what I showed last time was it showed a breakdown of the five years and there's Implement there's design implementation and then monitoring right and so like I said with each of the goals that we're trying to do is we can't do everything the first year I get that part sorry my question was more about the development of the planet itself like plan is we're really close we will show you the plan beginning in May and then karsner

[01:46:00]
I feel pretty good about the product that we're going to bring forward it looks like there's been a lot of work that's gone into that I'm really excited to hear about the advisory committees and you know the the work that's still going on with the community and the other voices in that so that's awesome right and we're looking at working groups to assist us as we move forward and continue to take that type of feedback we did offer that first do the advisory committee if there was any of them that had interest in a specific initiative that they wanted to remain connected to so we'll see where that goes it's great any other comments questions I'm excited to see it as well all right thanks for hanging in there but that was good that was good to finish on that too because I know that it's been a lot of work coming to to that product so it'll be great to to get to the Finish Line on that all right so
