[00:05:00]
any questions based off the information that has been provided all right are there any questions from the committee okay I am seeing none the only question I have is basically just a confirmation that this will be put on to our website 1200 okay we will go ahead and move on to the next item agenda and

[00:06:00]
our next item is the aps Charter School Financial audit accountability item are presenters tonight are Johanna King Chief of Staff Dr Joseph Escobedo senior director of charter schools and Roberta Velasquez manager of Charter School business you have the floor good evening Madam chair period the fiscal year 2024 audited financial statements include APS authorized Charter Schools as part of the district's oversight the charter school team has established a process for supporting and hold his schools accountable for improving their audit findings this evening you will hear from the charter school team on their process and phone number from one of our charter schools on their correction action plan alternative to Dr Escobedo in Las Vegas Nevada

[00:07:00]
in your packet is a presentation of our process for supporting and holding the charter schools accountable for improving their audit findings it is should be noted that we do follow National Best Practices from the National Association of charter school authorizers or conducting the accountability which requires all schools who have an audit finding develop a corrective action plan so every single school who has any finding from a charter school has to develop a corrective action plan and so as a reminder in Charter School governance Charters are set up much like School District governance with the governing Council acting as the school board and the school administrator acting as a superintendent so it's really important that we work with our governing councils on oversight of the audit process and I think you're going to hear a little bit about that tonight from the audit chair from Santa Claus and as you look at the

[00:08:00]
how to process on page 14 it's imperative that are Charter leaders and and governing Council council members and who oversees the process really understand that balance and that oversight and their role and we've had some really good conversations with Saint August about that are oversight process requires each school as I said to develop their corrective action plan and to submit that and so as part of that we are going in and testing that fixes from the corrective action plan as part of our site as a process so you know as you see an example of an audit finding tonight we are actually asking the schools to tell us you know what's the fix and how can we see it whether it's a policy whether it's a procedure and what have you and schools who meet certain criteria of deficiency also receive a notice of

[00:09:00]
satisfaction performance and so just as a reminder to the board that is the contract language that kicks off the revocation procedure so once we issue the notice of unsatisfactory performance of the school isn't responding if they're not implementing their corrective action plan with Fidelity those revocation processes begin so we're following a legal process our team as I said monitors that process and the person who does that is Roberto Velasquez she's been with our team for 6 years and has 30 years of Finance experience she's also a certified fraud examiner so when she's looking at these things that's really through an additional lens so I'll turn it over to her as as you have received this audit information

[00:10:00]
we analyze it and to identify our total number of it findings are repeat findings are classification of findings and then we use that data to determine who's going to be issued the notice of unsatisfactory performance as you can see on page 19 of your packet the total number of audit findings for Charter Schools decrease in at 5:24 from 103 to 88 and if you ever get out of monsters schools that's about 35 school and remember that as part of the audit a lot of our charter schools have foundations that are also component units of our audit their component of the school in the school is a complaining and we've also included the analysis of

[00:11:00]
audits for the foundations on page 20 and 21 in your pocket we also trained our governing council's audit committees on the responsibilities and you can find some of that on page 22 we also work with our Charter leaders to make sure that what needs to be fixed is being fixed and and that determination is made by our auditory Alaska that we have only goes up to page 16 unless I'm looking at the wrong packet know I think you're correct Madam chair and I think that the page that she's referencing for us would be 14 the charter school governing Council audit committee responsibilities

[00:12:00]
just want to make sure we literally all on the same page literally Madam chair members of the community and superintendent like he just a reminder of State Statute to requires all Charter School authorizers to monitor the fiscal compliance of each school and this process does that for our annual audit so we do stand for any questions you may have period thank you so much are there any questions from the committee so as an author 8 p.m. the Board of Education what is the plan and time line that's in place that allows us to

[00:13:00]
reasonably get all the information about an audit standing along with anything else that will allow us to make an informed decision about Charter Schools being authorized by us approval about the timeline for the notice of unsatisfactory performance is being executed now so those schools who received the notices went out on Friday of last week and so the school's then will be meeting with us in February to submit their corrective action plans and have our teams

[00:14:00]
approve it you're going to see that process done on a more expedited level with Saint Aguas so we can also provide you a report of all schools and their findings by each school but we will also have that as part of the executive summaries every time the school comes before you for an amendment renewal or new application I hope that answers your question it does with regard to the audit thank you as it relates to Charter Schools thank you for doing that and I'm sorry

[00:15:00]
item is the discussion of Saint Aguas International School FY 24 Auditorium Chief of Staff Dr Joseph Escobedo senior director of charter schools Dr Alonso Verda audit committee chair of Saint Aguas International School and valya yes thank you cordello executive director CNN Aguas International School you have the floor when does noches thank you so much for authorizing Santa Rosa we did is I'd like to say the number one to a language immersion program in Albuquerque if not New Mexico every year we host visitors from all over the world primarily what language conference but we do host them throughout the year

[00:16:00]

[00:17:00]
if you look at finding number one this was a repeat finding when it's related to the Gatsby's and Vita more professional development is clearly needed in this area for myself and our business manager we have already signed a contract with a company to assist with calculations and to train our business manager this will be starting here pretty soon that is part of their scope of work the governing Council will be overseeing that contract sorry that was my line yes

[00:18:00]
oversight from now on we're going to work with our business manager to ensure that any time timeline extension requests are first granted by APS bars are being reviewed monthly and I'm signing off on all of the reports the governing Council yes yes you see minutes any questions so far the next finding is a request for reimbursement on non-compliance or other non-compliance finding we have now to make sure that we have two individuals looking at the documents that are submitted for reimbursement this will also include a sign off for me that it does meet the criteria for re

[00:19:00]
on this one we met review and update policies for rfr's and take it to the governing Council for approval going to cancel with oversized spend it to review process and review and approve the policy that but they're a police is needed I have a question but it seems like the requisitions need to be reviewed before the purchase to ensure that they are eligible for reimbursement do you have a process in place for that I'm currently there is a justification piece that is needed to be completed before

[00:20:00]
I sign off what I'm going to be asking is to make sure that they explain how it is a Justified that program managers and people requesting are explaining how it is an allowable expense thank you our school has really struggled with this area since 2020 as you can see from the findings that was when we purchased the building and so we've been trying different ways to make it right what we finally have done and it's already a work in progress as we've already contracted with a business management company that will review and trained and update all of the documents going back to 2020

[00:21:00]
to make sure that it's correct this next year and going forward so it's a pretty big deal and so I'm personally involved in making sure that I also learned so that we can help resolve this issue we're going to cancel will make sure to go see that contract execution and make sure that the results of everything that we have thank you I think that was the end of what you needed to present to us is that correct okay so we will go ahead and stand for questions are there any questions from the committee members okay I am seeing none and thank you thank you for coming in front of the board and

[00:22:00]
I think just having a little bit higher level of accountability comes with coming before the audit committee and presenting your findings so we appreciate you doing that for us and thank you Doctor Escobedo for taking such good care of our Charter School Division and will now move on to the next item on our agenda thank you you're welcome thank you for coming tonight we appreciate it all right our next item on the agenda is the report on the ethical Advocates statistics for the period of July 1 2024 through November 30th 2024 our presenters tonight we'll be Dr Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent leadership and learning and Jeanette executive director student parent and employee service center gentleman you have the floor

[00:23:00]
I guess I'll go ahead and start for some reason my camera the host turned it off so I can't turn it back on so if he turns it back on I'll be live on camera so Madam chair members of the comedian superintendent Dr Blakey good evening here we go I am to have other executive director of student parent and employee service center and today I bring before the ethical Advocate data from July 1st 2024 to November 30th of 2024 and this has been shared with you as a quick overview of complaints are filed primarily through ethical Advocate which allows for Nana's reporting I have followed the procedural directive when receiving these reports review the reports and send them to the direct supervisor and one additional supervisor of in that chain of command so that to levels of supervisor or notified

[00:24:00]
as you can see in the data that we have provided we have received 42 whistleblower complaints from July 1st to the end of November 2024 the reports in your packet provide a breakdown of the data by several different categories and at this point I stand for your questions thank you Mr Saavedra are there any questions from the committee I do have a question what accounts for the DraStic drop from 202324 to 202425

[00:25:00]
was I can tell you that a lot of the the let's talk now provides an opportunity for employees families members of community to bring concerns to us that we can answer immediately and therefore I would make the assumption that they don't necessarily file a whistleblower complaint because they're able to get the answers and solutions that we provide here through the service center at that point or through the district when they are given to different departments okay thank you madam chair Mr Savage from the first page down at the bottom in the chart title complaints by location School level and I can't figure it out so I'm going to ask the dumb question what does non APS mean or in this case specifically

[00:26:00]
where did this complaint come from if you can disclose that information well the non APS means that they're not an employee or you know a student teacher from APS it's just somebody outside of APS and sometimes they don't identify you know what their affiliation is or or the complaint is coming from exactly so that's how that is categorized okay thanks are there any other questions we will move on to our next item agenda which is the executive session so our next item is the consider of approval for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the public meetings act section 10151 H2O to discuss limited personal matters in connection with activity fund audits may I have

[00:27:00]
Mission please I move that we approve for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized by the public meeting 10:15 - 1 H2 to discuss limited Personnel matters and connection with activity fund audits this is board member benavidez and this is board member Dominguez I will second thank you Doctor Albright may I have a roll call vote please yes Courtney Jackson yes okay I will now ask

[00:28:00]
