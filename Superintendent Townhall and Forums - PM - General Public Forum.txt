you can learn more about both of these finalists by visiting aps.edu it will begin this evening good evening we know you have a lot of other things you could be doing this evening on the exciting Tuesday night and so you taking time out of your evening and your day to be with us shows your investment and your commitment to the children of Albuquerque and we're really grateful that you're joining us this evening I'm Gabriella Blakey and I'm the current chief operations officer for Albuquerque Public Schools and I'm also very daring because I'm showing my high school picture throughout the course of the day to people

[00:01:00]
my experience and growing up in Albuquerque set the foundation of the values that I carry with me today I attended Sandia base Van Buren and I graduated from Highland High School and it was through those experiences that I really learned not just the importance of public education but also a commitment to respecting and understanding diversity I grew up in a neighborhood and then School

[00:02:00]
where everybody was different and I feel more comfortable in situations where I'm around different people because of that experience that I had growing up when I was in Middle School I was around 11 or 12 years old and we had a toy drive for the holidays where we brought in toys and food for the community and to deliver to families and I had a lot of friends at school that helped put the drive together and we went across the street from Van Buren to some apartments and walked into one of the apartments where about seven kids came out from the back really excited about the toys in the food and out from the back room came my friend Diana who was in school with me and it was in that experience that I understood that we all come to school with different home lives and different experiences and that's what creates such a strong learning environment but it also taught me

[00:03:00]
even though we all have equal outcomes that we expect of our children that we need to have Equitable inputs in order to achieve those and I learned that at a very early age and I'm really thankful to my experience at Van Buren and Highland that got me to be in the place that I am today serving the students in Albuquerque now I was a teacher and I still see that I'm a teacher at heart so I want you to take a minute to just close your eyes and think about a child that's important to you this is a child that's important to me this is my niece says in preschool at Whittier Elementary School and we'll be going into kindergarten next year and so coming with going to level of responsibility professionally and personally but she has her whole education life ahead of

[00:04:00]
and it's my commitment that the decision that I make in the best interest of science is a decision that I make in the best interests of all of our children and I want you to think about the child that you were thinking of and know that the decisions are the decisions that are good enough for the child that you're thinking of we have established APS goals and this was created by the work of the community and the school board to develop these four goals early literacy mathematics post-secondary Readiness and skills habits in mindsets but it's a work of the district to develop the Strategic plan to make sure that we are set up for success

[00:05:00]
so we have four strategic priorities clear expectations rigorous instruction engage students and responsive and coordinated systems so I want to walk you through just a few key initiatives that you can expect under my leadership for each of those initiatives let's start with clear expectations under my leadership I will demand accountability for student outcomes of all levels of the district and create systems and levels of autonomy I also will meet continuously with staff community and students to get a clear understanding of what keeps the district from achieving goals and the ways we can remove those barriers I can tell you even though it's been a long day for us we have sure that there's a commitment from the community and that this isn't the first time that I'll be listening to the community but that this is an expected listening that I will have throughout the course of my Administration

[00:06:00]
decentralized central office and increase decision-making to be closer to the school level our second priority is rigorous instruction under my leadership I will collaborate with the community to provide high dosage tutoring for students I will ensure that lessons are taught in the classroom are connected to grade level standards in all classrooms across the city I will partner with the public education department to open the Statewide Literacy Center you may have heard that the state is interested in building out a Statewide Literacy Center and you might also hear that we have some schools that are really small that we're trying to repurpose I see this as a great opportunity for collaboration and to build out the Statewide Literacy Center here in Albuquerque I also want to increase support and training for structured literacy and support teachers and meeting the individual needs of all the students in their classrooms the third priorities engaged students under my leadership I will add

[00:07:00]
give me a shower to all of our elementary schools genius hour right now is in some of our elementary schools but expanding it into all of our elementary schools is essential in being able to make sure that our children have creativity throughout the day I will ensure that all of our middle school students have access to electives and it is not just given to them as a reward for attending school or learning I will create opportunities for high school internships with Community Partners increase and established robust Career Technical education programs ensure that art and music is in all of our elementary schools again we have art and music available in some of our elementary schools but we haven't built it out to be available for all of our elementary school students across the city I also want to support an increase access to bilingual programs for our students and expand social emotional sports for our students are fourth priority is responsive and coordinated systems

[00:08:00]
under this parody you can expect that I will support an increase her teacher pipeline programs and teacher residencies I will work with our Community Partners to increase her Workforce I will review curriculum programs to make sure that we're not being redundant in different areas and that we don't have curriculum that's being used of substandard quality I also will continue to work to shift to students budget aligns to student outcomes and through all of this I want you to think about that student again as I think about Sia that my commitment to you is the same commitment that I have to ensure that say I have a successful education from kindergarten to 12th grade now that I will listen I will respond I will leave and I will deliver for all of our students

and most importantly of served as a teacher and a superintendent I highlight those two because after 11 years in the classroom I knew that it was time for this individual to get out of the classroom before I became a handicap rather than an asset to my school I was getting burned out I needed to change and so I stepped away from the classroom and initially thought that I would I would be leaving education of of students in the classroom with the teacher is that's the foundation of the educational process is the foundation of the school district and that that interplay between the two is always at the Forefront of my mind as I execute the duties of the superintendency I was educated

[00:11:00]
Drake University for my doctorate and my my superintendent's licensure I got my bachelor's degree from the University of Denver I got my administrative licensure through Iowa State I can go on and on and on and on about the education that I have sometimes it seems like too much but I do want to highlight prior to leaving the classroom I thought that I would be leaving education when I was finishing the classroom and so I earned my masters of public administration I know I wanted to stay in public service and as it turns out that was a very beneficial movie consider the NBA of the public sector has been hugely beneficial in in the areas of human resources and business and finance and giving me giving me a little bit of a different angle the most superintendents have on sort of the back office operations that are necessary for for any school district to be successful in our even more on nessus

[00:12:00]
is there to be effective and efficient when we're talking about a system the size of APs My Philosophy and my Approach here's where my heart is in my thinking is in my approach to executing the work of the superintendency and as an educator at the very basic level all students can learn and all students can succeed when we find that that's not happening with a segment of our population then we need to be examining adult behaviors and modifying those adult behaviors and create and changing the environment in which we're serving our students such that they do learn and are successful Equity is my Northstar Blakey speaks about this eloquently our students to get

[00:13:00]
sometimes the really restrictive rules that we need to follow as public Educators we need to recognize the starting point of each of our students is different and how we serve each of those differences needs to be needs to be modified based on the particular needs and the particular background and life experiences of those students so that by the time through the school district they have equality of outcome and and Equity of opportunity when when they

[00:14:00]
leave the doors of APs all staff teachers certainly have the most direct impact and then principles but all staff working in a school system have a crucial impact on the outcomes in the in the experiences that our students have I believe that firmly whether your food and nutrition worker or a bus driver or working in on the maintenance and so the outcome that we that we realize with our students is the result of everyone's efforts and all of us need to own that people work educating smaller human beings to allow them to blossom into their potential and we can follow the best science best practices that we can find but regardless of what strategies we use if we do not have a healthy welcoming

[00:15:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:16:00]
one of the things as a superintendent that I did was develop a continuous Improvement team and we had a small team of Six Sigma certified staff that would regularly go through especially after program evaluations and and look for ways that we could be more efficient and more effective at the work that we are doing so that we could directly as many of those resources directly to the classroom as possible everyone contributes I believe in engagement it's so awesome to see how many people have been in this room today listing to doctor Blakey and myself talk about how we would approach this work but for those who aren't engaged we need to push to get them engaged for the sake for the sake of our students the next generation of leaders are in our classrooms right now we have to take that very seriously and

[00:17:00]
we should not be the only ones impacting the trajectory of their educational experience we know that public schools are being asked to do way more than they were initially created to do and one of the debates that I've had to have frequently with my board of directors as superintendent of responsibility for instance so that we can extend the school day in a cost-effective way you know we provide meals for our students we provide Mental Health Services for our students we developed a dental clinic in Des Moines schools through some Public Partnerships we had health clinics there's a whole way of things that we did that were necessary for our students to have that basic level of support so that they could be successful academically but we need

[00:18:00]
need to be shouting from the rooftops to our community all of the gaps that we're trying to fill while they think that all all that we're trying to do is teach because it's gotten way more expensive than that this is I guess if I could leave one point of emphasis and I have one minute to do it I genuinely believe that student agency is where it's at and this is particularly true I think when we're serving the kind of diverse student population but I do want to say this out loud every student understands that she has fundamental control over the choices and actions that make her who she is we need to be engaging and listening to our students as much as possible creating programming responsive to the wants and the passions of those students so that they find real meaning in the learning that we're trying to impart and

[00:19:00]
Dr Blakey will begin with you

[00:20:00]
what is your previous experience with early childhood education programming and how will you grow apses Early Childhood programs in a manner that is developmentally appropriate thank you thank you for the question and previous to my work in Albuquerque as an associate superintendent I was an assistant superintendent in Santa Fe Public Schools in oversaw early childhood and growing to make sure that every child had a space to have access to Early Childhood since that time are state has invested a great deal of resources into early childhood and I think that as the district were a partner in that work we have a new director of early childhood education who is doing a really good job in building relationships with other providers and making sure that we provide choice and access for Early Childhood across the city we believe that

[00:21:00]
play childhood is really a partnership with others for everything from wraparound services to making sure that children have a place that they are able to thrive in one of the examples is in February upcoming I wish I knew the day off the top of my head but I have a lot of other things in my head right now at this location where we're putting on our first Early Childhood Showcase of providers from all over the city to be able to share with parents what is available in early childhood because we believe that it's a partnership so at that fair for example they're going to have the private providers public providers they're having access to all kinds of different types of Early Childhood environments for children to choose from so that parents are aware of what their

[00:22:00]
options are and being able to find the best place for their children I think we're at a critical place in the state where we're able to address some of what we're seeing in kindergarten but making sure that preschool and early childhood stays Early Childhood I think that's really important and that's something that's really important to me that wherever the child is attending Early Childhood that they are able to learn through play and that children are able to be children in early childhood was showing a picture earlier of my niece who's in preschool at Whittier Elementary School and when I asked her about her day I always asked her like what she did to play because when you asked for a year old you'll get all kinds of things that they played in but you get to hear the imagination and the creativity and making sure that whatever environment are children are in for

[00:23:00]
play childhood that they're in an environment that they're able to be creative and to play and to use their imagination or a heart with in Des Moines State of California programs and including

[00:24:00]
including Head Start was to expand the number of seats that we had available as much as we possibly could and to extend the the number of hours we got funding by the way for half-day preschool but only for about half the students that we served at that age so it was a it was a continuous push to to get investment in in pre-k at the state level and we did a nice job of getting that expanded for them to finally recognize that yellow Services were necessary even at the preschool level if we wanted to have our students fully prepared for kindergarten when they came out something that was necessary to make the preschool programming accessible genuinely accessible

[00:25:00]
I'm with the half-day programming we knew that we weren't serving all of our students so one of the things that I started doing very systematically when we would share out data for reading and math of our elementary students is I would always break down which of our students had a high-quality preschool experience and and what those what that data look like compared with those students who did not have a high-quality preschool experience to take every opportunity to demonstrate just how important that Readiness factor is and and we also pushed I was never quite successful with this but my my Pre-K director and I created a model of funding that that would have been about 2/3 whatever that would have provided half-day high quality preschool and half and half day high quality daycare not call it preschool but provide access especially for those

[00:26:00]
there's not the flexibility with work and other responsibilities to to have to be shuttling students all over the place so it's vitally important and something that grows and importance every year so looking for any ways to bridge the the that access Gap is vitally important stuff

[00:27:00]

[00:28:00]

[00:29:00]
oh yes

[00:30:00]
my ability to incorporate diverse pairs

[00:31:00]
perspectives in the classroom because otherwise what happens is I've done I've worked in every quadrant of the city and it's really important that we all know I was teaching at Highland High School so it wasn't just Highlands they have this class but they don't have this class at another school it should be that all of our children have the opportunity to learn diverse perspectives really see themselves in the history of the of

I don't feel like it's effective to give them an extra

[00:44:00]
so I think it's really important that we work really closely with our youth well we're trying to address and then we work with our community and try to get a hold of what is in front of us

[00:45:00]
end of the year Baseline of kind of landed and where we need to go I don't see a lot of value in state and National testing for drilling down to individuals addressing the needs of students and it gives

[00:46:00]
not being able to reach the goals and the standards and the state assessments are a larger picture of where we are as a district where we are as a state and comparison to others and so I hope that gives you kind of like a little bit of an Insight of how I feel that teachers should

[00:55:00]
I am answering the question of the assessments when you're looking broadly that's the use of State assessments right so as a middle school as a whole we can look at 7th grade math and see collectively what we did in the year but the reason that we were making those gains is because of the short cycle assessments of the Middle School principal of this work so for more details so as a collective as middle school principals we worked collaboratively to make sure that we were working together to change the trajectory for our students but then you break that down individually at the school and the classroom level by making sure that the teachers have time to

[00:56:00]
individual level

[00:57:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:58:00]
I firmly believe that we

[01:01:00]
access

use them appropriately

[01:08:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:09:00]
carrying weapons with them because they're scared so how do we make sure that students have access to be able to communicate I know a lot of parents rely on the phones for communication to make sure kids are safe as well so we just have to look at it really of what is causing the distraction and how we can eliminate the distractions without causing issues on the other

clutch on the professional development that I was providing for my staff and not nearly enough on a whole bunch of other factors that were also staff related that that if I hadn't if I didn't show up it wouldn't really matter how how high quality is the professional development was miserable to get better results

[01:20:00]
so my first order of business would be to

[01:21:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:22:00]
individuals and create levels of autonomy and support for schools to give them the power to best serve their students with the finances and the resources that we provide this is the last question that partnership to create

[01:23:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:24:00]
all of those situations even though it can be contentious it's always positive because it takes a little bit of push on both sides for us to have progressed and I believe in pushing on my side and I value a push on the other side whichever Union it is I'm working with because that's what makes us
