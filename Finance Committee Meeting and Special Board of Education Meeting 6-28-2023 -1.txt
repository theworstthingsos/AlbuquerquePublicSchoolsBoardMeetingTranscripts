[00:00:00]

[00:02:00]
play Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes you're still talking about yes so our next item for consideration and action is consideration for approval of the June 28th 2023 Finance items on consent calendar minus items efst and you I will move for consideration of items on the finance committee consent calendar with the exception of efst and you pick up a second this is Peggy thank you again so our first item for consideration

[00:03:00]
an action is going to be item e which is consideration for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service this is for technology for April 1st to the 30th 2023 this is a discussion action item we have Mr Mark Turnbull here is our executive director of accounting we have you as our speaker but I will go ahead and open it up to board member Miller on for her questions so I know that you did try to like answer my questions and I don't know if they were just mine about the equipment taken out of service so I know we included reasons so back when I would just ask so many questions about why why why why why why and there are no reasons listed on either this item or the next one so I just didn't understand why all of a sudden that got taken away and the reasons are not listed as to why that equipment is taken out of service who made that decision why that decision was

[00:04:00]
made somebody could answer that for me that would be great and I think if you're saying the reasons for the ones that have a value of 0.00 out of service and it was a lot of computers and

[00:05:00]
it would still say they are obsolete or old they're broken they're etcetera and that's not the case anymore so is that just going to be the way forward that we're not going to list reasons for why they were taken out of service and if that decision was made it was made so something like that has since retired and I don't know that we have been able to replace him so it may have been that whoever is trying to pick up the work simply did not complete that task I don't recall anybody having a discussion at any time to not include that information there to check it through

[00:06:00]
we'll look at that before we come back next month okay and then the other question was there are a lot of you know a lot of Chromebooks on here A whole I didn't even count how many there were that it says their location was inventory control Osuna warehouse and I am just making an assumption I think you use that right to track where everything is correct so what what you're seeing with respect to the increased volume I think I've mentioned it before our initial priority during the pandemic was to distribute the device at the students needed and what we are doing now with our new we hired additional staff we kind of focused them on collecting the ones that are old and scanning them

[00:07:00]
inventory them making sure that they are truly obsolete packaging them up into big pellets and kind of moving them through the salvaging process so you can expect to see you know for every single purchase that we've made between you know 3 to 7 years later it will that amount will show up later and we're really catching up to we're catching up because that process was that process involves collecting the devices bring them to the warehouse when they're when they're brought to that warehouse they're scanned in and so that's where you get the different location change and that's it doesn't mean that that's where they were before but tip web keeps track of where they were and that's the last location so is this going to because I know before there are schools that says you know see below Tony hillerman it says where they you know got taken out so is this what's going to happen

[00:08:00]
from now on or not necessarily that it's all going to go to the warehouse cuz I see most of these were older obviously older computers that went in service and you know 2017-2018 I think that's when most of them if I recall were in the middle in the past the Salvage process all the Salvage processes were triggered from the school site and so the equipment would be salvaged directly from the school site and for now for the devices that technology is collecting because they're obsolete we collect them and we scan them into our own inventory to say hey look they're over here and then we salvaged them from there so you will in the future you'll still see some that are salvaged directly from the schools so schools for example suppose there's a device that's been I don't know destroyed at the school site it was dropped

[00:09:00]
play Don rolled over by a car or something like that and they have the ability to just call Salvage right there and it does not have to it doesn't necessarily need to go be sent over to technology we do offer that as a service but school still can do that so in the future the bulk of things should be coming from a warehouse in technology the book of Technology items should land there but school still can sit down and and schools can still send their own if it comes from schools and technology so you do know what schools these came from though yes we can I we can I buy it it is a isn't it it's a one by one research process for each

[00:10:00]
that we could go back and look but it's there's no report at a tip web that's going to give us that information so it would take a person going to teach record and trying to identify and going back and identifying where it came from there's a chain of cuz every time you scan it into a new location it records it records it scan so we can see where it currently is but going backwards means like you have to check each item and then see where it was before and then some of these Chromebooks a lot of the Chrome to individuals so it's not really a school so it was your answer your question probably not I mean I just think and I am not a finance person that you need to know and that would go to probably miss up a taco that it's important to know where things were

[00:11:00]
right like I think I personally think that's important I think any business needs to know where things are or are they started were they ended and I think that's important I don't know maybe it's not if it's not just tell me it's not important who cares it's all from the warehouse even though we know all of this stuff didn't originate from there that it did originated out of school so a child still if it's given checked out to a child it's still goes to that school though it's not the child right if a child is in transitions started in one school and go to another school it wouldn't be a sign to a school it be a sign to a student what I can tell you that we do have a record of each item is a signed at all times and also we can track where it was one by one by one by one so it's not

[00:12:00]
there is a what I think I'm sorry but what I believe he was saying is that there is not another there is a report that has a field that says location but there's not a report that has a field that says location before that or location before that we can print that out but it's not a report that we have because usually people want to know like where there are things are like currently and they're not going backwards it's not like a standard report for that I actually believe we can go back and find out at a certain point in time like where was everything at another point in time like we go backwards but some of these might have been anyway there's not a simple way to have a report that says the location before the current location so

[00:13:00]
it whatever it's called that obviously doesn't help with knowing where it was previously it just is that true doesn't really help with that at all if we had a business reason to look and find where everything was the step before the current step we can get that done okay yeah I would say inventory systems are are made to find out where the asset is currently they're not made to find where the asset was previously it's a tracking where the current location has been again as drones said their

[00:14:00]
there could be a reason you would look but not for all the assets because these are basically they're absolutely so can I ask a follow-up question to that just so I could understand clearly so let's say it's October and I'll use West Mesa you know they have all these Chromebooks that have been issued to the students if we pull a current inventory it'll say these Chromebooks are for West Mesa right they're not going to save the location of the warehouse now I'm saying that's not going to say that I would say currently that's where that's okay and then we would need to cross reference the student ID with the current location of the student okay and then let's say now still use West Mesa me whenever all the students all the seniors graduate they have their Chromebook all those Chromebooks get turned back into West Mesa

[00:15:00]
so there's there's a chain and you can find out where anything is at any particular Point okay

[00:16:00]
send in your opinion is tip Webb it worth it is it good does it do what it's supposed to do is we do we need to make our inventory control better cuz we need to know this is taxpayers money being spent on things like we need to be able to answer to them yes tip web is a good system so we had to do a lot of catching up after the initial hand out because we couldn't touch so we have really really struggled the last time the Capital Services but it's not as frightening as the first

[00:17:00]
number that was thrown at me a while back so tip web is the key it's just making sure it gets used by the people in the schools cuz you started using that it's been like I think before I even got on the board right like I think it was before 2015 so it's been used for a while and I don't think it'd been used quite this way I think it initially might have been in the library and I use something somewhere

[00:18:00]
is their IP address and their geographical location I might be able to use that to identify where my all my assets are so we tip web does not have that capability but it's something that anyway we're always looking at new ways to improve things okay just when I'm looking at location it just seems here a little just a little misleading so thank you thank you do we have any other questions related to item e I'll move for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service for April 1st 2:30 I said this is supposed to know thank you there's no further discussion Dr Albert Toyota

[00:19:00]
yes so our next item for consideration and action is item F consideration for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service for April that says the exact same thing it's this one the first one was technology and this one is just equipment so that was good and I'll turn it back over for her questions were listed again and then when it came to I know you were ordering a whole lot of Promethean boards and there are schools that say they don't have what they need and so I didn't quite get an answer if the smart boards that were taken out of service were replaced with new ones if you don't know the answer and you can get the answer you know that's fine what I do know is that we are ordering sufficient Promethean boards with the

[00:20:00]
give me list funds that every classroom will have one so the ones that are being taken out of service here are their really they're really really old and they might have been projectors and not chords but we do have a project in place to ensure that every classroom okay and there will be a lot more Salvage in the next few years so we're going to go and we're putting in the the boards the ones that are there the schools are going to be salvaging in the next the next few years okay and I'm assuming that the reasons weren't listed because of what superintendent Elder said that we probably just don't have somebody there to list the reasons that they were taking out I don't believe it's the decision to do it I don't know what happened but we'll have to look into it but I don't recall anyone ever say let's stop doing this and I have a feeling maybe the transition and authorities it just didn't get done

[00:21:00]
honestly I think I was under the impression that we needed I recall like putting reasons where the the value was something other than zero and so those I believe have reasons but the ones that you could just look and see if that is just the case and if that's going to I want to make sure that that does just continue so if the value is more than 0 that that is on there and it could have just been written that way or just done that way thank you thank you any other questions related to item F know if I have a motion please I'll move for approval of statement of equipment to be taken out of service for April 1st 3023 I think this is supposed to if I could have a real call place yes Barbara Peterson yes

[00:22:00]
yes Courtney Jackson yes Crystal Tapia Romero yes so our next item for consideration is item es which is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equal or exceeds 250,000 this is for advanced placement English language arts instructional materials this is a discussion action item we have executive director missner here from procurement and I will open it up to board member melatonin for her questions thank you so I know I look through everything and you all said you got input from you know teachers that were teaching the subjects and that you also got input from the community so my question on this one and it'll be the same for the other for the other two but for the

[00:23:00]
English the AP English how much input did you get from did you gather from community board member Mueller Oregon Health than the other subjects I hope that teachers worked with community members and ways that we don't always know about when they're making their recommendation I think it's safe to say that they presumably do teachers are talking to their parents so hopefully we have that Baseline amount of community input regardless of people filling out forms okay so we don't have any idea how many people gave their input Community input is an area for potential Improvement that we are continually trying to come up with new ways because I know that they have to if they want to look at the book they have to come to Central they have to come here so that's obviously an impediment for a lot of people you know we

[00:24:00]
add online options which we could do again and we also have low input there so I would say that we are very interested in ideas for how we could get more Community input okay cuz I think that's important and I don't know if it's up to maybe the Publishers being able to put the digital copy of the book and maybe there's reasons that they can't I don't know what it is but that would be something that would make it easier at least for those that have access to a computer just to be able to look at the book that way we can actually asked for a sample lessons we could any any ideas I can get to always good practice to ask Publishers for what we want because we don't if we don't ask they don't know what we need right and so I think that's something to just ask for me maybe they can't put a digital copy of the book so that people can and you know Publishers are up against each other so you know hate that

[00:25:00]
be an impetus to get them to do that so I think that would be important so then I was you know I did you know look at at you know these books and they talked about I looked at some of the authors you know and some of the authors I thought you know my own opinion that I wouldn't know why they would get chosen that I didn't think they had you know we're really good literature in my personal opinion but what I found interesting was that they had they had a pie graph and it had to diverse range of voices so there was this pie graph and so I'm assuming and you can tell me if this is what they were referring to is the authors that are part of that you know 50% White

[00:26:00]
25% black 111 Asian can you tell me what that pie graph refers to on their on their website is it about the authors that board member Mueller Oregon to answer that question I would really want to look at this specific pie chart because our lives are full of pie charts about and it would very much not want to answer about a different pie chart is there is there a link or a place I could look no I just looked on just yeah I just looked on to see you know the I went and looked on to for you know the it was high school for AP and so

[00:27:00]
is pie graph came up and I just was like I don't know how if that's what it is and if you could find out if that's what it is I don't know how that makes for good literature has anything to do with good literature that you are getting so many authors that are Middle Eastern or Jewish or lgbtq male-female I don't know what that has to do with choosing good literature and if that is a case I would like to know if that's what that pie chart is referring to because it wasn't very detailed it wasn't very detailed about what they were talking about if they were if they were talking about the authors that was my assumption right and for Miller Auto and I am extremely reluctant to talk about this specific pie chart just because I don't want to be an accurate my library and I don't want to do that I would love to research it and tell you exactly what they meant to say about it for sure

[00:28:00]
but when we are looking at high quality instructional materials it is true that one of the things that we are looking for is a wide range of authors and experiences that's one of the things that the New Mexico ped is asking us to look at when we look at high-quality instructional materials and it's it's very much like the attitude that we have in the libraries where we're not trying we don't want to take voice is away we want to add voices we want to say here's more stories I mean and by stories I also mean nonfiction too of course but here are more pieces of information here are more perspectives it's just the kids get the kids more information and more stories because then they can make up their own minds which is the most beautiful results of education so that is a part of high-quality instructional materials but as to the specific pie chart are are colleagues and friends in the publishing land they do love a chart so

[00:29:00]
I want to look at the specific one before saying anything just because I wouldn't want to give you an accurate information I just want to make sure that it's we're choosing good literature and that's what it's about teaching how you know kids good literature how to be good Riders not about you know and I looked further into you know this Ela apla and I mean some of the things that were in there just I just and I'm not an English teacher so hey I could be wrong I can't speak that much about and I can only tell you from a Elementary perspective you know but some of the things that were in there just were like I just questioned what they had to do with English to be honest with you and when you're talking about the course that some of our textbooks in our curriculum are like taking most people that I talk to are not in agreement with the curriculum and the way a lot of textbooks are and that is you know

[00:30:00]
on Santa Fe and it is on the Publishers giving what they think but parents just I mean they just want to have like a bigger say and what they're finding is a lot of their values and beliefs and moral teachings at home they just want him to be respected and not undermined and because they believe differently than some of this stuff that I read doesn't make those parents intolerant or or hateful but they don't want their kids to be you know for the schools for government to contradict what they're teaching their family values and their morals or religious beliefs they just don't want that to contradict what they're teaching and what I saw in this textbook did that often and lots of the chapters and I think that's the serious deficiency and my opinion and

[00:31:00]
parents against schools which is not what any of us want we want to be a real partnership and I don't see that happening with you know the World Language with the health or with this one and I would just tell parents that are out there like you said they didn't they didn't come look at the books so some of that is you know it's on them you know you but we also need to make it easier for them but I say if you you know if you don't like what's going on or what your kids are being taught in the classroom speak louder than my one voice you know I can vote you know I can vote know that I don't agree with this because of what parents tell me but I mean it's still can get shoved down you know down your throats if you're not speaking up and kids are the easiest stuff to get to through education so I say parents you need to stand up for for your parental rights that's what I say you

[00:32:00]
and you need to make the trip down here but this is going to be for are we having these books for 6 years period for pursuing the goal of including many voices and on that note I moved to may we go ahead and move to accept motion to accept any other questions or discussion related to item asks go headboard Jackson thank you yeah the only suggestion that I wanted to have to offer is I was kind of I was surprised to see this because

[00:33:00]
I actually did not know that the AP language in the world were coming up and so a suggestion that I would might offer for more Community involvement in the future is to let the board members know and ask us to help you get it out to the community some of us have social media platforms it's really easy for us to let the public know that this is coming we can alert the public we can alert the community and so that they can come down and and review and kind of give their feedback and if I missed it I apologize but I did not see anything special on the ape or the World Language I will say that I did appreciate your your review that you gave in the document as to what the process was I think you guys have really gone a long way and improving the process and I am so appreciative of that but I would just ask you

[00:34:00]
to let us help you as well we do have platforms that we can kind of help engage the community and so I think help us help you so that's it thank you any other questions related to items I just want to make a just sort of like a comment I think it's more like a point of order because I understand that you know we had this on the agenda and I didn't see these questions being posed except tonight which I believe that as board members we we made a green bit that when we got these we would ask our questions ahead of time so that our staff could come prepared and so so I think it's unfair to sort of fire at questions tonight when they could have been asked before and I just want to state that because I think that's on us we have to hold that as a piece of Integrity ourselves around and structural

[00:35:00]
and we also agreed to no surprises and so no surprises for a staff I think we need to be fair on that so if there were questions about what was here they should have been asked and I just want to state that because I think it's really important and I know I'll just stop at that so I think board member Dominguez wanted to make a motion so I'll just wait for her to make her motion and all second that and so I moved to approve the district purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 2 5 0. 0

[00:36:00]
same time I think that's the beauty of our board that we all have different opinions different backgrounds and the ability to be able to say our voice like at no time do I ever want anyone to feel like they can't speak up and share their thoughts their feelings and because the overall that's why we're here we will not necessarily always agree and that's okay but we should always be able to feel like we have our voice heard granted we're going to do our best to follow a process to the system to be able to streamline everything and be more effective and efficient but I do appreciate everybody's diverse opinions and knowing that we're here to speak on what's best for our constituents and will continue to do that so having said that we do have a motion and a second so Dr Albright if I could have a real call Cordova yes yes no and you can tell us yes or Peterson yes Courtney Jackson yes

[00:37:00]
Crystal Tapia Romero yes so our next item for consideration is item T consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds $250,000 this is for World Language instructional materials in Spanish and French this is a discussion action item board member to go on any additional questions outside of what was stated on items now and I just want to say I think I appreciate what you said Romero it was me who didn't get the questions in and I apologize if I put you guys on the spot in my mother was in the hospital she can't get left alone for a single second so my sincere apologies because I'm very good about getting him in on time and I'm sorry I didn't mean to ever put you on Spotify

[00:38:00]
my mom just very ill and so I I still am sorry so it's basically the same you know the same kind of question this is different it's like I am assuming you didn't have a lot of community input so we need to figure out how to make that better and then just some of the things they said on here and you know when I was reading about it was just you know that Spanish belongs that language only belong to people of that Community I mean if you kind of go into their website and just read more about what was going on there is you just need to read a little bit more I think we're all languages belong to everybody my son-in-law is a Spanish speaker speaks better than almost anybody that I know and he's Scottish from Scotland so it doesn't just belong to the people of that Community I think it belongs to any child who chooses to learn

[00:39:00]
I think that should be the case and that's how we should treat it doesn't just belong to to one group so I think that's something that we need to look at tonight that's one of the things that I have trouble with just kind of reading more into this publisher that we can only learn Spanish and be a true Spanish speaker and that's the only way we can understand the Spanish speaking cultures I mean things like that I think that's just hurtful to people so and that's all that I have to say about that thank you any other questions Associated item T if not may have a motion place for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 20050 World Language

[00:40:00]
which is consideration for approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 250,000 dollars this is for health instructional materials in Boardman I'll turn it back over to you so this one you got more input so what kind of input I would just assume you did cuz I know when they were changing the health standards there was a whole lot of input on Hell standard social studies standards so why do you think that you got more input for this one as compared to the other two

[00:41:00]
Ford dealer Aragon I I actually think that it might be one of the areas that we've identified for potential future Improvement which is that there are existing like advisory and Community groups and that is something that we've identified for like k through eight Ela ELD SLA coming up is maybe we need to give the community much more notice and also work through established like groups of people that we know to publicize things that and we combined review opportunities although then Health still got the most but maybe that is telling us just as much as you can consolidate make it easy for parents so some of it could have just been the logistics we still did not get for a district of how many thousand students that we have and how many parents I think we got and I brought the spreadsheet and did not count them in advance I think it was 15

[00:42:00]
which is better than 0

[00:43:00]
and through that tool which we was utilized as we as APS looked at the health education textbooks that's part of it you make that alignment so we can go back and look at that and there have been other states that other districts and other states have adopted the same materials and they've done the same thing with the heat cat so we could utilize the information from that tool to do that alignment for this but I did want to make a statement that for health education and being a lifelong Health educator you don't use a textbook a lot so textbook is really very much supplementary materials and like The Sciences the Deep Sciences it changes frequently let's look at the pandemic you know the information we were giving two years ago about a pandemic is different than the information we give out now the information changes to quickly the nice thing about this textbook is it does have some online resources that can be up

[00:44:00]
as things update in the health world and so that was thinking why this was kind of an attractive material going forward but the textbook is a health educator the only time I ever used it was when I had a sub so you know it's not really something that Health Educators rely on a lot and so but it's about time it's not it's been way longer than six years before health education has been in the adoption because I kept getting from the state level getting put back on the burner on the funding for textbooks because of the need for science adoptions it's in it's in that same and literacy in that same adoption cycle for areas that do need to be updated every six years and it was interesting when I was looking at those different standards templates that different states have created what you just said was true it would be like okay we have this standard

[00:45:00]
gender roles or let's see sex active risk of sex activity you know whatever it was and then it would just have like a page number where they could link it to that textbook so what you're saying is basically they use it for you know this one page or something to to link to their standards and so it's probably the case that people still don't use the textbook as much thank you that's all thank you any other questions I have one but it doesn't have to be answered tonight but I just came into my head and I'm just wondering how we are aligning or how the decision around your choice aligns with cold number four to increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the skills success for severance self-regulation self-efficacy social awareness

[00:46:00]
and again you don't have to answer that tonight I'll take a shot at it tonight if you'd like since both of those are sort of in my wheelhouse right now there's there is information in this in the materials that are being put in front of you around SEL and that's really the big alignment in terms of health education and go for and that's the SEL piece of it and so this does have some information in there although we are not going to rely solely on this textbook as we roll out seal District wide and so it is one tool in the SEO toolkit but it does give Health Educators which is part of their standards so it's the only one subject area where you will see in the standard some alignment to social emotional learning and where we don't see that in the other standards but this these materials will give Health Educators another tool in their tool kit we're planning to give them

[00:47:00]
a lot more tools and not just Health Educators but these materials are aligned in that way to go for thank you thank you so what grade level are these materials for 6:30 to

[00:48:00]
the playground in the internet because chances are if they're asking us they're not going to go home and ask their parents even though we might say that's a good conversation for your parents it's way too many instances it will not happen and so it really falls on us to be honest straightforward and factual age appropriate great appropriate absolutely but when would be shocked what questions 5th graders come up with and and it's and I think it's absolutely essential that across our curriculum that we reflect our community and our community is incredibly diapers and that doesn't mean being disrespectful of any family's beliefs religion ethics but it does mean that we have kids sitting next to each other who have a whole Broadway

[00:49:00]
respect that and reflect that and so I really appreciate the work that you've done on these issues and materials and so with that I will move for adoption if that's an order of item are we on TV on you okay consideration approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds $250,000 for health instructional materials thank you so we have a motion by remember Peterson's and Dr Albertville call policeman yes Brittany Jackson so our next item

[00:50:00]
for discussion is an update on the district series 2023 General obligation bonds is a discussion only item and we have have Mr Turnbull here from accounting to give us an overview I'm join the party city to to answer your questions

[00:51:00]
good evening Madam chair members of the board my name is Kaylee weimerskirch with RBC Capital markets we are your Municipal advisor as mentioned that we are going to just go briefly over the district's recent Bond sale of the 2023 8 and 2023 bonds so in your package you should have presentation a pricing book summary just a brief overview the district issued one series of bonds 20238 it was for 70 million dollars these new money so we can go to projects capital projects for the district we received 5.4 million dollars in premium the bonds came in at a true interest cost of just 3.4% for total interest to be just about 19.5 million dollars the bonds do have an optional Redemption date of August 1st of 2030 and the bonds have already closed back on May 17th and funds are available already

[00:52:00]
for the district for spending the second bond issue is that the district issued for refunding bonds the series 2023 bonds these Bonds were total Paramount of 42,885,000 and received 3.5 million dollars in premium the savings of these bonds produced 1.8 million dollars and Present Value savings or 4.15 percent again these bonds have also closed I will pass it off over to the underwriter of these bonds Bob can see us to talk about the pricing and the marketing of these bonds thank you very much for president Madam president excuse me I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight as Kelly mention is a very successful bond price on April 26th working very closely with the Detroit and the rest of the

[00:53:00]
financing team on our part underwriting a lot of pre-marketing went into the issue the week before leading the days up to the April 26th pricing obviously the district's rating is very high AA Standard & Poor's it's a very good name in The Marketplace so your bonds are very well received we were able to distribute the bonds to a wide group of investors I think it was over 25 different institutional investors were able to sell bonds to New Mexico retail investors and money managers Bank Trust departments very diverse group of buyers they're over 300 million dollars of orders for your bonds about $12 million ended up issuing between the series a and the series B so you were oversubscribed allowed us to work closely with

[00:54:00]
RBC and their desk to lower the yields only the 23 maturity didn't have orders we were able to take those bonds into inventory at our risk which we always do is the underwriter but overall is a very successful Bond pricing execution by the district you're very well LED obviously with the most popular Mr Turnbull the folks at RBC and and the folks in module and we appreciate the opportunity to underwrite your bonds so I could go on and on but you don't want to hear me talk about it but I'll pause and see if I don't know part has anything to say or any questions were to address those as well Madam president and members of the board the only thing I would say is that he may recall when you approve the notice of sale you gave the authority to the ad

[00:55:00]
to do what has been described here and to stay within the parameters that you set and so I just want to affirm that every one of the parameters which was don't exceed the interest rate don't exceed the number of years don't exceed the commissions all of those parameters were met and so we're here to say very nicely all went well everything's in place and we have no nothing if you have questions happy to answer them thank you I will go to open it up for any further discussion or question mark

[00:56:00]
on your Municipal bond fund flows the flow change and the 4-week moving average so we see that like what drives what drives the for the moving average like what is that driven by so I think it's on page 19 of your questions the financial markets continue to be very volatile so going back in time to April 26th that was certainly the case then a recall the shed has been certainly then was in the mode of of raising interest rates inflation numbers that week prior to come out higher than the market anticipated at that time

[00:57:00]
name of the inflows there's investors specifically in tax-exempt Bonds in on a weekly basis they track the number of dollars millions and billions sometimes dollars either going into money market or into the inflows for the treasury Investments or going out and so I think preceding the sale there had been 11 consecutive outflows of money in the church at RBC put together going back to you know over the course of time so investors have options besides municipal bonds to invest in stocks real estate gold whatever the case might be so they were because of that volatility pulling money out spending it elsewhere so I think to your question it tracks that ins and outs of that particular Market okay thank you so much for making it simple

[00:58:00]
thank you any other questions okay well thank you thank you for being here to present so our next item for discussion is Item B which is an update on the fiscal year 2024 budget this is a discussion only item we have Miss Rosalinda Montoya our executive director of budget and strategic planning here to present I will turn it over to my thank you madam chair board members superintendent Elder as mentioned I am here to prison and update to our budgeting process in this presentation we have the IRS team here virtually to give an overview of our student-based initiative will be giving an FY 23 update or 20 424 timeline on what's on our radar and our FY

[00:59:00]
5 budget will be going over a few and genomics graphs showing our employee to student comparison and how we are looking at enrollment and Staffing a 3-year projection of Revenue expenditures and what that may look like in the next few years or potential areas of savings and an answer update primarily the American Rescue plan act or what as we refer to arpa funds which is the third allocation of the elementary and secondary school emergency relief funds or Esser funds and with that I will turn it over to brunette to begin our discussion on student base budgeting okay thank you so much a couple of slides okay next one so today is objective is to build them up

[01:00:00]
partnership also to review some questions answered in phase one next an alignment with the board and Kohl's and card rails and the Strategic plan we are working with ERS and on this side you can see the specific goals guard rails and I am going to hand it over to Ericsson that is working with the Albuquerque Public Schools and I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes period we're communicating all along

[01:01:00]
O'Connor and just a second and you will notice that like many of our colleagues we spent many years in the classroom principal shifts and I also sit on my town school board so I'm eager to share this update with you as I know that you're eager to keep the agenda moving forward as as I stated that we come from errs which stands for Education resource strategies and we work with primarily large Urban school systems to support strategic use and align structures and policies with the ultimate goal of improving student outcomes everything we're doing is specifically around resource use and focused intentionally on on how we can be supporting our students so if we could go to the next slide please I'm going on this flight here you're going to see that their that

[01:02:00]
currently in the beginning of this project and we started in this in May I believe was our kickoff time so we are here giving you an update on what is really just the early phases of our data analysis and the work that we're doing to to look at the different options for different funding models in Albuquerque Public Schools so if we go to the next slide there's this that I shared with you a little bit about your ass you're welcome to take a look back at that whenever you have a minute and if you go to one more slide forward I would just share a little bit more about yours as well just make sure that you understand the quality of work that we're providing after almost 20 years of supporting our school districts and we've worked with almost major major difference in many different contacts

[01:03:00]
we have worked hard to specifically design and Implement some student-centered funding models in about half of these districts which is what we're looking at doing here as well if it makes sense within the context of Albuquerque and if that's the suggestion that everyone moves forward with again and it gives us a this our experience gives us a deep functional knowledge that allows us to share what we observe in other districts and helped shape decisions and districts unique contacts so I'd love to just pass it off to just O'Connor who's leading our team and she can share a little bit more detail about what renette previewed and a little bit more about the work that we have already started great thanks Kyle and thanks for having us tonight if you go to the next slide I'll share a little bit more detail of what Kyle previewed in terms of the work that's happening in this phase one which is our current phase of work

[01:04:00]
which is really designed to be around a diagnostic State assessment and so we will be working alongside many stakeholder groups in APS to really start to define the vision for the funding system to assess the system conditions for funding redesign and to identify opportunities to shift resources and service of your priorities and needs so this work kicked off in May as Kyle mentioned we've been doing some data collection and have begun to process some of that data that we don't have any findings in place yet but we also plan and launched a kickoff visit for for the for the teams and during that kickoff we met with several the stakeholder groups in working sessions focus groups interviews and I'll share a little more on the next slide about who the key stay colder groups are are objective in that kickoff was really together input

[01:05:00]
on current strengths and challenges of the funding system in Albuquerque so that we can better refine the sorts of questions that we seek to answer through this diagnostic phase and begin to clarify you know some of the biggest enabling conditions that are going to be important in the Albuquerque context so you'll see here we're organizing around two share outs one in early August and the other in early September we sharing out some of those diagnostic bindings and engaging different groups in meaning-making about what they see in the data and what that suggests about where where Albuquerque should go forward with the hope that by late September we've helped to facilitate this learning process that enables key stakeholders to articulate what are the core priorities of the system and and what does that mean for how to how the district should move forward on its funding redesigned as

[01:06:00]
and if you go to the next slide I'll share a little bit more about who we're thinking about with stakeholders and you know first day from our experience doing this work in many other systems it is taught us nothing if not to that funding redesign initiatives like this in order to be impactful really do need to be centered around the communities vision and hopes for what this work can accomplish and that those closest to the challenges need to be at the center of the input and so we've been working with our APS leadership team at Rosalinda and superintendent Elder to identify who the core is for this group really need to be and starting in this phase one diagnostic phase that we've already begun engaging with is what we're calling our working group this is a group of cross-functional members across central office departments including Finance Human Resources academics

[01:07:00]
as well as school leaders and school zone Associates at different across different zones and levels we see this as our core audience for sharing and reviewing our preliminary diagnostic findings they will help us sort of lift some of the priorities for Change and identify some of those critical success factors we do have at the back of the presentation if you are interested exactly who's on that working group in case you're interested the other group that will be critical in supporting this work is obviously the cabinet and leadership team who have sort of started this work by clarifying their vision for what this resource model needs to accomplish really prioritizing equity and transparency and we see the recommendations coming from the working group is being a court input into the way that the cabinet and Leadership engages in some of the ultimate decision making around how the system should move forward and and what priorities

[01:08:00]
certainly not fully flushed out yet but have begun to identify both the venues and the ways to be engaging broader members so starting with you all tonight getting to give a little bit more preview of the work itself but are hoping to bring back some of the findings as we're able to over the next couple of months so that you all as well can help provide input on both the priorities and some of the key messages we've held some focus groups with school leaders during the kickoff time which was amazing really getting to dig into some of the challenges that schools and school leaders are facing and some of the drinks that they voiced about the system we've met with Ellen Bernstein to Sharon overview of this work and to get initial input from Union perspective and our currently working to identify what the right venues and moments

[01:09:00]
Community excitement and engagement around the idea of funding redesign and specifically thinking about what I moved to a student-centered funding model could look like so we're excited about that but I want to make sure that we're engaging folks along the way is that and these groups will also be critical sort of voices in the design phase as we as we look at head to what maybe this phase two work could look like if you go to the next slide we we wanted to sort of connect how how this funny and system really aligns to your theory of action for Change and sort of sets us up to think about what sorts of analytic questions and diagnostic questions we want to answer in this phase so the diagnostic is intended to shed light on some of the system level changes that enable

[01:10:00]
and that starts with the visioning work that you all have already done in your strategic plan as the foundation we know the district has identified funding redesign as one of the core enabling conditions to increase resource equity and to align resources to your state of priorities and that's such a foundational piece of this design work so in the diagnostic we'll see to answer questions such as what is the district's capacity to differentiate resources across the district what opportunities exist to prioritize Investments for student needs that really allow us to understand this question about how much is as part of the core question that we seek to answer at the same time we know as well as I think you all know that funding model changes alone will not change the conditions for how resources are used and ultimately will not impact student outcomes alone so while we sometimes say the funding

[01:11:00]
just as important is understanding how those resources need to be used for our how well and so this includes how flexible resources are and the systems and structures that enable School leaders and campus and District staff to make the sorts of shifts in their resources in order to create ultimately better student outcomes by creating an enabling different experiences so in this diagnostic will also seek to understand the conditions for influencing those structures and systems and understanding what needs to be true about how resources can be organized in Albuquerque to realize your vision for students and ultimately the board goals that you all have set out last year if you go to the next one it's just sets out the two phases of

[01:12:00]
one scheduled for early August and the other to be scheduled about mid-september we've organized them in sort of two big topical questions the first is what I was just sharing in the previous slide sort of our how much question how can Albuquerque differentiate resources and how is it currently doing that or some of the challenges what's the capacity to differentiate and reality to prioritize standing on need and that second session really focused on what the funding flexibility and structures need to look like so that once those resources are in place in differentiated the extent possible that they enable the sorts of shifts in resources that you all aspire to so thinking about you know what is the vision for what that looks like what flexibility must exist and how does allocation of resources need to look differently to enable that

[01:13:00]
we aspire to come back to be able to share some of the actual findings with you once we've done some of the initial analysis but I'll pause here for any questions about how we've designed the work in Phase One any questions that were testing or just other comments or wondering board members do you have any questions I have a question so this is board member thank you for being here tonight and for assisting our state this is great I just have a question in the diagnostic side when you're looking at the challenges is the challenges also sort of weighing where the difficulty comes in from the barrier from like maybe down from the state and the way that money moves from the FED State down because I think we need to really outline where those challenges and barriers might also kind of impede our ability to be flexible correct

[01:14:00]
yeah that's a great question thank you for asking that and absolutely and then much of the question around capacity to differentiate resources is about understanding the constraints that you all have in the system both because of state level funding levels State policies other constraints that sort of create barriers in some cases or at least constrain the way that flexibility plays out and so yes I think that is part of the work that we're trying to do is to understand what those conditions look like currently and potentially set you all up to engage in conversations about what might need to look different in the future because I it seems like a struggle I know New Mexico is kind of this weird State because we run on 12-month budgets with the legislature which I think is just insanity but that's just what we do and so I know that there's several constraints in terms of just the administrative

[01:15:00]
oceans of how quickly money moves through the pipeline and by the time it gets down to us you know what's that constraint in terms of the time that's actually hitting our books to the time that we actually have to spend it so I think it would be really helpful to know some of those especially as a board member those would be the kinds of things that we would be able to take back at a legislative level or at a state level so that we could also push back or we could also Advocate on specific administrative changes that might need to take place to help us be more flexible that's the number one concern that I hear from Staffing is that by the time the money hits It's kind of there's the it just gets really wonky in terms of the time and the amount of time they have to spend it thank you thank you any other questions or comments I'm curious from looking at the other

[01:16:00]
search that you've been involved with and it's definitely an impressive list I'm curious about what process you've used or what results you see with them for getting really authentic feedback just you know it's one of those things when entities come in to look at the system it's that balance between using your expertise and experience that you come with but also not having preconceived conclusions already drawn about what you're going to see how you interpret what you see so I'm just sort of curious in your experience and other districts what you've done to serve work through with people to have a really honest appraisal and understanding of that district and thank you for that question as well I think we see the the value of of having some of that experience and other

[01:17:00]
ask questions of the data that we see and engender that sort of discussion we sometimes you know think about that the information we have to help Benchmark or to help sort of pressure test where there might be opportunities to look a little bit deeper in one District's context but absolutely I think one of the things we've learned over the years is how unique every every every district is and how communities are asking for different things from their district and and those are important aspects to understand how to move forward to say this is what we've seen in other system do or have you thought about this you know we recognize that ultimately the decisions that you all need to make must be grounded in the context that you're operating and so we normally bring those in conversation to some of these shout outs just to provide context

[01:18:00]
I look forward to hearing more as we move on thank you anyways but when it comes to I know you said you work with over 50 major districts across the country so when you're looking at the student base budget how has that positively impacted in these districts student outcomes I mean what have you seen like a significant Improvement in student outcomes I think that's the million-dollar question that the systems ask themselves so I don't have a great answer there is not been a lot of well done research on SBB as a soulmate

[01:19:00]
and creating a system that allocates dollars on needs a loan will not change outcomes I think we feel pretty confident about that where we've seen systems improve outcomes and we have you know anecdotal Data Systems we've worked with Denver for example as a system that we've spent a lot of time so supporting over the years that has seen pretty significant improvements and you know declines over there history as well but I think what we have learned is that so much of the impact that students ultimately C is in how those systems allow resources to change as a result of that it's how well piece of that theory of action that we shared so not probably a super satisfying answer but I think that drives a lot of our belief around what else needs to be true in a system in order for a funding

[01:20:00]
I really think you know this is this is an example of a removing of a barrier to create the conditions for that success and for the students and and creating space for school leaders to have you know the autonomy to make decisions about how they're using their funding or you know as an example but what I'm really thinking of this in terms and and what what is saying as well as this is one component of an overall goal of of student Improvement that I think it's really important to name is not you know that's not one is not going to do is not going to happen without the other and I mean I know it's not just one thing that will help improve student outcomes but somebody out there is doing a dissertation maybe they should study

[01:21:00]
play what you have done the districts that you've worked in and see what they've what they've seen I think that would be you know helpful just when I'm looking at your Diagnostic and were you know you're grounded in the vision and then you redesign and you know align the needs to the strategies and then you see at the bottom that you're saying it'll create better student experiences and student outcomes in APS will improve so that's that's your hope but not necessarily you can't just prove that that's happened but that's just what you believe and hope does happen correct yeah I think we can point to systems that have seen student Improvement and we notice that there are certain aspects of their funding system that do aligned to those principles of effective funding design but the the other direction I think is something that is harder to to prove and

[01:22:00]
what the different roles are on the page that has stakeholders and rolls and you look at the you know working group in the cabinet and then you look at APS and staff and the collective bargaining groups and students and families and I just think student and family should have a bigger you know kind of a bigger say but it's pretty equal to collective bargaining groups so how do you come up with deciding what kind of rules each of these groups stakeholders have I think we often look to the system and you know if you want to jump in here as well I think it starts with understanding your decision making Frameworks as they exist now so who you know how do you think about who's your in provider who who is ultimately your recommender so we've shared

[01:23:00]
one of the things we find successful is having a cross-functional working group that is a sort of voice of recommendation up to a leadership but that multiple groups including students families you know collective bargaining units all have a sizeable input role so that's how we thought about it but we leave on sort of what the individual districts have done in the past we know that you've recently gone through a strategic planning engagement process and so we're all so leaning on what that process looks like for you all as well to inform that rent would you add anything about how we thought about this today so we're still working out some of these groups so definitely we definitely want to put these are just you know kind of drafted from

[01:24:00]
cuz we haven't had a chance to put that together yet we're working on that so your input is greatly appreciated thank you thank you any other questions or discussion on this this part I should say no okay I'll let you continue next okay period

[01:25:00]
FY 23 and what we're doing of course we're in our we're in the middle of our fiscal year end processes in Mahalo and her team are working on summer payroll Charter billing payroll and billing accruals any final cleanup needed to close out the year and of course this all leads to our final year in Billing once FY 23 is closed we will be able to give an update on actuals and this happens the first week in August so we will have made updates to our budget is we've made updates to our budget website which is visible to everyone and we have our budget presentations on there and are proof budget documents posted Renee home sorry one of our senior analysts is close to having our FY 23 budget book ready to publish on the website and

[01:26:00]
we do that we will give you will send you the link so that you can know that that's available and we are also reviewing our next our budget board policy present on our August 4th presentation next is our FY 24 budget timeline we have posted our budgets until BMS and hope to have PDS approval by this Friday so that we can post the budgets and so that they are available July 1st we continue to the left it's always down to the wire yeah yeah I'm still in that process and so

[01:27:00]
24 budget timeline correct I lost track of where I was okay so our budget yeah we as you know and we had we're working with the RS project management team and this as they continue to assess our data to see how we can move to a student based budgeting system and we meet with them weekly and we continue to attend a genomics webinars to stay current with all that is happening in districts Nationwide and run it has no received her certification in education Finance from Georgetown University so congratulations renette and being part of this group has really helped me to have a place to discuss issues that are facing all of us in education finance and knowing that we are all facing similar things next as we move on

[01:28:00]
25 budget planning these are some of the items that we have on our radar the S4 funds will no longer be available and we've mentioned you know the answer Cliff so we really put a lot of time and effort into that and then we have the phase 5 Fine Arts expansion which will cost about 1.8 million and the way that's on our radar is we will be probably lobbying for legislation so that this would be covered through this EG instead of us having to find other funds to be able to do that the Panorama software renewal which is about 742,000 + 118,000 which is the Emperor software which cost about $14,470.00

[01:29:00]
learning of 1.8 million the computer devices that we've had one-to-one technology initiatives which costs about 10.5 million will have to see how how we can continue that or of a variation of that and then of course the IRS student based budgeting the phase 3 costs and then we are going through the Erp implementation which will cost about 20 million dollars but that is going to be we plan to have that the panic button continue services but it has to be in on all these have to be on our radar anyhow just in case any parts of it will affect the operational budget next can we pause real quick I think we're going to shift gears with these next few slides I just want to ask

[01:30:00]
question specific to the computer devices the one-to-one has there been any additional conversation or I don't know if any of it I don't know if you'll know if someone else on staff are we going to continue it 1:21 now that we're we have completely transitioned out of covid are we seeing those devices still needed is it specific schools where we add on that is that appropriate question at this time I think that is something that we're looking into and I don't know Richard would like to chime in on this but yeah we're definitely know that they'll probably have to be a variation of that but I don't know what discussions we just want to add on a little bit because when we first talked about when we last talked about 1:21 I asked a question around the theory of change for how to use of Technology relates to student learning and the answer was that to come in the plan so I'm curious if you could just sort of an amendment to help

[01:31:00]
question is how this fits into the Strategic plan and student outcomes thank you for this questions Gonzalez and tap your Romero so with respect to this particular budget item it's important to know that prior to the pandemic there were already Arctic technology was in a barely difficult State the schools for years between classroom technology displays for meeting Etc teacher technology devices question mark

[01:32:00]
so around I'm going to say 2005 or so there was a big investment into technology and then that amount of investment it kind of tailed off and schools and students just we didn't have up-to-date technology so the pandemic was a huge challenge but it also brought a significant amount of additional funding so that we've been able to catch up with that kind of Legacy technical technological debt and keeping up with it in the future will require us to have to make some decisions about whether we want to maintain what we have or not the teachers have now one of the things that we're doing now it's not

[01:33:00]
1214 for students is ensuring that each of our staff have a device that is less than 5 years old because slow devices that don't work when you want them to create frustration and Stress and Anxiety which reduces Effectiveness so so with respect to the funding we had a big investment it kind of was tailing off I'm sure you've also those of you who have been around for a while and heard the complaints about having really old devices and things not working but the stimulus was a bit of a blessing in disguise which I'll just catch up but we're going to a few years now we're going to have to decide whether we're going to maintain

[01:34:00]
with respect to the theory of action behind one to one and other technology in the classroom the I wouldn't say that we have a document listed there per se that providing a kid a computer is going to be the Silver Bullet that changes everything but for our staff and sharing that they are able to do their job with the minimum of frustration is kind of a key theory of action for updating the stuff stuff and then also ensuring that there is a classroom display that is working and suitable for them to display whatever curriculum that they are trying to impart to the to the students is also valuable but I do think that that is going to be a future question as to

[01:35:00]
you know whether this community and with your leadership also would like us to educate students using computers so that they kind of are prepared for whatever prepared for using that in the workplace and the world in the future or whether we should not do one to one for all of our grade levels and you know maybe have some grade levels where it's you know paper and pencil and white boards and stuff so I don't know if that totally answers the question other than saying like technology is a tool to do something else it's not an end of itself and what we're doing with respect to the devices is to provide the students and the teachers the tools they need to educate the kiddos and if it turns out in the pandemic it was critical to have the one-to-one across all three levels but if it turns

[01:36:00]
kids that are 1:21 is not quite what's most useful then we will also be considering A reduced ratio or some other mechanism so I don't know so that would like to add to that is you know we had a discussion a few years ago and I mentioned and that it was costing the district about 23 to 25 million dollars a year to maintain the technology that we had just to maintain just kind of hang on and that was on an extended rotation that we were doing every three years we're holding some devices up to five years and six years and as you see how many devices from 20 years ago that people are hiding because they don't want to let him go and we do have a choice of capital funding most of the money comes from the capital and we met we know we have seven billion dollars in need

[01:37:00]
the buildings so we may have to talk about do we want to shift the last time I talked to Dr Bowman he thought the cost on maintaining the devices as it stands and trying to keep it to one-to-one was about 41 million dollars a year and that's that's been about 6 months so it may be more one of the things I have been really pressing at the state level is the concept of they need to start thinking about this technology is something needs to be funded maybe not entirely by all the cities okay because it's it is the new tool and the last week when I wasn't able to join in Chicago and I was telling the big part of the discussion was about Ai and the tools that are coming out that the students have access to and you know I really embrace it I think it's if we don't jump into this and really get our heads into how we're going to use this and help the kids use it then we're just creating

[01:38:00]
of citizens who are not going to have the same access we're not going to have the same tools it shouldn't be the blender so the third option as I see it is getting the tools in their hands and then getting the training in place so our teachers know how to use it effectively and ethically and I think that's what's going to pair kids better they had some great visuals they had some great ideas and honestly you know we're behind and it's not APS it's the nation and education is always behind on this stuff but we're going to I Really embrace it but I do think it's something that's going to be a future generation of the board and the district are going to have to face is how are you going to invest in it and the taxpayers may have to accept that do they want to do that and we know tax rate increase you know it's going to take that much longer because that's

[01:39:00]
675 million in Broadband that came out of the federal government yesterday you know what I find so fascinating about that is it's not everywhere even in Albuquerque it's not everywhere and to me I think we need to ship the Paradigm of how we think about Broadband it needs to be considered a utility you know right now you got private businesses out there running it and they only run it where they can make money but it is a vital part of life now and I think the technology is just that's it we have changed in education we're going to have to accept it we're going to have to move forward and that's going to have to have this conversation that Dr Bowman mentioned there so just let me know that's where it stands in terms of capital and potential costs and honestly I love that they're having the conversations about AI because that's something that has been on the Forefront which and everything else that starting

[01:40:00]
I got teachers need to be fully aware of what it is what the purpose is and how it can be used in both methods positive and negative because I'm sure it can get twisted in the classroom as well what was intended to be a really awesome tool could cause our students not to have the proper learning that we're wanting them to have so I'm glad there's that conversation taking place when she said that was like Hey you know but I feel like I'm going to contradict myself here I would hope that we would kind of steer away from the devices from kinder first second you know and not having that screen time not having the tablets because they need to be able to have that interaction when we talked about social-emotional development like that is part of it not being in front of a device and a tablet that is prohibiting them from fully getting that rich thriving

[01:41:00]
so my opinion would be that we would shift from the younger children from using those obviously we know our high schoolers need them you know for projects and everything that they're focusing on but not early childhood folks just my opinion so it's more than just your opinions to hear a reference to differentiating between young children and you know by 3rd 4th 5th grade the need increase period

[01:42:00]
cleaning the students and try to understand what they need and then provide them that so we absolutely have heard and you know if you go into Elementary School classrooms I guarantee you they're not staring at a computer all day maybe a 30 minutes an hour maybe there's a block where they rotate in I'm using stations or something like that but it's absolutely not all the time and I would just trust that are Educators there are using a being a age appropriate for the students in Provo just one follow-up I think this is a case where we need to not let assessment Drive how we teach what we know is sound practice should be driving with assessments we use and I know with with the youngest children months of times the desire to have devices and every student's hand is because we are assessing them hugely

[01:43:00]
with that method and so I think this is something that Educators really need to step forward and say let's make sure that good practice is driving assessment not vice versa especially when it comes to the use of devices have one thing is on the face five the Fine Arts expansion if I heard you correctly correct me I hope I didn't is that is going to really be dependent on what we get from Santa Fe or we can have to figure out how to find that one point eight million dollars and take it from somewhere else yikes yes so this is one of the things that we're thinking about right it's these are all just items that are kind of like I mentioned on our radar that we need to start looking at and

[01:44:00]
hoping that ideally it would be funded again like this year they did give some funding towards the fine arts program and we're hoping that that will happen again if not we would have to reassess at that time so we'd have to see you know we'd have to look at the budget as a whole and then just see it doesn't mean that we would cut that or that but we would have to find the funding for it okay I mean cuz I just think that's very important to kids like I just be good essential to have that at every Elementary School no matter where it is so that would be something I know this year was it that they had received about a million dollars is that what the Fine Arts I think that's about what they got so even if they got that next year we still wouldn't it wouldn't cover it down

[01:45:00]
but you know hopefully we've been given you know different types of Grants and different funding has come our way so we're hoping that even if it isn't in the CG maybe it would come through another rent or some other way but yeah it's it's definitely on our radar we're just keeping all these costs because of course with us or Cliff you know all that money is going away and we can't rely on that anymore and so where is up to date we always say oh we didn't get enough money for that let's use that one so you know when it's been an easy go to and so that's going to be a little bit scary to just kind of reevaluate where we are once again with no additional funding cuz we had said that we want those resources to be at all of our schools that it's all done period schools are getting so

[01:46:00]
that's not fair thank you thank you okay let's get back on track go ahead I'm sorry another question around items on the radar so when we approve the budget one of the things that doctor said we don't talk about was a program on it and we talked a little bit about specific programs foundations read 180 Etc but a broader look at what's working and what's not working with the potential to reallocate resources away from what's not working toward what is and so my question is what's the time frame for that and that may be a doctor's appointment or maybe for you all but I'm just curious like when white we have a sense of the potential for some reallocation I don't think she got the question she was talking to doctor so my expectation is that would not happen this is a design year with the Strategic plan to

[01:47:00]
but I think this is where we begin to look at that and see what can we read weed out and this would be the year to try to figure out what we could get rid of but she may answer more that's okay so my question was during the budget presentation and conversation we talked a little bit about a program audit for lack of a better word but looking at the effectiveness and return on investment of some programs that we've historically invested in and I mentioned foundations and read 180 is a couple of examples but there are a variety of other things that we're looking at for the potential to maybe reallocate resources away from what's not working to improve student outcomes towards what could potentially increase student outcomes so my question was like what's the time frame for when we might actually be able to reallocate resources so Madam chair and board member Gonzalez we have done an initial audit with the curriculum and instruction Department regarding what schools are using how they're using

[01:48:00]
certain programs within our district and have cut out non-renewed certain programs that have maybe been site based only and so were you just funding for one or a group of sites versus you know we're looking at how do we as a system engage in the needs of what the students need and then the teachers through programming for example and a reading intervention we don't want these schools using one reading intervention and then be schools using another because as a district when we're you know looking at that date we can't compare and that doesn't help inform our decisions and so we have done that initial audit I know that we were going to do some program evaluation when it comes to foundations and reading and Joyce Gormley may have more to speak to that

[01:49:00]
details of it but I know that it is something that we are working on and we did have the initial breakdown of what each of our district adopted high-quality instructional materials are in every grade level and content area so that it's clear to people what we're using should be using and and then looking again at what what are those additional pieces that we've I guess they were referred to as passion projects possibly that are not getting the outcomes that were looking at other things programs when we look at you know even Community Schools Avid those types of of initiatives you know we're really looking at how we investing in these initiatives how are they being implemented within each school and we have begun I can speak to

[01:50:00]
play we've begun to put some commitments in place recommends for schools and principals to commit to doing certain things to ensure program Fidelity because we don't want to fund something if the leadership isn't there to support it it won't be effective and it won't work so we're we're looking at this stuff very carefully as it is one example I can't speak to read 180 and fundations it was really more a question of time frame and so it sounds like big issues might not be on the radar necessarily for FY 25 budget but it's coming yes and again like renette and I speak pretty frequently about you know how are we how are we utilizing the resources that we have how is it aligned to the budget and student outcomes when we look at our

[01:51:00]
you know there's a lot of really exciting work happening right now with how we're reorganizing and and putting human capital in place to more keenly address each goal so with that there's going to be a lot more collaboration interdepartmental to achieve I think what we have put in place and so I think as we continue to move forward that's it's not on our radar anymore we're invested in it we're doing it it's going to take some time but we are absolutely doing it and we're not we're not allowing programs products to be implemented within the district without first the approval of the assistant suit for cni so we're putting some things in place so we can truly see what what we're doing how we're doing it if it's

[01:52:00]
is it sustainable funding and is it related to student outcomes period thank you thank you okay page 19 Madam chair yes we had teased you with some of these graphs prior and decided not to to show it until this presentation so we brought it back with a few more slides so this first slide is I didn't know if I needed to say next we have the Nationwide trend from the national Center of Education statistics which is a compilation of all the school districts showing what we are seeing Nationwide enrollment on this particular drop over I mean overall it's a 3% enrollment drop in while the step is staying with flat or slightly increasing and so on the next slide

[01:53:00]
now we are showing the economic scrap from Lubbock school districts which we see is quite similar to what you'll see on the next slide for APS which but this one is slightly more exaggerated so I thought it was kind of shows you know the ups and downs a little better than ours but it's similar in that the staffing has stayed relatively flat while then roll my is down 14% And this was shown in buy a genomics as a good example of where they have made some changes to staff and it's starting to Trend down from a higher growing employee ratio that we saw so this is kind of like what you kind of want to see is them starting to kind of go at least in the same direction on the next one is

[01:54:00]
APS is Trend so we are and and these graphs where I'll use the same template cuz it was provided to us by a genomics so that we can compare District to District even if the district sizes very greatly so our staffing has also stayed relatively flat why are enrollment is down 18% over the last decade and so in the next slide I just want to describe kind of why we may be seeing some of this and so the good thing is we saw that we're trending down right at least we're turning down as the same following the same as the enrollment but why is it not like closer and one of you know some of the factors are that it's not a one-to-one ratio write a loss of a student does not equal to a loss of

[01:55:00]
and also even with the student loss it's not always in the same grade levels so we still need to keep a teacher right and we may lose just a few students everywhere and student loans may be at different schools and then also expanded programs require additional FTE example the Fine Arts expansion and so we also have had an increase in special education students and this sometimes requires you know a more one-to-one like educational assistance and then APS may receive a grant that will require to run the program like the msap grant the magnet schools grants and in the tops models we also gave additional FTE because you know that we just felt that it was needed for support so those are some of the reasons why even though

[01:56:00]
starting to Trend in the right direction and you know it's not really close and actually Nationwide we viewed a lot of the graphs from all of the districts and some a lot of the districts are actually going in polar opposite you know they're going this way so we're doing pretty good in at least we're starting to Trend in the right direction in the next slide okay we have our three-year-old projected Revenue so on this Revenue it's kind of complicated right because it has all these items in the First Column that affect the scg so what I did in order to do my projection I just

[01:57:00]
is the variables that I know about right so so this is the prediction that is on historical Trends where I have made the adjustments the basic education is that first line and I projected that we would have a 3 percent decrease in our basic educated generated units which has been the trend so in that first line if you look at the generated units 89,000 and it goes down to 86 and 84 that's that 3% decrease I'm also projecting an increase in our unit value which has also been a trend this year we saw the unit volume increase by 13% for FY 2257 increase taking it from 6241 to 6678

[01:58:00]
and then the increase for FY 26 was a little less at 4% increase unit value and the reason I still feel that there's going to be increases is because the state is still has a strong position due to our gas and oil the state but it'll eventually start to Plateau as we saw in Prior years and if we 15 through fy19 it was kind of flat and I feel that way 26 is kind of going to be our Peak and where we start to Plateau so next slide is a three-year projected expenditures so in the expenditures we know that in FY 2525 it's going to grow significantly increase it by 7% and the reason why I

[01:59:00]
set up is to 7% is including some of the things that are going to have to come back onto operational from the other funds so I included I looked at all the items that I knew for sure we're going to come on took that dollar amount and then gave it a percentage and applied that percentage at 7% and then an FY 26 I figured it's probably going to settle down a little bit and I only increased it by 3% which is normal or inflationary costs so then on the next slide I put them together what is the three-year projected Revenue minus expenditures and so it really doesn't look pretty but we know that we can make adjustments to improve the budget outcome so just by looking at this this is if we

[02:00:00]
hidden absolutely nothing this is what it would look like and if some of you may recall and back and if we 20 we faced a 45 million deficit and we were able to Pivot and come out okay so I I'm not harmed by this I mean I it gives me gives us directions knowing that we have to make some changes but it's it's not as bad as it could be and as some of the other school districts that we've seen that have in the hundreds of millions potential difference so in the next slide is a list of some of the items that we've identified as potential savings and of course you know we're going to be looking a lot more than this but this is just like some of the quick things that we thought of to limit and restrict travel to create technology

[02:01:00]
efficiencies in streamline our processes and looking at the long-term vacancies and just really question have we have these dudes been absorbed by other ftes and are they no longer needed look at any redundancies Explorer voluntary bike back of annual sick leave at a reduced rate some of the other districts are doing that as we saw at Rio Rancho's is looking at that and then of course work with leadership to identify programs that should be funded and programs that may be possibly eliminated as a spoke to and in the Enterprise fun moving some of the expenditures out of operational into the right now we kind of do most in operational and the Enterprise funds kind of supplemented do it the opposite have them use their

[02:02:00]
and then continue the work with the right sizing committee so the next slide yeah let's pause right there only cuz we're going to switch gears again when we get to Esser do we have any questions related to this or anything about the suggestions for potential savings any discussion on that board member Jackson I see your hand sorry I don't know how long that's been up know I it just went up and I actually had a question it was back on the the three-year projection for expenditures and you mentioned the one right before that yeah right there you mentioned that there you you did the 7% because you're anticipating some expenditures are going to be moved back into operational and I was just wondering if you could give us some idea as to

[02:03:00]
what some of those expenditures might be that have currently are being covered by Sr but that we are going to have to potentially absorb into operational and doesn't have to be an exhaustive list I'm just curious what some of those are that's a great question and that's exactly some of the items that are on those on our radar some of those are some of the like the Ingenuity software that's currently paid out of the Panorama is going to be paid out of if they're so some of those are already some of the items that were looking at some is mostly software and we do have a few of tea that will be coming back but amazingly it's not but too many it's about 2 million dollars worth of 15 so it's

[02:04:00]
it's mainly software that has been purchased recently that potentially is going to come on to operational correct and and around the 7% expense like all of those are about 7% so that's where you got that 7% from yeah well 3% of it is is the normal increase that we get every year about a 3% and so it's adding about 4% more from the answer okay good well I'm happy to know that you guys are looking forward and not reacting it seems like this is a proactive approach instead of a reactive so I appreciate appreciate that you have looked into that

[02:05:00]
one one comment I guess is I am not at all Disturbed to see that there's a higher ratio of staff to students because and I'm not sure how that actually has played out in terms of class size and actual number of students in front of Any Given teacher at any given time but when we talk about social emotional well-being there's nothing more important than being able to really support that the relationship between educator and student and so I'm not distressed about the number now I am distressed about the potential going forward and but that don't mean for loss of Staff okay let's go to move on to Esser thank you so next is just a quick update on answer of course these are our areas of focus unfinished learning for 79.

[02:06:00]
6 million social and emotional at 5.1 million technology 20 million facility projects 22.9 million safe operations for school 75.2 million and other which includes the indirect costs and Charter Schools is 37.9 million and then those little bullet points are just a few of the projects that fall in those buckets and then the next slide when you just take a first glance at least from my point of view the first one is seeing the remaining budget of 50.5 million in unfinished learning and the 68.6 million in safe operations school but I do want to let you know that all of this these funds have been earmarked and with each presentation that we come back and give these

[02:07:00]
updates you will start to see the remaining balance will shrink and the expended expenses and encumbered columns will begin to increase as you know they are earmarked all of the funds are your marked it just is in the process of just the timing right now when I pull this data as of 622.23 you know pose haven't gone in place and that kind of thing but everything is earmarked I just wanted to point that out I mean to me it kind of stands out as being a possible red flags so with that I'll stand for

[02:08:00]
updating you awesome thank you Miss Apodaca thank you Miss Montoya so Marie look at this okay our next finance committee meeting will be held on Wednesday July 26th at 5:15 or immediately following the audit committee meeting at the John Miller Community boardroom at Allison brewski educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard Northeast or virtually at aps.edu so this meeting is now adjourned it'll be immediately followed with a special Board of Education meeting thank you everyone okay so we're going to go ahead and call this meeting to order so welcome to the Board of Education special board meeting Dr Albert me have a real call please thank you Crystal here so our

[02:09:00]
is item for consideration action is adoption of the June 28th 2023 special Board of Education meeting agenda we have a motion place and I'll move for it for approval of the June 28th 2023 special Board of Education media meeting agenda with the removal of for a 561920 and 21 okay so I'll have to have a second this is Crystal second world cup please in the past when we got committee reports from others within the committee vote the entire action on actions

[02:10:00]
were presented as part of a consent calendar and so there is only a single vote and I I mean I certainly respect The Descent of Any Given board member and I think that's important but it's reflected in the committee report I'm just curious about whether procedurally we have to vote on it separately again in the regular board meeting I don't think that was passed practice I'm going to ask our parliamentarian Courtney because I know she's been keeping up with this but if we did approve this in the finance committee because we've already taken the votes in the finance committee the actions were already taking all we're bringing before forward now to the special is just the consent and it's just going to be that calendar and it will be noted in the finance committee that there was a no vote

[02:11:00]
put on some of these so are we just voting that these are the items that were discussed and we're just taking the action there is the same yeah I agree with board member Peterson that it's reflected in the committee vote and it doesn't need to be it's like redundant redundant in so I don't need to be pulled out separately and what we're doing on this too is I'm looking at my agenda here at the first item was just adoption of the June 28th 2334 of Education meeting agenda the second item is going to be the consent calendar so on the first is just the adoption of the June 28th 2334 Board of Education meeting agenda do I have a motion just for approval of the agenda I move we accept the agenda or the special board meeting

[02:12:00]
1528 South 2nd this is Josefina may have a roll call on the agenda approval I have a question and then so then if we're proving the meeting agenda it's with the consent already on there cuz that's part of the agenda but since this is a new I will just disagree with member Jackson that this is where we have to pull off something off of consent and since this is a brand new meeting that all you require is one person to be able to remove something from but our next item for consideration action is the consent calendar and we could have a consideration for approval of items for the finance committee that's where the consenting that's where that where that motion would come the first motion is just simply for the agenda I defer to you change anything in the agenda it must be changed at the vote of the agenda not

[02:13:00]
in the body of the meeting so we can just go ahead and we have emotion on the floor with board member Mueller out of go and taking the items off do we have a second on that cuz that was the first motion that was made okay so let's take a vote on that we'll see where we stand let's take a boat no Brittany Jackson no cuz I think it's redundant Toyota is consideration for approval of the items poop by the finance committee on June 28th 2023 I have emotion on that please I just don't I don't understand how we don't it's just that we do I don't understand how I can't remove something from consent

[02:14:00]
we just took a vote on it for me because the way I understand it is you would remove it from consent to have a discussion about it but we've already had the discussion committee so all that this consent calendar is voting on is items that were approved in the finance committee meeting and all of these items even though there was a decent all of these items have already been approved in the finance committee so that's what the consent calendar is is mainly verifying dot this is what came forward from the committee and so it doesn't have to be voted on again like you don't want to remove it from the consent because you're not you're not going to have another discussion on it

[02:15:00]
so I think you're a verification you're just saying because it passed in committee that's why we would leave it the same as consent if it didn't pass in committee then we would have pulled it and voted on that but I think just the confusion for board members we had it done that previously so that's probably where the and I think we're just trying to get ourselves in alignment with what actual parliamentary procedure is so it is my understanding that we are correct all the board member Gonzalez is reminding me that what the vote was just now is that we voted that we don't have an agenda so now we have to vote on an agenda that because we voted against the agenda so she is so I will move for adoption of the June 28th 2023 special Board of Education meeting agenda please this is to leave the agenda as it is correct thank you

[02:16:00]
Paragon I don't even know what I'm voting for so I can't even vote the vote is to leave the agenda and changed with the consent are you just abstaining I will because I know that's not true I did talk to you before because I had a feeling this was going to happen and I talked to a professional parliamentarian who said the finance committee is a totally different meeting then this meeting and only one person can choose to take something off cuz it's a totally different meeting it's not a continuation of the previous meeting so I will that's just what I was told okay so your boat okay Jackson

[02:17:00]
