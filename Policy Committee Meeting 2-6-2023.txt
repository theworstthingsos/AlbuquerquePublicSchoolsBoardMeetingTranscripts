[00:01:00]
item for consideration and action is consideration for approval of revisions to board policy II special education this is a discussion action item and we have Miss TC Riser policy analyst for the Board of Education Services office and Anitra atler associate superintendent for special education you have the floor good evening chair Gonzalez members of the board and superintendent Elder the first item is on the agenda on page 5 of your electronic handouts the policy II special education is updated to reflect current law updates to administrative positions and references this is this is a discussion action item and Associate superintendent in nature atler is here to assist with any questions thank you board members is there a motion or a second or any questions I have one this is Barbara I think any of us can look at this and say yes this is exactly

[00:02:00]
the way that it should be and this may be a discussion that carries over into the procedural directive but as I look at this my my biggest concern is is it doable do we have the staff and the resources and I think one of the things that came up as we were in the in Santa Fe and having discussions now we are only reimbursed by 14% when the Federal Credit Union

[00:03:00]
turn up us redoing our administrative procedures is really looking at incorporating the policy diet that was recommended and also looking at the idea lawn state laws and how could we best serve all of our students in incorporating all of these together if you looked at our policies and procedures in the past we're looking about about 90 pages of procedures most of those if not all of them were based on idea law and in New Mexico so we didn't want to just reiterate the law over and over if we were following it so many of these that we have are already in place which you'll notice that is different in this new policy III is it will be supported by a manual of administrative procedures this was a recommendation from the great City Schools when they came out to audit our department and I believe it was 2018 I think one of their procedures

[00:04:00]
so this manual has been in place has been something that the department has been working on for the past several years when we got the direction to revisit all of our policies and procedures we did focus on completing this manual that will drive the work that we do in the department and really support the teachers in the work that we do with the students so this is a dress that you guys know that we are working on it it is not ready for it to be reviewed quite yet it is with our legal counsel but it will support all of the work that we are doing in the department and something that we will be able to sustain moving forward and really got the gutter Department in the direction I know one of the big concerns that came up with that audit was not having procedures in writing getting mixed messages from different people serve a constant state of flux and

[00:05:00]
lack of clarity about what really what real policy was so do you feel like this will be a big step moving forward on that yes ma'am I believe that this will help drive us in that direction it's been in collaboration with the Union the teachers union we've worked with our instructional Council so the special education department does have our own set of instructional Council so we have a teachers structural Council a what are the best service animals so we are reaching out for communication when we're looking at communication and how are we reaching out our department is doing that work to get feedback so we have collaborated with them and you're right they are looking for some some good guidelines to guide the work that we do so that it's a consistent message to best support our students and schools I expect to be as as the procedural directive is really developed there will be more ongoing

[00:06:00]
I'll make a motion to to approve the revisions to the board policy for special education I just okay I'll just I'll stop there and then I just I just had if that was okay if I could I know when I apologize for being late I lost my phone I have a question I have some questions though so I know that you all responded to some of the questions that I did I did have but I just wanted some follow up so when it comes to I know the response to my question about underrepresentation of giftedness so what you said basically is that there really wasn't that everybody who was supposed to be who was identified was gifted

[00:07:00]
so I got I got that so the part that I was confused about cuz it says that there are certain populations that don't have to be addressed as it relates to addressing over representation of certain populations so can you tell me who are those populations that don't have to be addressed when it comes to over-representation so is it the students with cultural differences linguistic differences so lower STS and disabling conditions is that what you want so then the other question that kind of didn't get didn't get answered and what I was trying to get to when I was talking about children that are in special that are in special ed classes is that what I believe that

[00:08:00]
I would see if we really look deeper is that there would be an over-representation of those populations that you just said right before presentation in special ed so that would be the case we are working on creating or updating a database so you'll see it on the special education internalization or visualization this year so that it can you will be able to see all of that current data for income the interim data points so that we can really do a better job at aligning the work that we're doing to support students and resume okay so my concern is always that there is an over-representation of those of those children in special ed and maybe not so much in gifted

[00:09:00]
but what you said is the kids at work supposed to be in gifted they are so so then my other question I guess about the gifted programs is they seem I guess they're going to rewrite kind of what it is to be gifted and you don't you don't have that yet correct right there's currently there's legislation on there in the process of looking at the it's called the town and that's the manual for for gifted in is probably right now but they are looking at how we are going to identify and serve students with giftedness so they are looking at possibly bringing back factors and other other other areas of representing students who could possibly be gifted articulating that correctly so is there going to be and I know you probably can't really speak to this is there going to be

[00:10:00]
lowering a standards is there going to be like a 360 degree change of the definition of what it is to be gifted I did have it in front of me so they are looking at the cultural and linguistic factors that go into how we could qualify students for gifted in New Mexico giftedness it is it falls under the special education umbrella but it's not something that we receive idea funds for the funding for so they are looking at how we qualify students I know that it's a conversation that we've had this past year with some of our different groups and do we look at some of their language factors would there be different points that we would use to address those so they are in the process of looking at that and how we're going to address different factors for students but we don't have all this

[00:11:00]
with that include like the language so if you don't speak and I mean I know I've said this before I've been in school before where there were children who the majority of them spoke Spanish and there wasn't a gifted program for the there was a gifted program for them so is that something that perhaps they would address because I don't believe that a child who speaks another language can't be gifted and they can be gifted academically and with all the factors that they look at now that's my opinion from what I've seen in right and I don't want to I don't want to see if you have other information that could help help us with this this is your lawyer she is our executive director of compliance and she may have more information to help us with this but it's my understanding that there will be Factor points or other other pieces that we would develop as a school district that could help us identify

[00:12:00]
attributes that would provide them with those cultural and linguistic barriers maybe in the past that wouldn't qualify them for okay and I guess until we really get that definition we're really not going to know what we're going to be be looking for because I was kind of going you know how do you ensure representation of certain subgroups you know how do you make a child's gifted to address the cultural linguistic you know I mean I have no idea what the answers to those questions are but those are questions that are important and I'm sure I'm assuming they're all looking at those as well so then I think the only one of the other questions I had is I know I was didn't get this one answered is when you were talking about and I understand the you know least restrictive environment

[00:13:00]
what is important for a special ed kids and I know that that's you know with stated here was important for our gifted children to serve them as much as possible in the regular at classroom and I understand that but the question that I want to know is that what the gifted is best for those gifted children and is that what they want and what their parents want I think we look at our students with giftedness in the Continuum of services as we would with our students with the disability that's how we can best provide some of those Services students could be provided those enrichment opportunities with their dead peers while other students need a little bit extra outside of the classrooms maybe need that socialization with their peers so I think we really would look at that individually and look at it as with the Continuum of services about five years ago we did the school in Richmond Model and started that to look at how we can confuse to get to pedagogy into the General Electric classrooms and curriculum we've

[00:14:00]
looking at that it's a little bit different because of funding but the theory behind it and how we're trying to continue to support classrooms and best support students we continue working towards that that model so do you think that there's going to be moved to really do as the majority of it in the regular classroom I don't think so I think it's going to look different with the new legislation I think we really will have to we may have to look at how we're serving students differently I know that our department is working towards already looking at it maybe an alternative protocol would look like to best serve our students so we are trying to move forward with that to really look at how we serve students who have cultural and linguistic diverse backgrounds okay and so then I love the school enrichment model I think it's fabulous because I think everybody needs enrichment and every single child is really good at something and we need to find that

[00:15:00]
but I I hope it isn't the goal and I don't believe it is the goal or the aim to remove gifted programs from those who qualify and just replace it with just the total it isn't okay I didn't I didn't think so but I said I'm just going to ask anyhow anyhow and then I think the last question when you're maybe you would just alluded to it is that we're fostering and appreciation for intellectual and other types of diversity so what on the other types of diversity are you against speaking to cultural and linguistic linguistically responsive and is that what you're talking about when you're talking about other forms of diversity so you're trying to look at that when you're trying to figure out what gifted is yeah that's what you're talking about okay

[00:16:00]
great thank you we have a motion and a second so miss King can I have a roll call vote please give me a little Aragon yes Robert Peterson and Dominguez yes Brittany Jackson yes Danielle Gonzales yes our next item for discussion is presentation of revisions including renaming of administrative procedural directive notice of procedural safeguards to procedural directive for special education mystery and Miss outlier you have before full stop the next item is on page 7 of your documents the procedural doctor for special education is brought for updates to contact a title change administrative Department positions and references this procedural directive has been brought forth as the only remaining procedural director of specific to special education this is a discussion item and Associate superintendent in nature atler will answer questions

[00:17:00]
it's thank you board members are there any questions I do I have a question so when I really like the idea of the manual I think that's great cuz everything's in there the only thing that I was wondering is and there might be a rationale for this why is due process not part of the manual in terms of you know the the process that parents may have around a due process if they're not happy with the situation so within the within the policies and procedures once again idea states that families can use their procedural safeguards through that so within our processes we provide families or procedural safeguards which which follows the state and guide them through the due process and so is that become part of the manual or okay I see you I had knots back there it was just because I was looking at the the Bold headings right I mean and I was just looking for the headings and was just wondering where is that all fit in there I mean I think it's a great idea

[00:18:00]
it's all here but that was the only thing that just kind of struck me a little bit is like how do how do parents you know find that process in there to Define you know what what do I do in the event of something so good evening numbers period and empowered want to make sure that

[00:19:00]
how far will informed and empowered in terms of seeing a transparent a way of doing business and more importantly a way of serving students and families so all of the procedural safeguards are actually the policy directives that currently exists will be included in the manual they won't go away you'll notice that it'll be written in and more everyday language but we will still have the legal Citation for every section that's included in the manual so it's very tedious work I get to do so it's exciting to work with our legal counsel as well as take all the feedback from our special Educators special ed teachers as well as administrative team leaders related service provider

[00:20:00]
and pull it all together into one document we foresee that it will be a living document that as needed it can be updated and accessible again online I love the whole idea of plain language and you know making it really accessible so that's great and I know that a lot of this work is the result of that deep dive with the council a great City schools and the work that they did with our special ed Department over the last couple of years I think it's been a while so I know you guys started before the pandemic but congratulations on finally getting to the point and and you know I look forward to seeing that manual in plain language because I think that will be really really helpful for for soon you know it's also a preparation for them and being able to step through our Manual of operations and into a manual that is of Sandra standard operating Pro

[00:21:00]
naturally occurs over on the DVR side because that's what happens for students when they leave here they go to that and there's a manual that sort of outlines all of the procedures for them as well so it's a great tool I think to get them sort of following that process and knowing that that's what they're going to go look for on the adult side when they when they start to transition in there so congratulations on on getting it done and thank you for answering my question read thank you other questions about I know we have a legal obligation to students who are in private settings and as I look at this just that just for my clarification and understanding so that obligation doesn't go beyond identifying and evaluating and if it's more than that how are those Services delivered and how are we as a district reimburse

[00:22:00]
so we have a child find obligation to those students and families so we will identify them we will write as an IEEE it is in ISD service plan ISP for the students in their in a private school setting so that just identifies that they do have a disability and then they will receive a very very small amount of supports mainly us going out generally and providing very minimal amount on the services we also by law required to provide Financial part of the budget does go to some of the to support for the private school settings so you'll see that in our budgets and that's all based on again some of the idea laws are regulations so we will have within our budgets as well some of our staffing will have

[00:23:00]
private school Liaisons and so even through the 90-day star reporting we are required to make sure that we get everything done through the private school for the private school students as well making sure that it's on time so is there any additional reimbursement that the district receives for that I do not know exactly I don't know enough to have to be able to answer that correctly and I don't want to give you any wrong information I think finding the right diagnostic Cool Tools is going to be in ongoing challenge so that we don't miss identify students who are simply language Learners and at the same time make sure that when their students are language Learners who do have disabilities that were able to correctly identify them and get them the services that they need

[00:24:00]
and I think that's always a challenge both finding the right tool and and supporting Educators in identifying who those children are thank you and we're looking at that with the diagnostic with some of our diagnosticians and digging a little bit deeper to look at is it is it language or is it a disability and and what do we need to do different and how do we dig deep and how do we work through this app process to best support students so we're doing a deep dive analysis with that through our diagnosticians to really look at the number of students were identifying and what we could do different to best support him again before they get into special education disability and then once they're there so we're hoping to we're doing a lot of work in looking at Julia identified students with disabilities who are also language Learners and we'll see a lot more coming out of our department

[00:25:00]
thank you thank you other questions the only thing I would just ask you use the word Shell Shell Shell a lot in in here and I just want to make sure that you have that you had to use the word shell everywhere that it was used we will look at that okay cuz I'm on one of them I thought the manual shall General will be exempt from formatting and I was like will generally I mean I would just look at all those shelves to make sure that in some of them I'm assuming it's really appropriate if you just double check that thank you write any other questions or just one last question what's the time on the is this manual going to be ready for like this next school year is that what our timeline is on that yes ma'am we are in the final processes of getting it all together we're having our legal counsel look over it so that the intention is having it probably done by July to be able to have

[00:26:00]
cabinet in the Board review it and have it ready to be rolled out training and everything else for the for the 2324 school year thank you sorry dot I'm sorry I do regarding you know just like we are concerned about diagnosing by or bilingual children or language different children appropriately I guess I'm asking if if the same applies to behaviors because and things may have changed over the years although I hear the same concerns from constituents sometimes children

[00:27:00]
going through a trauma and they exhibit really difficult behaviors in the classroom and they get put into special education as behaviorally I forget the the the acronym are you still using the same thing that you did at least when I was teaching and so is there an effort to look at that number and with anything we kind of

[00:28:00]
go away at one layer and then there's a layer of something else and so it's like peeling the onion and you feel you find one thing and then there's something else so we're going to continue to to work at that and use data to Driver's decisions really use the data that we're finding to to guide and direct our support to the school to provide continued interventions continued professional development to support the schools in the areas that we're seeing whether it be Behavior interventions reviewing the restraint and seclusion and data that will be doing at the end of the school year to really again the provide intentional support to the schools to dive into that as a department okay yeah and I'd like to raise that as a as an area to to look at based on my own experience and and again what I'm hearing you know sometimes children go through

[00:29:00]
families go through hard times and I know that even though this is many years ago I as a parent I had a child and I felt very pressured to put that child in special education when in fact I knew that this child was going to get over and at the time that child was not reading and was not doing a lot of things that were that other children were in kindergarten and I know that my circumstances Not Unusual and so I would just you know there are children who truly need the services that you all provide and that we this district has worked so hard to to bring together so special

[00:30:00]
the system with children who just need some time so thank you thank you and you said something about the manual is going to be brought to the board right around June July something like that and which then triggered in me a question just right here in the procedural generally be exempt from APS Board of Education formatting requirements for procedural directives in regards to us approving the manual directive does that mean it's just generally if it's a living document and something changes it doesn't have to be brought to the board every time or how does that affect the boards the board process of approval to the board what are the

[00:31:00]
call Crystal attractive states that the superintendent will develop the administrative procedural manual or safeguards so I believe I would bring it to you guys for you guys to be aware of it for you to know what we are developing But ultimately it would be under superintendent Elders guidance to to make sure that we are on top of this manual to make sure that we're doing everything that we need to do it I guess in regards to getting this out to everybody to comply to comply okay but the manual will be brought to us in July yes okay kind is it kind of like the student handbook where it's revised every year or brought to US every year is that kind of the the thought or is it may be a lot of it since it's rooted again in idea it's going to be a living document so there may be some pieces that are changed that are updated procedures and their stuff in here regarding MDA

[00:32:00]
LG MDR processes changes so as we go through the MDR processes they may change look a little bit different the discipline may look a little bit different year to year so as we change it we will definitely bring it back for you guys to to view and one of the difference is is the student handbook is actually approved through the board the manual would be for reviewing discussion and then they can update it as they need to so it wouldn't it would be a living document where's the handbook is a solid document for a year okay thank you so that was the question so the manual is not necessarily a board approved document every year okay okay thank you thank you our next item for discussion wait wait never mind OK Google and archive administrator administrative procedural directives within special education and then we have a long list here so I know Miss Satler you provided

[00:33:00]
play some background and Miss razor as well already so is there anything else you wanted to frame with respect to this agenda item basically just this is a discussion brief and at the discussion brief is on page 11 at least the 29 procedural directives that are recommended for repeal and archived great thank you are there any questions about this if you guys want to go to reach one just kidding right our next item for discussion is agenda item D discussion of proposed amendments to board policy AI academic goals this is a discussion item and we'll come back to the board for approval at the March 1st board meeting so is Riser you have the floor these next seven policies are added to the agenda with the intention of a first read Because this is a first discussion discussion together

[00:34:00]
put these policies do not have all of the recommended suggestions from our departments not all of your thoughts have to be perfectly Wordsmith I'll be working with Dr Segura to help put these together we will review all of your input from tonight's discussion work with the Departments and bring the policies back on March 1st for your review and approval so the first one is AI academic goals that is on page 39 of your 139 of your documents and we are recommending replacing academic plan with strategic plan and instructional framework and this is a discussion item I'll take notes thank you Miss Frazier so as she noted these are as an opportunity for feedback across all of these policies and so I'll just open it up and see does anyone have specific feedback or suggestions for IA academic goals question because it seems like we talked about

[00:35:00]
the importance when we consider policy that we give Community ample opportunity to active feedback and consider what we are considering and I know these are mainly procedural directives some of them are policies but I am curious about why we're moving that up to skip the month for feedback you know the the initial policy procedure that we had talked about on board was to have a First Street have a month to get discussion more thought do any kind of revisions that are needed in the yet another month out so I'm just wondering why what the urgency is for moving it to the March meeting rather than the April meeting so I think it was largely about it's not getting rid of opportunity for feedback that's still we have the February 15th and 22nd I think are the two board

[00:36:00]
15th and 22nd so there are two board meetings to provide opportunity for public comment before we get to the March 1st meeting is there a particular reason why there's urgency with these I think one of them is largely because we're working on the district is working on the Strategic plan right now and so a lot of the work that is in response to the goals that the board is put into place is starting so we have to make sure that our policies are aligned to that are all so in place I mean I was doing probably also because of the goals in the guard rails like to make sure that our policies are aligning to our goals and guardrails as we move quickly forward with that is how I interpret it are there other questions so I'm a little

[00:37:00]
confused Miss writer referred to page 139138 aren't we on the surveys and research conducted in APS is that one got cut from the agenda and her package okay so I'm looking at an old version of okay other questions or comments so can you just so I'm looking at academic goals and so we're changing or we're thinking about changing Public Schools so shall Implement a strategic plan instead of an academic plan is that the main change in it would say a strategic plan and instructional framework aimed at improving academic achievement for all students with an intense focus on closing the achievement Gap okay I got this strategic part that's what I have right now because we made changes after we posted sorry

[00:38:00]
so would you like me to read it again so it currently says Albuquerque Public Schools shall Implement a strategic plan and instructional framework aimed at improving academic achievement for all students with an intense focus on closing the achievement Gap and then so the academic goals the title that will stay the same though okay and is I mean I'm just I know it's like one sentence and it should be so simple but to do something so short and do it really well is harder than writing something that is a whole entire page so I think it's the reminder is that the goal is just setting our vision so if the vision is to improve

[00:39:00]
I think is part of what our goals are around our student outcomes focused governance so I understand the brevity I mean I really do because I think the it's important yeah just so that it's really clear that our vision really is just I don't I don't mind the Strategic plan and instructional framework I think it seems fine to me I mean as a first read you know I think I have to see like all of the the changes in there so that for my perspective as the board member I feel like it captures the essence of what the student outcomes Focus governance is about I mean I think those are around the academic goals I mean I think but what it does not capture for me and is is it just academic goals you know or are we

[00:40:00]
I'm still having like student outcomes so I guess that's where I'm struggling a little bit and I and I have to remember Miss Riser if like under the nmsa you know the the School Board Association or the recommendation on IA is it is it a policy specifically about academic goals is that the requirement I believe it is okay that makes sense I mean the only other thing that I would say is that somewhere in there and maybe nobody will agree with me that we should be talking about student outcomes and that so maybe we should have shall Implement a strategic and strategic plan and instructional framework aimed at improving student outcomes it's just a thought to try to get student outcomes in there somewhere and I'm not sure

[00:41:00]
aimed at improving student outcomes for all students with an intense focus on closing YouTube's or so I had a suggestion I guess and maybe it's a question with an intense focus on closing the achievement Gap and so where do we have to find the achievement gap for Albuquerque Public

[00:42:00]
or does that need to be here in our policy given that we decided to focus our academic goals on the Ozzie Martinez students plus black students so do we need to state that in the procedural directions or do we need to have like a sub bullet that says between English Learners and white students special education and white black all the groups that we prioritized I actually believe that would be in the procedural directive based on your goals okay then I would recommend to be in the procedural directive based on our goals and then my second question was and I think this is sort of similar to what board member of Montoya quarterback was responding to for academic goals should it be just student outcomes or should it also say something related to post-secondary Readiness or life readiness

[00:43:00]
related to postsecondary Readiness and then one related to the skills that prepare students for Life success and then named them so I think it would be something like Albuquerque Public Schools show Implement a strategic plan and academic framework aimed at improving student outcomes with a focus on closing the achievement Gap and improving college career post-secondary and life Readiness or something like that and how others feel about that maybe well it's part of the goal because that's our overall goal is not just to improve student outcomes but to improve life Readiness post-secondary Readiness so the details then would be in the procedural directive so I mean I'm trying to I'm trying to be pragmatic too because these policy directives hopefully sort of span the test of time right it's not just

[00:44:00]
I guess I don't know has been the as the direction been with the district where we changed the policy directors every time we have new board members or is it or is it just have they stood the test of time is that what the the goal is as well so that it's broad enough so that the procedural directive can get more specific and then you can adjust as as maybe adjustments are being made I'm just curious about that the policy should be your broad vision and then the procedural director of should Define it with your girlfriend okay I mean that's just that's just what I'm I'm just trying to think of how we would put that together I think we stated that our broad vision is academic Improvement postsecondary Readiness and life success or whatever we call that fourth one so I don't know how others feel about trying to add something relative to those goals as well

[00:45:00]
it just seems like that's fairly specific because as it is more likely that our goals will change sooner I mean hopefully we have accomplished our goals there are goals will change sooner than the need for policy change would come about I mean on the one hand I don't know that we'd ever say those weren't goals right so I think that's the thing what is the goal of academic instruction is our district is it just to improve test scores you know comes or is it all set to prepare kids for college readiness so if no one else wants that that's fine but we did state that I was just want to make sure that the policy is aligned to what we stated as our goals I feel like seeing student outcomes to me sort of implies because it's like the purpose of school is to get to good student outcomes and to me student outcomes are also called in Readiness and life skills I mean I that's how I

[00:46:00]
so I mean if we could you know it's the first read I guess write it in and we'll see what it what it looks like but for me I'm just my personal preference is I like saying improving student outcomes for all students with an intense focus and closing the achievement Gap and I like the idea of making sure we Define where that achievement Gap is defined but when I think of student outcomes I think of all inclusive I think of the outcomes of students in terms of everything obviously the whole purpose of school is to teach him something that way to to be able to improve and have success in their lives that that's just me personally and that's where I would rest and I would agree with what board member until a quart of a set as well I would feel

[00:47:00]
like the thing that doesn't Compass everything that we have like it's the umbrella for all so I am happy with what was initially given but I'm not going to die on that cross so like so why don't we try and add that and then see what it looks like coming back I'll take the feedback back to Dr Sakura one word that might help is if we added like stated student outcomes in because then it may be it draws to to what the like the current student outcomes are the student outcome goals so that it's very specific as to what our state is do now comes our right now maybe thank you any other questions or suggestions on IA all right we will move on to the next agenda item which is discussion of proposed amendments to

[00:48:00]
policy IG curriculum development adoption and review and moisturizer you still have a 4:00 I did the overview for all of them so I'll just let you go to your discussion great any discussion on IG hi hi I just wanted to say that I think to keep up with the current times as the superintendent or their designee taking away the his hers just saying their designate on those others just moving forward I actually like this one I don't have any other changes it just I just want to move into that into that language preference thank you other suggestions so I do have a question as to what it really means what what are we saying when we say schools and teachers show organized and to implement all mandated District curriculum and instructional materials what does that mean for different

[00:49:00]
appreciation what does that mean for making choices as appropriate for a group of students based on student interest in student-centered instruction what does this mean that certainly up for your discussion tonight it's one of the items that was put in here so it's for a discussion as to whether or not that stays on I think part of it is the vision is put here and then the details are in the procedural directive in terms of what does it mean but I don't know if others have suggested edits or a board member Peterson if you have suggested edits that would my clarify that for you at the very least I would see striking all organized instruction to implement mandated District curriculum

[00:50:00]
instructional materials is important but I don't know how others feel about this sentence well I'll jump in here like this I personally feel that particular word is important because I think we do need a standard of consistency and what's expected throughout the classroom and do the teachers and I think many times we read this and we immediately Define that we're taking away the the teachers ability to use their knowledge to draft a curriculum that might be appropriate for the students you know for their teaching they're teaching style but I think we have to keep that standard there because then we do have too many open doors you know and I think it really takes away from what the principles may want to

[00:51:00]
you know have some oversight within their particular schools and it allows for a little bit more structure so personally I'm leaving all mandated others know I was I was trying to pull up I mean one of the stated goals that we all agreed on was to have District district curriculum and so I mean again this policy just got too many tabs open here I mean it's it's just a balance between what the goal is that we you know we all agreed on and we're aligning it with policy and so I mean it's just again it's just making sure that everything that that there's no discrepancies within what are you know what are policy document

[00:52:00]
say so I'm you know I'm I'm in agreement that I believe that it should stay in it creates continuity creates you know like we were talking earlier about the special ed manual there's so many different pieces of information that can get out there that until we can consolidate it all into one place so everybody is on the same page and everybody knows what what compliance actually looks like in the special ed Department we have to work on making sure that all of our documents say the same thing and if the goal that we all agree to says District curriculum and instruction material then are policies need to reflect that as well thank you and I will also go again to the show there's lots of shows in here and I think they should just probably be Will's

[00:53:00]
but the question that I and I'm for keeping all mandated District curriculum as well but I just want to read this out loud and it just doesn't it doesn't make sense to me but it perhaps you can make it make sense to me so on the 2nd on the second sentence it says schools and teachers will organize instruction to implement all mandated District curriculum so that makes sense to me she'll mandate that they Implement all mandated District curriculum but then when you say will organize instruction to implement instructional materials so I don't know that you implement instructional materials that would be like technology programs and other things that aren't working not just yeah I just go how do you implement them just a thought if there's another word that might be better there and then

[00:54:00]
and the other question I have is on that last sentence in the first paragraph of its kind of got put there but I'm not sure if it's necessary there all of a sudden it just says a balanced program a student activity should be provided maybe it's just kind of there and I just don't know exactly you know why and then when it comes to this before you keep over from the previous policy so I don't know that we know why that's necessarily in there so I think we should discuss whether we suggest striking that sentence or suggest to finding balance program of student activities in the procedural directive or an alternative so before we keep moving I just want to see if there's other reactions to that final sentence on a balanced program of Student Activity shall be provided yeah I'm curious what a balanced program means myself so

[00:55:00]
I don't know what the reference was there maybe that's just a question for doctor said whether she thinks that stays or needs to be clarified is defined in some other way well actually I kind of wonder if that doesn't go way back to when we started to introduce title programs sounds like and we started talking about bringing in programs for both females and males and you know making sure there was a balanced program and this has not been updated since 2013 we talked about do we have a nice balance in terms of lettuce Fine Arts you know technology

[00:56:00]
and then on the second paragraph the last sentence on the second paragraph it if you could just rewrite say what you have to say there but just rewrite it it's just seems a little you know choppy superintendent or you know their designee will present the curriculum program the district will adopt for review by the Board of Education and I think you can shorten it somehow probably just taking program the district will adopt shall I will present the curriculum for review by the Board of Education anything else

[00:57:00]
I think this is still a topic for discussion of what does this mean for teachers ability to differentiate curricula and to make sure that they are making the best choices and for the instruction of their students and in this event I mean with that language then definitely for the next part there has to be deep discussion and engagement of Educators in the selection of curriculum did if we are telling the sport is not in a position of telling what teachers should teach that is the administration the administration needs to make sure that there's meaningful engagement on the part of educators

[00:58:00]
if we make the assumption that Educators do not have expertise in Professional Knowledge that needs to be a part of that choice we are not serving the best interests of our students so when we select curricular we need to make sure that it is representative of our students that it does allow for real differentiation for meeting students needs that it's engaging that it is giving teachers the tools that they need Educators the tools that they need to meet those needs so are you going to respond to that same point yeah I was just saying so so bored member would it be that at the end of something like this where it says District curriculum instructional materials you know that balances differentiated

[00:59:00]
can you know the I want to say something that I keep I'm lost on the word balance because it's there I'm trying to wonder what it was but that somehow honors or supports or still enables differentiated instruction I mean I I I I I I think what you're trying to say is that without the mention of differentiated instruction in the the ability or the or the purpose of that or the reality that that occurs in some instances would that help if it was just called out at the end that okay we want we want literature as well as nonfiction and I was just I'm just saying I got lost cuz I keep seeing that but I'm just saying if after that sentence is somehow you know honoring

[01:00:00]
you know somehow stating that the the reality of differentiated instruction because we also called that out I think it's part of our goals as well so somehow you know still using our mandated District curriculum instructional materials but using that to differentiate instruction yes so I heard two distinct Concepts member Peterson from your comments and so one is related to the adoption of instructional materials and the other is related to what maybe the use of the instructional materials and so so I think it's in the second paragraph the sentence the first sentence the superintendent or their designation for the review and Adoption of District curriculum I think this is where we need to include the concept about that process should include teacher Voice or teacher expertise or something to that

[01:01:00]
so shall develop process that includes teacher voice for the review and Adoption of District curriculum something like that I think would get to the process piece and be aligned with the guardrail that we passed on teachers to staff boys the second concept is what the instructional materials and curriculum should look like and so that might go above in the section where board member Montoya Court of was adding or talking through so we have all mandated District curriculum instructional materials comma to include cultural and linguistic responsiveness and opportunities for differentiation to meet the needs of students so board members just to not muddy the water hopefully but mandated I think is the word that seems to be the problem

[01:02:00]
call to mandated you called it District in standards aligned in your guard rail or District in standard or District adopted I think it was aligned so I don't know if you want to maintain that language to be consistent but I believe that was what the the language used in your car rail so where do we stand right now on some of this suggestions because I keep going back like we are responsible for setting instructional policy the board is 22 Dash 5 Dash 4 weeks that the instructional policy and absolutely we need input when we do that we set the policy we you know turn it over to the administration to implement it so I guess

[01:03:00]
where where have we landed on the the language the suggestion of the languages the language changes but at the same time it leads me to kind of the next question of the what if the district and standard aligned curriculum the mandated curriculum however we want to State it what happens if that is not what happens if that does not occur like is that language that needs to be added into the policy of what if it is not done with Fidelity is that you know something that needs to be added that can't be added to policy that's procedures probably not going to have a lot of language revolving

[01:04:00]
but there would be in the negotiate agreement and in the training of what we're working with our principles and our staff as far as what's expected and then I do think when we get down to it we're talking about that first teach there needs to be some consistency in the first teach that's what you guys are referring to when you talk about this curriculum where the teachers have the ability to augment and in developers when they come out of that first teaching kids are struggling but we need to have some consistency we believe in the curriculum across the district the there are variations of curriculum because we do have a few different and so one section of town may have said we're really much more comfortable we see better results from our students here in this type of curriculum or we may look at the results to say you know you really can't defend it and we need you to really think about being consistent with everyone else but as far as mandated curriculum that's difficult there's

[01:05:00]
and when we get into mandatory going to really talk about some curriculum said I specific special education for example we have students who require very specific programs very specific specific curriculums and if that's what has to happen then we have to do it that's Federal all right so that's why I think the variation is but again I understand we're trying to get to and you can leave it and see what happens but I think that's probably where the I'm worried that we're going to get into a what does that mean and when do we do it so I think to respond to board member Jackson's question it would be helpful for the procedural directive to include language similar to what you just said superintendent around needing consistency the first teach and providing opportunities for differentiation etc etc to address unique student needs so sometime of that language in the procedural directive and then I want to come back to again the word mandated

[01:06:00]
and so the language that we included in the guardrail was district and standards aligned so I think the suggestion is schools and teachers will organize instruction to implement all district and standards aligned curricula and instructional materials we can try we do have quite a few notes and assistant superintendent Joyce Gormley has joined us she's making notes because she's working on the procedural directors as well so I'm hoping I caught this but the superintendent or their designation provide District curriculum that is consistent and aligned with state requirements New Mexico content standards New Mexico instructional School Scopes and District goals

[01:07:00]
schools and teachers shell organized to implement all-district and standards aligned curriculum high-quality instructional materials and District develops scope and sequences of to include culturally and linguistically responsive high-quality instructional materials we have it in two places but it's first read so we're going to have an opportunity to to see it before the next board meeting to make sure that we've got it and I think then the second can you read the second paragraph the superintendent or their designation develop a process and I've got that highlighted yellow so that we can fix that wording for the review so I didn't change anything after that I just have a big highlight to fix that for you right

[01:08:00]
District curriculum period the superintendent or their designee will present the curriculum for review by the Board of Education yes and I did catch that second sentence anything else on this one and we will move on to our next item for discussion which is proposed amendments to board policy IH instructional program so any comments or questions suggestions on this one I'm with board member from all the shells across the

[01:09:00]
any suggestions on the content I mean I would say on the first sentence just to clean it up a little bit cuz we have four learning for all students if we just said instruction in Albuquerque Public Schools will provide Equitable opportunities for student learning period and then the second sentence if you could just tell me that I at least quarterly the superintendent shall report to the Board of Education evaluating various aspects of the instructional program and strategies for improvement program it just sounds Can it can be made better so I don't know if at least quarterly the superintendent shall provide an evaluative report to the board of education on various aspects

[01:10:00]
what's the instructional program and strategies for program Improvement maybe so I think that would be happening anyway through his reports related to okay cuz it's not so I think that actually what I was going to suggest is maybe this is another area where we highlight and just try to make it a line to the language for Progress monitoring and so we we know that at least quarterly we want the superintendent to report back on the academic program and we just want that language to essentially mirror the progress monitoring for student outcomes Focus governments okay remember more than I think other comments or suggestions or questions

[01:11:00]
our next item for discussion is an item after discussion know I'm just kidding G discussion of proposed amendments to board policy ih4 establishment of magnet schools this one has minimal edits largely in currently so just wanted to see if folks have any other suggestions for this one member Peterson so I can continue to be incredibly concerned about the fact that we give very little support to Innovation for the teachers for the practitioners that are in classrooms right now working that this is the will strive to collaborate with Community Partners charter schools and education stakeholders absolutely nothing about

[01:12:00]
and the kinds of innovation and examination of their practice that they are going through right now so one of my concerns with magnet with this language is that it does not it does not recognize or take advantage of the strengths of teachers who are really working to make sure that they are meeting the needs of their students in creative and engaging ways the other thing about magnet schools before you keep going so I think as a potential change then it could read Albuquerque Public Schools will strive to collaborate with Community Partners Charter Schools practitioners and non-magnet schools and education stakeholders dot dot dot dot dot dot okay so just want to give them a chance to capture that

[01:13:00]
and then the other the other thing is that I think that we need to make a very strong effort to make sure that the development of magnet schools does not alter necessarily their relationship to the communities that they're already a part of and we sort of had this conversation when we were looking at the when we had the right sizing discussion that we have schools that are based in neighborhoods and they may be in a perfect situation to become a magnet school but I think if we look for instance at the difference between Longfellow and how its continued to serve the martineztown community at the same time that it's been able to develop its role as did you a language Magnet School

[01:14:00]
it also focuses on the Arts as opposed to Coronado magnet school which is in the middle of Bareilles but really does nothing to guarantee access on on any kind of basis for making that a real embedded deep part of the community so that for instance the students that are in right around within blocks of Coronado San Jose and I think that we do not take advantage of those kinds of specialized programs in a way that really Fosters strong community at the same time and I don't think those two

[01:15:00]
have to be mutually exclusive thank you members you have any will stick on this topic for a minute to see if there's any language we could propose adding potentially well yeah so I wonder if it would help because this is a discussion that comes up routinely right like whenever we discussed magnet schools and and that we want the the demographics around so I wonder if it would help to add language that kind of ensures that the demographics of the magnet schools reflect the demographics of the schools that are already there and that we include that in the policy so you know perhaps Albuquerque Public Schools will ensure the demographics of students enrolled in magnet schools including race gender and socioeconomic status reflect the demographics of the district wide student population

[01:16:00]
I'm looking at superintendent Elder and I'm I don't know what he's thinking but I'm thinking that's going to be a difficult thing to ensure but I agree I don't know what you agree okay I read his face you I mean we have created in the case of Coronado the school where people can come and get bilingual instruction and it was done to save Coronado quite frankly probably be closed and if we don't have those that's a school that serves a population magnet schools is a general rule or in the neighborhood we moved away from the popcorn Model A lot of like we talked about 100 times but you know we used to have it period somebody we get an idea and poof we had a magnet school and as long as that somebody was there it was a good magnet school and then once they left you just saw the General Hospital

[01:17:00]
I understand the concept of trying to reflect the reality is the great majority of the great majority of our magnet schools reflect that I don't know what we do a CEC because those kids come from all over the city and everybody benefits from those programs I have no idea if they would reflect the Martinez Town neighborhood sorry just to clarify what I heard from board member Jackson was not necessarily that the demographics have to reflect the neighborhood but reflect the district overall and strive to language so what I wrote was APS will strive to ensure the enrollment of magnet schools like stopped writing because he kept going too fast but will reflect the enrollment of the district overall and so I just wanted to clarify there and see okay so then so it doesn't necessarily in this context of CEC have to match martineztown but making sure that those magnet schools remain

[01:18:00]
if this could be one of the policies that maybe does get delayed for final approval until maybe April just to give an opportunity for more specific kind of program and I don't think anyone would dispute the the importance of that program just like if we if we can move forward on taking advantage of our new site from all over the district and but those are

[01:19:00]
different from especially elementary schools that are based in communities you know I think we have made some decisions for instance with the agricultural thinking about the pathway from from elementary to high school there is consideration about the needs of that neighborhood that there were reasons why we like that particular group of schools were targeted for that program because it really didn't matter what's going on in the schools what's going on in this community and so when we do that kind of you may not necessarily even though this is your community even though this reflects your needs you may not necessarily

[01:20:00]
be able to have a site or have a seat in that school so I think maybe it's in the procedural Direction maybe it's too specific for this but somehow I think that there should be a reflection of community with the magnet schools when we do those transitions so considering that this is the first street and we're Drafting and just trying to make sure that we're capturing the values of the board I think this concept around maintaining diversity within magnet schools is one for which there's lots of head nodding and approval lots of so I want to propose some language to get it in here so that we can start working off of that draft as a straw man as we move forward so remember Jackson proposed Epps will strive to

[01:21:00]
to ensure the enrollment of magnet schools etcetera so if we add that that I think that's one concept that we can noodle over and get feedback from the magnet schools team and others before the next read and decide if it goes to March 6th or subsequent meeting March 1st March 1st March 1st or subsequent meeting the other concept I heard so we have in here Albuquerque Public Schools shall strive to collaborate with Community Partners Charter Schools we added practitioners is there some other way of engaging the community that is a value of the board that you think ought to be included in the policy or is this just a recommendation that when the procedural directive is considered it's attentive to community collaboration so what if it did

[01:22:00]
magnet schools should reflect the diversity of the district and address the needs of the community and something that's rather vague but let's it be more specifically addressed in procedural directive I think the first concept around the diversity was captured in member Jackson's edits the concept around capturing the needs of the community is a different one I just want to open that up for feedback and see if others have reactions to that or suggestions for specific edits well I have a question now now that we're spending some time on this are the new hubs that were proposing the new Early Childhood hubs would they be considered magnet school early childhood

[01:23:00]
it would just be a larger attendance area okay although I suppose we haven't worked out these particulars but I suppose if a parent worked in the area and want to do transfer their child to that they could but I don't think we think of them as magnet schools now okay only because I'm now on that one sentence where it says she'll collaborate with Community Partners and I would want to ensure that that type of program was collaborating you know with the needs of the district Community programs you know that are currently in the area that we're not duplicating our efforts but that's a whole different conversation but I was just it just sparked that question if that was considered to be a magnet school that's a good question I mean it's like and should we start out in this conversation here with like what is a magnet school that we can make sure that we're establishing magnet schools but we understand what a magnet school

[01:24:00]
means because I was surprised on the list of magnet schools for example that school on Wheels was considered a magnet school because I think for the community I'm not sure that they when they think of the word magnet school I think they think of it in a different way right so I it's just a sparking my my brain a little bit but I agree with you a little bit that we probably should maybe start out with some sort of why we start magnet schools you know and the you know the the maybe that's in the procedural director of how we start a magnet school one but I think we should have some sort of vision around why we started magnet school so it makes sense to have the vision in the policy and so right now we start with

[01:25:00]
the second sentence really the education instructional program objectives for magnet program shall be consistent with the goals policies and administrators we probably do also need a sentence that says magnet schools will be established to Foster Innovation and choice or something like that provide additional opportunities to meet the needs of students and Community more directed Innovation or something like that more directed Innovation and choice are specialization or something like that you know I mean I think that would be a good thing to have in there because it's clear about why so somewhere in the first paragraph maybe the first sentence will want we want to add a statement of why that includes the Innovations specialization community and my second question too when it says she'll be consistent with the goals

[01:26:00]
academic necessity and strategic goal for the magnet schools of what they need to strive for if within the policy they have to meet with four goals set by Albuquerque Public Schools fantastic any other comments or questions or

[01:27:00]
questions for ih4 I mean the only thing I would do Madam chair is on the second sentence I would just instead of at the end it says of the district I would just put the district in front of administrative procedural directives and then I I just really liked what what member Peterson had said about reflecting it should reflect the diversity of the districts so we're not saying you know that it will but that it should and so if we said somewhere that in there and I know we've already kind of said where we put it but another place I think it might work is the superintendent or their designated will direct the formal process for planning developing and implementing programs that should reflect the diversity of the District of diversity of the district and you have the proposed language

[01:28:00]
going to potentially add it in two different places and with that we will move on to agenda item H discussion of proposed amendments to board policy ih5 special services and delivery of instructions and suggestions for improvement so I had a suggestion so at the end we have schools show immediately inform the parents guardians of a student who qualifies to receive instruction through the program when the school is made aware of the students extended absence due to Medical injury or illness so I would propose just adding a sentence after that but just states that that

[01:29:00]
Correctional content should also be aligned to the district and standards of what did we say District in standards aligned curriculum and goals or instructional programmer or whatever something like that other questions or comments on I-85 the language that was placed into the academic goals into the very first one where we where it was district and standards aligned that that language should be inserted yeah something like that to be clear that just because the student is getting special services delivered because of their medical injury those aren't watered down lower quality special services for graduation academic progress Etc yeah all right

[01:30:00]
to try to make it more we get it in the second paragraph but in the first one that we're really talking or I'm assuming that we're really talking about long-term medical absences correct is that what this is all about so I think somewhere we get that in the second paragraph but in the first it seems like so broad like special service will be made available so it seems like it's so big so I don't know if there's something that we can do to just specify what we're talking about because these are specific to long-term medical absences so I agree with you when I first read it for long term Medical Services into that first sentence as well so for what it's worth when the kids in the hospital for multiple days they do get Educational Services there

[01:31:00]
at least at UNM unfortunately I had that experience all right we are any other on this one okay so our next item for discussion is discussion of proposed amendments to board policy IH 8 Community Schools remember what we believe in and what we do I think from that point forward it's procedural directive in terms of what is included what's involved it says you know the the operational piece of it I think the vision of the board is clearly stated that you know we affirm the need for that strategy and that you know it's an equity strategy for you know

[01:32:00]
but I just feel like everything below that is part of a procedural directive terms of how cuz it talks a lot about how everything after the second paragraph that's my that's my input so I heard some jazz and some nodding on the side I don't know Barbara University and give professional development are critical to the functioning of our community schools and I think it's absolutely critical in policy because we now have we have state money we have

[01:33:00]
Federal money we have any number of different funding streams coming in but they're all dependent on evidence-based practice and that serve embodied in the pillars it's so I am I'm happy with that but I would this one I really would strongly recommend we take off of the timeline for the others and that we really engaged conversation with ABC because it's not the existence of Community Schools although they are within a PS4 that we have we have actual legal binding relationships and I think that it would not service in the best way to to take care of

[01:34:00]
that hasn't really engaged ABC in its development so I I mean I agree that this goes into the depths of procedural directed but I would like to see us do a much more collaborative effort before we actually approve it so I that reminded me the other reason these aren't going through like the full 2 months because they're not new policies so they're just edits to existing policies so this is just minor edits to an existing policy so I guess that just sort of raises the question of whether there is Need for more conversation because it's not establishing a new policy I don't know if anyone's member of the team wants to respond to that suggestion we do have Brian Garcia here to answer questions in reference to the common so far

[01:35:00]
play the collaboration with ABC Community School partnership is essential and certainly in respects to this policy and the Community Schools Act of 2021 as well as the revitalization of practice that is taking place at this point in time there is the need for a collaboration however in review of the existing policy in using the words of a capturing the essence of the movement from the four pillars to the six key practices are appear to be in alignment with what's currently stated in this policy so there's been a review of more recent research practice and a new act at the state level that is a by what's written here

[01:36:00]
and of course guardrails discussion as well affirms that also you know one of the other things that I so I will go back to where I was saying that first sentence in the third paragraph is important to keep them as part of the policy that Albuquerque Public School Board of Education commits it's in the superintendent's participation in the partnership that would be an important piece of the policy but because it is stating that firm commitment that one we believe we affirm the strategy we love what it does it is an important piece of what we do and we commit to being part of that then I think everything after that is still a procedural directive in terms of the how we're going to get that because that could also change as things may change but I don't think it's a watering down or taking away of our commitment to to

[01:37:00]
Community Schools I think that makes sense keeping that first one had some comments questions but before I go to you I wanted to stick on some of this discussion here and a little bit related to what Mr Garcia said is the concept of the essence of community schools and how do we capture what that is because that's what we're committing to and so I think we want to be clear that it is an evidence-based model there are pillars or guidelines or a framework for it and that feels important to maintain here so that going forward it's not anything could put a stamp on Community Schools and say work community school so I'm not sure where or how we capture that sentiment because it feels important to keep within the policy I agree so does it I like I said I'm not sure where

[01:38:00]
and the procedural directive as it relates to those he practices that you're referring to chair Gonzalez and how the details of that is can be spelled out in a procedural directive in that transition from pillars to keep practices which maintains the Integrity of community school practice play with that I think the suggestion was how do we add language that states it has to be an evidence-based model so maybe just somewhere in the first paragraph We affirm the need for a strategy to identify and support the development of Community Schools comma based on an evidence-based model or following an evidence-based model

[01:39:00]
evidence-based let me try to see here in terms of universal best practice on that second cents a board of education recognizes a community school is an evidence-based model that builds Partnerships between the school and the Community Resources maybe I think that sounds good but I think that that is what ABC Community School partnership is in with all four feet you know what they're doing right now in my opinion I mean this is what I would do is I would just have them really look at this to make sure that they that this does capture or in the procedural directive if it's not supposed to be here

[01:40:00]
6 key practices that you are talking about so moving from the four pillars to those key practices and how to put that in there I mean like I in my opinion Jeanette Townsend was just know how to do that I mean I just think she's fabulous she knows what she's talking about and that's what I would move to do I would also make sure and hear that I would add because you're so much more to the Community Schools obviously then we're putting then we're putting in here I believe is that I would make sure that I would add on that first paragraph the last sentence Community Schools shall Focus but not be limited to and make sure we put something like that because I think there's a lot more to it than just the integration of academics Health there's just so much more and I think if we make sure that we leave that and I think you can probably capture some of that as well but I would really

[01:41:00]
like somebody like you know like Miss Townsend to just kind of look at this and if the bottom part is supposed to be in procedural directives I mean it seems like it is and there's a whole lot more than what's here that we could definitely capture in a procedure directive cuz this is not and I mean Brian knows that this is not everything that the Community Schools do not even close no so but I but I do think the purpose of the policy is to stay the boards commitment to the concept of Community Schools to the vision and roll of community schools and what they accomplished and I think similarly that they need to be the model needs to be evidence to research base so wherever that concept gets out of makes sense and then yes conversation with ABC partnership and others to make sure that nothing that needs to be into policy gets moved out and the procedural directive is inclusive Integrity yeah I heard I'm sorry Mr Garcia

[01:42:00]
mention the Community Schools Act of 2021 is that something that needs to be added to Legal cross-references presumably I believe so that's something we should look into that I remember Peterson you had your hand up but I was going to get everything that you had or was there more I'm good okay I mean that's why we work with ABC is because they have that level of expertise so I would recommend putting that statement in that third paragraph and then maybe just putting a period after that so that it would read Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education participation in the Albuquerque Bernalillo County community

[01:43:00]
School partnership in order to ensure doesn't have to be insured there might be another better noun or verb rather the development of in and implementation of evidence-based practice and it could be period and the rest might go into procedural directive you know if the joint Powers agreement everyone away then the policy would need to be Rewritten but as long as the joint Powers agreement is enacted that really is a large part of why we are part of that it's not just funding it's all so expertise and then we'll consider that

[01:44:00]
where did we if you could refresh my memory where are we going to put evidence-based practice in the first paragraph well there were three different suggestions I think that we have some material the concept needs to be included and so I'm referring to the team around where it makes most sense so when was in the first sentence which is where I put it and then suggested it somewhere else and so it'll be in the minute and there's three options and the concept gets out of I just think on the first sentence after Community Schools a strategy to identify and support the development of Community Schools comma and evidence-based practice just because that's what it is so you have options thank you we will move on to the next item for discussion

[01:45:00]
play discussion of proposed amendments to board policy ik academic accountability all right I will start on this end to my rights any comments questions suggestions so is that just this is just a question so we may adopt an alternative system for evaluating schools so is that what we would consider like is that our dashboard is that what we would consider it or not really just we don't really have an alternative system right I think with this refers to is that we just don't have to Simply rely on just the statement test so and we have done that I think with our student outcomes Focus governance have some alternative ways of assessing progress

[01:46:00]
those were not relying on just the state mandated test so that's how I interpret that for me we have Dr Bowman here to help us wonderful doctor Bowman take it away so what that thank you so this particular language to us seem to be from a previous time when the state may have created some methods of evaluating schools that the district was not an agreement with and it allowed us it was the will of the board to allow the district to provide their own measurements of how schools were doing so an alternate report card if you will thank you so what I was going to suggest is that we cut

[01:47:00]
everything after the first sentence in the first paragraph So we have Albuquerque Public Schools shall comply with Allstate and federally mandated student assessments period then continue on to Albuquerque Public School shall periodically report to families Etc and then add and this can go at the end but maybe it goes up above in the first paragraph the superintendent will report on the district's progress and achieving all our annual academic goals as required by policy IA to the board of education on a quarterly basis so just referring back to this quarterly requirement that's already in place and IA and clearing out some of this extra that's here I don't know other people so it was the superintendent shall report that District's progress in achieving all annual academic goals as required by

[01:48:00]
play policy IA to the board of education on a quarterly basis I'm sorry I talk fast the superintendent shall report the districts progress in achieving all annual academic goals as required by policy IA and that could be period and that's replacing the stuff that comes after Assessments in the first period first paragraph sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry to a progress monitoring dashboard and my first iteration I said quarterly basis but that's actually what's in IA so I think we just need to refer back to Iya so we can keep I understand where you're taking out and adding in so are we going to take out in that first

[01:49:00]
if we wanted to do that we could so one other thing that I see in my packet is that the art the very last sentence schools and it was crossed out are encouraged to and was replaced with shell or will schools will use electronic grade books that are made available to parents and students does that then like you don't have the option you have to use parentvue or StudentVue right right

[01:50:00]
other questions or comments no I mean I like it where this is this is what we've moved towards right accountability and it has to happen more often and it aligns to our goals that aligns to what we're trying to do so I had a question then and it's related to the legal cross references and it's mostly cuz I don't know where anything stands anymore with the states as a plan and our accountability the state accountability model is proposed to the feds as part of the plan which had consequences and supports for TSI CSI and MRI schools which we would have to follow so that would make sense that we include that in legal cross reference but I guess that's

[01:51:00]
and we're fine as far as the district as far as our reporting we've done what we were supposed to do but there are a lot of issues around that particular piece of legislation and the tool that the state's using to the point that and Dr Bowman I'm kind of looking at you because you heard the horror stories too you mean that's how they're determining that kind of gives you a sense of what's a TSI what's a CSI because of the pandemic it kind of fell apart for a couple of years there's some debate as to whether or not we're going back to that

[01:52:00]
what the new system is going to be I mean obviously you can have whatever cross reference you want we're going to follow the law either way so that's what I was just suggesting is that we had the legal cross reference and knowing that everything is kind of wackadoodle right now at the state level that has to be what it has to be but we have to cover the definition of what I heard OK Google yes so the legal conference is there I think I actually might be the one that you need because section 2222 c one and everything following it includes everything from the state assessment to the school Improvement strategy to remediation programs to grading all of that stuff is in that

[01:53:00]
Eagle cross reference so we can absolutely check it again but this one is pretty big so what I was suggesting is the legal cross reference is the federal law the 2015 every student succeeds act which require that all states put together an accountability plan and so regardless of where our accountability we should follow the federal law okay anything else on I kept wonderful so we are now on our next item which is just a policy chair update and so really just wanted to use this opportunity to try to give a bit of a look ahead around the corner on what's coming up and sort of various policies and big things stand because part of it is an effort to review policies in a way that aligns with our policy diet and our focus on

[01:54:00]
trajectory part of it is to make sure that we're not overloading any particular Department within the administration as we're doing about policy diet and so really sequencing out those changes and then part of it is just sort of other policies that we need to update because something has happened at the state level or the legislature even the federal level or whatever else and so all of that in mind what is coming next is for March in April those will be the finance policy and procedural directives and the superintendent evaluation policy and procedural directives so the finance policies are also in sort of in the way that we just went through all special education and instruction it would be that batch of policies and procedural directives that come next for finance and then may would be the student handbook and the policy and procedural directive changes in the handbook so what we did previously so there's opportunity to look at those various policies

[01:55:00]
and that also includes the opportunity for the public feedback and comment around what goes into that student handbook so are there questions around what's ahead yes can you say it one more time and the timeline timeline I got Finance policies April slowly March and April are the finance policies and procedures okay as well as the superintendent evaluation policy and procedure

[01:56:00]
are there any questions on that time frame you sounded like more when you said it faster I was giving the contacts the next policy committee meeting will be on Monday March 6th 2023 at 5:00 p.m. in the John Millie Community boardroom of the Alice and Bruce King educational complex at 6400 uptown
