[00:36:00]
other opportunities and perspectives that other middle schools don't have for example everyone is learning the same thing but at different approaches I will prepare us for high school by giving us opportunities other middle schools don't have including taking a foreign language class and practicing public speaking so that we are prepared for a more diverse social environment if we include an IB Program pathway in elementary schools it would be beneficial to the students by giving them opportunities to learn because they can become critical thinkers early on this could help them accelerate middle school high school and become lifelong Learners thank you for your time board members thank you all right our next speaker is in the room Vanessa goings you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:37:00]
good evening president Gonzalez superintendent Blakey and esteemed board members my name is Vanessa Gonzalez and I am in my fourth year teaching science at Cleveland Middle School I am the current Albuquerque and New Mexico chapter air and space force Association stem teacher of the year 2 years ago I got some of the most exciting news I had ever gotten as an educator I found out that my school was going to become an international Baccalaureate candidacy school I knew that this would bring along with it increased rigor in the classroom high quality teaching practices and curriculum and most importantly a feeling that most kids nowadays don't understand which is that we are part of a much larger Global Community as my school continued with its progress in the accreditation process not only did my practices and pedagogy as an educator girl but my excitement was only further fueled by the knowledge that my own son would be attending this Middle School in a couple of years along with me

[00:38:00]
knowing that he can continue this high level of Education of IB education as he enters the diploma program for international Baccalaureate at Sandia High School is invaluable to me as a mom and educator and an advocate for lifelong learning I now Champion the hard work and the fundamental building of the Future Leaders of our society that the international Baccalaureate program creates I've seen and spoken with the graduates of Sandia high school and I've seen how my own Middle School colleagues and its students have benefited in just a few short years of this program's implementation in alignment with APS school 3 of post-secondary Readiness I am exploring the school board to have a deep consideration for the implementation of a primary Year's program at an APS Elementary School IB should not be something that's confined to a lottery opportunity for our Albuquerque students and having the option of a full IB pathway is something that would be invaluable to parents like myself who long to put my third grade daughter into such a program

[00:39:00]
if the goal of APs is to generate capable globally minded knowledgeable balanced and risk-taking students than a full IB pathway is without a doubt a primary source for these goals thank you thank you ma'am our next our next speaker is in the room Dr cinello and you'll be followed by Mary Walker Herrera and you have two minutes

[00:40:00]

hi good evening I'm a mother of two students at Atrisco Heritage Academy I'm here tonight seeking your support and attention in person where I have emailed about this concern as to the board as well as to my representative our children are sitting in classrooms that are well over 90° teachers are being forced to teach an unbearable heat because the chiller at a physical Heritage Academy keeps breaking down which cools several buildings speaking to the table to the staff it isn't a new issue it's been happening since 2009 it's now to 2025 they have purchased window units but not all classrooms have Windows where it's a Band-Aid and the system should be properly fixed why not invest in properly fixing the issue rather than adding more expenditures for Band-Aids this is not just about Comfort it's about safety health and our children's ability to learn these concerns are not only for trisko but District wide but I know that this is not something that APS can do alone if we work together across the board City County APS and state and truly allocate funds where they are needed starting with

[00:45:00]
are schools we wouldn't still be talking about basic needs like safe classrooms working AC and a healthy learning environment for kids this also includes sidewalks for accessibility and proper School lighting for safety while crossing 118th and Dennis Chavez which is a really busy intersection a lot of our schools need accessible sidewalks and proper School lighting it was stated in public comment at city council that APS boards capital budget is 473 PSS operating budget is 2.3 billion dollars with this large funding our school should not be experiencing the lack of attention and not have proper AC and or heating the Southwest Mason is a vibrant Hardware in community filled with families and several schools that need your attention not just a trisko I'm committed to working with all of you in our community to ensure that our children have safe accessible and properly operating classrooms and campuses thank you for your time thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Renee Pacheco you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:46:00]
good evening board members are former student of Calvary Christian Academy decided to attend El Dorado a public high school for his senior year now he is returning due to the lack of morality and privacy only after a few weeks of attending El Dorado he found out that students were not held accountable for teaching classes they had no consequences and no work to make up he also told me that there is a senior boy who identifies as a girl he's allowed to go into the girls restroom making their private space and unsafe space when teachers allowed this Behavior they're opening the doors to dangerous circumstances there was evidence of girls being raped in these bathrooms and public schools get up then sending the boy who identifies as a girl to a different school only to do it again thank you for your time thank you

[00:47:00]
are next speaker is online and on Zoom Megan long how you have 2 minutes period And I think we should remember the what God is here and all of

[00:48:00]
the outcry and the call for Action because of this contract that had previously been sleeping with the Council of great City schools and that we need to ensure that we don't end up in that same exact place following this closed door RFP process I really want to see it play out I want the community to continue to have input I want to have that ability to communicate with board members and I feel like I've seen such a shift in the last couple of months since that last contract ended and I really would like to see that continue to happen I really want to see meaningful conversations taking place and collaboration with the community that's what's important to me and I'm saying that to you as I'm

[00:49:00]
taking a step away from the Ozzie Martinez process that's happening here at Embassy Suites and because it's what matters to me and I am an actual parent I am someone who is truly invested in public education thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is also on Zoom Nina Simona Nina are you there are you there can you hear me see me we can see him again and I attended the sfg community workshop at the end of July I joined approximately 25 teachers School leaders support staff community members

[00:50:00]
appearance I reflect on that meeting today because of agenda 10.1 what's stood out from that meeting was the frustration many families feel about not being heard and the empathy within our community for how families are feeling abandoned board members who are who are present witnessed a powerful exchange that underlying one central theme there's reoccurring lack of relationship building and Trust from APS for our families as you head into executive session to discuss the RFP process for hiring you coaches I urge you to consider how contractors can help strengthen relationships and build real trust with families I asked for members to be honest about their own experience of coaching under the Council of great City schools and how it affected their relationships with their constituents I want to acknowledge that the board conversations and decisions have felt much more authentic since coaches have been absent from this forum it seemed as though the board was previously being led in a certain direction but in the most recent board meetings your focus

[00:51:00]
Gilmore centered on children and our schools and to your credit you achieve that by using your own expertise to guide you and Sophie meeting the educator who said they would like us to measure growth that students make in their progress rather than status that shift from rigid Benchmark to genuine growth is a better foundation for measuring outcomes it's not perfect but for students like myself in English language learner it is critical that we don't continue to put students in a box let's celebrate backgrounds cultures and language giftedness recognizing the standardized tests cannot be used to measure progress within certain groups thank you thank you and our last speaker groups or last speakers in the room Michael shaver you have two minutes once you begin thank you my name is

[00:52:00]
Michael Shaffer I'm a retired school teacher and Constitution coach from actually from District APS District 2 and I appreciate the opportunity to bring to your attention a question of curriculum the question is how is APS complying with the United States code 36 section 106 that says each educational institution that receives federal funds for fiscal year shall hold an educational program on the United States Constitution on September 17th of such here for the students served by the educational institution and all the years that I taught in APS I was totally unaware of this but since I've been a coach I've been passionately interested in it and I haven't gotten down here to ask you about it so if it's possible that someone could get me the information I sure would appreciate it it's probably too late to do much

[00:53:00]
anything right now because September 17th is is upon us but I'd love to see how we can do a better job of of the Constitution and bringing it to everybody's attention and and you know that question that was famously asked to Benjamin Franklin what sort of a government have you given us and he said well a republic if you can keep it nobody asked that next question how do we keep it if we don't teach the Constitution we won't thank you so much thank you sir and board members that concludes public forum thank you and thank you to all of our public forum guests today report for gold three post secondary success or presenters for this again

criteria for an effective report has been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements does anyone have evidence to suggest otherwise seen none we will move on so since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will now open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or technical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails these questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented

[00:56:00]
both driven and time bound so we are ready to get started I'm just going to start right here to my right with board member Dominguez thank you my first question is a curiosity I've been trying to ask questions that that connect the previous the previous progress monitoring report which happened on I believe it was April 2nd trying to see the through line to the current but I'm curious about the absence of 3.1 and 3.2 and what shifts and strategies have happened to change since the last to justify or to

[00:57:00]
and I'm concerned about the 9th graders of course because historically they've struggled and so I'll leave it at that members of the board superintendent I think one of the things that I can say in alignment to the previous progress monitoring this sophistication of our work specifically I'd like to highlight the work of the academies of Albuquerque which apartment is we know only it's a big deal and we want their success to be real the Academy of Albuquerque offers us a framework

[00:58:00]
where is us a space to really look at not just the career academies but really the onset of high school and what does a 9th Grade Academy on a robust 9th Grade Academy look like in terms of small learning communities families working to take a freshman class of 300 and really shrink it down to a smaller group of students to provide a transitional opportunity for our students to have a strong start in high school so I think the 9th grade questions and one that we're really working on right now with the academy is in Albuquerque component at the three schools but also really flushing out what 9th Grade Academy looks like for all of our high schools so I have a follow-up to that how will we track

[00:59:00]
are 9th graders and 10th graders for that matter how will we track their student outcomes with regard to the academies Gonzalez of the Student Success systems and the word previously known maybe as early Warning Systems a comprehensive proactive approach to look at multiple measures not one indicator alone not just attendance not just grades not just discipline really the whole student the whole child to ensure that we are not looking at the state of justice but really

[01:00:00]
on an ongoing basis as narrow as a weekly basis and really looking to see how this system is going to provide us the data we need to do early intervention to ensure that our students are passing their classes are gaining the support that they need academically but maybe perhaps even emotionally in the school space wraparound Services capitalizing upon the community school methodology that we have many of our schools to really looking for what is the data telling us from ews or Student Success System point of view and based on that date by school how are we wrapping around the necessary reports to respond to what the data is telling us so for instance if we have a high chronic absenteeism school what are we doing with our Community Partners to intervene to connect with the

[01:01:00]
with the home to connect with the parents and support that in a meaningful way and there's several other examples that I could give in terms of the whole child I guess I'm trying to understand how how is it different now than it was a year ago I'm not getting that from the report doctor we have identified as you know schools and one of our schools are one of our area is our priority schools the schools in need they send out of targeted and intentional support is a FTE one of those FTE is a Student Success systems resource teacher so that person that person was not in place a year ago based on

[01:02:00]
turn on the work we've done but as you know during budget approval time we talked about how are we being more intentional with our resources to Target our resources in the areas in which we need them to be to intervene in meaningful ways based on the student data and the student outcome data that we're receiving so that's an example of how things are different this year than they were last year based on early intervention okay thank you president Gonzalez thank you very much and thank you to the team for your work on goal three and the progress I recognized that we're monitoring overall and we're not honoring right now so I appreciate that focus on the goal three comprehensively my question is about the Academy of Albuquerque and how you are thinking about connecting them into the

[01:03:00]
all three work this is Dr Miller teaching and learning answering his first question I think that the answer to that question is it is easier for me to answer for quite a while and then of course in Career Academy

[01:04:00]
call state quarters to make these decisions but I can give you an example of what it could look like once once the academies are determined in each schools develop their Pathways within those Pathways there will be CTE opportunities for kids to take one to 12123 completed classes and that will ensure a student will walk out and meeting the goal with an industry certification a lot of those a lot of those Pathways this course sequencing will also include advanced classes that could be I'd be that could be AP that could be doing enrollment again as they working through that pathway they will be working through CTE course work they will be working for advanced coursework and then depending on the pathway there might be opportunities for kids Dot

[01:05:00]
respiration experience will get the opportunity to then get some work-based learning once again the lines in the College and Career Readiness framework but the sequencing of the course work once it gets all laid out it'll be built in a way that ensures large amounts of students if not high amount like I'm working on I even looked at today and we said we can see this going to 80 to 890% period

[01:06:00]
that's helpful contacts and and so my primary follow-up is on the question of equity and Equitable allocation of opportunity across the district given that there's going to be distinct Pathways and different in each different high school so can you speak to sort of your theory of action for how you're going to ensure equity and Equitable access of opportunity and then within that sort of what do you see as the role of the Career Enrichment Center now which is sort of the way that everybody gets access to other opportunities and are you envisioning ships there but just sort of generally what are the what's the work ahead for Equitable Access Medical Assistant give you specific example as this gets flushed out I could use scenario in which we look at the way we transport students in the Albuquerque Public Schools based on the way on pathways are rolled out on access

[01:07:00]
we want to make sure that we are meeting on the comprehensive portfolio but individual needs of students and families so that could mean us looking at things very differently and capitalizing on some of the early president that's been sent with set with super stops providing super stops throughout the city so students from the South Valley could take advantage of a West Side pathway or vice versa and really looking to see how once this is defined we look at the systems that adults control in the district to really strike the equity in Access and I'm sure there's other examples that the team they have I think one thing that I'll share is we're developing our Freshman Academy of opportunities for all students to understand and make a clear choice for their pathway a lot of times

[01:08:00]
students don't they think about maybe a career but what we really want our kids to start with is what kind of Lifestyle what kind of Lifestyle are you looking for as you move forward and then and then giving them the options that maybe they didn't even know existed of possibilities for their future you know adolescence they they choose things sometimes and possibly or with very little information are Freshman Academy is going to be able to provide opportunities for kids to really understand the lifestyle they want to live in the careers that could be available for them after or through whatever the City of Albuquerque for every child to move into a highway

[01:09:00]
first generation college students they haven't been exposed to an advanced class or multiple advanced classes which we know the research will tell you one to two advanced classes coming all the difference in the world in that post secondary success I mean I was the first generation college student so that's something that really speaks to me and so not only is it giving students access to programs it's all it's giving them the understanding and the knowledge to make a well a well well thought out decision and have their families have the opportunity to be involved in that decision that's one of the things that we will build out this process is iterative this process is going to take a number of years to get it to where this community deserves for one of the things that we will we will start with is getting evolving into getting the information to our students in our family so they can make a well-rounded decision

[01:10:00]
pathway one thing I will share with you is there's a couple of positives that can come out of the pathway that may be on like really unrealised sometimes the student will will be interested in an area and and declare a pathway and get in there and decide all I really don't like that so then instead of a kid going into a post-secondary experience and they don't not knowing what they're getting into an obviously wasting thousands of dollars or different time they can make a decision on all the time you can make a decision what we are committed to is being able to provide that information to our students and our family that may fall in thank you ok Google

[01:11:00]
please identify systemic barriers to apib dual credit and Industry certifications for students and the three listed were unequal access to due to scheduling conflicts and course placement lack of student awareness and cost of exams and you provided in the the answers to the questions you provided operational changes that will remove these boundaries within one year and because our community members watch the meetings but they don't necessarily read the the supporting documentation would you please go over those and so that everybody can hear because it's a fantastic list and can you also let us know as board members what we can do in the community to facilitate this board member benefits thank you for having us this evening and I would be remiss if I didn't say thank you for the team who helps us

[01:12:00]
set of people that we have a chance to work with if I think I understand the question correctly you were asking with regards to what some of the barriers may be to our students accessing and Ivy as you eloquently stated unequal access due to scheduling may be a concern or an issue and so what we are looking out with our counselors with our teachers and really building robust opportunities for them to understand what is the opportunity for students to access through their curriculum through the academy and so we believe that there's going to have to be a great deal of coaching to our administrators so that they also have the ability to know when there is a system cannot access to obtaining whatever certification

[01:13:00]
play data in a monthly quarterly basis for our students the lack of student awareness of the available Pathways I think I sort of stated that which we are trying to launch a credential awareness so those students that have multiple opportunities to acquire whether it be credit for Algebra 1 and that also leads into maybe a co-star opportunity that they are aware that those credentials and those credits will as as Doctor mentioned will equate for those students if they choose to change a pathway or if they choose to change direction so obviously filling the students staff parents with the necessary information to make those quality decisions I think is something that will definitely be different coming into this year

[01:14:00]
so many of our students choose not to participate in those particular spaces and so I think we going through the academies of Albuquerque we can easily leverage Partners to maybe help alleviate some of those potential responses and then I also know that many of our schools are now working towards creating funds whether it be fundraising and or utilizing funds that we get from college board to alleviate some of those barriers for the students and I hope my captured a portion of what you did and the second part of my question was what can we do to assist phone

[01:15:00]
our partners who set up in the back Scott and if it is it was very clear with the idea that as barriers come about whether it be firewalls or funding for I think those have to be conversations that take place and we take actionable steps to make it happen one thing I'll add specifically industry certifications and get some financial assistance and we have kids that are that are doing it's going to be only natural for industry for kids to get their industry certifications

[01:16:00]
we're going to produce better qualified humans for the City of Albuquerque and that will strengthen the economic foundation and that's going to be a partnership with community business and industry families students it's all inclusive City effort and so as we build these out and we work with United Way in our industry Partners we don't have it nailed down I don't have a specific yet but I promise you will get to a place where that industry certifications

[01:17:00]
updated data I was noticing our children with disabilities you know they sit at a 12% in special education and achieving goal 3 I wanted to know not only why this is the lowest out of all the groups that are listed but specifically toward transition plans and next steps if we're creating those and making sure that kids have these opportunities throughout the years and by the time they graduate that significantly having opportunities so I'd like to know how are you using transition plans or next steps to implement goal 3 Madison area that was really focused in on

[01:18:00]
last year especially on the next step to find side so as you may recall last time we sent it on go 3 the level all platform was piloted in the Albuquerque Public Schools by the New Mexico public education department it's basically more of a modern sophisticated way to ensure that the next step plan is being used I will be very honest and say that we learned a lot last year and things did not necessarily work to our satisfaction but that's the good thing about being a pilot because we can give feedback to the state and make sure that the platform is working to our need one of the things that I will say came out of last year and that pilot work was it was an elevation of the next plan and the next step plan I think in some ways was complaints at best in the past we

[01:19:00]
got to get this done it wasn't a meaningful conversation with parents or students it wasn't a meaningful exercise and the level of platform not only ensures that there's parent-teacher student connection but there's also a connection to the economic landscape in the state of New Mexico So based on your interests based on your strengths how was that connected to the economic opportunities that the state has awaiting you as a student I think that process will only grow in its sophistication and as we build a utility in APS I really believe that we will make connections and we will utilize that platform to its intent it truly is a powerful connection piece more than anything and a conversation with students parents in school so I think that's what I would say in terms of

[01:20:00]
The Next Step plan with the transition plan specific to special education I would say that level all added a component to those conversations on added piece that wasn't necessarily there in the past transition transition plans are important as as our IEPs and they need to be specific in nature and they need to be specific to the kid and the team that's working on that IEP the level of data that can facilitate that conversation in terms of students interests and how we're working on going back to the students progress making that transition plan specific for that student as they move throughout the grades in a guess he stated next steps and transition plants why are we doing both

[01:21:00]
so Madam president members of the board Dr Blakey member to Burrito the transition plans are required and as you know they're required so we take that legal responsibility very seriously in conjunction with the IEP the next plan is also statutorily required because we need to facilitate that for all of our students so I think the trick here is going to make sure that we have a real good point of intersection as we're using these different systems to support the students continuous can you tell me where we would find the data for go for twice exceptional students that a president of the board Dr Blakey we can get that thank you board member thank you thank you team for this report

[01:22:00]
my question I have two questions my first question is directly related to phone number to moritos question and what specific programs and support such as inclusive Freshman Academy Pathways will APS scale to increase the percentage of students with disabilities since their 12% but also are a black and African-American students since they are only at 28% so more and kind of like a district-wide systemic level what inclusivity is are you bringing to our students bad and president members of the board member historica a couple of things in regards to that piece is I think the inclusive nature of students in classrooms is really important for most something we need to work to achieve and do well what is our teachers with the skill

[01:23:00]
that they need to ensure that they have and celebrate an inclusive classroom culture we recognize that all students including African-American students and students with disabilities have a lot to contribute and learn from their peers so how do we facilitate that Dynamic classroom culture and there's a few things that we've done over the years to ensure that we are giving our teachers what they need for example August 4th is an example of that when teachers came together and based on their voice of what they need we provided a dynamic portfolio of multiple venues including this very topic for teachers to take advantage of as they lift up the best practices from their peers to implemented their classroom to ensure a clash of inclusive

[01:24:00]
having a high school classroom of 30 students with individual needs regardless of background is a skill and it's something that we celebrate on a daily basis because we have some great teachers doing now what we need to do is lift up our best practices and share them throughout the district and I believe August 4th is an example of how we can do that Madame presidential Junior High classrooms

[01:25:00]
it is built around inclusive it's inclusive in nature it's built around kids and in building the the collaborative aspect of kids one thing that I've seen for a marginalized students is they start to they start to experience success in a in a different environment they start to see themselves more inclusive in environment and what I believe what will occur and what I've seen occur is that students that it's a mindset with a lot of our students to grow up and struggle students can't see themselves in their future in college they just need that little bit of a spark of that little bit of opportunity to see themselves and success and that's what our environmental shifts are going to get in a pathway because they're interested in something else they're going to experience some success in there because of the medical

[01:26:00]
environments right now 6 through 6 through 12:00 is we're moving our teaming from our Middle grades into our account into our Freshman Academy and then into our Academy so I think the environmental shift is something that's going to increase more inclusive environment it's going to create more opportunities but it's also going to give get the message because they're going to be aware of information provocation and stimulus that they haven't had in the past about what are possibilities in the future we know how we motivate human beings to be able to see give them a path to success or Mastery in the future and that's what this environmental shift is going to result in and it's really going to help all kids and marginalized Communities going to be able to see themselves and success that they have it really thank you for the intentionality of inclusiveness when it comes to

[01:27:00]
culture and and the environment in the classroom I would like to hear a little bit more in what specific supports you have for inclusivity when it comes to software or even mechanics so we've had some students speak today about the auto mechanics that they have in their school if there were students with disabilities who wanted to attend that type of pathway do we have certain funding in place for a material that we might need that specific to students with disabilities or things like that we will have a assistant superintendent TC Riser assistant superintendent of special education good evening princess special education students spend a lot of time in our career classes they do very well in mechanics they do very well in our

[01:28:00]
what are Hands-On classes that's where we actually flourish for our students I can talk about some of what we are doing in Albuquerque Public Schools so at Albuquerque high schools are students with disabilities are in our clear exploration classes were really working to get them into more of our AP classes and dual credit classes that's really where we struggle most we do have students at Albuquerque High School attending a lot of the bilingual classes so I've got like four schools that I can give you ideas with at elderado high school we really worked to have a collaboration between the General Ed and special education teachers so that they're really focusing on the secondary schools acquisition and in addition we put in 18 to 22 teacher at every High School to really work on those workplace internships and opportunities off campus in in the

[01:29:00]
community at Highland High School they have elective classes and CTE Pathways for students with disabilities and off-site work study placements for example students are going to Hawthorne Elementary School and working in different roles after school they are doing administrative support roles in elementary school offices working in VA Hospital Partnerships and at Roadrunner Food Bank on Highland High School they're working in the business and management classes prostart culinary arts programs and Fine Arts programs and and every student including those in our special education program has access to the pathways that prepare them for Life After High School an example at Sandia high school they have a workplace learning and community experiences so they have Partnerships with local businesses and job shadowing and Community baseball experiences what I will tell you is that through those transition programs we are working to

[01:30:00]
bilingual cell and advanced courses and Industry certifications because that's really where we miss out is in those transition program transition plans and talking about the opportunities for our students so that is one of the goals as we're working with her head teachers and IEP Specialists to present those opportunities to students through transition planning yeah great that answered my question I have another question but it's should I wait why don't you let will all get through one and then we'll come back okay board member Topia Romero thank you so I guess my question is going to be related more to thinking more macro relation to go 3 but what broader system changes in structures has the district implemented implemented to support Google 3 if you can be specific I guess it's not macro it's more micro please add a president that

[01:31:00]
what about in anticipation of this meeting is something I don't want us to overlook and I believe it's really huge from a systems change point of view from an equity point of view and an access point of view and that is this year when students pre-registered for classes it was done in a very different way a we had our district horse catalog that was accessible to all students regardless of the school that they went to regardless of the classes that were traditionally office that that's cool we have students register based on what they wanted full stop was wanting to take that doesn't necessarily mean we offered the class this year at that school but we had valuable piece of information that we had

[01:32:00]
40 kids at Manzano high school that wanted X class so now as adults as schedulers as planners we are now knowing how do we achieve this for the students at Manzano from a retired teacher to teach that class let's think differently of how to get these kids to a school nearby that they can take that class and we are providing ourselves with data and the voice of our students so I think that is one of the things that I am very excited about because it is cuts across all of these areas whether it's bilingual Seal Credit industry certification AP or IB all of that data is now in our fingertips so that we are able to do a more intentional job in a systematic way in the years to come in service targets I think the other thing that's really important to know is that this you know especially in the first year as

[01:33:00]
is that the majority of the time is spent putting the system structures and support in place to be able to move on these things and one thing that cannot be overlooked is the overhaul of high school credits so if you will recall we had House Bill 171 that was passed that changed the way we do high school and you all as a board supported the work in making sure that our students had access to more elective credits which is huge and being able to move on this work so without that I don't think we would be in a place to overhaul the high school learning experience in this way because of some bureaucratic things that were kind of in the way of credits so really the work that you all did in approving the credits for high school his is instrumental in giving the kids enough room in their schedule to even take these pathways

[01:34:00]
no thank you for that and I want to commend you to because I love the intentionality that you spoke about to actually correct collect the data that's needed to make the changes going forward versus it just being specific to a school only so I love the forward thinking that we're collecting and just the changes that we're making just looking ahead so thank you for that and you follow up okay so I'm going to ask my question and then we'll go back through if there's anybody else that has questions and so my my question is tailing off of the one that I asked previously and it's a it's about the we have the schools that are piloting me academies of Albuquerque and then we obviously have the rest of the schools that are not non or the they're not Academy Schools right now and the answer is best as I can understand it was that the academy schools are going to pursue receive very

[01:35:00]
Purge supports the non Academy Schools will receive targeted supports as we as we transition so my my question from like a sustainability and scalability Viewpoint is how are you going to ensure through targeted support that the non Academy students will still receive the benefits of the Advanced Credit the certification the bilingual opportunities while working through the scalability process that incident members of the board Dr Blakey Jackson thank you for that question so a couple of thoughts the first one is the initial High School in Highland Illinois because we recognize

[01:36:00]
that this model is going to take support specifically at the onset we will acknowledge as a district that we are learning we are we have some internal conversations that are happening very much at the Grassroots level with our principles and our teachers spreading common language and common expectation you're right the likelihood of us being able to offer an APN an academy coach at scale for all of our schools may not necessarily be possible so how do we take the staff who are pilot and how do we scale it with existing staff to change the way they are essential functions are being executed right now for example every high school has a number of assistant principals moving forward those assistant principals may be changing from traditional

[01:37:00]
essential functions that we use like curriculum assistance student services and buildings and grounds to still do some of those functions but they would also be charged with the oversight of an academy or a pathway they would be over they would be working on the instructional side so everybody on campus is part of the instructional pathway and focus of our students not isolated or siloed to specific things that need to be done the other thing is Academy coaches that may be a position that we Foster and look at for all of our schools because we know that this work needs coordination this work needs to be done and done well there's other rules that we have throughout the district resource teachers instructional coaches that some of those positions may need to be looked at the point I'm trying to make is

[01:38:00]
we have passionate strong people in our schools every day and how do we work with them to come along for this journey with us and some of that may mean for all of us is looking how we do things differently we also recognized at the district level that we have CTE and that Grant Perkins has a very specific set of compliance requirements but the work of the academy is about turkey is no disrespect to the work of traditional CTE programming but it's Dynamic its innovative it's exciting in the sense that we're going to take the work of CTE we're going to take the work of teaming we're going to take the work of Pathways and we're going to integrate it into meeting the student experience school by school and student by students so those are some

[01:39:00]
attempts at answering your question so I would like to have a follow-up yes I can follow it I think you answered the question of how it's going to work for the Academy Schools my concern is in the interim as the scalability is going up what is the strategy specifically for the non Academy Schools why we are scaling because I know scaling is not going to happen next year it's going to take a few years and Doctor Molly you seem to have been speaking from a position of authority on academies I'm going to assume that you have some experience with this so I'm wondering if you could discuss maybe any strategies or experience that you have where you came from

[01:40:00]
ensure that while we're building the academies the other traditional schools are not getting left behind and I'm sorry if I put you on the spot but here we are Madam president the work at the moment are learning about the work in there

[01:41:00]
conversations we have high expectations for instruction in every classroom and every high school that that doesn't change what what what what what what what what really changes as we build on an academy is the sequence in the intentionality on what kids are taking and why so what are other high schools you can we have a we have a new CD director that has a lot of experience and she's currently looking at non-academic sequencing of those classes just because you're not in a Academy school doesn't mean you can't earn an industry certification it doesn't mean that are looking at our students in intentional on how we how we schedule them so they can get in advance and they can get so a lot of the the aspects of gold free can be met in a traditional system we will be communicating

[01:42:00]
bark on I will ensure that we are communicating with our high schools and we are kind of established as we're establishing our why and we are getting our academies off the ground and again I would I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the it's iterative we're going to figure out what we believe will work we will diagnose it over time and the teachers the teaching or something we'll get better at the design thinking process but our schools that aren't in Academy we are still going to support good pedicures we are still going to support teachers in the classroom we are still going to support kids to get complete your classes we will always we always want all kids to take in advanced class because we know that advanced experience can be the difference between post-secondary success and not successful I don't know if I have a very specific or clear answer but you have your earlier and you're working on the specific

[01:43:00]
environmental shift that's occurring there you are educated in building a team with with with with everyone and what happens is and what has happened to my experiences as you build a team and you build Clarity of the vision and you really established the why we are doing this scale accelerates so we may go slow in the beginning but like Daniel Kahneman says we'll go fast I'm not exactly sure when that acceleration will occur I don't know if if a company knows but if you build the team the right way and you communicate the right way there comes a time does accelerate in my previous experience I'll share with you because you asked I spent two years old the vision of tomorrow and what we want to do for future years and everybody was like how did it go that

[01:44:00]
where we where we will get to a point where you asked about support the best support we can do is we can build a High School Division that they reach out to other high schools and say how do we do this and they collaborate as a team Albuquerque Public Schools is one one organization or not 13 silos of high school but that has to be billed and that communication Foundation has to be billed and we have a superintendent that's promoting that there's an assistant superintendent is buying into it every High School person I've met in the most high energy

[01:45:00]
I'm leaving everything but I'm hearing and I just want to point out that we are on target we're past our Target goal so that's really really great and all of our questions are just you know to figure out more information so you guys are doing awesome and I wanted to know more about how we're connecting these opportunities of the students have for certifications with Community Partners so that they're able to use those actual certifications after they leave our Pathways so are we working with local unions are we working with small businesses what is that look like yes I can kind of answer that on board member of storegga yes to all of that and it is I think the important thing about this particular initiative I guess of rethinking High School is that the community is so eager and supportive of join

[01:46:00]
yeah we have isolated pieces of this we have students who have paid internships we have students who have you know computer courses we have students to get a certification we have great things happening but it's not as a system it's if you're if you happen to know about it or have access to it so this is really how do we create it as a system and our local unions are Community Partners everybody is really anxious and it is actually hard to say like well we have to build it you know and it is something that makes it different because I think in the past where we've tried bits and pieces of this it's been a school trying to do it with a partner or a business or a teacher who tries to set up their students for all the internships on their own and it's just not sustainable it's also not connected to what the community needs and this is really intentional from a high level to make sure that

[01:47:00]
are students graduate with skills that are able to stay in Albuquerque and in New Mexico particularly and that is something very unique to it it's not just like oh let's create a pathway that then they have to go somewhere else to get a job we know that we're in a healthcare crisis in New Mexico so we anticipate that there will be several Health academies because of the need for it and a lot of Partners who are very interested in eager in helping us we also plug in for next Tuesday at 10:30 we're having a partnership meeting at burn a fossil to bring people together to to grow this excitement but also know that we have Community Partners we have we will have an average of 5 to 6,000 students a year that need internships so the like I think when people like oh we can take three

[01:48:00]
we're talking about thousands of students each year so it's actually based on community need rather than on individual School need of what we're responding to right and just a quick follow up with that is there anything that board members can do to help accelerate that response for Community Partnership I think yes I think board members could continue to talk about the connection to the community and connect us to those connect the Community Partners to us to create these opportunities for students because along the way there's lots of different ways to be involved as a community partner some might be at the highest level of Engagement and some might be like we are able to participate in the career fair we're able to do the workplace learning field trip versus the ones that are like no we want internship so there is a variety of ways to get involved so

[01:49:00]
yes I think board members could help in connecting us to the community and as you have community outreach meetings inviting us to come to talk to the community about this partnership to great thank you sorry boards I said I'd go to board member Dominguez okay so many questions first I want to say thank you mister Markle Harris for the specifics of your answer I was looking for the and I'll take you back to that when you were I forget what you were dressing but you mentioned that you were meeting with high schools and encouraging a

[01:50:00]
train of systems to know where their systems break down you talked about a monthly analysis of data back to me is what I'm looking for to to understand how we're going to capture and the sideways into my next question how we're going to have an intentionality about this 33.7 percent gap between students with disabilities and the aggregate system that sorry the aggregate outcomes which are phenomenal we are beyond our annual Target and that's great my curiosity lies

[01:51:00]
where is not only looking at the four top groups groups that are doing well but then I also go to the other and and those three groups are children with disabilities Native Americans and Ale kids and also there was an up and down and up again with black African Americans so how are we ensuring and intentionality in next steps to closing the gap of our most disengaged students Beyond I hear that you're doing the ews system but I guess I'm eager to hear especially around special ed kids

[01:52:00]
remember Dominguez members of the board I think one of the main things to answer your question is that we are creating a system right now I think because we are doing work to make progress but it is isolated in separate systems and we are still operating in a if you know that that is available if you know that this program is available if you know this opportunity is available it's not as a system so I think like overall when we create these systems it's not up to who you know or how you access an internship or workplace learning experience but it's how every high schooler experience will be through the academies be able to be exposed to these levels and right now we're not operating as a system so I think overall and how we're creating the academies in every student every high school will be in one it's not a except for we have

[01:53:00]
school that won't have a rehab this that won't or this track won't it's not it's every student and so in doing that as a system we're breaking down that isolation or the concept of if you have access to know that that program is available or that you talked to this teacher or you go to this school I think it's really important to point out and I think Ms Riser is doing a lot of work on this that special education we are really working as a district to make sure that people understand that it's a service special education is a service for students it's not a place that students go and as we continue to try to break that down then it isn't this oh do special education students are they part of the academy all students are partying Academy special education isn't a place that students go and it's a lot of foundational work we have to do to keep breaking

[01:54:00]
that was those ideas down to make sure that the academies are there to change our education system to make sure we do open these opportunities for many of our youth that are not seeing that this is out there for them right and I heard that the district wide catalog registration was one step toward that and appreciate that I think that's exciting and that you're Gathering I'm just wondering what is surfacing specifically to this group but also we've got four academies right is that right the the highest we have three high schools that are like the early adopters of

[01:55:00]
we also have pieces of the academies at Valley and Rio Grande as one strand of an academy that they're not Academy of the whole school okay so within that within those three that are piloting I guess is there an intentionality geared toward these kids that tend to be the most disengage to the original portion of the question like a specific strategy right what we're doing with our principles coming into this year is we're being very specific and intentional looking at their score cards and on the score cards specifically would be students with disabilities and monitoring how many students we have in particular settings

[01:56:00]
but with that we are actually reframing or reorganizing our professional development monthly and we are bringing departments into the mix who have the data who are the experts who are going to sit with our principals and work through what that data is saying and how then we can put some actionable steps into play so one example would be our jobs as the assistant suits and coaching our principles we're going to help them identify a problem with practice and it is going to be what we will look at every 30 days and much of the theory behind it is it is aligned with the 90-day plan what we know is we need to strengthen 90 Day plans to really strengthen the work of what we are going to do within the academies or anything else in which we support and so that would just be one way in which we are tempting to get our leaders on board with the idea of being very intentional with what day do they look at and how they adjust it and move through the system so it's through that guidance that you're going to get to the guidance

[01:57:00]
I would like to know how are you reaching out to the families because they're the big supports for all of these programs and right now it's very cloudy so I don't know what your initial plans are to do your Outreach to families and parents and those who may need to know so they can support their students are you speaking with regards to programs Academy I can speak to specifically just around the idea with working with

[01:58:00]
they are actually supporting and else in setting up tactic teams and so in these tactic teams there are very specific for one it's a communication tactics team and is how we will ultimately bring families bring student voice bring staff leadership voice to the table so that we can make the most appropriate decision to move an Academy Award for one way or the other four all groups of students that we deal with okay all right any other follow-ups questions for this very productive conversation is very exciting and we really appreciate the work that you have been doing and look forward to see how this is going to to scale up for our students so now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this

[01:59:00]
as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions I will ask them individually does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal I see all yeses is their growth towards division seeing all yeses is there a strategy and plan sufficient to cause growth toward the vision again seeing all yeses so the answer is yes to all three so the board can accept the monitoring report confident that data is accurate and the superintendent is performing at this point we are ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring reports thank you member Jackson for facilitating that conversation
