Farm gas when you signed up to speak tonight you were asked to review the rules and expectations which are presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agendas specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during meetings therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance for us to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they find out whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone in the center aisle at the back of the room when your name is called online guess will stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak when it is your time you will be escorted into the main meeting space please turn on your audio and video once you're speaking time is up you will be ushered back into the waiting room when you are finished speaking you may choose to leave the meeting and watch it online

[00:06:00]
does she have 2 minutes once you begin speaking hi my name is Fox Hilton my pronouns are he him I'm an 18 year old former Albuquerque High student I'm transmasculine meaning I was born female and I don't identify as female anymore if I hadn't told you I was a transgender individual you probably wouldn't know in 2016 my school outed me to my parents thankfully I had a supportive community and was allowed gender of him care that saved my life none of these treatments I regret and without them I don't know if I would be here in front of you unfortunately not everyone is lucky to have the support I did my concern is the lack of sensitivity in Awareness to how respect how to respectfully discuss transgender people but individuals during public forum today I'd like to share some statistics with you that highlight how to help and the 2020 Trevor Project States

[00:07:00]
that 46 percent of lgbtq 13 to 17 year old seriously consider suicide nearly one and three lgbtq youth say their mental health was poor most of the time or always because of current policies the mortality rate for transgender people is 628 deaths per 100,000 people a year how can APS find a way to support such a marginalized and at-risk Community while they are still in your school's facing adversity every day according to a 2022 us transgender service statistics 881.7 % of transgender people have seriously thought about suicide just using a person's proper name and pronouns at work home or school can lead to 65% decrease in suicide attempts if people using a child's correct name and pronoun saves this many lives why wouldn't you do it if I had not received the support I did from my community I wouldn't be here speaking to you today thank you

[00:08:00]
for your time thank you for next speaker is Ashton Hill can you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you my name is Ashton I am a transgender man I graduated high school in 2010 I started socially transitioning in 2012 after 2 years of therapy and doctors visits every three to six months finally in 2014 from young age I was depressed I attempted suicide multiple times I grew up sheltered and isolated not allowed to hang out with secular friends forbidden to be friends with queer students growing up I did not know what transgender meant or that it even was a thing school is the only Escape by had it was the only place I could go to learn and beat me and socialize school is my safe haven I dreaded going home every night and I couldn't wait to leave in the morning many many times I found myself staring out the backyard

[00:09:00]
with a pack bag on my shoulder when it was found out I had a crush on a student of the same sex not gender I was subjected to a Bible reading sessions loud Christian music in my room suddenly multiple times in the early morning and many more unusual cruel punishments when I begged for a therapist I was given an untrained unlicensed guidance counselor I cannot begin to tell you how much worse my life would have been at school not been the same place where I had friends who cherish me love me for who I am and have stuck with me to this day school for many children are so important for free from what happens at home for many lgbtqia students it can be dangerous when they are outdated to unaccepting parents or family New Mexico is always valued diversity and acceptance are trans questioning and intersects students not only need but deserve the right to feel safe and accepted in their schools they should be able to go and learn to further their education escaping whatever terrible situation they have

[00:10:00]
go back to not leaving one abusive place for another the most recent studies about gender affirmation and lower suicide rates coming from California are clear precise picture of what does and what does not work for a transitioning use I urge you to read them I urge you to listen to us when we say we are dying and it's because we are Paris of binary as a trans man who has gone through the Albuquerque Public School System never being told us a single thing about the lgbtq community or its history from any teacher or any APS staff protect trans girls especially those of the community protect those who may not know yet because home might not be a safe place for them to be themselves and that is important for developmental growth thank you thank you Ashley our next speaker is Kelly McMahon

[00:11:00]
call you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you and I will never be able to but some of you are feeling a week ago someone asked me why did you volunteer I want the people at the center to feel seen although they are seen by their shared Community some people in our society push them to the side ignore them or worse yet block their ability be themselves I believe all people should feel included and I want them to know we can't exclude anyone just because we don't understand them we need everyone whether they are lesbian gay bisexual transgender questioning intersexual cisgender straight and by the way we need a better term for straight the opposite of straight is crooked and who wants to be crooked everyone who lives in Albuquerque

[00:12:00]
he has a personal connection to APS whether it be your child or a young relative the neighbor or kids playing in the park from what I have read on the website APS is attempting to ensure all children feel valued and included APS believe students know someone has their back they come to school more regularly will be better able to learn and more importantly less likely to harm themselves the safe zone is a good start each school has at least one person who is available when students need help whether they are being harassed or want information about resources and they also have a middle and high schools student-led groups from gsas gay straight alliances are gender sexual gender and sexuality alliances and the website says Empower lgbtq Youth and their allies to create safer more inclusive and welcome to Stronger more resilient use APS is making a strong statement everyone in the city that all

[00:13:00]
thank you for this opportunity to share thank you Kelly our next speaker is Andrea consultant you have two minutes once you begin speaking then I want to thank you use please continue to protect all kids at school and keep the focus on learning I know we all share concern and fear for the safety and well-being of our kids and I think it is very important to name what actually threatens the climate of learning in the lives of our children as the parent of a trans child I speak from personal experience caring for our kids means finding out who they are and supporting them and finding their voice and place in the world and when our kids are at school we want to know they are safe accepted and included my child came to me and seventh grade and told me all I wanted was to be

[00:14:00]
13 that people were afraid the difference was catching and that some people find different threatening they also understood that we all share a human identity and that respecting difference especially when it changes our own ideas is one of the greatest things we can do for each other what we do know is that kids need to feel safe to learn we know that gender are forming care and using proper names and pronouns saves lives my child has said to me directly that all of the ways I have seen and supported him have kept him on the planet and did I know at the time that his life was hanging in the balance I did not I only learned that later the Journey of a parent is uncertain and definitely not all knowing there are so many things we can't control but we can ask that at school kids are accepted cared for and if they are not in spite of who they are but because of it we can continue to

[00:15:00]
the staff teachers and administrators in our schools work to ensure that all students regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity are treated with the new Mexican values of acceptance affirmation and love in order to receive a quality education thank you thank you miss him our next speaker is Emily Schmidt minutes thank you my name is Emory Schmidt I am an Albuquerque resident of the past 3 years and a Rio Rancho residents since 2008 I am a queer person and I have to tell you that I am transgender because that is the way you understand me if it were up to me I wouldn't want to use those words I would need to tell you that my pronouns are he him and

[00:16:00]
and that that would be it but that's how I have to introduce myself to my medical professionals who are trying to give me Care in order to actually receive Medical Care and not get stuck have a panic attack and have a really hard horrible time every time I have to see someone who doesn't already know who I am if we had more education about transgender people and if everyone was able to see representation of themself in school I believe that we would be able to build better Americans better New Mexican better citizens better community members the more access we all have to information that helps us learn about our neighbor's and people who are not like us the more accepting

[00:17:00]
we will become I am living proof that one world view does not stop a person from being who they are I started transitioning in 2020 there have been existed Transit people in history for hundreds of years the public Universal friend is a Quaker who went by gender-neutral pronouns and actually maybe no problems they wanted to be referred to as the friend so yeah that's that's the thing so and that's definitely not new people like me are alive here and now and people who are not white those voices need to be uplifted now more than ever we need our young humans to grow up and see them

[00:18:00]
I want to see what they can become I'm sorry you've got over 2 minutes I need to have you wrap up in one quick sentence please thank you I can't be as eloquent as some of the former speakers here but thank you for your time thank you for next speaker is Leon Garcia you have two minutes I want to start by saying I'm grateful to the educational system as my parents always told me education is very important knowledge is power right education allows us to adults to make informed educated decisions in the absence of Education people tend to make choices and decisions based on emotion and at this point in my life consequences through those I find it's foolish to make decisions off emotion this is why I'm here today HB 7 has given children and teens the most susceptible Among Us the power to make life-altering decisions based purely and emot

[00:19:00]
to be given such power over their own lives at an pre-adult inexperienced age is absurd for my whole life I've heard the children are our future but with the power to alter their anatomy and reality what would stop them from making those other emotionally driven decisions in naivety like drugs suicide or premarital sexual activity with anyone they find comforting what makes a child a child after that HB 7 is robbing our children of their innocence and the title of the future is a mental scarring many are and will have to endure because at one point transgenderism could be the cool thing to do or because their friends are doing let's give their innocence a chance as they are constantly hit with a barrage of obvious propaganda through social media and entertainment today their school should be nothing of the sort truth is it's very possible this could be a phase truth is transitioning is very difficult and could be a life threatening thing feels like HB 7 cover the truth with emotions adults can do as they wish and bear the consequences in an adult capacity

[00:20:00]
dangerous threats to our community

[00:21:00]
I'm not threatened I'm relieved that's because recent studies show that using the correct name and pronoun is suicide prevention So Close by voicing my support for APS is current gender non-discrimination policy safe zones and affirming and supportive staff working in the schools because those things help create a safe environment for lgbtq students thank you thank you Andrew our next speaker is in the room James okay I'm not seeing anyone who won the next one Julius Milanese I'm sorry I made a mistake these

[00:22:00]
resume so hold on my mistake I am my apologies sorry and I want to express my gratitude particularly important in the case of trans youth who are just trying to live their lives with dignity and respect there are times as you've heard from previously is the only space which they feel comfortable simply existing as they know themselves to be improving and further refining policies currently in place that allow for that opportunity is the most important

[00:23:00]
for all kids as they learn and develop into well-adjusted members of society at a time when there are pressing issues facing APS including academic achievement declining enrollment aging facilities Staffing shortfalls and the increasing threat of gun violence you haven't been distracted by fear-mongering and baseless paranoia please keep your eyes on the ball as they say and continue addressing the Myriad challenges actually facing the district there are so many structural pressures felt by young people to exclude to differentiate to alienate please ensure your policies and goals push against these instead of amplifying them thank you very much thank you James our next speaker is Julius Julius when you begin speaking you'll have two minutes Madam chair and members of the board I am Julius Muslim and a father of

[00:24:00]
as it stands I still experience islamophobia every time I Donna Summer outside after 20 years of the war in Afghanistan you would think that there would be a Reckoning with the United States citizens who wish to push ignorance of the realities we live in unfortunately that is not the case and we must drown them out yet again so here I stand in support of continued lgbtq education and the education of other oppressed minorities is our history is intersectional and does not deserve to get whitewashed by those who wish to make us disappear thank you for your hard work and your time thank you Julius next speaker is Amelia Robertson you have two minutes once again remember the board good evening

[00:25:00]
here as the mother of a wonderful third grader I'm here to express my gratitude for the continuing professionalism and kindness which we have all experienced from the teachers staff and administrators at her elementary school and I'm here to Express gratitude to the board for the continued for your continued taking Justified stand against voices who would seek to silence voices of difference including queer and trans people the fact remains as you've heard already tonight their students in APS who are in transfers their students in APS whose parents or siblings are queer and trans and there's no way to silence queer and translation without silencing these kids the notion that some kids can talk about their families when my daughter couldn't is painful to me as a parent and it flies in the face of my understanding of the virtues of liberty and justice for all that we all put our hand on our heart to a few minutes ago

[00:26:00]
thank you again for continuing to ensure that our voices of grandparents people can be heard in classrooms and libraries throughout APS and thank you for all your hard work good evening thank you for next speaker is on zoom and it's Sarah Palin are you there Sara members of the board thank you for opening this space up from input from the community my name is Sarah I use them pronouns I'm an educator and I love books and libraries school or public I am here to voice my opinion on some of the discussions being raised on books being banned in classrooms in schools I strongly believe in the

[00:27:00]
Army of each individual no matter the age of the individual and their ability to make decisions for themselves information is power and books are inaccessible way for students to discover the world around them we do not have the ability to control the way students receive information they can seek it out safely in a classroom with supervision or they can go find an older student or child they are connected to and receive it that way we can however encourage Exploration with positive sources like books which can allow students to understand more about themselves and others students deserve to have a range to have access to a range of perspectives that inform them on different types of living those should include different religions cultures races gender identities and sexual identities when we hide a remove certain information it creates shame and secrecy around a subject if I had seen and read more books about bisexuality maybe I would have helped more comfortable in that identity at a early age

[00:28:00]
and how blessed fear and confusion towards myself we as adults can look back and assess ways that we were hurt or shut off in our education and we can coordinate on ways to resolve those issues and form betterments for children to learn the best way for anyone to learn is in a classroom full of love and understanding that holds space for any and all of their identities removing books that can make a student feel seen and known as harmful and a misuse of our power as Educators thank you for your time thank you next speaker is in the room Tom Sullivan you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you good afternoon Madam president members of the board thank you for this time my name is Tom Sullivan of New Mexico's education system in one capacity or another

[00:29:00]
I've also had the pleasure of working with many members of the aps leadership over those years like Miss Blakey and her dad later a superintendent I would have thought it was unusual for guests to offer thank you for your service to us but the prior speakers were great and especially to miss Peterson who is passion and unfailing commitment to our kids will be sorely missed thank you for being here today is publicly compliment and thank my granddaughter's kindergarten teacher at a Miss Diane Bloomquist but also to acknowledge new principal weeda who has quickly established a positive receptive and caring environment at seen amazing teaching and learning from kindergarten through 12 years through 12th grade over these years and I'm looking forward to 11 more here with APS just a quick aside

[00:30:00]
the changes and challenges for educators over these years have been dramatic and frightening I remember pickups with 22s on gun racks in the high school parking lot and nobody gave it a second thought but now we still expect our schools to provide a warm welcoming environment for our kids parents and Community but also while making it safe and secure as a military base really we are asking no expecting staff to perform an almost impossible task what next asked him to walk on water in their spare time after covid I hope more parents in the broader Community would have come to acknowledge these realities and appreciate what Educators do pretty sure that is not happened yet I'm sorry that I haven't taken the opportunity to come here to share these personal observations sooner again thank you all for trying to help accomplish this virtually impossible task thank you

[00:31:00]
Sullivan our next speaker is Geraldo Sedalia vanilla Gooding increase

[00:32:00]
stability in cost more debt and anything else to populate the world they are determined to save the planet from too many humans who are allegedly the cause of climate change formerly known as global cooling and then global warming no should it be global warning warning this could be one of your own kids or grandchildren whom you loved so dearly and precious to you to Your Heart and Soul on the other hand that local level the APS school board members should greatly emphasize the necessity to Advanced educational and top three in French

[00:33:00]
what does dashboard of the public school code and local school board shall have the following powers for duties subject to the rules of Department developed educational policies for the school district that says should you develop educational policy starting with Reading Writing and arithmetic not sexual policies of perversion mutilation and castration which is actually abortion transgender among students thank you very much thank you sir is Haven's Levittown and retired APS teacher I want to thank the Board of Education and the administration of the Albuquerque Public Schools for prioritizing the needs of all student

[00:34:00]
in this complicated time every student regardless of race gender sexual orientation or disability deserves to be seen protected and celebrated in our Public Schools this means that lgbtq plus students rights must be respected and policies put in place to ensure their safety when books ideas and self-identity are banned students understandably do not feel safe it is hard to learn respecting lgbtq plus students takes nothing away from other students and in fact all students benefit when everyone is valued with the hateful things being said about the lgbtq plus Community right now are lgbtq Plus

[00:35:00]
one way to help them learn graduate and Thrive goals I hope we all endorse I urge you not to waiver and your support for lgbtq plus students and staff thank you thank you for next speaker is Christina or a piano you have 2 minutes once you begin my name is Christina Elementary School and APS Blue Ribbon School of Excellence 100% of our teachers are either letter certified or in the process of certification I'm here tonight to inform you that the Bell to bell schedule are having detrimental effects on the teachers and students at my school this building schedule has reduced teacher planning time or whole school meeting time and our grade level collaboration time extensively we were a school who met in all capacities once a week now it's

[00:36:00]
85 weeks or so I have not met with my grade level for collaboration had an icy meeting or met with the staff at the school since September 5th we now have a district PD in October 12th which will negate the day for much needed extensive collaboration a day that we were to look at data and set goals for reading a math this also plays a huge role in staff morale as teachers are reporting that they feel isolated from one another and our new staff is struggling to make connections because of the lack of face-to-face time the new schedule reduce our prep time to 3:43 minute period

[00:37:00]
make copies respond to emails from parents write newsletters complete mlss plans that paperwork great papers edit student writing look at data complete 20 + State School trainings plus the new cybersecurity training you just assigned PDP and post observation paperwork now because the new calendar teachers only have two work days to complete their report cards the quarter ends on the 6th the 7th and 8th or weekend the 9th is a holiday so we only have the 10th and 11th both of which I find you are some of us do not have a 45 or 43 minute period and the 12th the day the district closest report cards is District PD this time frame is completely unreasonable and two minutes please finish in one complete sentence of my fourth graders were proficient or advanced in reading and that was because I was able to collaborate

[00:38:00]
teaching does not happen in a vacuum thank you ma'am our next picture is Speaker I'm sorry is Richard Galligan you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking as the proud

[00:39:00]
didn't feel accepted and valued for who they are they are more likely to excel academically develop strong self-esteem and Bill positive relationships with their peers in contrast a hostile or unwelcoming environment can lead to negative outcomes such as increased Dropout rates mental health issues and diminished overall well-being as responsible Educators and community members it is our duty to support all students in their pursuit of knowledge and personal growth this means anti-bullying policies fostering a culture of acceptance and inclusion providing access to lgbtq resources and offering appropriate mental health support inclusive education breaks down stereotypes promotes empathy and prepares young people for diverse and inclusive World beyond the classroom by learning about in respecting the experiences of their lgbtq peers students become

[00:40:00]
is there a quick to engage with people from different backgrounds and perspectives in closing our Educators and school system must continue to provide our lgbtq every opportunity resource and support system available to become the most genuine absolute and best version of themselves after all at the end of the day that is exactly what they are trying to become thank you thank you for next speaker is Ray Allen Smith 2 minutes once you begin thank you madam chair and board members my name is Ray Allen and the president of indivisible Albuquerque I heard such powerful stories tonight and I'm grateful for all of your courage to come here to tell them recently I watched a parent during public comment at a previous board meeting talked about the inappropriateness of using social

[00:41:00]
National learning techniques in the classroom I have to admit I have to research that to understand her concern and from what I can find and after talking to teachers in my family I've learned that social emotional learning is understanding and managing emotions making responsible decisions showing empathy for others maintaining positive relationships developing self-awareness handling stress and setting goals so I'm wondering why wouldn't we want our kids to learn to manage their stress and channel their anger and appropriate ways don't these skills make them better citizens better workers and happier people all around can you imagine that if we did a great job as parents and his teachers to ingrain these skills to our children from a young age that maybe the weed have fewer violent incidents at school if you were bullies who don't feel listen to and perhaps fewer guns we might even have happier kids my guess is that this is some kind of code for something else or a conspiracy to like a conspiracy to groom our kids and is something that they

[00:42:00]
I heard one parent say she was afraid that teaching these techniques will make her kid gay so I feel so sad that so much of our population is so misinformed just as kids come with freckles or brown hair like me kids are kids and they need to see we need to see them for who they are and who they want to be let's see the scientific evidence of teaching children to be nice to each other makes them gay we can't educate our kids based on fear we have to educate them using facts science and proven behavioral techniques please encourage the use of social emotional learning techniques with our kids maybe I'm missing something but no gay person I know because they were taught to be nice to others at school thank you for your time thank you for next speaker is Sergio you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you

[00:43:00]
good evening board thank you so much for your time I am a middle school science teacher teaching in the South Valley of Albuquerque my school has been recently labeled a CSI I'm speaking today to bring attention to what I believe goes one against one of our guard rails that we recently have our goals and our guard bills and it deals with the guardrail number two of inequitable resource allocation at my school we have Promethean boards that aren't working and when we talked to APS Tech they mentioned they're too old to fix but we have new ones on the way but it's months of this and we've gotten a timeline but I feel that it's not Equitable because I know elementary schools are prioritized ahead of middle schools for this but it goes against to me that equitability of access to technology for all students we have some classes without

[00:44:00]
while we still wait for the new ones we are 4 years now removed from the Yazzie Martinez losses and I know we had covid during these times and so I'm very understanding of the realities that the district faces that the board faces that all teachers face but it seems like a lot of these things are put on the back burner for new incentives new goals and some of our students still get left behind so I want to talk about the Equitable allocation of resources that I feel is not yet being met and the staffing issues that is why Statewide but Nationwide I hope that the District of the board can meet to maybe offer further incentives to make sure positions are filled one of the ways that we are failing

[00:45:00]
do this is not necessarily anything we want to do but maybe a force of the staffing issues faced Nationwide we have EA's that should be assisting patient classes that occasionally have to be pulled for coverage because we just don't have Subs so we don't have positions filled and I pretty sure this is about District why so I would like to see maybe something done incentivizing more staff or our schools and then that our resources are being allocated equally thank you thank you and board members that concludes public forum thank you thank you so our next item for discussion and action is consideration for approval of the Board of Education student outcome Focus governance self eval

[00:46:00]
and Madam Secretary will be presenting thank you very much so if everybody wants to get to their their rubric that is in the packet and this is just a reminder that the board performs a quarterly self-evaluation to help us stay on track with our commitment to more intently focusing on student outcomes and so it's important that we focus we make sure that we're evaluating what we're doing and so that everybody is being held accountable so last quarter when we went our first self evaluation we scored 15 points so yay we're doing we're doing so I think what I'll go to is all open it up we'll go to

[00:47:00]
let me get to rubric and we'll just go through it like we did last time with President Montoya Cordova and we'll just start with our vision vision and goals last time we decided that we were approaching our student outcomes focus and so we gave ourselves 10 points do we feel as though we're still at the 10 to meeting student outcomes and if so please support your statement as well sorry board member

[00:48:00]
is it possibly have to do with the second paragraph in the blue in the 25th right so I wasn't able to to mark off any of the items in the green right okay yeah so does anybody feel differently does anybody feel we've met any part of the meeting student outcomes focused the 25 points on the board included students and community

[00:49:00]
just we just haven't done all of the goals right we've started we started but we can't check check every single box so as far as the the vision and goals everybody agrees were still 10 yes consensus all right so we'll move to the values and guardrails last time we gave ourselves a five again approaching student outcomes Focus does anybody feel we have moved solidly to the third column meeting outcomes meeting student outcomes focus and give ourselves 10 points okay so we're still at 5 Points okay let's see we can pick up some points here all right so moving to the next route it is not about the points it's about the account

[00:50:00]
So speaking of moving to monitoring and accountability last time we gave we gave ourselves 0 points so that meant that we had not yet met the student outcomes focused track have anybody feel that we've moved into approaching student outcomes Focus for our monitoring and our accountability and if not why I actually gave us 10 points I know I'm scared to say it's nobody said it's like are we tracking our time in Port Authority board meeting we are not currently tracking our time

[00:51:00]
so from what I'm hearing we are so close to the approaching student outcomes focus on monitoring and accountability the only thing that we need to work on their is the tracking of our time and as soon as we track our time officially and then we'll be able to check that box office agreement there because I do think I think that we actually have moved into spending more than 10% of our time we just haven't tracked it or not recording we're not recording this right and we have to be we have to Madam Secretary to be able to give ourselves 10 do we have to keep track of investing no less than

[00:52:00]
so I don't have my over 16th on how to track time yes that's what I was just going to say there is a training coming up cuz I think that's the only one on the we just have to make sure that we're able to track it other than that I think we got we have all the other ones but we're still at zero I agree so I think the superintendent has led an interim goals and monitoring calendar the board has adopted a monitoring calendars the board has received monitoring reports and the superintendent well I think maybe we're not quite there yet either has the superintendent has not been evaluated on performance regarding the board schools guard rails and interim goals and guardrails so I think we still have two two that we need to

[00:53:00]
can you track and we possibly can't even get that one until we might it might be a while cuz that's what I also put her we haven't technically really done this yet on that one okay or what it's worth I also think that we're still stuck in the red on the second to last one the board has not consistent consistently demonstrated the ability to distinguish between customer service issues and owner service issues I'm not quite sure how we track that but I'm pretty sure we're still involved in customer service phone right now but that might be because I'm sure she's listening right that might be something that we actually need to learn like are we supposed to track it

[00:54:00]
are you how do we how do we know whether or not we've demonstrated customer versus owner service issues so great point so still in the zero it's part of mindset the mindset practice believe it or not okay so everybody agrees we're still at 0 for monitoring and accountability yes okay all right moving to communication and collaboration are we still in the zero or are we moving into the second column so if we hadn't done the second one on approaching I guess the question two is have we succeeded to do everything in the first column

[00:55:00]
you're giggling why are you giggling board member Peterson kind of coming down to the tracking of our time okay all right next to Unity and Trust last night

[00:56:00]
I guess the first question is do we feel like we've accomplished everything in the First Column and are we have we moved into the second column no okay why not because we have not yet adopted policies and procedures but we are going to this month yeah so as soon as we do we can solidly give ourselves a 0 and then move to the next one period

[00:57:00]
all right so I'm giving this a 0 let me see 1050 0 and the last one ask a quick question of course to get the one the second one there the board has adopted a policy or procedure requiring that information provided by the superintendent to one board member is provided to all board members are we doing that yet cuz I don't recall seeing that in the governance manual or other policy recording I don't think we're doing that her policy so to achieve that one point we would have to adopt a policy or procedure and we're not currently considering a policy or procedure so whoever chairs the policy committee should probably get on that you know where it might be a good place is to add that into the government's manual when it comes before the board on October

[00:58:00]
16th in fact I mean I think it's important thing we need to develop a format so that it doesn't become a bureaucratic nightmare period the superintendent or staff so I think figuring out how to do it in a streamlined way is necessary but it's important because I think there are lots of conversations that go on any one of us is not a part of and has no knowledge of I think we have to figure out if it's like something really big if it's just something that maybe has to do with the school and Barbara's district do I need to have all that information I really don't need to have it and so that if all of if you think about all seven of us and what we asked for and if superintendent has to provide all of that to all of us

[00:59:00]
that's all that superintendent Elder would do so I would suggest that if you have proposed language for a policy that would address those issues that you send them to the to Johanna that then can then be discussed on October 16th for the policy right because you make a good point there's there's things that everybody needs to know and there's stuff that not everybody needs to know but but some of that stuff that's really related to individual schools is the customer service mindset so we shouldn't be asking for information related to specific school so that's that's a potential way of tracking it but I do think we could work with our coach and get some model policy and try to work that into the government's manual for the 16th

[01:00:00]
again where does zero any let's see if we completed everything at least in in the red and we're moving into the second column I think we have the government right away so we have a solid zero and we're working on 0.5 but we don't have a solid one you should just say we're not negative there we would negative so okay so it sounds like a lot of where we're kind of getting held up on being able to move into that second column is the tracking of time and the ability to

[01:01:00]
to prove our time is being spent for remember Dominguez you had a know I resolved it okay all right so are we comfortable with giving ourselves a solid zero yes okay so so for our fourth quarterly evaluation we are still at 15 poyntz that moving forward every day so yay for us and for the team that is working with us some of her right now we're trying to put or approval of the Board of Education students focused governance of evaluation for your one quarter for with our 15 points this is Crystal

[01:02:00]
Barbara Peterson yes this is the type of Romeo yes if you need a Mingus yes yes yes okay our next item for action and discussion is the 2-year Community engagement and Outreach plans so I believe board member Jackson Gonzalez and Dominguez will be presenting you go all right so I can do the introductions want to up in okay so again we were tasked with putting together a two-year Community engagement plan with the intent purpose of creating

[01:03:00]
two-way discussion with with the community so that we could continuously update our community and have conversations about the vision and the values that are so important for us moving forward as we just realized public forum is not the place to do that because it's more of a one-way conversation so what we have done is worked very collaboratively to put together a two-year Board of Education community meeting calendar and it takes into account some of the sosg directives that we have semi-annual engagement and just a reminder because I do think it's important as we are wrapping our heads around all of this new terminology Community engagement is when the board hosts an event and the way I think of it is engagement

[01:04:00]
the board is bringing people in community outreach is when the board goes out we go out to places that are maybe already holding an event and we are participants in their event so if you ever see me talking and I'm doing this because I'm trying to remember in and out so but that's important because there are different directives that go with both of those so if everybody wants to kind of pull up their progress monitoring calendar I will just give the highlights and then if my colleagues want to to jump in one thing that we did was we thought it was important because the progress monitoring calendar is kind of our North Star that the community engagement tracked the progress monitoring calendar as well so what you will see is when we created or

[01:05:00]
engagement events it was after all of the goals had been discussed and the point of that was so that after all the goals have been discussed that's a perfect opportunity to go back out to the the community and say we've just gone through a whole round here's how we're going to present this to you and we'd like to get your feedback we also attempted to put something every single month so that we were either doing Outreach or engagement but we were all very deliberately going out to the community every single month except for summer a couple months off and summer but I think everybody wants to break in summer the the other thing that we try to do was to incorporate some of the discussion that we've heard over the past month especially like around the budget where we learned that as a budget is being built is very important to include the

[01:06:00]
community and so we tried to be very deliberate about creating an event that is just about the budget so that not only can we get feedback on the budget but that's also a great opportunity to provide training to the community on how the budget is being built just a reminder whenever we say board member Outreach those have very specific Rules of Engagement rules about reach I should say in that you have to go with another board member there are always has to be two board members there so that the the same message is being presented no matter where we are so board member to add a little bit on the right now so part of the effort was to balance Outreach and engagement but also thinking about other ways in which people receive information and how we

[01:07:00]
communicate and various audiences across the community so thinking about how we make sure that we're inclusive that we're representing all voices that were not talking to the same people or the same communities are the same schools over and over so the idea is to do this in a way that doesn't do that that's Regional and I guess more inclusive so I think so that's really embedded into here as well and then the other thing is balancing that community outreach and sort of and so if we think about the community Summit Community Summit that we just had to release the emergency stronger plan essentially continuing something like that aligned with the timing of the superintendent cup so in collaboration with APS Foundation proposed a state of the district

[01:08:00]
every year reliably it would be going out to the community again presenting the date on how the district is doing and seeking feedback so that sort of accomplishes like I said some of the grass Topsy stuff too so an attempt to be both balanced and inclusive in all different dimensions of that the other thing that I would add is part of the charge of the committee was super feedback on related to the superintendent search as well so that's integrated in here too both in terms of seeking feedback from the community on the competencies and what the community wants in a superintendent but also to engage the communication the community in the hiring process with Community Town Halls so that's integrated takes the place of some of the other community engagement during the superintendent search process in full disclosure I've been gone for about 16 days

[01:09:00]
Lots happened and I guess in looking at at what at the calendar my only I think the challenge for us will be making sure that the Yazzie Martinez protected groups that we've identified for goals one and two that we make very certain that those groups are given enough voice particularly on the superintendent search so and I think I think we can work through that the languages

[01:10:00]
tell me more about the superintendent search but also some what about the regional Town Halls to make sure that we reach those populations certain way so do you have ideas about maybe how that could for sure be done well I think it will mean privileging those areas of town right but I will say I did reach out to president will be working closely with the firm and they're taking that into account or will we will take that into account so but I think it's

[01:11:00]
my concern which I think we all share that we need to be intentional about about that because we only have two Regional meetings that focus on that will encourage the community to talk about superintendent characteristics that they want so that are that are bored yes but I think to to your point with the hiring of the search I think the search for will they have been tested so the other the only other point that I did want to make real quickly I'm sorry was that we did in bed the the strong Rec

[01:12:00]
nation that board members do participate in this community engagement so it is it's not a requirement but it kind of is so that is in the government's policy manual as well so again so that as we turn over it is expected that this community engagement will continue so I'm sorry I interrupted no that's okay I just wanted to respond to member Milan's question around ideas because what you see in front of you is the deliverable of what we were charged with was the two year plan but we also did a whole lot of other work and brainstorming so there's lots of documents and notes with all kinds of ideas for different groups to engage different individuals different communities different ways to do it ways to overcome obstacles around participation and child care and media engagement so we tried to think through all that and have like a lot of recommendations for certainly everyone else can contribute to that as well

[01:13:00]
but this is just sort of the final very high level but there is a lot more detail this is kind of the the skeleton I just know what I'm sure everybody else on the board just wants to make sure those groups that are so often silenced that have have the Forum to have their voices heard that's all and I know we all have ideas about who they are and we probably know they're the same they're the same price same groups thank you yeah I think the challenge is going to be in the communication of the meeting set of certainly important how we actually make that happen is a challenge communication is

[01:14:00]
always a challenge to do it effectively and then also I hope that we can sort of keep thinking about the format in with how do we structure when we do have people there so that there really is that balance it is I think a legitimately hard balance between structuring it so that it sort of on point and and moving forward and we get certain sort of we get input that matches what we're asking for and at the same time the other side of that is that then I think it becomes harder for some people to feel like it's really authentic conversation that it's still a sort of a natural Challenge and finding how we balance

[01:15:00]
is tricky because meetings can run away and not not have any comprehensible input at the end of it so it's just something to be thinking about as we look for different ways of structuring actual conversation and I think if we do the different layers I think because they're two different kinds of meetings but I think we have a lot of development still to do on it and also figuring out how can we get the word out how can we deal with the communication part without overburdening staff because I think that is a real concern absolutely which is which is kind of to your point we were deliberately trying not to stop by creating you know by creating this calendar and we did have staff input too so I mean Joanna

[01:16:00]
Miss King and Dr Albright were with us as this kind of this skeleton came together so unless there are any other questions or concerns I would ask for a motion to approve we could ya the board of education is 2 year Community engagement and Outreach plan get a second I will tell us yes yes yes yes yes okay our next item for consideration is approval of the consent agenda 6.1 to 6. 7 5
