my name is Kathy Hagar and I'm an APS school counselor and I've been lucky enough to be chosen the APS school counselor the year a few years ago and to be considered the New Mexico school counselor the year 2 years ago and represent our state to the Department of Education and Washington DC I came and spoke to you all after I got hurt by an elementary school child in a Janet classroom in May and I asked for help I wrote to you all after that and once one of you responded and said you know this is an issue I'm glad you're bringing it to light I included the union I included Administration I got silence so I wrote to you all in June and I said you know we have to be able to inform parents we need to get an accurate account we need to find out what's really going on because I don't even know if the parents are informed one kid has been violent in their classroom kids parents I got silence nothing nothing

[00:15:00]
from the union nothing from the school board nothing from Administration sound like okay well as a good school counselor we need data so tonight can you turn that I brought data so I filed a Nipper request with APS to find out how many staff members have reported getting hurt to risk management I know people in my school including my principal and a special ed teacher that have scars on their arms from students being violent they didn't report your kind of discouraged to report because you don't want to get a little kid in trouble so this is the date of from APS before 2020 they didn't keep track 2020 you know part of the year we were closed 18 employees reported getting her by students at 8:00 p.m. in 2021 60s in 2022 staff members

[00:16:00]

[00:18:00]
I came here last meeting it was told that I came in here and I was hostile and that I was escorted out which was not true but it's been told that to outside of the house at I don't know where but it's been told that Sr morning in other places It's just sad that there's a lot of retaliation going on and things being swept under the rug and people being abused staff members are afraid to report even though they have their Union reps they're afraid to report due to retaliation I had staff members call me last week reporting incidents to me and I'm like because they're afraid to report to you guys because there is such a different departments everyone saying it's not their job is not my department go here go there go there no one wants to stand up and say hey I'll take charge for you it's all being swept under the rug in a sad I want I want to see change in pictures substitute ease everyone protected everyone at APS

Miss Rogers you'll have 2 minutes what you begin speaking good evening everyone board members Dr Gonzalez I'm here I am a school bus driver I've driven for 7 years now I'm retired from the banking industry and we're here because we want ratification of our contract that's up we also are having still the problem with discipline on our buses same as they're obviously having in the classrooms we're not getting any parental help the principles are not helping they just say go ahead and take those kids to their shops all we can do is write them up we have no say what happens on our bus essentially and that's a very dangerous precedent we're driving in Albuquerque traffic with a big vehicle with 68 kids potentially on board and kids are throwing stuff at us you can't drive like that you can't drive safely

[00:21:00]
so people need to take it serious my other item is we have a bus driver shortage we do have our raises coming up that we put in to get approved and we're hoping that goes through we do have a bus driver shortage it is a tough job just like anybody else working in the school district but we're out there on the road it's hard to control like you would in a classroom we do have the assaults that have happened on our buses I can give you instances of one of our drivers was hit in the back of the head with a boba tea while she was getting on the freeway we've had tennis balls thrown at us and pens and pencils and candy and sandwiches and just crazy stuff and when you get hit it's a distraction and any distraction when you're driving is dangerous

[00:22:00]
and so people need to take us seriously when we have a problem I know our managers and supervisors at the bus start are trying to do a better job but we get the push back from the principal saying well that's the only way the kid gets to school riding a bus is supposed to be a privilege not all right and we need to start enforcing that thank you guys have a good day thank you ma'am board members that completes public forum Thank you period Municipal School District number 12 and the Albuquerque Federation of classified prevent professionals and agenda item 5.2 acceptance of progress monitoring reports for guardrail 3 interim guardrails 3.1 and 3.2 high quality curriculum and instruction
