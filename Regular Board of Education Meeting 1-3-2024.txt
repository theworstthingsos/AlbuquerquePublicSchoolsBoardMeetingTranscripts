thank you thank you very much and now board member told if you would be so gracious to share a few words with us I love the money now I just really want to fall upon and this is something that I have always really try to inform everyone that I have a great great grandmother who walked the Long Walk of the navajos in 1863 just south of here and to acknowledge Native American people and our students within the district is vital many of you who don't know why the street Indian school was named what it was and when you go to the South part of 12th Street where Indian School resides was once the place where all our native children were attending schools and APS had no native children that were

[00:15:00]
knowledge within the schools there are 30 children maybe more of their graves that live there based on the Indian boarding school so I hope within the time in my term that we not only get to see the lens a different lens of what it means to represent our children all children especially those of color who have not only felt the traumas of what the schools have done but I hope that with this new incoming member and bring in another lens that we start to heal and that we start to recognize that we all have a responsibility and it will take everyone to make sure that this District does what they need to but we're also the primary example to the state of New Mexico and I pray that we acknowledge that leadership not only within our communities but within our homes I know I represent a different voice but I also know I represent a different Vision so

Google is a safe and welcoming place to learn in particular extremely grateful for seeing in the classrooms and libraries when I've gone to visit my daughter's class of course materials reading materials that reflect the beautiful diversity of Albuquerque as a queer woman my daughter is growing up in a home with two moms I'm very grateful for the fact that she can see in the material in her schools things that reflect her lived experience and I'm grateful that her classmates who may be black or indigenous who made of their experiences as well because if we want I could learn to read and write what better to read than about people they know what better to write in their own experience is support for all the kids in my daughter's classroom goes beyond just reading materials though of course very grateful that everyone in her school gets two square meals five days a week her school

good evening Happy New Year to everyone and I hope your holidays were good my name is Ashton I am a transgender man I graduated APS in 2010 I started socially transitioning in 2012 and hormonally in 2014 with new board members joining I hope we will be turning a new page of true acceptance and inclusion of trans and queer folk as a whole I am hopeful that we will look to proven period tell us how loving and accepting trans and queer kids is the best Suicide Prevention we have available to us I also hope that the white washing and censoring of New Mexico history can be undone there are many issues with our educational system that needs some serious elbow grease to fix I am hopeful that the new board members are up to this task

[00:31:00]
and they will use rational thinking to make Common Sense policies to continue to protect all kids all teachers and all staff in APS system when we are exposed to new ideas and new experiences and new people we gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a part of this planet every Triumph stirs Pride within us and every defeat sorrow yet with recent National and world events I believe it is very clear that way atrocities and violence against different minorities to save a few folks from feelings that make them uncomfortable has caused Great harm and long lasting negative effects on our society while I do not have the answer to this problem one thing we can all do better all due to better ourselves and our communities is to learn about each other and to stop being so afraid of things that are different from what we are normally

[00:32:00]
New Mexico is becoming a safe place for minorities who are fleeing persecution within their own country if we cannot be honest with how New Mexico became a state we what has transpired within its borders and who to this day is still deeply affected by both good and bad how can we truly be safe for everyone how do you say you come over two minutes I need you to wrap up in a very quick sense thank you all for doing what you're doing and this is an amazing historic day thank you thank you our next speaker is in Persona memes

[00:33:00]
thank you sir you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening you have gotten it from last year Thanksgiving month and also the the three new one the New Mexico so happy 20244 New York City on October 12th 2023

[00:34:00]
according to Medical transitioning of young people when are American clinicians paying attention Dr Katella 58 years old is a finished born and trained adolescent psychiatrist the chief psychiatrist and the department of Addison adolescent Psychiatry at Finland University hospital she treats patients teachers medical students conducts research in her field publishing more than 200 and 230 scientific articles in 2011 Dodge Dakota responsibility to oversee the establishment of a gender identity service for among the first positions in the world to have a devoted to treatment of distress young people since then he has personally participated in the assessment of modern 500 South Dakota in 2020 from 9:30 every systematic review of evidence today including

[00:35:00]
one published in the Journal of the endocrine Society has found the evidence for mental health benefits of hormonal intervention for minors to be a blow or very low certainty and quote you need to learn from such scandals because gender transition has gotten out of hand when medical professionals start saying they have one answer that applies everywhere or that they have a cure for all of life's pains that should be a warning to us and school board members that something has gone very wrong would you agree thank you sir I appreciate it or next speaker is on zoom and it is Marcy May I can get her to join the room she's coming in now I see you there

[00:36:00]
can you hear me yes ma'am you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you so much for taking time to listen I just as I'm listening to the olds that have been taken for a new board members I know that they are saying that they're there to support the Constitution of the United States and of New Mexico and of the laws of New Mexico but I want to remind you guys that there were several laws that were passed with regards to gender of the Constitution and under Marbury versus Madison to the Constitution is Boyd this is something that's going to need to be a vigorously discussed and I want to encourage I definitely want to encourage

[00:37:00]
the discovery of what has what was going on in the Indian schools if you and I've talked to people with personal testimonies that were put into boarding schools because they were taken from their parents because basically the public school boards I felt like the Native American parents didn't know how to raise their kids I believe that the the gender of care is also another slap in the face of parents to say that parents don't know how to take care of their own children and that other people outside of the family are going to decide without the parents permission or knowledge how to raise their kids adults that are they may not feel like this and they may think that they know better than a parent but many of these laws go against the Constitution

[00:38:00]
the violation of freedom of speech I also want to acknowledge that the one board member that was saying we will talk to all the pessimistic parents and maybe I'm one of those but we're still constituents and we still have a voice and that should not be negated just because we disagree we're taking time to have a voice because there are things that need to be said and like DRC and Ellis said if you have a one-size-fits-all solution that's a problem we all have a voice thank you thank you and we have one more speaker in the room was in the jar you have two minutes once you begin speaking sir

[00:39:00]
good evening my name is Rosendo Najar I'm the proud president of the Carpenters Local 1319 here in New Mexico and we actually just got done celebrating our 120th year so we definitely been around for quite a bit and we've been building New Mexico for quite a bit so very proud of that I'm very pleased to see and I want to congratulate all the new electives of board members I'm very happy to be able to go back to our membership and report to them that are three endorse candidates have one and we were elected at their hard work and going out there and hanging signs and knocking on doors actually does work it's a really amazing how the full circle just works Joseph High School teacher back at Highland in the year 2000 and Scott Helder was actually the principal who kicked me out of that school too so high school how you doing so the full circle is just great you know I'm here and I spoke to a lot of you board members with ideas of how we really need to help out at 8 p.m. on the construction projects and making sure we have actual High School

[00:40:00]
do it's working on these projects but also helping to get the trades classes back into APS I do a yearly field trips that we do to our carpenters training center and it's unfortunate that only three schools three of the high schools left in APS actually have a workshop class we need to start pushing trades a lot more and we just here to let the new board members you know you guys have an ally in labor not just the Carpenters Union but all labor and we really are looking forward to helping us not just fix the problems we have any PS but in our community is the full circle around a very long time for 1700 members strong just like last year we were sitting at 90 apprentices and with all the work that we've been fortunate to get we are now reaching the number of 400 with that being said we do need to work to put these apprentices to work and they could get a good career jobs a lot of our members are making well over six figures

[00:41:00]
I didn't even graduate high school so being able to give these students another option and putting CTE classes back into the trades is a real real high priority and I think this new school board I know all of you the majority of you very well and I look forward to working with you guys and seeing how we can fix that towards the future and I hope we can get it started but you know by electing a good neighbor friendly president tonight and and just get it going you know we just have an alley in carpenters and thank you guys for everything look forward to it thank you sir the board members Arkansas tonight we appreciate you being here our next agenda item is a discussion of interest in serving as a board of education officer during the first meeting in January the Board of Education Alex officers including president vice president

[00:42:00]
and secretary our Council of great City Schools coaches have asked that our current parliamentarian board member Jackson continue to act in that position until the election of officers is completed at this time I would like to allow each board member to say whether they are interested in serving as a 2024 officer and if so what position they are interested in and why please limit your remarks to a couple of minutes and I would like to begin to my far right with board member historico thank you Doctor Gonzalez I will say that I would like a position on the executive team as secretary so I will nominate myself for that the reason being is because I have been on multiple boards before so I do have experience in that role as secretary specifically I also understand that this is a critical moment for us to provide

[00:43:00]
but when it comes to agenda setting and you know just different things that we want to see on school board so I want to make sure to bring the voice of my constituents in that executive team and obviously it's not one person we still have you know six other board members that will make those decisions together with but I do believe that a young person needs to have a voice at the Forefront of this board so that is the reason I would like to be secretary thank you thank you remember to thank you it's one of these things when you realize especially since I've sat on two national boards and really think that my voice and what I can do in the position I'm seeking his vice president I think that one being a vice president not only is supporting the president but also making sure that we're running things as we need to flowing through and doing what needs to happen but it's also a big representation of not only the executive committee but it's also a huge voice and making sure that we not only

[00:44:00]
we're going to work but it's also this great support with the executive team that needs to take place I do know I'm one to make sure things are going through I do also make sure there's accountability and I make sure that we are following through and not staying stagnant my biggest concern right now is that we need to be fair representation of our communities and the issues at hand and that we need to continually realize that we have to work together in order for our children to succeed and to be who they need to be within this city thank you thank you remember Gonzalez thank you Doctor Gonzalez I represent District 3 and would like to share that I'm interested in serving as president of the next board I have spent my entire career in education in education policy specifically but I also began my career as a teacher on the us-mexico border very intention

[00:45:00]
play working to teach English Learners and to teach Mexican Nationals and to help live into this ideal of Education as the tool for advancing the American dream which I very much believe in addition to having spent my career in education with a focus on educational Equity educational Justice and racial Justice I'm also a parent to for school age students my kids are seven eleven 13 and 14 and so I've lived with them through the pandemic that's the reason I ran and I bring that perspective to the table to everything I do to every decision I make is always student-focused I'm also as I've shared a proud product of Albuquerque Public Schools as is my whole family and I wear that badge with honor and proud of APs I have all the last couple of years as a fellow for the national school board School Board Partners fellowship program and I've learned a tremendous amount from that about access to school board leaders from across the country had access to a coach and to a mentor themselves serve on school boards across the country and so we'll bring

[00:46:00]
add expertise as well I was recently chosen to be a new deal leader a national program for Progressive leaders one of only three school board members nationally and also recently nominated to serve on the national assessment governing board and other National Education board during my time on the last two years on the board I have been very active serving as the chair of the policy committee and working to Advanced multiple policies to improve instruction and academics here in APS I also worked diligently to pass our policy on smart gun storage and to improve gun safety in our schools I worked to bring sfg to a student outcomes focused governance to our board to bring us our coach and to get us committed to those goals and guardrails and ultimately to the Strategic plan which if elected president I will work diligently to continue to advance and to implement that particularly I want to say guardrail 3 which is posted here around the room which is really clear that we are committed to high-quality instruction culturally in linguistically responsive instruction for our kids and I will live that

[00:47:00]
strategic priority number two which is around rigorous instruction working to ensure that every single student an APS in every classroom every day has access to grade level content that every teacher in APS has access to the high quality professional development that they need I bring a strong policy a strong knowledge of APs of APs policy of Education policy of Education research and education Equity as well as strong grounding in Robert's Rules and as I mentioned before the way other school boards operate I have been focused this whole time on board work and being very clear about my role as a board member to stay in my board Lane and stay focused on strategy and I want to share a little bit about my vision for as we move forward on this board as I mentioned committed to the goals the guard rails in the Strategic plan but I think most importantly to go for which is around skills habits of mine and mine sets for our students but also working really intensely to ensure that we are

[00:48:00]
safe Equitable learning environments and focusing on school climate for our students this is a huge shift a huge shift for APS to have that I know it's critical that our next leader and our superintendent focuses on that as well finally guardrail 4 states that we are committed to voice and engagement and if elected as your new president I would like to work through actually bring a student member to serve on our board as well I agree with member that the student voice the youth voice is critically important and I think there's no better way to live in that then having a student serve up on this board as well the biggest decision that we're going to make is a new board is going to be our next superintendent and I am committed to staying focused on student outcomes to choosing a leader who is focused on student outcomes and then to supporting that leader and evaluating that leader to make sure we're working collectively to improve students thank you thank you member benefits doctor Gonzalez so I think that as a new board member I think it's for me it's best

[00:49:00]
to come in and learn the job before taking on a leadership position and that's just the way I feel but I will say that I'm having had discussions I am interested in serving a secretary and I think that my experience as a current CEO former Municipal Magistrate Judge lends itself well to the responsibilities and roles of this office however I do recognize that there are other interested parties in this position and I want to reiterate my focus on working for students and not getting bogged down in political battles that might be self-serving but not APS surveying and so no matter what happens I am 100% committed to the role that I end up with whether it be an executive level position or not so thank you thank you remember don't want to thank the community for coming out to welcome our new board members I see leaders I'm proud to see leaders

[00:50:00]
and members of the Carpenters Union all of you and bright orange and yellow ATF leaders leaders from the United voices for newcomers rights and las mujeres de Asia toward the university who are in the back they do great work in the South Valley and are expanding and to the many others Bienvenidos my name is Josefina Elisabeth and my name carries with it the weight of a rich history and that history comes to bear on the important work before us on this board student outcomes don't change until adult Behavior

[00:51:00]
change and that change starts with me that change is informed Guided by my life experiences and the leadership training I have been part of for this past year from January of 2023 all the way through December 30th of 2023 my personal history and the lived experience of not only my indigenous grandmother but also my Mexican migrant mother my union leader father and my public school experience as an English language learner provide me the lens by which to honor the pursuit of student outcomes I understand the need to improve the educational Journey for all APS students and families and especially those

[00:52:00]
students with similar Rich cultural linguistic and labor-friendly histories to mine which in turn enrich our schools and city in fact diversity is what Albuquerque parents and Community students value most documented in APS surveys of our community and verified by our community engagement events and Outreach work that diversity is and must be the Bedrock of our goals and it is certainly referenced in our guard rails as Equity something that we have yet to achieve and culturally and linguistically relevant learning and teaching those goals and guardrails resonate with me at my core which is why I'm offering my canned

[00:53:00]
I bring three important qualities to the position of word president my temperament and integrity the years long commitment to student outcomes focused leadership training and my respectful relationship with our Workforce and constituents because they are our parents as well thanks to 30 years working as a classroom teacher educator I learned from students and families who span for the most privileged to the most disadvantaged to be a compassionate listener and a collaborative partner in education to shed my ego in favor of preserving relationships to be empathetic thanks to 30 years of listening to the

[00:54:00]
wisdom of fellow colleagues ranging from the school secretary Believe It or Not custodial staff bus drivers to the nurse and principles to the wide range of classroom Educators I've learned to respect and to honor the thoughtful input of our Workforce who by the way again I want to stress they are our parents thanks to becoming an English major a Spanish minor turned English in Spanish teacher I am careful with my words and considerate of the process of second language acquisition I know words can create unnecessary riffs and unleash awful unintended consequences it was my students who taught me that I must either men those Rifts or lose the class I

[00:55:00]
who's the man riffs and to preserve relationships in favor of student outcomes before we were a student outcomes focused in short Methodist oriente Y Mas que Todo so myself to conversation and relationship building and I respect above all the relationships with our Educators something that my mother instilled in me because she said because they put up with you guys those qualities I offer as the foundation to be bored president which leads me to my second reason for seeking the board president I do want to advance the work on student outcomes Focus governance or

[00:56:00]
FG I just devoted a full year to leadership training on this matter the president of the aps board must have a clear understanding of and a strong commitment to s o f g and must have the capacity to articulate our diverse communities values and goals into the s o f g progress monitoring process in order to make it hours apses and New Mexico's this is what makes the work before usually exciting and full of possibilities for me to make foundational shifts that serve the 70% Title One students in our district we must honor guard rail number 3 with a focus on multilingual Multicultural communities we must honor Heritage languages and cultures for

[00:57:00]
tribes are newcomers and emigrantes to set the stage for successfully meeting goals one and two by way of high-quality learning experience for all our students especially those who comprise the subgroups of the Martinez Yazzie Martinez and Yazzie ruling plus African-American students in January of 2023 all APS members were invited to register for the student outcomes Focus governance cohort a year-long class that included school board members from Across the Nation aps's membership with the council allowed with the Council of great City Schools excuse me allowed staff and board members like executive director of board Services Joanna King former board member and president Yolanda

[00:58:00]
participate in challenging and rewarding assignments the most important assignment that we were required to complete were three sosg mindset practices these mines that practices were critical partnering with former president monthly according to reflected and analyzed leadership behaviors in ourselves in myself that either promote or undermine the structural Integrity of the governance model that stands for improve APS outcomes the practices prompted conversations with APS staff thank you dot conversation from the Board of Education staff perspective the practices

[00:59:00]
what productive conversation with our s o f g coach Ashley pause thank you Ashley for your patience and for the questioning techniques that underscored how the power of our title can be a Wylie distraction a power that requires vigilance most importantly the practice is taught me to keep my eye on the prize pursuing student outcomes via our goals on our guard rails in every decision every email every question in preparation for board meetings and every conversation as a result I'm determined to have a fine tune conversation and definition about equity and what it means as we pursue our goals I'm determined to focus on guard rail 3 for preserving and developing Heritage languages and cultures in pursuit of literacy and numeracy

[01:00:00]
are tribal and immigrant communities have have been clear about this priority and the details behind goals 1 and 2 make for a hefty and nuanced challenging Endeavor long overdue in our community and the devil is in the details and I feel like it needs to be said to those who did not have to learn English or for those who took a foreign language and may have forgotten the challenges of that process if you want to consider well I'd like for you to consider what one Spanish-speaking parents from the group and listen to me regarding our literacy goal up and then you know what learning English is not always so easy and our children are not robots we must listen carefully to what this constituent is telling us there's a right way and a wrong way to pursue

[01:01:00]
mercy and numeracy proficiency and the board signals the mindset and the direction by which by way of our progress monitoring sessions by the questions we ask in preparation for board meetings and the president is the point guard on these matters in APS student outcomes happen only if we lay a solid foundation framing multi-link are framed by multilingual Multicultural education that benefits all students and reference by the leader report which informed the Martinez Yazzie ruling it will be the job of this board president to keep that message at the four and I believe I am the person to do just that I hope to bridge Communications between the board and the superintendent and communities concerned with protecting Heritage languages as we pursue

[01:02:00]
goals Lassie United voices for newcomers writes the vibrant young females at Asia represent a few of the of such communities and in the case of our tribal communities Governor Abate them I heard you loud and clear at the last tribal Summit I hear your concern about having your language go extinct when only 10% of your children know that language and it is the responsibility in some capacity that we must Define to help our tribal communities in preserving and developing those tribal languages and here's the greatest Advantage Dunrite by keeping the focus on that he aspect of guardrail 3 all children can benefit from this multi-lingual multi-cultural

[01:03:00]
approach lastly and equally important I have a relationship and the respect of our Workforce our front light Educators they trust me to partner with them in this s o f g Endeavor because they know I believe in their professionalism they know I firmly believe vast research that indicates Educators in fact know what top quality learning and teaching are what top quality professional development is Educators don't need fixing they need to respectful collaborative partnership to address a systems problem working with our Workforce who are our parents specifically the ATF is the best way to advance our sacred Endeavor or strongest Educators in the classroom have something to offer I know this because I was one of those Educators but I was rarely given the opportunity to share what

[01:04:00]
play as a Chicana and as a Mexican Americana as an immigrant was reading and preparing and doing in my classroom Educators like me continue to feel dismissed and I hope to instill a mindset that rectifies us the responsibility to build a mindset a board culture that breeds Goodwill and collaboration aboard that signals to the superintendent and his cabinet that we expect the same Goodwill and collaboration from the top down in service to our most vulnerable students 70% of our student body period can I

[01:05:00]
I'm excited to embark on what this next year is going to bring I'm excited to have new new board members and New Perspectives and can't wait to see what this New Year's going to bring I've spent the last two years on the executive committee sitting as the secretary and have gained a lot of probably 10,000 ft knowledge of of how bored operations work and through sitting on the executive committee have learned a lot about how to set agendas and and and and policy work and finance and all of that so I think at this point what I would be interested in is to sit as policy chair maybe to move to a more

[01:06:00]
Dad can't think of the word now what were the looking for Antonio more diverse role so anyway as as my last 2 years have have brought me lots of experience I have sat on several committees including the strategic planning consultant committee that worked to hire the super the strategic planning consultant I thought on the superintendent search firm Consulting committee I chair or chaired the community outreach and engagement committee and worked on the committee for the governance manual that created the policy that now serves as our main governance role I have worked to create policies that have moved the district forward including instructional policies that require high-quality grade level material

[01:07:00]
go for students to succeed so very much within our guardrail number three I have also served as our time use management role as well as the parliamentarian I have an understanding of how it works to act as a chair for committees cheer leadership does require you to set agendas it also requires you to know when to move agendas forward and when to work efficiently it's all so ultimately to to talk about what board member benefits stated it's also to always maintain the focus on the benefit of the students and so I think that I would bring a strong background as the policy chair I can communicate effectively I'm not going to favorably right now because you know let's be on it but very can communicate a very effectively

[01:08:00]
through agenda setting through writing I do have an understanding of Robert's Rules of orders obviously sitting as the parliamentarian and bring a good student outcomes focused approach to to board governance so I think moving forward that is what I would be interested in is to sit as policy chair and the other thing that I would like to state is it has been very apparent in my past two years I do work very collaboratively I can work with anyone I can work through bipartisanship and through diverse philosophies and my main role to be here is to focus on our students and to make sure that every single student in APS receives the best education that they deserve no matter what area of town they live in and out of the policy chair would enable us to guard that

[01:09:00]
so that all of our kids can continue to to move move forward with the Strategic plan that we have created based on the student outcomes focused framework that we have worked so hard over the last 2 years to to bring bring to the board so that's what I'm interested in thank you remember Topia Romero hello everyone I am so sorry that I'm not there with you all tonight you know I'm missing all of the festivities and everything happening and congratulations again to our new board members truly excited to work with you all but we'll get right down to business because you guys know that's how I work and how I operate and overall these last two years have been probably the hardest yet most rewarding time of my career for me I'm actually going to throw my hat in for vice president and throughout over 25 years of being an early

[01:10:00]
education and be an educated myself I really feel like I bring a different Insight because I'm still currently living this this isn't something that I have done in my past or I've retired from but this is still something that I live and breathe every single day like board member Gonzalez I have children that have attended APS my children range from 8:00 to 21 and a 24 year old are only waiting from APS I myself graduated from West Mesa High School so this is still very personal to me this is something that I still live and breathe every day and I think overall we have gained some serious momentum of what we've been building these last two years and the new direction that we're trying to move our district our schools and overall our students in the right place and I firmly believe that I am the person who is going to continue that and be able to support our president and making sure that

[01:11:00]
can we stay focused on student outcomes that we maintain our focus on making sure that our students are getting everything that they deserve overall I feel like that has been something that I have lived by these last couple of years and anybody who's been able to work with me on the board can solemnly say for themselves that students come first for me it's not about our own agendas or anything else that we we we we we see in the background but truly truly what's best for our students all the way from pre-k through high school and Beyond because overall I want to ensure that our students even stay here and they're not leaving our beautiful state so overall I believe serving as vice president is going to be something that I can even be able to grow within our abilities as a board I've been had the opportunity to share the finance committee the last two years and to even see that particular Department grow tremendously and be able to make the shifts and changes that were needed

[01:12:00]
has proven that we are all able to work towards what's best for students I've had just an immense respect towards our finance team and everything that Mesopotamia and her team have built in our continuing to build and I am have been honoured to work with every single one of them so overall I feel like I would be the best fit for vice president and I want to ensure that we continue the momentum we continue the growth we continue to do what's best for our students best for the staff best for everyone who is associated with Albuquerque Public Schools and again if we move that needle for a PS we move the needle for the entire state so overall that's it you know me I will get straight to the point I won't add all this extra love into it and I look forward to the outcomes for tonight and getting us to move forward and get some continue to get work done thank you thank you so much thank you all our next agenda item is the election of the

[01:13:00]
2024 Board of Education officers nominations are now in order for the office of President I'd like to entertain any nomination for the office of president at this time I'm pitching myself for that position nominating myself I would like to nominate Daniel Gonzalez for president can we have a selfie nomination are there any other nominations for the office of president of the board if not nominations

[01:14:00]
I've had my son yeah I think we've done that all right so with that nominations for the office of President are board member Gonzalez and board member Dominguez the board will now vote when your name is called please State the name of the nominee you are voting for and Miss King may I have a roll call vote Janelle Astoria Oregon

[01:15:00]
Dominguez Courtney Jackson board member Gonzalez and with that the Albuquerque Public Schools board of education has elected Danielle Gonzales president I turn the devil over to you thank you Doctor Gonzalez and also I'd like to thank my fellow members of the board for putting your trust in me across the board even if I did not have your vote I still look forward to earning your confidence into working together with that I'm trying to figure out which page wrong the next officer position to be filled this evening is that a vice president so nominations are now in order for vice president I would like to nominate Crystal puppy Romero for vice president I think it has been

[01:16:00]
addition to have experienced members sit in the president and the vice president role she obviously has the experience as the committee chair and has proven herself to work collaboratively and I think it's just very important that we have experienced as VPS are there any other nominations for the office of Vice President yes I'd like to nominate newly elected and sworn in Ronaldo I think she brings a wealth of knowledge and she brings very important perspective that has been lacking and as long overdue thank you we have nominations on the floor for Christmas if not nominations are closed so as I stated nominations are crystal

[01:17:00]
would either of you like to add anything else before we move to a vote Yes I just want to throw another little reminder out there that on the one unique position I sit in here and the one area that I know that is lacking on this board is my knowledge of special education and also the Martinez and Yazzie lawsuits I have fought digitally not only legislatively but also in helping the the bringing about of this legislation I've also made sure that the accountability for our children with disabilities is key when we sit in these positions not only laws and policies specifically for Disabilities but also making sure there's accountability from not the top of all the way down to the bottom and I hope that within my seats of sitting on not only national boards but I have also predominantly settled for

[01:18:00]
tears on the New Mexico Ida panel I have set on the New Mexico Civil Rights Commission for a couple of years I have also sat on not only helping APS within their Community engagement policy but for about 10 years ago but making sure that we had family engagement and the educational policy with an APS which was surely lacking my expertise is not one to go lightly I have been an advocate for a Native American children and our children with disability for 26 years I understand the outside and inside of what works within an education program I am very aware of the deficiency of what is occurring within the district and I also know that we do need to work together but I also know that it's going to take expertise from the outside and also those knowing that we can represent and do what's needed within the district but I also know I'm a great parent mentor and I can also help the community understand the principles and the connections with why we're doing what we're doing

[01:19:00]
and to make them understand that they are also part of this voice on this board thank you thank you I remember Crystal tap your remote would you like to add an additional remorse I believe one final remark that I'll just add to this is just to remind everybody everything I'm doing is what I'm currently doing as we speak it's not something I've done in the past or have I used to do but it's what I am doing I currently serve on the Early Childhood advisory Council for governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and that is something that I have been able to do right now for three years and I was recently appointed the last term so I feel confident that I can continue to move the keep the momentum and continue to do what's best for our students thank you great thank you so again we've had our two nominations and the board will now vote when your name is called please State the name of the nominee you are voting for Miss King may have a roll call please Janice

[01:20:00]
remember to tell Mario another Town Florida weather period thank you Public Schools Board of Education the next officer position to be filled this evening

[01:21:00]
nominate myself Heather Benavides are there any further nominations for the office of secretary if not then nominations are closed nominations for secretary are as follows member Janelle astorga and member Heather Benavides I would like to offer both of you the opportunity to share any additional remarks and we'll start with you I just want to remind everybody here and watching that I have experience in education policy I have experience inside the classroom and one thing that I do not lack is listening to the voices of students teachers and Community when it comes to sitting on the board I do understand the role of secretary like I had mentioned before I been on multiple boards and have been a secretary have been vice president and president but with that it's not about the position it's about what we bring to the table and how we're going to move things forward so I agree with board member bene

[01:22:00]
this is not about politics or the political news it's about making sure that our students are successful and with that becomes change sometimes and I think my more Progressive outlook on policies and working within community and understanding social justice and what that looks like inside of Education brings a different lens to this board especially on the executive committee and again stating that I am the youngest person sitting on this board which means I am the closest one to have been in schools and I have not stopped being in schools I have run youth programs I have spoken to many different classrooms around social justice and what things need to be done to help our students achieve that success and make sure that we are proficient and anything that relates to academics so I'm continuously working on that that's my day job that's what I do and I will like to put that forward as your secretary thank you thank you and remember one of those would you like that I need additional remarks

[01:23:00]
yes thank you I do agree that board members highly qualified for this position and thank you for putting your name in I also do feel that I am highly qualified for this position and I think that my motivation to do this as I stated before is not political because nobody wins when we put our own politics in our own ambition above the needs of the people of the district my motivation is really having been a parent for the last Almost 21 years and seeing what my daughter experienced in the public school system and the good and the Bad and the Ugly and whatever I can do in any role and specifically as the Secretary of this board I'm going to do to advance the cause of the students simply because that's where my heart is and I understand the diversity of the community I honor that I'm glad to be a part of it and I don't think that any one of us up here has a patent on that and

[01:24:00]
so I think that it's really important for whoever holds this role to understand that we are working together and that we all are aligned in our focus on the students and their outcomes and so with my experience as a CEO current CEO former Municipal Magistrate Judge and how highly organized a secretary needs to be I feel like I am perfect for this role thank you great thank you very much for the position of secretary again when your name is called please State the name of the nominee you are voting for Miss King may have a roll call PLS in Dallas Georgia weather in Venus board member benavidez Crystal City Dominguez

[01:25:00]
board member benavidez Brittany Jackson board member historica thank you the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education board member Janelle astorga as our next secretary congratulations and thank you to all of you for that process which was a little awkward and uncomfortable to hear from each other and to really understand where each person is coming from and I think the board is the commitment to this District the commitment to our students and the commitment to all of the staff within the district so I love you woman women bringing that to the table with that we're going to move ahead to agenda item 6.3 which is discussion of board committees chairs and the meeting schedule New Mexico statue requires that Boards of Education have a finance and audit committee

[01:26:00]
so those two are required by law in addition the aps Board of Education governance manual manual which was approved last year calls for a standing policy committee will be discussing tonight those three committees audit finance and policy board members are all invited to use this time to talk about these committees the structure the membership the chairmanship that you may be interested in and we can also talk about meeting dates if that makes sense if we want to go there but I know sometimes that's painful to schedule in public with a group of seven people so we'll figure that out as we go board members interested in serving is committee chairs will share their positions for wanting that position so this item is on the agenda is just discuss it is a discussion item will start with finance committee and so I just like to open up the floor to discussion on Finance in here who is interested in serving on the committee and sharing this committee and if this time if you could also just share your interest and then we won't come back around on that so we'll start with open discussion on finance committee

[01:27:00]
I am interested in being a part of finance committee but not necessarily cheering it thank you I am also interested in being on the finance committee but not necessarily cheering thank you remember I think you're off mute yes I waited to say this President Gonzalez I would like to continue to share the finance committee place thank you is there other interest in either serving on the finance committee before we moved to agenda item 6.4 which is election of officers so the next discussion is around the floor to hear discussion and interest in

[01:28:00]
I'm interested in sharing the policy committee I have a particular interest in and concerned about gold one and two I think we need to be very focused and sensitive to the foundation from a multi-line a multicultural and a multi-lingual perspective we will get our kids proficient only after we honor those Heritage language and Heritage language and culture as a Spanish teacher I used to tell my non Spanish speaking kids

[01:29:00]
you're eager to be fluent it takes 12 academic years to get to fluency or proficiency so when we ask young kids to become proficient by 3rd grade just think about that unequal equation and I was one of those kids but I know that would help me with proficiency early on in my public school years was that class with Mrs Lopez who I can't tell you a single English exercise that I did but I do remember in Spanish

[01:30:00]
I remember her working with my mother to develop my literacy in Spanish first and so I have a special interest in getting this right and so I'm putting in my interest in Sharing policy thank you is there any other desire to serve as the policy chair and most importantly because of the understanding of what the difference between governance and management is as a policy chair the responsibility there is to to help work through the overall policy structure and policy statements that the board will make it is not the responsibility of the board to dictate

[01:31:00]
Pacific City into policy because that is a job of the the management of the administration and so I just think it's it's important that the person who sits in the role of the policy chair you know I understand what their role is and that is to to set the agenda to set the the vision to move it forward to the policy committee collectively but it is certainly not to make specific recommendations that is the goal of that is the work of the administration and is really what is more done through the progress monitoring that we all are a part of and not necessarily the policy so again I would just like to State my desire to sit as policy chair because of the the understanding that I have of what a chairmanship

[01:32:00]
yes thank you honey yes I just like to go ahead and throw my name in for sitting on the committee for policy this is board member I thought I would also like to sit on that committee great thank you any other interest in policy and I'll add just according to our policy to our board governance manual there is no specific language on the number or the format of the Committees and so it is up to decide us to decide how we want to handle those and so all committees are publicly posted all seven of us receive all of the information about every committee meeting even if we don't want it and so you have access to all the materials to read and you can essentially choose to attend a meeting should you want so should anyone decide yes I want to be on that committee or no I don't want to be on that committee if there's something on the

[01:33:00]
and you're interested you're welcome to submit questions through email as well as join that particular committee meeting I think one of the particularly interesting things about the opportunity to move forward and to advance and change is that the Committees can be small they can be three people they could be four people and we can decide when they meet we would of course follow all open meetings act regulations rules and statutes and post everything but there is some degree of flexibility there to have for example the zoom meeting or even to have the meetings be for policy for example quarterly or every other month again that sort of up to the committee and should have Forum follow that's up to the board and we should have four and follow function I think one of the things that sometimes is done is a meeting is set and then an agenda set to fill it and we don't need to do that I do want to add that we do currently have both finance and policy set for the month of January because we had to continue

[01:34:00]
in the absence of us doing our organizational meeting so January 8th is the next scheduled policy meeting that agenda has been posted that agenda is pretty straightforward and includes two things really one is just an overview of some administrative policies that need to be voted to essentially be moved into the administrative manual following our policy diet so there's a chunk of those that that committee can review we've also discussed with Jessica Martinez who is the staff person who leads that on behalf of the staff an opportunity for continued learning and engagement and discussion around policy review and diet so she would be the point person for the staff or whoever chairs that but it will include that so the policy review and diet as well as an initial conversation around the superintendent evaluation and so the way that we set forth the policy is it any major new policy that comes forward has

[01:35:00]
opportunity for edits and amendments second read and then a final third read which is a vote during that time there are two board meetings in between their which are opportunities for public engagement public comment for meetings with the community so that's the way it's currently structured and so one of the new policies I mentioned is going to be around superintendent evaluation our student outcomes Focus governance coach Ashley pause will be joining that meeting to walk us through the Council of great City schools and sosg focus for superintendent evaluation and the reason we're doing this policy I hope is obvious but it's also because the policy should the contract and the policy should align and so as we get to the point of selecting our new president and negotiating that contract we want to make sure that we're evaluating that person in a way that the line to the policy that we stated forward so we'll have that first reader that person will negotiate that contract and we'll have that policy moving

[01:36:00]
at the same time the finance committee has also been scheduled for January that is January 24th January 24th at 5:00 p.m. the way we have been running those meetings is because it's required by law and because there are specific according to the psab specific guidelines on what needs to be included in those meetings in terms of specific Financial approvals that does happen to happen have to happen monthly and it does have to have a board meeting afterwards to approve everything that gets moved in that finance committee so that will need to be monthly no matter what but again the chair can determine the structure the Constitution the timing of how and when the committee meets but monthly that committee will be considering and working with internet so we'll be considering that agenda and have an opportunity to work with her and her team on moving that forward and again we also had an ad hoc Finance I don't

[01:37:00]
who worked with our legal counsel to determine what is legally required to be on every agenda and how we can streamline some of that as well so there is a set of recommendations that will be brought forward with the finance team to try to streamline some of those meetings as well so I wanted to write that additional context because the agenda does say we're going to talk about timing and setting meetings but I do want to clarify that we do have two already on the agenda and then I think from there based on who is chairing and who is serving on the Committees we can work out additional scheduling does that make sense cool okay any other discussion around committees before we moved to agenda item 6.4 which is the election of Board of Education committee chairs the only thing did you point out that the board vice president serves as audit committee chair no not yet because

[01:38:00]
start back we will also point out that the board vice president serves as the audit committee chair so we will not hold a separate election for audit committee chair just the chair nominees for finance and policy but thank you for that we'll go ahead and move forward to agenda item 6.4 which is election of 2024 Board of Education committee chairs the standings include audit finance and policy but again board Vice President congratulations on that nominations are now in order for finance committee chair based on our prior discussion in agenda items 6.3 we have interest expressed from Member Crystal as our person interested and so we just need a nomination for that I will nominate board member Crystal happy

[01:39:00]
thank you so the Albuquerque Public Schools board of education has elected member top your room now in a surprise vote as finance committee chair so congratulations

[01:40:00]
the next position to be filled this evening is policy committee chair during our prior discussion we had interest expressed from Members Josefina Dominguez and Courtney Jackson and nominations are now in order for policy committee chair I would like to nominate board member Courtney Jackson and I would like to nominate board member Dominguez thank you are there any other nominations for policy committee chair all right if not the nominations are closed and nominations for policy committee chair are as follows member Courtney Jackson

[01:41:00]
All the Time Warner Dominguez Danielle Gonzales member Jackson Heather Benavides remember Dominguez is the top of your Romero member Jackson great thank you with that the other cookie Public Schools Board of Education committee chair congratulations and so I just want to we had some discussion on who would like to serve on committees and so I just will say for finance as the chair with interest from serving on that committee and so when we have this January 24th committee meeting those can be our members but again everyone is welcome and we're working through additional details of scheduling following the January 24th meeting along with Miss Opelika and then when it comes to policy we had interest

[01:42:00]
Express from Member Tom burrito and member astorga and so again that next meeting is January 8th at 5:00 p.m. the agenda is already set for that meeting and already posted and so will host that meeting with that meeting and then after that we can determine any changes we make to the composition or the timing or the schedule for that meeting as well that's sorry that committee as well all right the next Board of Education meeting is set for January 17th 2024 at 5 p.m. and the next special Board of Education meeting is January 24th at 5:15 p.m. or immediately following the finance committee meeting which is before that at 5 p.m. meeting are held at the Alice and Bruce King educational complex at 60400 Uptown Boulevard and live streamed at aps.com edu and with that the meeting is adjourned
