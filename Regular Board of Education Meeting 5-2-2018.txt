[00:27:00]
the Board of Education operates we want

[00:28:00]
I need to know that you're welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting in public forum upon signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting tonight there are more than 15 speakers therefore to accommodate the greatest number of speaker each speaker has one minute for comments within the 30 minute Forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield your unused time to another speaker you are always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you are not able to speak with in the 30-minute public forum the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn only at this

[00:29:00]
time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so I'm going to call up the first four speakers and have you line up against the wall the first one will be Robert Fair foyer Carolyn Bennetts oh no I'm sorry nevermind Overton and two more David Witt and Dan Bernard go ahead and start with the first speaker and Elementary School is the Line in the Sand for those of us that cannot and will not allow Wall Street to siphon off our public funds to line the pockets of the richest 1%

[00:30:00]
for decades corporations in concert with political leaders have created a narrative making teachers the scapegoat for all the failings of public schools but after Decades of this assault we are very aware of the charade that is diverted our attention away from the erosion of funding vital to a healthy education system the new narrative must look at the failures of the Martinez Administration to address the poverty that is devastated so many new Mexican lives as we have all learned in sociology 101 poverty equals low educational achievement not teachers I hope that ATF and 8:00 can work together to fight the egregious decisions coming down from the PED in must be remembered that the centerpiece of democracy is a free and fair Equitable education system for all people which means that this APS school is worth fighting for

[00:31:00]
good afternoon or evening rather first I want to congratulate all the teachers that we just celebrated I've known a lot of those teachers and have had the opportunity to hear some of their great ideas everything from stem to pbl Amazing Ideas but none of those ideas matter if the children that we are teaching those ideas to have to worry about being woken up in the middle of the night because a police officer is telling them to move their car or if a child has to worry about where their next meal is going to come from we need to make sure that our teachers know the children before the children can be taught that is what is going on here we cannot take an entire staff and replace it when we already have a new Administration we need to make sure that these teachers know these children at Whittier so that we can support these children we need to bring Community together we need to bring the district the citizens of our communities and everybody together with government to find a way

[00:32:00]
to make all of this work and the school is a you know it already struggling community that school is a is a Cornerstone for those children closing Whittier and forcing families to travel to other schools other failing schools seems very silly to me and the proposal also assumes that teachers are to disregard the large percentage of failing schools in the district I think there's something wrong with the way we measure that performance or the

[00:33:00]
a larger problem in our district so I think that keeping the school open and keeping those teachers there are definitely the most important thing on the plate all I have sorry my name is Dan Bernard on the library reading teacher at Whittier Elementary teacher I am not and because of that I will be removed at the end of this school year if we follow the Peds response letter I work with the bottom 1% students that are English as a second language five of my students are special that are not performing well on standardized testing I am being penalized because I chose to work with those students I came here at Whittier 2 years ago from Comanche

[00:34:00]
country and I told my principal I want to work with the students that are most struggling in reading and writing I am dyslexic I'm a dyslexic library and I'm proud of my school I'm proud of my staff and I want to make a difference in this community I chose to leave Comanche to work with Whittier and work with that Community please keep us open and fight for our staff and students thank you hey Google members and teachers our Union believes in his

[00:35:00]
an elected school board and local economy we know our elected officials and the experienced Educators who work with our students every single day know what's best for our students they serve our Union is proven in court that the PDS value added teacher evaluation system is based on flawed methodology with a polling data errors that same value added methodology is part of the equally misleading politically motivated School grading system used to Brand Public Schools as failing regardless of what the school board does or does not do tonight to address a punitive and educationally unsound demands of the pedias and Whittier Elementary schools are union will work with our lawyer to enjoying this MRI scan with the injunction currently in place are union believes in neighborhood schools we do not buy into the face Falls ideology of a market Base education system and while we support open enrollment with APS we know that what the PD is mandating at Hawthorne is a corrupt scheme aimed at least stabilizing communities and our public school system in order to promote the reforms and favorite Charter Schools we will organize to ensure that the parents

[00:36:00]
Hawthorne Community know this and are clear that the best place for their child is their neighborhood school to the communities and the staff members of Los Padilla's Whittier and Hawthorne our Union will always stand with you we've got your back good evening my name is Tessie Duran more opportunities to grow and learn in my career that I have been in my entire five years of teaching I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of myself and my wonderful co-workers at Whittier this last year has been filled with many stresses that have been far beyond our control and constant threats to our job from the public education department the rejection letter we just received clearly stated that we have failed many generations of students but the reality is the average length of time any of our stuff

[00:37:00]
members have been there is only about 3 years we have been we have not even received a chance for us to shine with our highly punitive evaluation systems and many highly qualified teachers with higher education and endorsements are now possibly being asked to leave at the end of the school year the same staff members have chosen to stay and work with our community and this High needs area because they have a passion for the students when deciding tonight the fate of our schools and teachers please consider the impact these decisions will have on our community hi my name is Gina Naomi Dennis I'm the volunteer president of the Coalition of neighborhood associations in city council district 6 were compromised of 17 neighborhood associations in March Coalition publicly support Whittier Elementary in Hawthorne Elementary with the letter from her entire Coalition that will happen soon I stand here today to emphasize

[00:38:00]
did the staff at Whittier and Hawthorne are highly qualified I hope that there is transparency I hope that APS only performs tactics to support the existing students and the existing staff these schools are the heart and blood of the communities in city council district 6 from Miguel Valdez to Dan Bernard to Tessie Duran and many many more these are souls devoted to our students and our families thank you

[00:39:00]
hi I am Michelle Skinner and I'm a mother of two APS students I am thankful for all of the hard work of the aps staff my sons have had a phenomenal start to their education and have built a strong foundation for their future here in APS my sons are passionate musicians a passion that began here in fantastic APS schools I love my that my sons have an opportunity to participate in music programs here because they support character development and research shows music education increases are cute and improves brain function and increase his test scores the likelihood of our students going in college yay wonderful and I'm so excited that we live in the world is one piece of that great community and they are offering a great opportunity for students and I come here tonight to ask you for your help in creating the strongest community in the greatest opportun

[00:40:00]
sweeties for students by opening a PS facilities for overnight use thank you for your time my name is Tom Robinson each board member should have received a packet it says GPS student account fraud that's Gordon charter school it's costing us 1.8 million dollars a year they were getting paid double what normal schools would get for students APS Charter School administration 5% of GPS is budget and cannot be should not have a third party that would investigate the this does not include the feeling

[00:41:00]
CS it has low student attendance low graduation rate high recidivism and non-existing parcc testing and you got my contact information if you did not receive a package thank you good evening chairman of the board superintendent Radio tonight we have some of the best Teachers Community in those schools need our 100% support but I also want to say they have the best educational assistance in the system they're from the community they work hard and they love their students so remember them when we're doing all of this craziness and ladies and gentlemen six more months six

[00:42:00]
months and the witch is dead but anyway with that being said I'm here for a very different reason last month or the last school board meeting you had some very eloquent students here speaking about suicide prevention mental health being protected at their schools what my ass tonight is as the president of the Albuquerque educational assistance Union is we know we know for a fact that a lot of these students come to us to talk to us because they feel very safe with us and what we are asking is that we have in our to be will be included in any kind of training any kind of further advancement to be helped these students at those schools that were included because we need to have that training and the awareness on where and how to guide them because we want and we know we're a part of that system and they do come to us because they feel very safe we're not a threat we're not the teacher we're not the principal and you do have

[00:43:00]
play some really good counselors and therapists social workers in our schools please take advantage of their their expertise cuz they're good people but our EA's need to know how to take care of those kids to or how to give them awareness and guide them thank you working in a community such as Hawthorne's has a challenges many of which are out of our control but that's what makes our jobs much more important my first year at Hawthorne I came on board when there was a mass Exodus at least 25 years and I wondered why then the following year I was the only one returning on my team and since then have worked with 13 different teammates in the four years so what I see as one of the main root causes of our current designation is not only High mobility of students

[00:44:00]
put High mobility of staph and part of that is lack of support and training for teachers but what I'm really seeing is not failing teachers in an effective evaluation system but effective teachers in assistant that is set us up for failure I personally have a designation of Highly Effective but have worked alongside some exemplary outstanding Educators who would likely never attain that status because they teach in special ed or I know teachers who work in other more affluent communities that are mediocre but labeled higher because the students walk into their school without academic advantages and privileges coming from home Hawthorne School the students and their families are the heart of the community and should not be transplanted elsewhere just because of someone's political time is coming to an end we will not be anyone's political guinea pig and I look forward to November when we when you systems are going to be put into place teachers are respected as professionals and students and their families are able to stay within their own communities thank you

[00:45:00]
thank you for your input that concludes the public forum thank you superintendent is not going to have a report this evening we've got a big meeting and we need to take care of the special issue so we'll go on to the special issue which is consideration for action on the response to the New Mexico public education Department's decision regarding the three more rigorous intervention applications and just a just a quick reminder of the process of a presentation to do

[00:46:00]
I think they have a PowerPoint presentation and maybe some comments on that after that we have had a few of our constituents asked to actually speak a public forum to this issue specific issue and that's what we can do in any particular time I know some of you spoke during the public forum we have a few about four little speak at this time so after the general presentation will have those comments from those people and I'll call you up and you will get one minute one minute each to tell us a story at that point in time what we'll do is we'll have a general Q&A from our board in terms of some of the things that are planned I think we have some response later some draft response letters to our public education department and we'll go over those letters in your presentation

[00:47:00]
what are concerns are about some of those things I had given some time limits here those are suggested I'm not going to be too too dictatorial about that but I do want to move it along because in reality the bottom line is we need to make a decision tonight May 4th is the deadline for us to get a response back and we do want to give a response back whatever that response is we want to give a response back so we will make a decision tonight so we do want to be able to do that so once we've had that discussion then I'll entertain a motion on whatever option we want to have during that discussion and will vote on that so that'll be kind of the basic process and hopefully we can get done with that within an hour hour and a half so I'm going to open that up for our staff to give the presentation and give

[00:48:00]
did the discussion on on the concerns that we have with these MRI schools and the responses that we had from the public education department so whoever goes first you're there thank you members of the board members of the audience tonight as usual I'll be speaking from my heart but the difference is that I want to share with you and experience that has left me baffled as you know we've been attempting to work with interim Secretary of Education Christopher and the public education department in an effort to design a plan that will move forward our media schools I'm sitting here saddened and quite frankly disillusioned you know me as an open collaborative individual I firmly believe that true leadership encompasses a willingness to approach in genuinely here what others have to say it is not about power it's about us sincere

[00:49:00]
effort to disclose issues and concerns and challenges that affect us and to support the sound plans ideas thoughts and proposals that Rise Up from special groupings of individuals who have a vested interest in how things move forward for their children as you know I have tried time and time again with every challenge the district has faced in recent years to ensure that there has always been an appeal to for input from stakeholders open dialogue a celebration of two-way communication and the acceptance of a collective voice that is truly valued these efforts have resulted in the aps profile of The Graduate or academic master plan acceptable inappropriate budget cuts reorganization of APs Department's reorganization of the district in to learning zones and arcade 12:00 continue that will

[00:50:00]
strengthen and bolster student learning this was all done collaboratively people were heard in my years of experience as a successful as a successful educator and leader I can tell you that no change or modification to any organization be at a corporation a local establishment or a school none of that can truly be sustained if it does not respect or consider the thoughts ideas feelings of those directly impacted any effort to force coerce or voice to plan on affected participants with no input or say in the matter is doomed to failure guaranteed at an initial meeting with interim Secretary of the 15th 2017 he pledged a relationship that included cooperation mutual respect and a true partnership between

[00:51:00]
PS and p e d it energized us truly we looked forward to stimulating professional dialogue between APS and ped and frankly aside from that initial meeting there has been no evidence of any of the working Alliance that was promised in fact the opposite has been true New Mexico School designations were set to be released by the public education department in October of 2017 October this would allow for at least 6 months of planning for these identified schools schools designated as MRI CSI CSI they were to work on Improvement plans during that time the MRI Improvement plans were to be much more details and actually were considered reorganization plans well the actual designations were not

[00:52:00]
at least until right before school is closed for their 2 1/2 week winter break in mid-December 2017 schools did not open reopen until January 3rd Los padillas Whittier and Hawthorne Elementary Schools were identified as MRI schools at this time the timing of this announcement even with a small extension cut planning time dramatically as the plans were due to mid February 2018 that gave us only 6 weeks to put together the highly complex plans of this nature but we did it we did it with our heart and our soul and we were excited about the opportunity to design a sustainable education plan that can be scaled up as a model for other schools we felt that well that good about the planet itself itself the aps team together together together with family staffs student

[00:53:00]
and community members worked with genuine sincerity and true determination to come together and design a plan for those three schools that genuinely reflected what would be best for their children the resulting plans reaffirmed the commitment of the stakeholders and the support that the district would offer it ensure the curriculum would be research-based aligned with standards and vertically aligned throughout the grades it ensured the principles and staff would receive higher compensation we successfully recruited and compensated some national board certified teachers who we thought would offer the expertise and experience regarding reflective practice that we wanted to be modeled at the schools the plan added significantly more instructional time for the children in Edition School leadership had already been newly assigned as had been request

[00:54:00]
it incorporates the extra genius hour to meet the needs of the whole child through creative Hands-On activities for our students it included efforts to welcome Community Partnerships that would enhance learning particularly ABC Community Schools which is sponsored in highly respected by the City of Albuquerque APS and Bernalillo County the plans were submitted mid-February the PED denied the plans in March with an option to resubmit APS requested a meeting with the interim secretary as no interaction had taken place with the interim secretary since December of 2017 Essence altered the measures from the original December application without explanation still we updated the plans and

[00:55:00]
we submitted in April of 2018 at the end of April just a few weeks ago we learned that Los Padres and the Whittier plans were conditionally approved frankly the measures and expectations expectations as it turns out we're substantially changed Again by the PED we were faced with confusing timelines directions and expectations the entire process had changed significantly was once more the Hawthorn plant was denied but no reason was given that justified denying a plan that was similar to the others the rejection emphasized that the school Community should be made aware of other schools in Charters that were in the in the vicinity for possible transfers for the students no other reason was given regarding the rejection a quote from interim secretary riskowski in the

[00:56:00]
spoke of a lack of confidence in aps's ability to implement the planet Hawthorne this was Bill wildering as ped had never spoken to a APS regarding our ability to implement or not Implement any of the plans that we certainly would any of the plans and frankly we certainly would not have put in a plan if we didn't think that we could do the work one cannot escape the fact that this rejection of the Hawthorn plant appears to be uninformed and an arbitrary the Peds changing criteria not withstanding we have taken one more look to see what if anything we can do to move forward with the latest information that we have received we have refused to give up we have studied the new conditions set forth by the PED what is doable

[00:57:00]
what is not however this confusing bewildering and perplexing experience with the interim secretary and his team actually gives us real concern about the PD's ability to judge plans objectively open-mindedness open mindedness fairness honesty Clarity and consistency are attributes much appreciated in leaders they are prized because these qualities ensure stability and that gardeners trust fair treatment aside we are committed to implementing the plans with or without the interim secretary support some of the conditions were Incorporated the spring and those can certainly be considered something that we have already embraced there are some conditions which have impractical impractical or unreasonable time lines and expectations

[00:58:00]
can work cooperatively with ped to discuss this and to set achievable timelines in goals we're still willing to do that and is sincerely hoped that ped can see the Merit of working together with APS to support the children I want to stress that the door will always be open to work collaboratively with the interim Secretary of Education always open however based on previous interactions I cannot say that I feel that this will occur I am sure if some of the conditions Outline by the entrance secretary I'm sorry I'm not even sure that some of the conditions Outline by the interim Secretary of Education or actually legal this would need to be explored before APS would agree to any such actions it would be irresponsible of me as superintendent of APs to enter into anything that is not legal in fact it

[00:59:00]
what is the interim Secretary of Education Mr ruskowski is overreaching far beyond his statutory responsibility and role this should be looked into even though the interim secretary has declined our seven invitation to visit these truly wonderful MRI schools I know that you would embrace the opportunity of watching the short film that I have brought tonight I wanted you to see the smiles and faces of the children attending these schools they are not faceless numbers they are flesh and blood and they are the center of all the work that stakeholders have done putting together a plan for them the plan is just for them these are the children who have been rebuffed by Mr riskowski not once not twice but 7 times it breaks my heart

[01:00:00]
I have Dr Gabriella Blakey doctor Antonio Gonzalez and Mr art melendres here with me tonight to go over some of the experience in more detail for you thank you

[01:06:00]
good evening before you this evening we have a bit of a background to illustrate where we've been throughout this process review the plan one more time and I'll go over the letters that you have before you for consideration as was mentioned by the superintendent the district was made aware of school designations on December 5th of 2017 these initial design

[01:07:00]
nations were committed by the public education department in October of 2017 however they were not delivered until December therefore an opportunity for the district to engage in the work of truly considering the designations in the plans that would be executed in response was cut down by those couple of months immediately nevertheless when we receive the designations the district worked with schools we had several dozen meetings with different groups including staff parents and community in identifying one of the four options that was for the public education department in response to these three schools under the MRI plan just to remind everybody those four options were closer restart champion and provide choice or significantly restriction redesign do initial contact and collaboration with the school communities

[01:08:00]
call three schools chose the option of significantly restructuring and redesigning their schools the work commenced immediately in response to this decision after Community meetings staff meetings surveys and input from these communities it's important to know that the MRI plan explicitly stated that if the district refused to identify an MRI option to participate in the MRI intervention for the school therefore it was incumbent upon us to respond accordingly with one of the four options and again all three schools chose the Restriction redesign option the original charge was really an opportunity just next door in the delay on Martin room to sit down with the public education department in his team

[01:09:00]
to really get a better idea of what this meant keeping in mind that Elsa was new to us these designations were knew it was a good faith effort for us to work learn and hopefully dialogue a little bit in reference to the expectations that forth by the public education department the cabinet met with the secretary designates team and I think it's fair to say that we left hopeful the information given to us on that December 15th meeting to the aps leadership by the secretary designate was to be bowled was to think big and guaranteeing that we had a blank sheet of paper to really engage in this work they committed assistance and collaboration along the way following the meeting as we reached out with the public education department he became clear very quickly that only technical assistance would be given to District to the district and school

[01:10:00]
in preparing for the submission of these plans we continue to engaging in several dozen meetings with all three schools December came and went the winter holiday passed and we came back from the winter holiday to engage in really a quick 6 week turnaround in the submission of these plans these plans were submitted in February of 2018 just a few months ago with an original plan which we will go over with you once again several board meetings were held to brief the Board of Education several Community meetings civil instructional Council meetings with the school staff to really ensure that he comprehensive and representative plan was submitted APS throughout this process invited the secretary in his team to the schools to see for himself

[01:11:00]
to learn from him to collaborate with him a true desire of good faith was put forth throughout this process to date we have not been taken up on that invitation that genuine invitation to collaborate in March of 2018 we received notice from the public education department that our plan was denied with an opportunity to resubmit well disappointed we met with the secretary designate with his team and it is what it was at this time where we receive for the first time oral feedback from the secretary we took it to heart we just did we incorporated and we submitted just last Friday we received the conditional approval for Los Padres in Whittier Elementary and they did not of Hawthorne Elementary's plan it's important

[01:12:00]
make a note that we have really worked in several attempts to engage the public education department throughout this process it is proven to be quite the moving Target as we have worked along this road as an example would be the original request outlined that it is the expectation of the public education department that the plant outlines that only effective highly effective or exemplary teachers be considered for continuation at the schools affective highly effective and exemplary teachers that was the original guidance that we took in the original submission of the plan in March when we receive the denial with the opportunity to be submit the target moved now it called for only highly effective and exemplary teachers yet again in the April letter

[01:13:00]
just last Friday the target moved again and the call now by the public education to the department was to ensure that every teacher at these three schools have a multi-year track record of Highly Effective or above we want to take some time to just briefly remind you of the plan that we submitted originally again as Dr Gonzalez stated we were excited to have this opportunity and we really did see it as an opportunity to provide support to the schools I think one of the public speakers actually alluded to that too that what can the district do to support these schools rather than penalize them and I really think that that's how we approach to this work is what can we do to support these schools and so we work together dozens of meetings with

[01:14:00]
team members teachers as you recall we came up with a comprehensive model of comprehensive research that we used of what we could do to really enhance the education experience for the students in the schools as you see in front of Dr Gonzales we used a lot of research we didn't just pull this out of our hat and we use research that was really grounded in successful schools especially low income schools because there's different models for different populations so we really took time to look at what works clearing house that's national board teachers came out of a lot of that work Community Schools came over everything that we could do to see what could we really do to enhance the educational experience for these students what we came away with again was the more rigorous education that centers on the needs of students both academically and emotionally

[01:15:00]
a well-rounded education we wanted to make sure that we focus not just on math and language arts but also a social studies science physical education and the Arts this is where we also added the genius hour which came out of the need for students to really have time to be creative this was extended by an hour of the day with Community Partners and teachers working together to help students apply core knowledge to real-world enriching activities we wanted a strong principal who shares School leadership with parents and teachers we took a right away and January we found new principles for these schools and we also knew that the plan needed to have additional support and training for all of our teachers and Educators in the school and we wanted to make sure that we would use a national board framework of accomplished teaching in the schools so remember that the plan as

[01:16:00]
who created it the plan was used as a framework and so we did keep it pretty broad as far as allowing it to be a framework that then could be replicated into other schools are CSI schools are TSI schools and really looking out what works in schools and what can we do in order to provide educational opportunities as well as have a sustainable plan and that was really important as to that it was a plan that would be sustainable if you recall our theory of action that we came up with was based on our community school pillars of integrated student supports expanded learning time and opportunities family and Community engagement and collaborative leadership in practice we came up with core beliefs that we all agreed upon which would include student center learning social emotional learning formative assessments backwards planning standard cross curricular planning and

[01:17:00]
sing and distributed leadership we use things such as Blended learning dual language we expanded Early Childhood we included the genius hour we included Avid we added the national board accomplished teaching 5 Core propositions and we did all of this with in collaboration with the teachers in the community one of the things that we are struggling with as we move forward in these plans is that these elements you see in front of you with every reiteration of the plan get watered down more and more because we feel like at some point we're doing two plans and we want to really be true to the core of the plan that we designed with the community with the teachers and not see that we have to do two plans and a lot of what we've learned just in looking at schools within the district that we've worked on school turn around is that they were very clear with us

[01:18:00]
it doesn't work it feels like you're trying to do too much and so things are being thrown onto the school and to the teachers saying you're a turnaround school try this try this try this and so we really want to be clear that we want to stay true to the core of what was designed and then add elements that could enhance it but not change the original plan I believe that before you you have suggested letters drafts to respond to the public education department on the May 4th deadline which is Friday I like to go over first the responses which are identical for Whittier and Los Padilla's Elementary School in these responses generally speaking there are eight points that are

[01:19:00]
emphasized in these letters the first has to do with teacher Effectiveness in this letter you will see that APS continues to believe that every classroom should be staffed with a licensed teacher over a substitute a real concern is yesterday was May 1st the opportunity to engage in the robust recruitment plan that we have set forth in the resubmission application March the opportunity to ensure that we have what they are calling for in a highly effective or exemplary teacher with a track record over time is a concerned remembering that there are 10 days added to these schools with a December July 23rd start date as outlined in this plan on APS will Implement its

[01:20:00]
recruiting efforts to Complete Staffing as soon as possible for the New Mexico State School Personnel act we will do that with intentionality and very swiftly to ensure that the plan is able to move forward APS will monitor the status of an Ensure compliance with the pending injunction regarding teacher evaluation in the state of New Mexico there is a real question in our mind in regards to the implications that may lie there in in regards to the removal of teachers that do not meet the highly effective or exemplary status with a multi-year track record there in in regards to that pending litigation secondly the second point is teacher compensation we believe that we can achieve

[01:21:00]
the feedback given by the public education department under that component as an accepted indicator outright the third point being instructional time we believe that we can accept this with the understanding that uninterrupted blocks for English language arts in math will be developed as soon as possible but some time maybe needed Beyond May 15th to do this work with great attention in the attention that it deserves currently this information is being requested by ped by May 15th and we believe that we would need a little bit more time to get this done well the schools will make every effort to have uninterrupted blocks of time for ELA in math however it would also need to create a schedule that serves

[01:22:00]
call students and provides common planning time for grade level and teachers all students meaning your special education IEP implications all students meeting your bilingual students RTI and so on the fourth Point having to do with Personnel we believe that we can accept and comply with this condition made by the public education department with the understanding that the newly hired principal at Los Padilla's and Whittier were given per the Peds initial request a 3 year commitment to assure continuity and any change in the principal and support principal by June 1 of 2019 will only be done in accordance with the principal evaluation system set forth by the public education department and the New Mexico State

[01:23:00]
APS is hired a principal for both schools with a multi-year track record of success therefore we find it to be unreasonable that one year of data would determine their employment status APS will utilize the PED evaluation system and again for the principal which includes the multimeters of effective leadership under the New Mexico principal competencies with regard to support staff including District Personnel APS will comply with this base on the New Mexico School Personnel act curriculum instruction and assessment we believe that we can accept this with the understanding that APS working with our classroom teachers will ensure that the curriculum instruction and assessment are research base vertically aligned and standard aligned

[01:24:00]
it is envisioned that a collaborative effort with ped and our teachers will be undertaken to assure the requirement is properly implemented as described in the recent to the PED Los padillas in Whittier will work with West Ed data center to align the standards again we may need more time than the May 15th deadline for this information to be submitted accordingly instructional materials for ELA are currently being adopted as we speak the next component has to do with the expected outcomes of community schools and we believe that we can accept and get this desired outcomes information to the PED with no problem by the date that they have set forth in addition we believe that a revised budget for Los pad

[01:25:00]
is in Whittier can be submitted with no problem based on the date that they have required US based in this most recent April correspondence and finally school performance and exit criteria we believe that we can accept this condition with the understanding that APS believes that Peds intention was to Los padillas and Whittier to receive a secret for three consecutive years beginning with the 2018-2019 school year as opposed to the current school year in which we are preparing to complete we look forward to that clarification from the public education department in that regard in regards to Hawthorne Elementary School

[01:26:00]
find arbitrary because Hawthorne has virtually the same plan as the other two schools there is no indication of the reason I was why Hawthorne was selected as the school that would be denied for some background information on Hawthorne which is a school I drive by every day on my way to work intentionally just to remind myself of the work Hawthorne has had in the past five years up to 70% Mobility at their school the factors that we use for school grade and for Teacher evaluation includes growth and looking at growth with a Mobility factor of up to 70% is measuring growth on 30% of students Hawthorne has actually been working side-by-side with priority schools Bureau at ped for the past 4 years voluntarily they were asked if they wanted to

[01:27:00]
dissipate in the tri-annual school visits they asked to do that to get the extra help and prior to this school year party schools Bureau has been working side-by-side with Hawthorne at three times a year looking at their data putting systems in place for them and actually the feedback that the priority schools Bureau has given to Hawthorne has been of high marks and that Hawthorne Elementary School is on the right track Hawthorne Elementary School's implementing everything that they've asked them to do and last year party schools Bureau actually told Hawthorne that they were a model for other schools in the work so we were quite shocked when Hawthorne Elementary School which is the largest of the three schools was chosen for denial again the feedback that we received didn't indicate as to why Hawthorne was selected Hawthorne has

[01:28:00]
in one students this year at the 40 Daymark we were given the selection of champion and provide choice for students at Hawthorne Elementary School those of you familiar with Hawthorne Elementary School may know that Hoffman elementary school has one school bus that comes to their school because the majority of students walk to school and they like to walk to school and that is their neighborhood school and so the students at Hawthorne Elementary School have been able to transfer to other schools since receiving an F as indicated in our transfer process students are at school are able to transfer their the second priority in transfers and they've had that as part of our transfer process and there are that if the student is enrolled in a school that has received an F for 2 years they

[01:29:00]
play second priority for our transfers in the letter indicated that there are 11 or so schools closest to Hawthorne three of those schools have a grade of a b between the 11 school closest to Hawthorne there are 70 open spots K5 those are all at different schools so if students do choose to transfer they perhaps wouldn't be able to transfer with their siblings they may have to go to a different School than their neighbor but there has been the open transfer for Hawthorne Elementary School we also have the school choice fair in October when students and families are able to come and see a variety of schools both our local public schools and the public charter schools and they're able to see what options are out there for Hawthorne Elementary School in the past five years they have had transfers

[01:30:00]
is there school people who may be aware of this or may have other reasons to go to other schools and they also have had transfers into their school in this since 2013 the percent of students who have transferred into Hawthorne Elementary School has actually increased despite their eighth grade from 15% to 24% since 2013 14 the amount of students that have transferred out has decreased the top school that students transfer out to is La Mesa Elementary School which is down the street and still in the neighborhood and the tops and I think that La Mesa Elementary School is a d School the top school that students have transferred into from Hawthorne Elementary School is Sandia Base Elementary School which is a b school and that is the top transfer in

[01:31:00]
first students from Hawthorne Elementary School so we just want to remind everybody that the transfer process has been available for Hawthorne Elementary School and parents are taking part of that and many parents from Sandy bass Elementary School are taking part of that to transfer their students to Hawthorne Elementary School and the superintendent will give us the recommendations going for from here so the recommendations and Whittier is a letter of acceptance but with the conditions that we mentioned and as far as Hawthorne it would be acceptance of the New Mexico ped champion and Prov

[01:32:00]
sing the choice option with the understanding that the redesign plan will be implemented as planned and with that Mr President thank you very much information

[01:33:00]
play of the variety of things that have happened over time so just to let you know that there's more in this letter a little bit than just that and the board members may want to comment on some of those things as well so I'm going to open it up so board members that have any oh yeah I forgot the process well because it wasn't part of my process I already had a change in the process before I could actually get it out and we have five bedroom speaker period

[01:34:00]
Hawthorne area and Senator Michael Padilla who is from the whole South Valley you know everywhere will also say and then representative Cheryl Williams also and so I'm going to have Mimi Stewart first week 1 minute me just to be consistent with everybody okay thank you and I've been to many of the meetings not all of them because they happen during the legislative session so I'm getting letters from the teachers there I'm getting worried letters from parents saying the teachers are leaving because they're so demoralized and demand I just have to tell you that I think the plan you put together

[01:35:00]
we had a speaker in front of Ellie a c I went over the plan because what she had been talking about was best practices everything you've put in the plan she talked about that day as best practices Jeanne Oaks from Stanford so I do believe that there's been a wildly misinterpreted esse idea that's been put forward by the secretary designate I don't believe he has the authority to do these things and I will fight along with you to keep Hawthorne open hole and moving forward with the good plan that you put together thank you baby thank you mister president and members of the board I mean first

[01:36:00]
play the Yes means a lot to me I was a student there my mom taught there for 20 years and my wife got her start there as an educational assistant in the New Mexico pre-k program so the school means a lot to me and my family I think what we're seeing from the public education department is gross overreach that's something that's been happening for the duration of the Martinez Administration and we're really starting to see come full circle now that she's going to be term limited out part of that overreach I think Madam chair of the LSC pointed out well that I think there's a gross misinterpretation of the esse esse in general and again this is for the course with the public education department

[01:37:00]
has been rushed in their plans we see deadline after deadline that come around holidays and I commend you all for the work that you've put together and supporting these schools and I'm right along there to support us Whittier and Hawthorne stay open and thriving cuz we have great teachers and great community supports thank you thank you Senator thank you Mr President and Mr Vice President one of the things you learned the legislature only comment on things that have already been said so I agree with everything that my colleagues have already said here I will tell you that I also have a very close connection to Lowe's Elementary School grew up right down the street and I will tell you that my great-grandfather on the Padilla side of my family gave about half the land where the current elementary school is to the district to make that possible because we needed a school in the valley to continue to build on

[01:38:00]
on our educational goals there I'm going to I support all three of these schools all three of these plans I think are wonderful but I'm going to tell you what what are the numbers 5054 and 65 have in common well what year was open in 1950 Hawthorne 1554 and Los peas in 1965 so the youngest school is 53 years old I'm only 45 and so the reason I bring that up is it's taken 53 years to get into this condition the PD has asked Now to turn this thing around into a situation that they wanted to be within about six months so I asked you not to commit to anything from a longevity standpoint that would shut the place down if you will within the next six seven eight months or whatever I think they need the opportunity to really turn it around and have the time to do that thank you thank you

[01:39:00]
I do not believe that ped has the authority to require approval conditionally approved or disapproved plans for regress interventions and I hold it to House Bill 165 that was passed in 2015 and I believe that you all might be very familiar with that that shows specifically that they don't have the right to enforce Improvement plans I also want to say that it was eliminated in entirety in the law which contained Provisions for the development of school Improvement they were not allowed to change Public School internal organization replace that for extended school year as a result of the plan I would like to say the plan does not seem the the process that pedi wants to take is not consistent with Congressional plan I believe the PED has gone beyond its Congressional intent and is using

[01:40:00]
play Politics on bullying on the backs of our children and specifically at Whittier Elementary School which is three blocks from my house low performing schools members of the board and Mr President is not a violation of the law thank you very much greatly appreciate all of the public forum speakers and certainly are legislators song Thank you very much and I appreciate everybody staying around today this is a very very important conversation we're having so much

[01:41:00]
Blakey you mentioned that parents have had an option to transfer students out of Hawthorne since they started getting F grades how many students have transferred out since the initial upgrade was Hawthorne Elementary School the transfers out have been in 2013-14 25% 2014 2018 %

[01:42:00]
Hawthorne had been described as a model for other schools from the priority schools Bureau is that from p e d school spirit and then my other question was so when it is been communicated with family members that they had the option to transfer out can you tell me just a little bit about how that was done it's a variety again this is my first year working with Hawthorne specifically but in all of our schools it's on the individual report that students take home that has their the school grade and it has the students data too and then the it's on our website and

[01:43:00]
play most schools and I just can't speak for Hawthorne cuz I haven't I just started working with them in August will have it in their newsletter and letters home to parents but everybody gets it in their child report that they take home and then we have the school choice fair for all students so I hope everyone goes to the aps website go to the board page go to the agendas and on there are the letters from secretary designate riskowski because I think reading that gives insight into how old is responses are I'm just going to read a little bit in case people haven't read it so

[01:44:00]
this is the starting point is how fraudulent the whole van and teacher evaluation system is that I will bet you that any number of those wonderful national board certified teachers who we honored tonight the golden apple recipients and the teachers of the month any number of them rated on this system are going to be effective minimally effective and ineffective because how effective you are is based on so many things that have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of teaching that goes on into a classroom and so to predicate everything in here on that van means that I mean really and truly we have got to proceed with the legal Challenge and I want to know what other

[01:45:00]
done what representative Stapleton just said based on the fact that we have a secretary designate that hasn't even been approved by the Senate partly because he refused to turn in his own resume for examination what by what Authority do they have it's it's our community that's paid for those schools it's our communities that uses the schools and it's not accidental that there is not a single School in this entire nation that's been shut down the nail on the coffin to struggling economic neighborhoods is to close a school and they will never reopen in the charters that may move into them and offer some kind of limited service will never open the door to every child

[01:46:00]
in the community and so we have got to find every single legal in road to challenging this now I'm not sure how that lines up with what we do I mean I would really like some good legal advice about what does it mean if we really and truly reject this what standing do we have how do we proceed because I don't have any Clarity myself on what that means the fact that is 2001 we've had these random targets of never addressing root causes never giving never investing in schools the way they need to be invested in of Austin I mean one of

[01:47:00]
one of the absurdities is that in the initial 8 points that came from the PED we were told that there were too many assessments and then we get this proposal that lines up basically weekly testing this is written okay if a teacher who currently teaches at the school earned a rating of Highly Effective or exemplary but then there's a rating of lower than highly effective it's not talking about any teacher that gets recruited and coming it's only talking about the teachers who have already committed to being in the schools they earn a rating of lower than highly effective they're going to be placed on piercing for you a good plan for teachers who actually are struggling into it really

[01:48:00]
in Secretary designs response Any teacher placed on part that does not meet the district's identified Target of 1 year of growth within each semester for an increase of two grade levels per year for every student who is not on grade level will then be let's see bottom line remix is responsible for providing transportation to those families to any school they choose for their entire Elementary School career

[01:49:00]
with no additional funding for the district which plays into this other Narrative of we have more than enough money the reality of how we've been devastated from education over the last 10 to 15 years is totally ignored so I guess I would like more input about what really and truly are are legal options for this we did in good faith a good plan a plan that we can be proud of the plan that should be implemented for every school in the district so what legal requirements do we have let me show me somewhere I'm going to be real brief the way it works is that until

[01:50:00]
go in fact if they reject what we're going to do and they decided that they want to take over our schools or remove something then we can do something legally okay so that's the basic idea we can't just do something legally when they haven't really done anything yet other than tell us they didn't like it so crazy it's not a question and just to let you know we do have that in our back pocket so you know we were going to try to work we're trying to work the best for what we're saying here and decide they're going to remove people are going to do whatever then that becomes illegally to us okay I understand so when that happens or if that happens or whatever then we would have illegal response to that if art has other things that great thank you she wanted to be real clear that you know the legal options

[01:51:00]
leadership

[01:52:00]
text in this context the supremacy clause is that federal law in certain areas prevails over state law in the Essa plan there is a difference given to state law right so what I read when I was reading all about when it comes to exiting out of you know CSI TSI whatever is it with the federal level but it is determined at the state level is that correct I believe that's correct so it's all up to the state to decide who gets to accept so I know if we had if we had had trouble

[01:53:00]
play back when this was signed into law under Obama in 2015 that would have been the time to probably really say something we let it come to this so I think that should have been something that we should have done back in 2015 when he did sign it into law so I know it says that Federal funding is contingent that in secretary's letters that Federal funding is going to be contingent upon the district fully meeting the conditions so would you consider according to this letter which I think is extraordinarily disrespectful to he's pretty amazing with some of the things he's done with with people in his classroom so anybody can laugh and it's sad that small people will laugh about people so what can happen there

[01:54:00]
I mean can the federal funding be withheld for the schools if we don't meet all of I mean we're saying yeah we're going to do this kind of so you have to start from the beginning and you have to determine if the s a plan is in fact illegally enforceable plan and that decision would be in the hands of the federal government and the consequence of a representation by our state that the es a plan is a valid in forcible plan when it was determined it wasn't the federal government can withhold all federal funds from the state of New Mexico and I know when I was looking at it one of the important things about the whole essay plan is equity

[01:55:00]
we always talk about how important Equity is for many of our children of color and coming from from you know High poverty areas and where we look at a lot of these schools are there that we need to do the best that we possibly can for them and that was one of the things that was in the title 2 part 4 and it's consistent with so 111111111 GB where it says we must improve Equitable access to effective teachers consistent with Essa so when we're trying when they the secretary wants us to do that he is going by what it is telling us in the plant in the season I think the plan does not have the measurements that New Mexico evaluation so there is in fact a separation does not speak to the evaluation teacher evaluation

[01:56:00]
50 states plans is grading of school grading of schools some are done a through F some are done with with stars some are done with you know targets colors and then some use a designations comprehensive support but that's something that has as far as what I've read that something that every state has to have correct it has the designation according to certain and most of the most of them wear were academic I think there was one part that wasn't but the rest of them were active and I think there are maybe five or six states who have taken what is the designation and moved to closure as opposed to assistance we would be

[01:57:00]
under this decision one of the six or seven okay I was just looking at some of the things that were just going on in New York that has a lot of children of color and from high poverty areas and they were blanketed with I think starting in 2014 with their turn around I know they call it something different I think it was renewal or something so they were blanketed with hundreds and hundreds of millions and they did some really wonderful things spending money for social services they had a longer school day they had more teacher training they had they opened up some help you know health clinics on their campuses and what we found is that I think that they're going to close 13 of those schools cuz with that money the last four years they saw that enrollment increase graduation rates in increase

[01:58:00]
escorts in attendance and the overall trajectory of the schools didn't improve as well so I'm I think he's planning on closing 14 more lower performing schools that's about $4,000 students recognizing that this expensive initiative at least he understood that it failed so and that was his that was his initiative so I think that's important for us to look at I just can't imagine all of us not wanting better for our students I was looking at one of their schools and they had 8% of their students being able to read at grade level and 3% passing their math test so if everybody thinks that imagine that that's a good thing for your students I don't know who would say that as a teacher I would never think that was good enough for my kids I was listening to a professor of education at Columbia

[01:59:00]
and he said what de Blasio is doing after blanketing him with tons of of support that if these closures are mergers I know he merged up I think dozens and dozens of schools but if it brings some kind of energy to the school with a new staff and different culture that that's not a bad thing and we're always trying to look at things from a negative point of view by calling people not nice names by threatening the governor's Life by doing horrible things like that we should try to come at things in a positive way and go what are we going to do that's going to be best for our kids and I don't know how we can because I did happen to talk to pedi today and cuz I think that's what we should do I think that's the right thing to do since they are

[02:00:00]
military is the leader of Education in our state no matter someone might not like them and we wonder why he hasn't been you know made a real secretary is we wonder that's pretty political so I don't know after talking to them how this is going to go across is saying yeah we're going to kind of do this because from what I was told they expect all of this to be done so when it comes to Hawthorne having us be a champion of choice but also carrying on with our MRIs is not what was written in the letter that he he sent to to superintendent reading so if we don't accept all conditions it doesn't say something with this option it says if we don't accept all conditions then they'll take the necessary action

[02:01:00]
is that what we really want to do to to those students and those families I mean I'm just I just want to know from a legal point of view if they're saying this I don't know that they don't have the right to do this art I'm taking a quick look at Hawthorne the interesting thing is is the direction is to provide the champion and provide choice and it does not say you are prohibited from doing anything else so you can do you can do one so I would say that there's no Prohibition in the

[02:02:00]
and I just want to make sure that when we are trying to use certain parts of a law or certain acts that to ensure somebody keeps your job and we don't want to we decide we don't want to use that one but we want to use this one because it's just in the adults best interest that we should be careful when we when we say things like that all I want is what's best for best for the kids personally I wouldn't want to have the secretary's job I think that would be a really hard thing to do I think what's best for kids is getting him in front of great teachers because we know and any research that that associate superintendent or that's associated superintendent Gonzales knows that if you get a Highly Effective Teacher you find a great teacher we all know who they were and it's not

[02:03:00]
there are great teachers and they make us learn they make sure it's exciting and fun and those teachers stay great teachers who have received and not just in New Mexico but across the country their ratings are you know not the same but what you find is teachers that are rated usually as highly I'll use ours exemplary highly effective 90% of them stay in that rating and we know when we're looking at teachers that are these great teachers they get kids to learn way more than an average or below average teacher and that is just proof that is just research base so I want great teachers around those kids and I've asked and asked what teachers are the great teachers at that school and found out the highway I think the exemplary teachers out of the 84 teachers there's five at the school and we want to talk

[02:04:00]
what about equity and caring about those kids of color and from a low income do we really care about them so if I could say I think that it's interesting that this whole analysis around the rating that is given to a teacher and I think it's a little flawed personally myself I wish I could come out with a perfect one because I think when we say there's a problem we should come with a solution I haven't been able to figure out a better way to do it because I think that's for teachers out there I think it's not perfect but if we're going to complain about something then we should come with a solution and find a great one that I'm sure somebody can so just just as you say that I don't disagree at all great teachers are great teachers the irony is that the data that was presented in that lawsuit that is referred to indicates that

[02:05:00]
there is up and down and exemplary teachers in fact do not always stay exemplary and below average teachers become exemplary and that's part of the analysis that I think may end up being something that the presiding judge either tells us to do or guides PED in school districts to do because it's their human beings and circles so I don't know that's that's just my opinion I think there's always a way to be nice and to respect people extended to the secretary and there's an opportunity not to be disrespectful

[02:06:00]
I hope that happens I'm an optimist and I don't have in fact I've only met the secretary once for about 10 seconds so I have nothing for against him I just hope I'm an optimist and I hope it works we have to believe believe in the best in people that they have the if you're a secretary of education we're hoping that we have the I hope I hope that there can be true collaboration between ped and APS and the merits of both sides can be understood in that the kids and recognizing people I just need clarification regarding Blakely West End

[02:07:00]
organization that helps in unpacking standards and creating Curriculum maps and so we've used them before in unrolling common core standards and so it's a group that can come in and help the teachers know it's a an agency consultants and it completely has marginalized a community of color and so this in itself is racist to begin with I don't think we need to stop

[02:08:00]
it's clearly flies on the face of racism thank you very much that you put together actually you use extraordinary restraint I don't see them as disrespectful at all in fact I really think that we should a little bit more because what we got from this cabinet secretary or acting designated Secretary of incredibly disrespectful they change the the the the guidelines that they initially gave us over and over again

[02:09:00]
and I think that the secretary rostowski has has been absolutely disrespectful towards this board you don't meet with one board member and expect that you have a sense of the Board of Education this board of education was elected we were all elected we each have 1/7 of say in coming up with the direction of where we go and what we decide and what we go what we decide is actually a recommendation to the superintendent we don't but we do have a sense of what our communities I think and I have been out for the last nine years 10 years on the board talking to poor people who go to these so-called F schools I don't believe we have asked schools I think we have schools that are struggling for all kinds of

[02:10:00]
what's the reasons some of which boils down to what a young person can do on a test but it's not just the test that determines whether or not a teacher is effective or a school is an A or an F you know I think that reasoning is flawed has been flawed from the get-go and unfortunately I was involved in the Essa discussions like the superintendent and a lot of you went to those discussions at least four or five of them and when I went I gave input I listened I suggested comments that would help develop a good plan none of those comments by the way were incorporated into that plan what they came up with and how they came up with it is beyond me we had so many people there and we work hard to collaborate to work together with this Administration so

[02:11:00]
I just have to I have to do a reality check here and say I don't think we're being disrespectful at all in fact I think it's time that we assert ourselves and that we say no not going to play thank you I beg to differ with all of the issues that have confronted and to call them small because of the frustration that they have had in trying to make this work is I think and then to turn around and talk about respect

[02:12:00]
is hard to listen to that said I I want I know I can we just keep it down a little bit we do want to get through this and I know I know what you guys are feeling okay but let's keep it keep it a little bit quiet okay go ahead I do need to know I mean this is a serious issue every every everything that we have submitted his come back to us with new qualifiers with new demands

[02:13:00]
if we say yeah we'll we'll work at complying with champion and provide Choice how do we how do we have any sense that what we do will not be overwritten you know we can we can say yeah this is an opportunity but here's what we are committed to for your school we have a good plan we know that by holding on to committed staff having the opportunities for staff and for children to move forward at Hawthorne how do we know that it's not going to be just over riding again with having complied with someone's non-specific ideas of what it means to offer choice in the same thing with Whittier and yes I mean

[02:14:00]
how do we have any sense because there's never been a road map we have gone to Essa I mean the doctor Blakey Dr Gonzalez I know have gone through the law gone through what has been in the Essa proposal crafted crafted our submission so that it would comply with Essa and it's been turned down so I need to know I mean I need to know how I'm going to vote on this because I really don't I don't know what I mean I can I can listen I think that the letters for from superintendent we're written with good intention I don't know how I can vote if we have no sense of what the response is going to be and then what free

[02:15:00]
weather

[02:16:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:17:00]
that's what are our responses we have to put a response back even if we do disagree with some aspects of it and we do and we have that in the letter if they in fact decide not to in fact accept that and to do then what we'll do is we'll go ahead and Implement our MRI plans and if they try to remove people or if they try to suspend the Board of Education or whatever it is they do we will in fact responsibility is there any point at which by saying that we're going to try to comply that it closes the door on the legal action if that makes

[02:18:00]
at what because it is so amorphous because it is so unclear do we say we're going to try to comply with these agreements and then when when they go that Step Beyond then the legal the legal argument is but you said you would comply so you have no standing for legal action is there is there a point at which we close the door for pursuing legal action whether it's on the point of view of these are schools that were built by our community or whether it's we're trying to comply with with some element of teacher qualification in the alternative because these teachers don't exist I mean they do not exist special ed teachers that are

[02:19:00]
highly effective or exemplary with multi-year track records do not exist do language teachers that have multi-year track records of being highly effective or exemplary do not exist and so then who Staffing our schools at what point do we I think your question is is well stated in others the question is is are we in fact shutting off some legal options by simply saying we're going to try to apply and others by actually indicating that does that maybe say that anything legally because he said that's the question and I can't answer that question I'm not even directly but you can take a shot at it Mr President

[02:20:00]
what's the path forward is rejected then secretary will have acted and there will be recourse by APS if the secretary says I accept your conditions let's move forward collaboratively then in the world we live in we would be moving forward with our plan and collaboration with the secretary which I think is what everyone wants to happen which is to serve the kids and those communities so I'm not sure that a Cooperative effort is a bad thing I don't disagree with you that at some point six months from now or a year from now someone could say you fail to fulfill the commitment

[02:21:00]
that says

[02:22:00]
are reliable and valid for use and I Know It reliability means and I know about it for use means and we have not been shown any of that you understand the assessment itself has to be reliable before it can actually be valid for you it can be reliable but not be valid for use not reliable so this is assessments are really the foundation for nearly everything we're talking about the foundation for school grades their foundation for the proficiencies of our students the foundation for growth of our students the foundation for the greatest self the foundation or a large part of the foundation for the teacher evaluation itself is not been shown to be liable and you legislators by the way have required that by a state

[02:23:00]
required the department to show that they are in fact reliable I have seen no reliability numbers and I Know It reliability and there's several aspects to the reliability one aspect is this assessment itself one aspect is even the grading of the assessment in other words when you have people who are arbitrary in my mind grading written information on an assessment that may not be consistent as you're going from greater to Greater and so forth that has not been shown to be reliable there are many aspects of I have a lot of research here but I'm going to just give you one this is from the American Education Association and they did this this relationship and if anybody wants him I'll just read a little part of it this is from

[02:24:00]
play November of 2015 which is almost 2016 know this is fairly recent says in a statement released today the American Education and Research Association advisors those using or considering the use of value-added models about the scientific and Technical limitations of these measures for evaluating Educators and programs that prepared teachers the statement approved by the aera council cautions against the use of them for high stakes decisions regarding Educators in recent years many states have attempted to use van to determine the contributions of Educators or the programs in which they are trained to Student Learning outcomes as captains statement speaks to the formidable statistical and methodological issues involving and isolating either the effects of Educators or teacher preparation programs from a complex set of factors that shape student performance

[02:25:00]
this statement draws on the leading testing statistical and methodological Expedition the field of Education research and related to sciences and on the highest standards that guide education research and its applications in policy and practices said the AER executive director for lease living and I have a lots of data and lots of information and so the bottom line to me is that we have a legal requirement that these assessments be shown to be reliable I have seen no reliability numbers consequently I could just say right now you can't use any of this for the way you're using it legally because it's required I don't have to go very much farther than that okay now the question is is is is is is some of this is some value and the answer is yes I think some of it is I'm not saying it's not something

[02:26:00]
that's why we do this that's why we do research that's why we look at this information guys and I'm you know if anybody wants to challenge me on this I'll be more than happy I'll be more than happy to talk to him about it you know if you want to talk about what what evidence-based means for evidence informed I'd be more happy to talk about that terminology there's evidence based means the statistical validation of it there's nothing so now the question is well I don't want to argue about this I just want to do something better you know I want to do something that's valuable I want to do something like that education

[02:27:00]
so if in fact we are being held to standards of performance here that I can't agree with yes it is a problem it is a problem okay and that's the issue we have to deal with that's what board member of Peterson's basically question is what are we going to do if in fact we don't improve in the manner that we were supposed to improve when in reality I'm not sure I agree with you without so we have to do is we have to understand the system better and we have to understand better ways to do it and I agree I agree that we need to we need to work on that legislature needs to work on that we need to work on that we in APS need to work with the legislature on that okay right now we have the question what are we going to do for the next whatever time we have we're going to have a new governor we're probably going to have a new public education department and there may be changes in the law that's what we're talking about when we talked about legal issues see it if we agree to something but legally

[02:28:00]
what what we're doing with evaluations or how a great things or whatever then we are going to need to adhere to that rule whatever the state statute comes out to be whatever the rules are will have to do that right now we have to basically adhere to what we're doing with in terms of our current status okay and so the question is is do we just simply say we don't agree at all and so go away we're just going to do our MRI and then whatever happens happens or do we say let's let's try again let's see if we can get started here get our schools running and and do something positive with this Administration the question is how do we do that okay so I think what the administration has put together is is it to try to do that that's the point they agree with everything at all they agreed to try the best

[02:29:00]
started we got to make sure that our schools understand they're going to be open we got to make sure our schools understand we're going to do the best job we can to address exactly what Mueller again says tonight is to improve our students and prove the education for students the weather we agree in terms of how to do that or whatever that's something else okay so I think again all of our board members have had some concerns we've had some thoughts about where we're going with this but the bottom line we have to make a decision tonight is relative to these letters that we have that's what we would submit back to the public education department I do have one minute I couldn't possibly Read days without having a minor in it you know and I'm telling you again I don't try to find these

[02:30:00]
buddy in the first second third paragraph of the Hawthorne plan the 1 23/4 line there's an extra the It should read but for your statement in the Albuquerque Journal instead of but for the statement so you can make that connection to have a two-year growth every year it's not going to happen every student statistically impossible

[02:31:00]
you know my brother was probably that student you know you know so we know that we know that there are a lot of things in here that are just you know I wrote down because I wanted to say to myself have I really looked at this carefully have I carefully looked at this and thought about it and I got to write it down because I forget you know so I got right now but I'm not going to go over all those I I think we got to do the best job we can and we'll see how that works out and so what I'd like to do is kind of go on to what I call the next phase which is we have three letters here with at least one minor correction and I guess you like to vote individually on these would you like to

[02:32:00]
accept them as they are all three would you I'm open to suggestions from the board and you and we will have a roll call as we do this cuz I want to make sure it's clear how we vote I want to make sure it's clear in terms of what we really plan to do going forward and I don't disagree a bit with a lot of the concerns and I don't disagree a bit with with the kind of things that board member Peterson brought up is how do we know whether we're going to get put in a bad position but you know we got to get our schools going we got it got to do with plans that we said we're going to do we got to go do that I tell you right now I think the stuff that they put together is fantastic I have looked at the research I have listened to Jenny Oaks and everything she stated was right there in the play she's talked about the genius hours by the way is being taught by the teacher in other words

[02:33:00]
call experiential learning so we're doing a lot of the great things we're extending the school year you know maybe that's something we need to do for all of our thing that's that's something to start thinking about guys you know so there are a lot of things here that are what what we said here is this is a foundation not just for the schools it's a foundation for how we might start to be thinking about all of our schools and not just the CSI and TSI I'm talking about all of our schools you know and I'm really proud of him for thinking that way because I'm a big a big believer in in sustainability what we're doing and scaling it to how we need to do it we got a 1899 and probably these plants are working every single one of them every single one of them not just our MRI store

[02:34:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:35:00]
the intent absolutely vote for and that's another discussion item I have that on my agenda and my process right if we vote no on whatever we propose then the question is OK Google what are we going to vote for what are we going to do and so we may have another discussion here and we could be here a little longer the best of my ability let me return to what the secretary said in his letter which is that APS by May 4th must accept the conditional approval and if we don't he will take all available in appropriate actions including clothing

[02:36:00]
conditions on it that cereal possibility and then we have a straight in a way we have a straightforward path then it's not necessarily the path we want but it's clear what we do at that point yes however my my great hope is that there will be Merit scene in working together and write navigating through these conditions on both sides if there is a right here in the letter it says if they don't like our response they will take all the available and appropriate action which may include taking the necessary steps to close the school so I don't know if they want to wait a year before they make that decision or they want to wait a week or a day but we will have an answer and at that point it will be your turn as a board and with the Superman

[02:37:00]
that's all I can tell you is that's what's in the letter we have to respond by May 4th and if we do not we're going to say this conditionally accepting the conditional approval the secretary will have to weigh that careful so in other words so we are not going to wait around for a response we are going to go and Implement a plan so much the responses

[02:38:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:39:00]
Nicki Minaj Oregon I would like to thank greatly the audience for being here I want to let you know that this board of education is 100% behind our schools we will in fact keep our schools open we will in fact Implement plans to improve our schools and if we have to legally fight for that we will do that

[02:40:00]
song I don't want to let you know that we want our community to support us in this so all of our communities need to be together our legislators need to be together our neighborhoods I appreciate greater than the neighborhood person coming here and speaking and saying that Coalition in the neighborhood just helps out one of the things we have with Community Schools guys is that we're trying to expand our capacity we cannot do it alone we have to have our businesses we need to have our parents we need to have all of our community and we need it and that's what our plan is about is having that community so we want everybody to be part of this and I want you to have a voice so if you want to do something you can write the secondary you can say we want this way we want it here and and we know

[02:41:00]
what do we have a lot of schools that in fact need help and that's what this plan is going to try to Pilot to some extent how we help all of our schools and so we want to do that so thank you very much for being here I'm not sure where I am in my my order here but let me see if I can find something to do at the end we do have board member comments with parents who wants to do something visible for parents to let parents and families in the community know that we are committed to the schools that we are behind you let us know so we can be there okay I have no president's report so the next Board of Education meeting
