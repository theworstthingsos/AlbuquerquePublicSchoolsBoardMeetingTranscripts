[00:05:00]
presenters are not Apodaca Chief Financial Officer Mark Turnbull executive director of accounting and Amanda Boyle District controller in accounting the floor is yours thank you thank you so much this presentation that we provided in your packet is on APS internal controls it's actually a presentation that we had presented probably a year ago and I know that board member Courtney Jackson really appreciated the presentation and said she wished when she started on the board that she would have known this information so we thought it was relevant to bring it now that we do have new board members so if you go to page 14 of 28 it is the introduction and I will

[00:06:00]
hand it over to Mark to talk about that slide or miss a foil about the statutes and the best practices that we follow oops you're on mute Mark are you still on mute yourself

[00:07:00]
which each school district is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure including board policies and procedures and is also responsible for ensuring that the school district complies with laws and regulations applicable to state and federal programs we also have a certain accounting regulations regarding our internal controls such as the Canadian sponsoring organizations of Sherway commission coso American Institute of certified public accountants standards for internal control in the federal government thank you Mark next slide

[00:08:00]
15 of 28 we list the three types of controls that we definitely concentrate on and these help reduce the risk of fraud waste and abuse so we have preventive controls detective controls and corrective controls and really you want to be really heavy on preventive controls because these are the ones that help deter or prevent an adverse event from happening so you want to really be happy there then the next is the detective and these are the controls that help us discover or detective there is an issue and then the last one of horses corrective and these are the controls that are implemented whenever we detect something that the control might not have worked the way we thought it had and these of course are the ones that are more costly because

[00:09:00]
it it's usually a control that's after the fact so like I said we really really try to identify prevention and detective and then of course corrective are important so I'm going to go to the next page and Miss Amanda if you want to talk a little bit about that slide sure so this slide has some examples of each of the types of controls so some preventive controls include things like segregation of Duties which is another way to think of it is checks and balances we have levels of approvals verification custodianship and training and stuff awareness is a big preventive control our detective controls include audits reconciliations financial reporting inventories financial statements variance reports and whistleblower activity and then our corrective controls include root cause analysis disciplinary

[00:10:00]
action new or updated policies or processes more training and then corrective action plans thank you Amanda if you go to the next slide which is preventive controls this right here kind of has like an overall District so it's not an exhaustive list but if you want to talk about a couple of those sure again the preventive controls as I mentioned training is a big one or pre-employment screening making sure people are background checks is another big one assets making sure all our assets are tagged and tracked in our system followed up on we have pre-approvals for things like travel and purchases and then the other really big one would be the segregation of duties or the checks and balances that includes role based permissions

[00:11:00]
site and different levels of approvals and yeah just levels of approvals is a good preventive control thank you and next we also were able to identify different controls at each department so here in the slide you'll see the budget has its own preventive controls and then procurement of course has its own preventive controls on budget we do have different thresholds where we require different approvals so as noted here a site admin might have 10,000 but then is it goes up it also needs control agent period you'll see those in the finance committee the transfer

[00:12:00]
and they all go to PD so PD also has to approve them and when we put them into the state system also it's based on permissions and user rolls and one thing also that is related to the budget is our class size our class size is dictated by Statute so we always have a compliance process for that in a procurement we have different committees that award vendors would not just one person making the award it has to be through committee that determines also are buyers have different thresholds and the supervisor has to look at any purchases above their threshold to make sure that we do have a proper procurement method if for some reason a purchase was made before

[00:13:00]
we do have unauthorized purchase forms they do require cabinet level approval we also communicate to the vendor to make sure they understand how to do business with APS we limit our sole source procurements that's something that we have worked very very hard on at one time we had about 67 Souls I think this year we have one and I think last year we had zero so we have really really gotten very good at that we also have a vendor committee when we set up new vendors and we met the vendors by looking at only business license and registration with Tax and Revenue and again they go through a committee so the community vet some before they are prove to be a vendor for APS we also

[00:14:00]
Empire conflict of interest forms department and suspension forms and we also check them on sam.gov which is a federal government site to see if the vendors are in good standing next payroll again we found some preventive controls in the payroll department segregation of Duties verification of employment status timesheet processing in accounts payable also we have different preventive controls one of them is her Picard limits and also we do 100% on our cards we also have dual signature on checks over 50,000 we use a bank positive pay process which really helps with Broad and us being able to identify

[00:15:00]
we have written next rat management has also prevented controls that has to do with requisitions and approvals and transfers a general ledger also has some controls Amanda if you want to talk about those that's under your shirt so all of our cash handling is handled by separate employees the employee receives the cash and prepares the deposit is separate as well as from the employee Who records the revenue we have our change funds or packets and we have them prepared and initialed by two employees large cash deposits or verified by two employees we have a level of approval on missions here in finance where we review the account string usage and we also maintain the general ledger for the

[00:16:00]
which is it holds the whole chart of accounts and the account structure and setup thank you next Capital fiscal again we documented some of the preventive controls including segregation of Duties verifications approvals next and then some detective controls so like I said we have 100% approvals on our requisitions some of them all the way up to 7:00 on what they're purchasing we have a specific approver for software for hardware for Capital assets and then again if it goes up in the cost it goes to a cabinet level you just heard from TC on The Whistleblower hotline that is very good detective control

[00:17:00]
we can have our annual external Finance audit we also have activity fun audits which are going to hear about today we do an annual physical inventory we do monthly bank and fund reconciliations and then we also review our open purchase orders to see if there's any type of duplication that we might look into next on payroll we look at absence reports we analyzed reports something we started doing here recently is we started analyzing reports for employees that don't have a bad swipe of logged into their computer so if someone's not showing those two things we are going further to verify employment to make sure if they should still be on our payroll records we also look at our checks

[00:18:00]
the numbering of checks total amount of our payroll we have variance report and we have triple segregation on manual checks next a capital fiscal 100% physical inventory on assets reconciliations comparing the assets to the general ledger we do data analysis on what's been disposed of we bring all of them to the Board of Education we have different analysis for the capital of monthly and we also her budget look at positions looking at our FTE and what's budgeted next and then grab management we have our request for reimbursements so they also approve of them we also have

[00:19:00]
duplicate verification of manual time timesheets and we look at expense reports next and in General Electric again we have different detective controls a lot of reconciliation and looking at accounts bank accounts are reviewed every day we get a cash flow report every day accounts payable 100% audit on travel 100% cards next and if we have some corrective controls we do a root cause analysis we research the audit Trail if needed we update our processes are procedures if needed will take employee action through HR we do have some mandatory training that stuff has to take before we get them

[00:20:00]
is to our system so it is a online course that also has testing at the end to make sure they understand the processes we have corrective action plans for any of our audit findings and we do review and update our policies frequently next and that's the end of our presentation and we hope that this was helpful to understand all the internal controls that we do have in place to help against Broadway and abuse thank you that's it yeah well thank you and Miss Boyle that was a fantastic presentation and I'm just going to open it up really quickly to see if any of the members have any questions about what was presented it was a lot and I just

[00:21:00]
remarked that there's a comment that says that these are examples and is not an exhaustive list and there's so much contained in that presentation but it's not exhaustive so I'm just curious how much more there is to talk about so it was a lot it's very impressive are there any questions from committee members it doesn't look like it it's a quiet group today no worries well thank you again for that presentation and I think that for all of the people watching from home I know there's so many of them audit committee is interesting I hope that it makes them feel good to know that based on what we've seen here today that APS is being a very good Steward of taxpayer dollars so all right I think we can move on to item number 6 and this is executive session and so I will entertain a motion to consider approval for the Board of Education to
