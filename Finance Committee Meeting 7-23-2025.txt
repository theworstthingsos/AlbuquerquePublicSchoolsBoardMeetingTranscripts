[00:07:00]
committee there we go board member Benavides question thank you so much to talk about you I just wanted to say that I am so excited and I want to thank the City of Albuquerque and the county of Bernalillo especially the members of the lgcc for working with us on the opioid settlement funds and I am so pleased that we have brought 3.6 million dollars to the district for this work and I'm just so excited about that so thank you all for working on this thank you to my lgcc members and let's get started thank you any other questions from our committee members go ahead for remember Dominguez excited about the settlement and I'm hoping that we can somehow track data somehow find a way to

[00:08:00]
use to share data from the district wherever this money is used to to track how it impacts the the families write the students and and the families that that it will serve and of course that all gets into the weeds but in the global aspects our Arena I think it's it would be a good idea to and I'm sharing it now to see how we work with other agencies so that we can in fact track this money and and report it out to the community in an intergovernmental wave of course just for clarification that is the responsibility of

[00:09:00]
spending so there is reporting connected to it and the money it's not just coming to us it's actually allocated for very specific initiatives that you see Dr Salazar on but it's to expand some of the programming that we're already doing with counselors in the schools so it's very specific it's not just hear some money and how do you want to use it if the agreement was to use it for very specific things and my understanding was and I'm going to call I mean the night that I won that I was in attendance Crossroads members or staff from the crossroads program were there and so I'm aware of that that program specifically will be impacted but what I also learned that evening was that they did not have

[00:10:00]
data and so I'm hoping that this with this resource that we can build up that ability somehow thank you great thank you any other questions related to this agenda item go ahead this isn't really a question I just wanted to address a board member dominguez's comment there is data and we did provide it at several of the lgcc meetings so I'd be happy to send that to you that would be great thank you okay thank you we will go ahead and continue our next item is to consider approval of the June 2025 intro function transfers for Grant budget and excuse me are presenter for this is Miss Apodaca and Miss Montoya good morning thank you

[00:11:00]

[00:12:00]
perfect thank you yep it's that time of year so understood thank you so much any questions committee members okay I see none we will continue our next item is to consider approval now of June 2025 enter function transfers for all non categorical funds and Miss Montoya do I believe I turned this back to you yes it looks like I might have jumped the gun and ask for those approvals earlier so just what I had said prior to that for your approval on these thank you perfect thank you committee members any questions okay thank you so much we will continue our next item is to consider approval of the qualifications bass bit in the amount of 28 million + 800,000 + submitted by Enterprise Builders Corporation for Van Buren Middle School this is Phase One Construction and granting

[00:13:00]
signatory Authority on all necessary easements and infrastructure for the board president and secretary and are presented for this is Mr Hawkins you have the four star good morning Madam chair members of the board members of the committee and superintendent Blakey so we come before you to consider approval for the qualifications based bid in the amount as you said of 25 million 800,000 and this will be for Van Buren it consists of a face replacement of several buildings at Van Buren out with some outdated Standalone structures and consolidation out there and then some grading and drainage work that will be doing as well so with that myself and I believe miss all right stand for any questions you may have thank you Mr Hawkins members of the committee any questions okay oh go ahead board member Dominguez I did some good question and only because I think this is an opportunity to talk about this this question in what ways do these

[00:14:00]
does this project and the question was in what way do these numbers demonstrate the CMP the capital Master plans commitment to honoring guardrail 3 the ethical distribution of resources maybe some history on Van Buren to help me with that but just to kind of start off answering that question so how does it aligned to Equitable alignment of resources so of course we do have a long-term facility Capital master plan and we're currently in the process of updating that on our 5 year review with an architectural firm that is looking at kind of that piece there and then those as we look at that comprehensively across the district all of our facilities will be

[00:15:00]
will be rated and then they'll be looked at the be looked at individually needs right and then looked at across the board as far as our aging structures and how we support students I'm going to tie this back to enabling conditions as we all know right this facilities is is a huge piece of that as well as our maintenance piece for students I don't know if I answered your question period do you have anything on the history piece of that well first of all let me apologize we're having some internet difficulties here so I can't get any video and so this was and this one also was assessed and ranked by PS4 money so as you know Limited

[00:16:00]
we had to kind of Cobble together some money to get it going so it's kind of been in the drawer but it has a lot of strong needs and like I said they're ranked against each other across and you mentioned you had to this was approved in the 2023 what election was that is that the bond election we had to Cobble money together right I'm just clarifying is that due to

[00:17:00]
inflation yes yes yes yes and what's the significance of the psfa being involved go ahead go ahead of us so our local you know Community has approved the the initial the 28 million I believe and then the stretches those dollars out so it's we do a lot of work right to work with psfa to submit this again the projects as well and they look at different things so it's aligned with our master plan they look at our master plan they'll look at our alignment but it brings several dollars back into our district which helps us really stretch that and you know complete or or add to that project to get more done so

[00:18:00]
but my impression is at the psfa just going my attendance at New Mexico School Board Association meetings Regional meetings when they presented or when this topic has come up the frustration in the past had been that we don't we rarely qualify for money is that correctly so their systems construction projects or specific systems that you can apply for based on their ranking and through my experience some of the challenges are their rankings and what we actually see here two different things so we work closely with that part it is it's a long process and we become owners through the process as we do this for funding and for approval of everything so applying is one piece of it qualifying is the next piece of it and then the third piece is over the last five years they've added a new

[00:19:00]
can you qualifying system where the percentages have shifted So based on District bonding capacities and some other variables it's shifted kind of those percentages so all of those combined kind of make it a little bit challenging but for this project I believe it's a little over 10 million dollars almost 11 million dollars that will be receiving so it's even with all that being said if we can identify projects and work closely with psfa collaboratively to get that it is well worth it very nice thank you it's rare that it works for us and I'm glad it did this time thank you great thank you Mr Hawkins any other questions okay I seen and we will go on our next item is to consider approval of District purchase or expenditure that equals or exceeds 500,000 dollars for New Mexico produce Growers turn it back over to you thank you madam chairman members of the committee and superintendent Blakey so we come before you to consider approval of our

[00:20:00]
an expenditure that equal or equals or exceeds 500,000 for a New Mexico produce Growers this is this is super exciting it's using local Growers within our food services programs and just really quickly to touch on a few things I know over the years that we are working really hard to expand that piece one of the challenges is there's two big major challenges with this just for your information one is finding Growers that can produce the magnitude of food that we need to fill our menu items and the other part is food safety but we are continually wanting to bring that into our school cafeterias and also not only celebrate that but talk to students about it so with that I stand for any questions fantastic thank you Mr Hawkins members of the committee any questions okay thank you our next item is to consider approval of the June 2025 cash disbursement and Miss Apodaca you have the floor okay thank you madam chair board member super

[00:21:00]
Dr Blakey this Action Memo is consideration of approval of June 2025 cash disbursements psab supplements 7 requires that this summary about yours be presented to the board for approval and entry into the minutes and this meets those requirements perfect thank you Miss Apodaca any questions okay I see none thank you so much our next item is to consider recommending consent agenda of items discussed during the July 23rd 2025 finance committee meeting these include beginning Grant budgets for fiscal year 2026 Grant budget adjustments June infection transfers for Grant Budget Insurance for all non categorical funds qualification
