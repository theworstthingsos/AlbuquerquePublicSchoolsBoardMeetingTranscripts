[00:21:00]
presented as a prayer or item during the government to government meeting in November the Pueblo Governor's and the Navajo Nation president are in support of these and have put it on their agenda for the January State legislative session as well now we asked for the support of the APS school board we're asking the Indian education committee and the Indian parent committee is established in compliance with CFR title 25 section 27315 20 USC section 7401 and the Indian policies and procedures and the bylaws we're asking currently has a total of 6,458 Native American students representing 12020 269

[00:22:00]
thank you board members my name is Wesley sinqua and I'm from the Pueblo of Laguna and my daughter attends Hubert Humphrey Elementary where is the Indian education department in APS has a total budget of 1.9 million of which $298,511 is operational funds and 1.6 million are federal funds through grants where is the Indian parent committee and the aps Board of Education have an updated Indian policies and procedures dated June 25th

[00:23:00]
play comedian and tribal leaders will recommend a plan to the aps superintendent or board or make suggestions to the aps superintendent or more to modify the educational programs or provide services in order to attain equal participation or appropriate progress now therefore be it result let the Indian parent committee and the Indian education committee supports the five goals to be included with the district goals and plans put forth to the 2019 New Mexico legislative session as per the Indian policies and procedures agreement go one to establish the Indian education department as a separate Department under the office of the superintendent the Indian education must meet statutory requirements related to the education of all students the department has the potential to be strengthened

[00:24:00]
send elevated in the district organization charts currently the annual budget for the Indian education is 298,500 thank you hi I'm Thomas Colbert I actually have five kids that are attending Albuquerque Public Schools and appreciate your time so continue 5:45 for the Department although there isn't much to cut the department of budget cut at the same level as other departments at the house the current programs that are in a few schools are not operationally funded Native American Educators often informed that Native American story have the lowest graduation rates

[00:25:00]
what's the highest dropout rate the lowest academic achievement rate and the highest rate of absenteeism yet the current programs offered and supported for Native American students in the district are not adequate I'll move to go to which is to establish an APS indigenous education training center with appropriate District funds the training center will house programs instructional materials serve as a site for training for Teachers Community and other stakeholders classrooms for Day evening and summer courses the center will also serve as a meeting site by staff Community instructors parents and students every year or location of sought for the Indian education summer programs with this building the search will not be conducted because it's the programs the center of the Gathering Place for Native American events and activities the center will be used by researchers Nationals for aps.com University of information about their latest research

[00:26:00]
play community members and staff higher education professors and instructors will teach courses related to indigenous education and Indian education teachers will teach courses needed for scholarships and students respective tribes higher education will conduct dual credit courses for Native American students from all schools thank you good evening I'm Nicole Shaw I have three students attending Albuquerque Public Schools so I'll continue to increase distribution and use of culturally relevant materials and test books regarding American Indians with appropriate District funds each year of the districts for various subjects and grade levels due to staff capacity of the Indian education education has not participated in the review of textbooks the Indian education department needs a designated education educator to fill this role as a district moves forward with new with each new Adoption District reviewers do not need

[00:27:00]
do not review for cultural equity in regards to Native Americans and ethnic group representation when they are when they perform the reviews representation of equity for marginalized ethnic groups such as Native Americans is important in textbooks that the district adopts for use by the students by all students resources for literature related to American Indians is necessary for use by teachers as a teacher about specific topics and content books relevant for tribes in different parts of the nation is also needed funds available to purchase books are not accessible to the Indian education department books available in the department resource Library are purchased by federal grants another need is technology and equipment in addition to software for the new for the few Indian education programs available in the school often the federal grants that are awarded each year for Indian education programs cannot support technology equipment Albuquerque is rich in Multicultural Community experts who can be utilized as resources in school

[00:28:00]
however due to the lack of funding the use of community experts is lacking in all district schools many experts require minimal honorariums to share their knowledge and expertise so funds for this is necessary and just to move on goal for to increase District retention and recruitment of Native American Educators from teachers to superintendent's cabinet and Leadership with appropriate District operational funds thank you Judy Young

[00:29:00]
hi my name is Sarah samani and I just wanted to comment I know that you guys are considering are probably putting forward a k through three retention program and I wanted to just admit my disagreement with that so because I don't it's not evidence-based and there's not research to support it or historical support for it and other schools around the country I'm a special education teacher I feel that there is support for maybe kindergarten retention and it can help some students but it's fair to do that just when the schools are not properly staffed I'm starting disabilities are not properly addressed I would also

[00:30:00]
make two comments against the the way that the public school district is attempting to address teacher shortages right now but I'm hiring specifically from the Philippines I feel that the Philippines has a completely different structure with special education they allow dropouts from first to 12th grade it's an autocratic government with some authoritarian ideals and that if we're going to be bringing in students it should be culturally relevant maybe from Mexico or Central America or if they're coming from Asia they should come from countries that perform well with teachers who have better track records like Singapore or Hong Kong but the Philippines is known to have a much worse education system and so pulling teachers from there I don't feel is truly

[00:31:00]
I've had the privilege of teaching there for years now this is my fourth year and I don't care whether you see us as a home like our students do or voices raised in the wilderness or roads made straight or whether we're just another set of hands reaching another set of starfishes I would like very strongly recommend that you that you approve of our Charter renewal because we're doing a job out there that needs to be done and we're doing as well as we can thank you hi good evening my name is translates to Lauren

[00:32:00]
Stuart brunelle I come with you with the Indian parent committee the resolution for the Indian policy procedures agreement I am continuing with Goal 5 which is increase the indigenous language programs each year the Native American parent survey indicates the request for children to learn their home language parents have requested this need for the past 13 years attending the school district however due to lack of funding the need has not been realized district-wide with operational funds other languages are funded but not of Native American indigenous languages currently grants that are that the Indian education department has written funds the Navajo and Zuni languages with three teachers in a few schools we hope to have three additional teachers on board if things go right Research indicates positive impacts on academic achievement with students who are bilingual and have strong heritage

[00:33:00]
mini Urban Native American students are born and raised in the urban community settings and as they get older they develop a yearning to learn about their home language and learn more about their identity and an increase of programs for an American indigenous language will not only impact academic achievement but help build strong Community citizens another need is to rename the Heritage language course from foreign language to American indigenous language coursework Native American students will no longer associate foreign language to their Homeland language and help end the quadri this is called Native American students regarding their home language courses in addition Native Americans students have identified English language Learners e l need instruction that differs from English Learners because most Native American Idols already know English they need support Committee in the

[00:34:00]
Indian education committee calls on the Public School Board of Education the superintendent to improve funding and resources for the provision and quality culturally relevant to education to serve the students Thank you period I have a tremendous concern anytime children are abused are manipulated are used in a political fashion for an agenda for a particular in the Avenue so on the 13th of this month a principal from Janet coin find Arts Academy represented herself

[00:35:00]
this is the testimony that you have in front of you from being from Manzano Mesa Elementary Manzano Mesa is in the singing arrow District but Janet Khan Fine Arts is not she brought seven children those are the names right there with her she prepared at seven statements for them to read they could not read them because the language was too difficult for them and they had to stop they were shaking they were very traumatized by this experience period

[00:36:00]
play legal ramifications for their children speaking at a forum such as this they were sworn in and they were told that there would be legal ramifications if they lied they didn't know whether they were lying or not because they were reading from a document that the principal had prepared for them that they couldn't even read they were shaking and when they were sworn in they began to shake even more because they didn't know what they what they why they were there really thank you

[00:37:00]
Stan cordette and Vivian Romero good evening and I am a private citizen and I as Judy would like to bring to the boards attention the shocking display of exploitation of 5th graders from school of integrated arts and I hope that it's not common practice to take children out of school and parade them to parade the students around to use for political purposes last Thursday the City of Albuquerque conducted a Judicial proceeding downtown concerning of a new community center participants were sworn in under penalty of perjury and sworn statements became public record

[00:38:00]
Christy sigmon introduced herself as representing Manzano Mesa Elementary School and seven girls read prepared false statements that they could not pronounce several days later we have discovered that Miss Sigman is not with Manzano Mesa Elementary School but she is in fact principal of Janet Kahn School of integrated arts the children are not associated in any way whatsoever with the project that was being heard on that day and yet they gave detailed false testimony about the condition of an existing Community Center and the reasons why they wanted to Community Center built their statements were full of falsehoods and not appropriate for the purpose of the hearing the principal misrepresented and concealed her affiliation and the affiliation of the children and use the children to make political statements and to make a circus of a serious judicial proceedings

[00:39:00]
directions to the children to teach solid ethics and to keep them from harm the community that participated are all appalled by this manipulation and abuse of children and we hope that the board takes this type of exploitation in the schools seriously thank you I'm Martina Mezmur I was at the same hearing the kids were for an hour and a half in the front hall they spoke about the first of all they do not attend the center they were speaking about our physically not near there and yet they spoke of there's mold in the walls there's water in the ceilings or in the on the roof this was given to them and they knew nothing about it this should not be paraded at a hearing that's heard by a commission of the city in a political matter

[00:40:00]
I would look into this and see why these children were put through this this prepping in the hall that I observed was really strange they also said they were speaking for others who couldn't speak for themselves they needed programs for the Spanish-speaking kids who hadn't learned English the existing Center already offers all that and only has four kids in the program so they were voting for a five and a half million dollar 15,000 square foot Community Center they had no clue what they were saying I think somebody needs to look into this thank you for almost a year now and my personal experience

[00:41:00]
it was terribly hard to try to catch up catch up on moving to New America the staff and students were welcoming what is a small school everyone knows everyone and we all help each other out we're like a family teachers are also very inspiring and supportive to other students with many opportunities to do great and Achieve anyone can succeed in new America the school has helped me be organized and help me find ways to help myself succeed and be a good student from online classes to night school new America has options that can work around you and ensure your success thank you ok Google

[00:42:00]
hi my name is Fernanda and I attend the new America school I am a senior and I attend the new America school because it has given me an opportunity that no other school has I have a very great bond with all the faculty we all know each other and help each other out and they care about us so much they always make sure we're good and if we ever need help they're the first ones to offer it I have stayed at the new America school because I have finally found my place I know that this that it's just a school but to me it is a second home and it would really mean a lot to me if my younger siblings get that experience that I did because I know the new America school won't let them down I was in good hands and I know so will they I hope the new America school will continue on and I hope we can get the renewal thank you Joseph

[00:43:00]
turn the new America school and I'm a senior and that school has been just an experience I went there because I was low on credits and they welcomed me in the school my first year and they wanted me to be as involved as I could and they just treated me like I was family and they just helped so much and I think that it should stay open because it just has so many opportunities for students and they don't give up on their students and no matter how many times a student drops out and they always call and say we need your student back or your child and they just push you to do right they push you on the right path and I think that's important for kids

[00:44:00]
hi my name is Sarah Johann about 4 years ago my son was attending Rio Grande High School what's really good attendance and fell behind and I searched and searched and talked with APS and talked with Rio Grande and didn't really get anywhere so I found new America's after sending we went to a ton of different charter schools in the South Valley area and in the North Valley area and finding them very comforting warming welcoming everything they were the perfect school with my son attending their he actually became a proud graduate on time with 2016 and I don't think he would have if we wouldn't have found them and Josephine my daughter that just spoke again attendance and I think that's something that draws kids and and without them and their focus on the

[00:45:00]
the calling the parents and saying hey are they sick today or you know anything they wouldn't have made it and I think just said before without the school they were going to be so many kids missing out on it if you don't let it continue thanks good evening who graduated from high school but also as a community member that's really concerned about what is going on at that school I for one stand for our children to be able to be in places where they are protected safe so that learning can happen and right now I know that they're particular

[00:46:00]
coincidences that are occurring at that school where there are divisions and lines being created between staff and students to choose sides I think that we have to come down to a place where we recognize that as we create safety plans for these children that are involved in that incident concerning the teacher was high school that we all have to remember that the safety plans also need to include the children but also the school itself you know because I feel that as the activity of other parents who have been here and the anger that has resulted in the divisions that have come to play that are children are now experiencing those divisions so we need to recognize as adults how were also taking advantage of the system with our owner and our own wounds and rehashing this so that our children are not feeling safe and also that they're being told to choose a side

[00:47:00]
I for myself you know that I'm an advocate for our children with disabilities and I always feel at times that those kids are put under strenuous pressure but I also know that children of color are being held to that same ground and I feel that that's very unfair so I'm hoping as a board that we'd look at not only the conditions of what's going on but we also look at how we're causing the Divide to and not doing anything about it thank you thank you thank you I'm a member of open organizing parents education parents who have children with special needs we identified 22 systemic issues throughout New Mexico that we have a goal of changing I'll give my contact information to you

[00:48:00]
in just a minute so we have invited each of you to attend one of our meetings that we've had every Thursday night this entire year 6:30 p.m. at the State Bar on Masthead and contact information so that you or anybody in the audience would like to come check our group out and see what we're up to is NM dot open 100.com 100% of schools in New Mexico via the Ida so that our children are served so Dr Ross Green was a consultant hired by APS about 10 years ago and he gave him some very specific advice to what needed to happen within our school district so that our children could be safe and educated even children with disabilities he's now created a documentary called the children we lose

[00:49:00]
the children we lose dot comma so we can find more information about this documentary we are hosting a screening on January 5th at 10:00 at the guild movie theater we do not have tickets available they're not for sale so it's first come first serve the information presented is not for children to view we want to refer to the unfortunate that happening in California regarding a 13 year old and we would like to make sure that doesn't happen here in New Mexico so we are creating awareness to the special education environment and culture so we hope that you'll consider coming and come early thank you Google

[00:50:00]
I come here before you because I was a former teacher at APS I've taught K through 12 at both private and public schools as a science English bilingual teacher I attended the meeting this past week at the plaza building which is the city building for planning I was appalled that principal Christy signals stood in the hallway because I attended that meeting from 8:30 to after 12:30 that's how long it took for the 80 or so people in the residents of Four Hills to stand and wait to be heard at a community meeting those children were in the hallway I know for a fact they had no lunch I know for a fact they were standing the entire immediately the bristles on the back of my neck because I feel that was a misuse of their time

[00:51:00]
there were only seven students I know that as a teacher on field trips that the whole and entire class had been included and it was nothing more than a manipulative effort by that principle who misspoke who misrepresented and had those students read pre-written documents that the students did not even read they did not understand what was going on and I would highly recommend that that principal will be disciplined and or fired for her activities because I know this is incorrect it was not only not fair to the students but it put the adults and the audience at a warning that this is what's happening in our public schools that students are not properly being taught ethical reasons for making a statement I have nothing against students coming up and stating their opinions but that was inappropriate and it was not a proper use of the student's time as they should have been in school being educated thank you very much

[00:52:00]
well thank you all that concludes public forum on the board encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting if you can so you may listen to board member comments before we adjourn at this time only at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member OK Google

[00:53:00]
promises the last few times that we had interacted partly on instituting some sort of policy change for the way these meetings are set up in terms of public forum or some sort of actual community meeting I haven't seen anything publicly in terms of any efforts to make these changes or to set up a meeting with the indigenous Community but one thing I do sort of think that the school board specifically doesn't need to understand is what exactly is racism when it comes to the sort of meetings the two parents that spoke in support of the teacher in the last meeting to the population and more specifically to your students is hurtful and very harmful for them you know these students that had to go through that have to have this Justified and have this on the public stage by having people in defense of the teacher as well the environment has turned to one of mourning

[00:54:00]
a large population of the student body as well as the teachers are not wearing black and solidarity of the the racist teacher that had committed that act and I feel as if that the school board doesn't really understand how this affects indigenous students and how this these these acts of solidarity end up harming and just students more than anyone else and it needs to be discussion with Cilla and the school board need to just affected and the parents as well to discuss and actually understand and come to some sort of agreement on this being an act of genocide and act of racism because very clearly there is no understanding of what any of those words even mean for indigenous people genocide isn't something for the history books it's actually happening we have recently as 2017 of 4 stars realization you know these things aren't something that can be ignored and there's just a lot of follow-up that I'm going to need from you guys and

[00:55:00]
upcoming meetings and I just came to say that without new America I wouldn't have a second shot in life and a second opportunity as well I'm 21 years old who dropped out of high school and there was many options for me so no America so I really appreciate that they've been a great help and I'm sorry

[00:56:00]
they are amazing the staff is always encouraging me to pursue my life goals and dreams and that's something I never had now I do and I'm really motivated and eager to learn every day and I'm really thankful and yeah I hope to go get some thank you thank you thank you thank you that was really Brave of you thank you for coming this evening intently to each person who presents if you'd like you're welcome to stay for the remainder of the board meeting so that you may listen to board member

[00:57:00]
before we adjourn it's only at this time that your concerns may be addressed at the discretion of each board member thank you for your input this concludes our public forum thank you very much I will go on to the super dance report and Dr Richard Bowman will give this report today a superintendent read he actually he's taking it out and she's gone home so thank you Richard thank you the superintendent has prepared to follow up report for our next meeting on our continuing efforts to make Albuquerque Public Schools a place where all students feel safe and respected as we head into winter break I wanted to highlight a few of the amazing things happening in 8 p.m. the clothing bank and Supply Barn have been busy they have filled and giving out 480

[00:58:00]
beat Supply kits to elementary students 532 complete Supply kits to middle school and high school students 1650 boxes of colored pencils 392 scientific calculators 1936 composition books over 1,000 1,062 dry erase markers 7,935 number to pencils 3,039 packages of pens 2,789 spiral notebooks and 1,012 backpacks school supplies and clothes are needed all year you can see the donations on the aps clothing bank web page on aps.com edu schools are trying new things to boost attendance for example Lew Wallace Elementary School modified their Wednesday schedule which was their day with the lowest attendance they now

[00:59:00]
have formed enrichment groups for Wednesdays those groups are small about 8 or so students per group and they are led by an adult who is not the students general education teacher to expand those network of connections at the school site that each child has those enrichment groups help to Foster connections through the exploration of diverse interests and are being favorably responded to Bible students and teachers at new Futures High School future Focus interns which is a nonprofit organization is coordinating paid internships for students students must go through an application in an interview process and at a recent interview Workshop over 60 students participated for Community Schools APS recently received a shout-out from The Washington Post the articles about Community Schools and shared that 23 of Albuquerque Public Schools are Community Schools they described a few unique

[01:00:00]
is provided for low-income families such as job training for adults and English language classes the article also mentioned that Albuquerque is lobbying the state to go further pressing officials provide money to help districts establish more Community Schools and Human Services like full surface Health Centers I want to say thank you to Dr Muir for raising aps's efforts in Community Schools to the National level thanks I wanted to end the last superintendent report of the Year by sharing a video hot off the press from the Communications Department the video shows some of the extraordinary things that APS Community has done over the last few months for example Painted Sky Elementary School Early College Academy in Dennis Travis Elementary School hosted food drive resulting in 1,000 of pounds of food for families in need the Mitchell Elementary School planted trees

[01:01:00]
San Antonio elementary school students composted food waste to help the environment Mission Avenue and Statesville cones Community collaborative school students were encouraged to write what they will do for somebody else on Hearts the Bulldogs at Albuquerque High School adopted future bulldogs for a day the new future Service Learning class hosted a toy drive while Sy Jackson and Truman Middle School students collected more than $350 coats Manzano High School made more than 300 lunches for the homeless while the Cleveland High School choirs carols at a nursing home Georgia O'Keeffe Elementary School in Dennis Travis Elementary School Drive in Mountain View Elementary School students and staff meeting cards for the troops Tony hillerman Middle School made care packages for first

[01:02:00]
binders and this is just to name a few of the amazing acts of gratitude and it's really just a great it's really just a great kind of example of all of the things that folks here in our district are doing everyday that concludes the superintendent's report thank you Richard we're going to special issues the first issue is consideration for review and approval of the 2019-20 traditional alternative Kate school work day calendars presenter Dr Bowman and thank you for your review and approval the workday calendar for next year for a traditional alternative schools representatives from ATF and the educational required hours of instruction and comply with 184 and

[01:03:00]
1383 days that are teachers and educational assistance are required to work they really aren't change significantly from the times from last year are there any comments from the board members or remember again so what were the changes Dr Bowman Jessica

[01:04:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:05:00]
schools because of the additional days that they have and one of the things that I heard from them is that they might like and I don't want to speak for them so this is just kind of throwing out the possibility can they have some flexibility for how they work in their professional development days because I know that I have heard some comments that they might find it helpful to be able to put them in her purse through the through the year instead of front loading them so I'm just wondering if there will be the one Dr period

[01:06:00]
believe the time you're referring to is the sqt time which is the one hour and right now the schools are playing around with that so for example Whittier is doing more professional development at the beginning of the week and they're being a little more organic with it and I know Hawthorne is pretty strict and like this is what we do every Monday every Tuesday so we've internally given them time to move that around as needed because it's not directly connected to the calendar per se it's an extra hour of time that they're able to play around with what they do with that time do you have any comments

[01:07:00]
okay thank you Linda any other comments from the board member I'll entertain a motion for approval that have a second thank you thank you we're going to item number 6 D now BNC have been pulled and that's the update on the International School basketball education and the international school at Mesa Del Sol the school has been issued a notice of unsatisfactory performance for special education compliance was derived after several site visits that were required following

[01:08:00]
complaint via the New Mexico public education department it was found that the school did not correctly apply special education law in the provision of Social Work failed to conduct timely individualized education plans and failed to ensure the least restrictive environment for students the school has developed a corrective action plan and this is to provide you an update on the progress of that plan the school is making progress towards fixing its deficiencies and we think the school for taking important steps forward and Dr escobita will give you more detail Mister president the information from the briefing we provided you we do have Barbara administrator for the school who has a short comments to make but as of October 1st the 40th Day the school had 340 students enrolled 19% of the students are students with disability

[01:09:00]
I want to thank associate superintendents for special education listen to Sanchez for her partnership in the work of supporting students and ensuring compliance the school is making progress for improving their systems and processes to support special education students they have also provided us documentation by the deadline for the provision of compensatory Social Work services that they needed to complete they have also utilized processes and procedures for the documentation of all ancillary Services however at the 40th Day the school had two overdue IEPs the school also needs to improve the documentation of special education or ancillary Services accurately in the IEP and Miss Langley can come forward to make a couple of months of the board stand before you today to update you on the corrective action plan which we received in September of this year as I stated in

[01:10:00]
remember I took ownership of the past and as a team we have worked hard to improve our special education department with me today is my my social work department chair Eliana Garcia and a member of our governing Council supporting me as well know that we have taken this directive seriously and we have completed all of the required actions today we made contact and met with every student who was a compensatory Services meeting the required ped deadline of October 31st we have revamped our process for documenting contact logs for all of our ancestry service providers so that the mistakes of last year will not happen again as of today we are 100% compliant with our IEPs and revaluations with the sped team to ensure continued conversations about the needs of our students and what we need to do in regards of services evaluations and re-evaluations which are due in January and February

[01:11:00]
I'm very proud of my team and the progress of our special education department and that what we have done as a whole and proving ourselves our processes and our procedures thank you for your time and continue to support of our school are there any questions and it was 3204 students but on the next page it has 340 students which is also what doctor's appointment and we have 16 years

[01:12:00]
so we are Pre-K 4 year olds through High School 12th grade 18 years old ok Google your high school enrollment so there's a drop from elementary then to middle school and then a significant drop in high school so I think you only have 2022 high schoolers this is our first graduating class this may and we have six kiddos in that class or five we have had difficulty with that jump from the middle to the high school because as our kids have stayed with us from K through 8th grade A lot of them are looking for something different as they go into High School whether it be Sports whether it be dance or other activities or

[01:13:00]
Barger schools where they can find more variety and a lot of times we end up having kids come back to us that have left us a lot for the reasons that the students shared with you from new America because we are that small environment for our high school students and so it as a School of Choice that's where we're struggling with that high school but our high school kids like the students that spoke to you from new America are being successful many credit recovery and trying to find that home in that environment where they can find that Safety and Security to Garner their High School diplomas and then I believe I read that there was 1551 is that correct I have four license special ed teachers I have two license working with special education and then we have full-time and a half a part-time Physical Therapy part-time

[01:14:00]
occupational therapy and two social workers and then I know in the corrective action plan I think there was some Services some students that were owed services so have those students received those services and that we met in contacted every single one of those parents every one of those parents except one waive the services and the one student that did have the 30 minutes of compensatory Services has been received OK Google

[01:15:00]
Services they just didn't receive the fax services from the old years from last year so that shouldn't happen again again and then I just am curious about I was looking at your school grades and so you had had seeds last the last 3 years and then last year it went to to an F so yes we did drop we had some stuff and some other areas it was my first year as a lead administrator and a learning curve as well with that and we have put in place the fully curriculum which I know you all use for short cycle we adopted the full of curriculum for our staff and our students and we've already seen great games as far as we just completed today thank you remember

[01:16:00]
with regard to your Social Services you say you can't according to this you contract for social services we have two social workers that are on our staff we contract speech language OT and PT are those the ones on your staff are those who wants you contract now the speech OT are contract and they're all from a bmsi which is bilingual multi-language Multicultural it's a contract Service OK Google has been with the campus I know for three years old has been with us for 4 years are physical therapist is her second year with us our social work team have been with us for three years

[01:17:00]
in fact Ileana who's sitting here was an intern with us from Highlands University

[01:18:00]
what students put those are the students that are in their last year of their master's program the many of those students work with students that are in our process as well as our general education because we know that all of our students need support at one time or another the students were all trained the interns I apologize we're all trained by supervising social workers in August before they came in they were trained on what was expected in terms of documentation and as far as what we needed for file specifically for our special education students and our students as we try as students may move from the SAT process into special ed or out of the process of the interns actually all are on campus at least two days a week and they started approximately a week after we did they did have this week off but we only had a three-day week today was our last day they will start back only three days after we started in January and then they finish

[01:19:00]
right at the beginning of May which only it leaves us a little bit of a gap at the end which are social work team picks up the difference on that okay question mark

[01:20:00]
as an introduction a brief recap of events of the last year in December 2017 the board approved renewal for a 2-year contract with conditions that needed to be met before the contract was executed in April of 2018 our staff identified special education concerns and issued a notice of unsatisfactory performance from May to June the school developed a corrective action plan in June the board did not approve their Charter contract at that point the school appealed to the New Mexico Secretary of Education to finalize the contract and on October 31st the secretary ruled that the contract must be finalized order we bring for your consideration the contract and performance framework for Laura Solana Leadership Academy as you will note from the letter from the secretary he did order the contract and performance framework to be finalized we know that

[01:21:00]
this action item may appear to be counter-intuitive given the next agenda item and the supporting documentation however it is essential that the contract be finalized so that we can move forward in all appropriate authorizing actions including monitoring the corrective action plan Mr Melendez is here for any questions from a legal basis so if we don't approve this contract that the p e d basically they put it together or is it pretty similar to what we had in June Mister president of the state law it is not

[01:22:00]
the same contract that we use however for Simplicity and for compliance purposes we are asking that you finalize and approve this contract it does contain the same overarching language that includes corrective action plans notices for replication Etc that we will be discussing in the next action item so if we wouldn't approve this then we can go ahead with the next action item then Mr President to finalize the contract if it is not tonight okay

[01:23:00]
why did that was the best course of action we really don't have the power to do that Mr President in the steps that were taken before when the contract was not approved there was an appeal to the board to the secretary and the secretary said that we could not just not approve a contract we had to have a contract in place in order to take the next step which is revocation if that were to happen and so while there may be some disagreement at this point the directive from the is to approve the contract as his recommended by the administration so much as I'd like to say something different tonight

[01:24:00]
my only comment I guess would be that I think the PD should have just simply said well you have a contract go ahead and approve that contract I don't know why they have to believe that they can put out their own contract that doesn't make any sense to me otherwise I do know the performance framework is still there and that's the same for me anymore period I have a second

[01:25:00]
please thank you all in favor please say hi hi hola post that was an eyes that correct Yolanda okay yeah I know that there's a little delay there with the mute button but okay thank you very much okay we'll go on now to item number F which is an update on the resolution on the corrective action plan and have committed to bring you a recommendation on the next episode of action plan implementation through monthly visit

[01:26:00]
set my special education and the charter school team that included reviews of IEPs feedback on processes and coaching to support Laura Solana in successful implementation of their corrective action plan we have brought monthly updates to the board beginning in August following the board's request in November a team of special education and office of innovation and school choice staff spent three days at the school getting an update on their corrective action plan and comprehensively reviewing each student's individualized education plan the team included are senior director Dr Escobedo and three special education certified APS Educators who are also administrators for the district as you will hear from our update tonight the school has not made out of quit progress in implementing their corrective action plan period individualized education plans continue to reflect the lack of attention to ensure that appropriate services are provided

[01:27:00]
the comprehensive review of all IEPs revealed ongoing fundamental flaws that substantially Impact Services as Dr Escobedo describes the status of the corrective action plan please keep in mind that statute and procedural directive outline three options for you as the charter school authorizer to select from one you may allow them to stay open under corrective action plan which would include ongoing monitoring from our office to make to suspend the governing Council of the school and take over the government of the school or three you may move towards revocation and have a revocation hearing alternative to Dr Escobedo for more details Mr President members of the board reviewing the information from the corrective action plan and the documentary to was entitled overview of progress and timeline

[01:28:00]
in which we have a place there in that document outlines the Improvement areas that were identified in April and sent to the school with corresponding federal and state law statute compliance that needed to be done as you will note out of the 19 improved areas they have only successfully met 6 they remain out of compliance and 11 are and have not made the progress that they need for us to take them out off of corrective action they have we have given them ample time to improve the processes systems and overall support of their special education students the largest area of non-compliance is providing educational students for children with disabilities the school has not made any progress on and are not in compliance in this area off of support and monitor the special education corrective action plan that the school developed and we approved on page 4 of the human

[01:29:00]
can you see the timeline that we have used to support and hold the school accountable this does not include the tremendous amount of hours of time and support we have given over the phone through email and other communication opportunities with a very small amount of staff that we have we have had to utilize other staff from the special education department to support us in this review of the IEPs from and many other consultation across the special education department regarding compliance issues again I want to thank associate superintendent listen to Sanchez who has really stepped up and have gone above and beyond and providing support for this process and working with us to try to support the school to come into compliance we've given you a lot of numbers of documentation for a review but I think it's really important as a

[01:30:00]
play school leader myself to remain centered on the significance of the IEP on The Daily learning and the future success of each student so if you think of an IEP as functioning as a road map for a map to fulfill its function The Traveler has to begin by identifying their current destination well in an IEP the current destination is described in the present levels of performance that the child is demonstrating in their academics in the November visit 74% of Laura's IEPs did not have complete present levels of performance a traveler would also identify their desired destination on the map in an IEP the team of Educators family members and the student identify goals or the desired destination for the students learning 47% of the IEPs had missing or incomplete goals in their November

[01:31:00]
review Once a traveler knows their current destination and desired destination they plan their route the route in an IEP is communicated in the progress towards goals and the service schedule that describe the supports the student will be provided to reach their destination in November after 5 months on corrective action 58% of Laura Solana's progress towards goals and service schedules are missing or inaccurate this analogy could continue but I think the point is clear service is to support the learning of students with IEPs are only as supportive as the accuracy of the road map these inadequacies found in the IEPs indicate fundamental flaws that result in effective services for Laura's students with disabilities without a road map that clearly delineates the current destination desired destination and the route to take a school has no

[01:32:00]
ability to support the student to reach their potential the inadequacies inadequacies are not Minor Details such as failing to cross an eye to your cross and I rather they are indicators of substantive negative programmatic impact on Student Learning Center State Statute an authorizer holds the ultimate accountability ultimate responsibility to hold a charter accountable for academic financial and operational performance an author has three options when a Charter School commits a material violation of any conditions standards or procedures set forth in the charter contract or violates federal or state law those three options are as follows you may allow them to stay open under corrective action which would include continued monitoring from our office this option extends the timeline of the corrective action through a continued monitoring and support relationship

[01:33:00]
between the school and the authorizer but does not allow the district to provide Direct Services to the students or to the school we do not recommend this option given that the school has been on corrective action for 5 months since June and continues to demonstrate an inability to appropriately service students with disabilities I believe that reasonable opportunity for the governing body to remedy the problem along with above and beyond support and consultation from Albuquerque Public Schools has been given the second option for you was the authorizers are to is to suspend the governing Council of the school and take over governance of the charter school as the APS school board we do not recommend this option either the resources of our office even with substantial support from the special education department have been stretched Beyond capacity to provide the extensive monitoring and support

[01:34:00]
since June furthermore the burden on the board of education would be substantial and would require you to consider retention of Administrators and employees of the school execute legal authority of the governing body and monitor operations and improvements of the charter to name a few of the responsibilities that come with this option the third option is to move towards revocation and have a revocation hearing we do recommend this option from the office of innovation and school choice based on Laura's demonstrated lack of ability to ensure that their 27 students with disabilities have adequate IEPs after 5 months on corrective action Dr escobita will provide a sample of the proposed revocation process for your discussion president members of the board we are seeking your guidance

[01:35:00]
we have walked through hopefully for that is reasonably understandable which shows the dates and the corresponding statute and procedural directive as you will note we are recommending that we hold the revocation hearing on February 6th this will give the school ample and adequate time to provide us a response by January 23rd If the board chooses to revoke the school at that time in February we have provided you with the timeline for appeal and decisions to come down prior towards the end of school I want to remind the board that we are not seeking to immediately close the school or for the school to close within 30 days of your decision we are we do recommend and we will be recommending that the school be allowed to stay open until the

[01:36:00]
school year is complete so that there is not a disruption of services for the students prior to the end of May we stand for questions after you would consider that and February we would bring it to you a plan for number one which is the transition of students and supporting them to transition appropriately and we would work with the special education staff to identify how we take steps to take care of their IEPs and to provide whatever necessary supports to the students individually at that time we have just had very brief

[01:37:00]
and surface conversations with the special education staff but I can tell you Miss Sanchez has been at the table and and continues to support us will get completed Dr Percy Mr Garcia we cannot we will have to work with our attorneys to ensure at what point can we get in there to fix the IPS and to fix the deficiencies so that the students are transition correctly to to their next school if that is the path that the board chooses so we have to take very deliberate steps the first step would be the revocation hearing is it so I know that you said five months to carry out their corrective action plan the average time that other

[01:38:00]
Financial compliance and we have two schools under the under corrective action for special education compliance you've seen the progress that one school has made and you've seen the lack of progress I cannot give you a clear timetable about how long it should take but what I do know is that as a school leader everything should be focused on fixing and supporting 27 students the school has 722 students there is no excuse in my mind and I apologize for my passion for this to happen and to take place for the children that's first and foremost so obviously something is not going right for those children and I don't know what the administrator at the school would have to say

[01:39:00]
the children keep on getting sent there and they stay there so why are they being sent there with the problems that the school has when it comes to to special ed there has to be some kind of reason so I'm thinking about I'm thinking about those kids there's a reason that those parents are still sending them there because they know about this since you know several months ago so I'm just curious because I care about what's going to happen to those kids is the bottom line so why are those kids still there why are the parents still sending them there with all the trouble that they're having with IEPs Dr Peterson I can't answer the question for the 2017 to go over the details of the corrective action plan the school provided another agenda to that demonstrates that they did that we were not notified of the meeting we were not notified

[01:40:00]
pictures of notes from the meeting so what was disclosed to the parents we do not know I mean I just I mean I would love to know what that rational is what those parents are thinking and in the end what's going to happen to those kids because they did they did come from other you know they did come from other schools before they got there because it's just as a middle school so they were somewhere from kindergarten to 5th grade before they got there so I'm just wondering what are the IEPs look like before they before they got there so I'm just curious just care about what's going to happen to to the children so after if they are revoked

[01:41:00]
going towards the revocation makes sense to me because I think it gives us an opportunity to hear from the school at that time in terms of what's going on I am concerned also about the 27 students and the information that is passed on to the parents obviously you know they selected a charter school for various reasons believing that it was going to be in the best interests of their students get we have a school that fails to comply with federal law about how IEPs and special education is supposed to be administered period

[01:42:00]
it's because these parents are missing out also on not knowing it's alright the weather they had a bad experience with a previous school or whatever it doesn't matter the fact is that in the school that they're at right now and the services that they're receiving are not appropriate it is not it is not fair to these students to continually have the IEPs that are just they're negligent they're not following through when I looked at the percentages of not that difficult so I'm finding it really difficult and understanding why the school cannot make the progress with all of the support that our staff has given them so thank you dot because I know it's been hard work thank you

[01:43:00]
and my concern was along the lines that Lorenzo brought up I mean how will how can we ensure that these students are students will be served between February and May and till the end of school and how can we ensure that these IEPs will be met and they get the kind of services they deserve doctor's office we do not provide Direct Services to students and we do not provide Direct Services to schools and so it is a quandary that we are in and will work diligently with our attorneys and with the special education department to find a path forward and we will also find a path forward for the transition of students

[01:44:00]
to whatever school is appropriate for them and we will bring that plan forward this is not something we are recommending lightly it is very taxing and very wearing and I think you can tell by my passion and my emotions tonight it is not an easy thing to come forward and bring forward to you thank you thank you thank you but remember Patterson time and resources by the aps district and the school system in our population and they're not getting the services and the education they need this is outrageous vacation

[01:45:00]
I sent that to us and Dr Percy and Miss Peterson we we will ask them to provide a response by January 23rd so that we can make sure that that's provided to you in a timely fashion however going back to review the 27th IEPs if that is your direction for us to do again in January we will make an attempt to do it but I can tell you that it took us three days just to be at the school to review the IEPs by three certified special education teachers and administrators and then coming back and riding the reports we have very very detailed reports about every IEP and I want to make sure you know we will be providing those detailed reports with corresponding names to the school so that they can try to

[01:46:00]
Ford and remedy those however I think at this point whether they make the progress to have the the IEPs 100% compliant my recommendation still stands I mean I think every time we have students from a charter schools for us as a district to learn about what is it that we can do better and need to do better but in my heart of hearts I truly believe that students are better served inside of our schools that were that we've got the capability to serve them and that we know that there are things that we can listen to to get better but every time I hear someone says we need to close excel in APS because it's too small and then

[01:47:00]
we tried to justify keeping open a school of 70 students somehow it does not make sense to me I'm sorry period are special education liaison and she's is funded by the special education department and what we know nationally because we are very involved in connected with the National Association of charter school authorizers is they just put out a special education toolkit and review and we have been ahead of the curve for many years and we are actually working with other districts across the country to show what we're doing and authorizing and holding the schools and compliance for special so I want to thank Patricia for her work because we are on The Cutting Edge of national significance I mean again I think it's the relationships that develop that make things work or not and when they're strong relationships it's very compelling

[01:48:00]
but it doesn't mean that students are being served the way they should so it's for us to make sure that they're being served the way they should be and have an opportunity to develop those relationships that make them feel like they want to walk in the door of the school everyday need to be really careful when they want to serve students because it is extremely difficult to serve special education students you know if students come to the Charter and their what I say

[01:49:00]
different abilities are advocate for the charter to serve that's one thing but it's very difficult for us to even find our special education you know staff and it's extremely difficult for the possible variety you might have in a charter to have enough special education services being able to be provided so you know my message to Charters just be really careful because it's difficult to do it's difficult to do it may sound good to have small small schools and students but then when you get a fair number of students with differing abilities it becomes difficult in that small environment to provide the kind of services that we can provide so I'm just a message to be able to provide those kind of services they don't want to but I just think it's difficult for them to do that so I think you have your

[01:50:00]
your basic Direction there and we look forward to having an update on the progress of what you guys are recommending so thank you thank you but go on to item number G which is consideration for approval for board members to attend the nsba inconsiderate City schools for upcoming conferences and our mom Diego this early because unfortunately we either have a deadline that has to be met prior to us going on break or sometimes the hotel as well so the first one that's coming up

[01:51:00]
National School boards Association Equity Symposium in Washington DC at the end of January and immediately following that the the next day it is on your Action Memo but it's their the national school boards Association advocacy Institute is right after that so the equity Symposium is January 26th and then the advocacy Institute is January 27th through the 29th in DC then in March March 16th through the 19th is the great City Schools legislative policy conference we have been very consistent about attending that particular conference in that one has been very very helpful for us our New Mexico session ends on March 16th the day that this this one starts so it is unlikely that staff will be able to attend this because as you know in the final hours of the session lots of things happening

[01:52:00]
and then the third one is the national school boards association annual conference from in March 29th to April 1st is in Philadelphia this year so there are three board members who have not taken an out-of-state trip this year so I don't know how you want to handle these upcoming ones if you want to send someone to each one of these or what you'd like to do so that's what's up for your discussion tonight okay and Elizabeth I can make myself available for the March 29th Philadelphia

[01:53:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:54:00]
policy conference tends to also interact a lot with the legislators the you know so you get a chance to talk to the main people up there so I think that's a good one to go to so if you can make that that would be good

[01:55:00]
so that would be good thing to go to I think so and then the fall conference and the fall conference is another one where I think probably good to get a few people to go to that but we'll see you at that time you know right now

[01:56:00]
29 nsba in Philadelphia Chandelier and I'll go to the March 11th 19th in DC for the consulate City schools and with that week so we have a motion to have those attendees have a second and all the paper please say hi hi thank you Google Ok Google the coral Community Charter School

[01:57:00]
what was the second one's approval of the Gilbert Santa Charter School in the third one is the new American charter school and what I'll do is I'll take those in order so what I really would like to do is just simply take a roll call vote I think people want to make sure that everybody knows how they vote on this so I'm going to have a motion for approval of 7.002 and then we will take a photo center yes yes

[01:58:00]
application of the Gilbert Center Charter High School and I'll take a motion for approval I'll make a motion second and I will take a roll call vote on that please Lorenzo Garcia Yes Papa song

[01:59:00]
I'm going to abstain Harper Peterson yes I'm Delirious Patterson's be careful you've heard about our discussion has been so we welcome you we hope that we can work with you but again it's important if you have any problems if you have any concern please let her let our Charter School staff know about that and and see if there's ways to improve what you're doing okay thank you Google

[02:00:00]
let's see dot 7 I believe that's what Peggy wanted want to remove for a separate approval is that correct baby I just want to see if they had any of the answers to any of the concerns that I had so not knowing any of the need you know details that I need you know if it's costing $900,000 to build to put in an artificial artificial turf well how much is a maintenance on that how much are we saving and water when do we get the return on investment so if there's an answer to that question to those questions then that would be great that is correct their the the people who could probably answer those are unavailable right now they have committed though to

[02:01:00]
play presentation in the January copt meeting for your information so we will have some information on that that we do need to vote on this so I'm going to pull that off again for a roll call vote also so this is 7 dot 7 and that's the additional approval for a general landscaping services if you remember we were adding additional money for those extra maintenance schedule

[02:02:00]
scheduled I think that is the idea I think that is the idea my understanding OK Google

[02:03:00]
we have board member comments I'll start down here at this time no I'm going to start with the phone Yolanda Montoya oh okay well I mean it was really interesting for us to consider those five goals they seem very logical I look forward to some next steps in terms of what we might do around that and then I just wanted to just do a quick shout out for the superintendent's report she said that was adopted a bulldog

[02:04:00]
the reason I pull that one out is because I think of just the the learning and especially the crossover for students that are working towards soft skills development and things that are going to lead towards Career Technical add pieces anytime we have opportunities for our high school students to engage in Opportunities where they can work with younger students to actually be mentors and do these things just sort of thinking about themselves or Civic engagement and just development that they could have as they move forward so I just want to say thank you I got to see the artwork also I was watching on the live feed the artwork was beautiful so congratulations to the students that were selected that's the only I have for today thank you thank you

[02:05:00]
first I want to just give a shout out to all of the Gordon Burnell graduates it was a really wonderful graduation it's really special to listen to them and these young people and middle-aged people and older people all have a chance now that they have that diploma so I wanted to read their names cuz I think it's very important and they're all really special

[02:06:00]
and then I wanted to I went to also the 93rd New Mexico State Police recruit graduating class last Friday so we have some people out there willing to risk their lives for us so out of the 25 that started 16 completed so it's the 93rd recruit class so that's another great thing I also want to listen which was absolutely beautiful I went to the New Mexico Philharmonic music initiative at the national Hispanic Cultural Center on the way those elementary students saying it made me cry I mean they were just absolutely beautiful and how they played was it would take your breath away and also the Garfield Pantry opening if you haven't gone out to Garfield to see that I know there were several of us several of us there but they're freezers are stocked with so many things I mean those kids can't be

[02:07:00]
more happy to have that in those parents so it's it's a really wonderful thing they got those freezers donated by somebody out in the community and it stopped with with really good things and then I went to go and judge future engineers and Engineering the future project so we listen to 90 second pitches and if you would just go you have to go listen to them because we have nothing to worry about because they came out and Lorenzo was there as well but some of the things they came up with I would have never ever thought of so it was pretty it was pretty fabulous so we have a lot of really bright bright bright kids out there that are going to do great things for a community so thank you to all of them Peterson

[02:08:00]
particularly the MRI schools just the amount of dedication and hard work that's been going into those three schools very much appreciated and it's exciting there is a community school Statewide Coalition Gathering last week and so it's it's it's very helpful that the concept of community schools and put that looks like growing around the state so hopefully will lay the base is for some legislative support for us for public forum I don't know if the person who was concerned about retention

[02:09:00]
is trying to implement that in Rural and I think that the PD may go through your transformation soon where it is recognized that that is not the way to to support students and you know APS his had a tradition for the last eight years of speaking out against retention as an automatic intervention that it's not appropriate and we can stand by that I saw a video apparently in response to the Filipino teachers who are here this morning I saw a video of some Filipino teachers getting together in a social and dancing and developing their communities from one culture to another it's really shocking

[02:10:00]
but the fact is I think these the teachers who have come from the Philippines are professionals and their it's been a struggle for housing for just some of the really basic things that need to go on for people to function but it seems like hopefully it's getting addressed and taken care of and the sense of community of those teachers and getting into the support that we have is is getting addressed so hopefully it will be a smooth or second semester looking at the Indian parent committee it seems like it's timely and Urgent and that this will help us address the needs of students and we need to figure out how to support

[02:11:00]
I'm I'm distressed to hear of what's happening at Cibola if if there are these splits that are developing I think somehow the there needs to be some intervention for some healing and hopefully there's some people who know how to do that to start fostering conversation and understanding and I will you know I think the Administration has some skills in doing that and it's not necessary one thing I will say it's not our job to censor who speaks to us and we are compelled to listening to listen to all the different voices that come and it's not our job to sensor but I think what gets highlighted and it's why

[02:12:00]
the urgency of ethnic studies is there the fact that when two parents came and spoke for the experience that their children had had I have no doubt that that's the experience that their children have with that teacher and one of the things that's most damaging I think for us is the community is how they were unable to see that that's not the experience of every student to walked into the classroom if we're going to figure out how to move forward to the community part of what has to happen is how do how do we brought in the view of of people so we start being more empathetic and more realizing what

[02:13:00]
native students we have we have work to do but I think our heart is in the right place but we need to figure out how to implement and that's the challenge before us so hopefully the parent committee will help you a guide with that as well but remember Garcia thank you I just want to say something about the Filipino teachers I know that there have been a number of people who have tried to help out but I'm very concerned that they have come here under exploitative conditions and you know we really need to do better for those folks we need to do better for ourselves but I don't know if there's a state legislation

[02:14:00]
that can be put in place you know the world is moving around lots of different ways and lots of different directions but in this case you know you have some people who want to come here and work and have a shot for themselves but when they come and find themselves you know really not realizing what they signed up for it makes it tough you know if they have to rent a car you know and have another things it just makes it tough so I'm concerned about their conditions that's all I can say about

[02:15:00]
but clearly we haven't done enough and what we've done has been limited and it's going to require us working together there's no other way to do it I think that you have a commitment on the part of the board certainly my commitment is that we move forward to do what needs to be done to make schools a safe place for every child regardless of their background or nationality but in particular for the groups who have been systematically such as our Native American brothers and sisters when we find ourselves in the situation is to figure out how we get past the places where we've been played against each other and we do have to work with each other support each other and move forward

[02:16:00]
when you have so many people in so called leadership positions who are really saying horrible things and setting this up to be against one another so we have to I think as a as a leadership group we have to step forward and we also have to rise above the tendency to want to attack one another the follow up on the my understanding is that is actually being put together that there have been some things that were done at the school I don't as a board member get into that level of details but my hope and expectation would be that Veronica Garcia could speak with you and you have a chance to kind of get an update I know meetings are being planned and the doctor's

[02:17:00]
able to make comments but I'll just say that I believe we will move forward there and in other communities as well period

[02:18:00]
so that's a really good thing but we all should be taken aback by the fact that we have so many students who are hungry so many parents who can't make ends meet and we have to we have to basically raise the issue in such a way that we can ask one another to think about how can we how can we begin to address this issue more systematically so that no child has to go Hungry Howie graduation decided to get it together

[02:19:00]
Valley High School future Engineers presentation guide I had a hard time following those young people there were a number of students who designed certain kinds of apps and things and it was lovely but Heck if I could say which was the Best Buy students were talking about designing things that could actually clean up the environment which was a surprise I never thought that they would think that way but sure enough they were about four different presentations made that were really responsible

[02:20:00]
help us take care of Mother Earth to take care of the future you know these children were very clear that climate change is real it's not fake and we really should pay attention so that was very inspiring to me thank you period thank you Lord remember Patterson and I love how they involve the families who support them in the community for the graduation I really enjoyed that I want to thank God for your for the superintendent's report thank you so much for sharing those wonderful stories that people don't normally know about our schools thank you so much and I want to thank you

[02:21:00]
speak with us and who wants to hear what it is they want to share in our community very special thanks to Ronaldo Tom who has been a Community member for Native Americans for many many years and for your words of Courage here what we need to do in our community and thank you so much for being here and sharing that look forward to working with you in the community as well and and have some time and with regard to your goals the the five goals I believe the district needs to take a look at this and I think I believe we need to work with you on this I think the reasonable I think that it's it's time that we take a look at these give me and I appreciate that you brought here today and let me see make sure I don't forget anything else

[02:22:00]
I don't want to you know I don't want to continue her sorry Barbara to continue thank you so much and thank you all for being here I appreciate your time as well thank you Katie appointment that's here but how do we support it and how to how do we move forward on that would be my first question is his name but I want to know how do we support and honor his request that he has in front of the board so that's my second question my heart breaks to hear

[02:23:00]
what about the division that's taking place at Cibola and the type of things that might be happening to divide those parents the students in that staff especially hearing about people wearing black I mean my heart just breaks and so my question would be as APS staff and administration what can we do to help that Community Hill then my final question is what the hell happened at the City of Albuquerque meeting in reference to Janet Khan and so understanding that so we can have more information around that again as a board the more information that we have the more knowledgeable we are we might not necessarily be able to act on this because of our role but having that information would be incredibly helpful those are my questions the students that

[02:24:00]
have this incredible artwork and that were honored tonight I also love the students who were able to participate in public forum we often know how courageous you have to be to get up and speak and talk and we're all so intimidating looking that must be really hard for me so and then I wanted to celebrate the the leadership awards that my colleagues receive so congratulations on that and congratulations for the work you do every single day too to make sure that this community is a better place so those are my only comments my only questions thank you thank you let me ask you a question right setting up departments and setting up those things are really up to the staff to do it's not our job to do that but it doesn't mean we don't follow it I think they're working on

[02:25:00]
I think that's part of the resolution part of what we're trying to do there at 7:00 and so I think that's to be to be determined here in the near future and don't don't expect it overnight but I think it's part of the part of the plan in terms of The Sibling concept and what's going on there surely that must be part of what they're trying to do as well I don't know exactly what we can restrict what people do it is a free country but I think in terms of trying to educate people and try to let them know how that might not be the right way to collaborate and to make things better that's probably part of what they're they're trying to work out I think in terms of the thing in terms of Janet I think that's I hope that they made this message to the superintendent because she's the one who actually can deal with this issue right now are you sure we don't go to the

[02:26:00]
we don't have any idea what what the story is exactly right we don't know but that's hopefully the superintendent will get this information that this stuff that we got handed out and and and and you guys is associated superintendents can take a look at that and see what what was the deal here right now I want to let you know that and I was reflecting on ours last night as I watched Chevrolet

[02:27:00]
and I can guarantee you she was the best and I gave her all 10 of my votes I gave her all 10 of my votes in the top 10 I gave her all 10 of my votes in the semifinals in the finals and she was fantastic and what a pleasant young lady what a pleasant young lady so and you know Bill Walton mobile

[02:28:00]
UCLA and we did not win it was very refreshing to hear some real positive okay that doesn't mean we're against each other that we have is a great culture here and all the accomplishments doesn't mean we don't have places to go of course we do have it up

[02:29:00]
what do we have and you know this afternoon I went to a performance of all the music teachers at the Del Norte Baptist Church area that's not a religious thing they just that's where they perform I mean we had over a hundred music teachers drama teachers hey Google
