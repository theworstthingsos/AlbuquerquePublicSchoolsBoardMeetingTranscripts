==================================================

[00:00:00]
and a happy time with the family and friends I would like to call this meeting to order Dr Albright my may I have a roll call please the middle school we did get a notice from board members

[00:01:00]
she's she's got an important to Commitment at work so we certainly understand our first item for consideration and action is to consider adoption of the December 2nd 2024 policy committee meeting agenda may I have a motion and a second please I will move to a doctor December 2nd 2024 policy committee meeting agenda this is number Jackson I will write could we have a roll call please yes next item is the minutes approval

[00:02:00]
would like to consider approval of the minutes from the policy committee meeting on November 4th 2024 may I have a motion in a second please I will move to prove the minutes from the policy committee meeting on November 4th 2024 this is member Jackson yes Courtney Jackson yes yes next time for consideration in action is to consider approval of amendments to sections for J and 4K of the aps Board of Education governance manual

[00:03:00]
I am the presenter but I'm going to ask for a motion in a second before we get to discussion I think I will move to prove the amendments to section 4i of the aps Board of Education governance manual and I will secondary I think we'll need to discuss first so some background information on this and let me my I keep getting a sign

[00:04:00]
all that says my voice quality is poor so just raise your hand if if the voice quality goes bad I'm getting the same too so it's coming on my computer too the policy committee has recommended amendments to sections for I for J and 4K these of the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education governance manual while reviewing the proposed changes for full board consideration the policy chair I noted that a sentence regarding the number of days required for board members to submit questions had been inadvertently omitted from section for I to correct this I recommend that section 4i quote all meetings are open to the public and all meeting materials will be

[00:05:00]
posted publicly 72 hours before the meeting and here's the correction all members are required to submit questions prior to the meeting due dates are included in the boards Weekly Newsletter and listed in the timeline for board meeting agendas the amended sections of the governance manual will be placed on a consent agenda at an upcoming meeting for for full board consideration any discussion about that no I think that makes sense to make it a little bit more General instead of having a number in there I think the only question is in regards to those sections being placed on a consent agenda because these will now need to be incorporated

[00:06:00]
into the governance manual that member of store again I will be working on so I guess I don't know if it if those sections will go to consent or if they will now be incorporated into the full review of the governance manual but my recollection well go ahead someone was going to weigh in our understanding into the government's manual that you're working on that is actually working on those sections not being discussed in the policy committee and then the full governance manual will go to the board for full for full board discussion at a later date right that is correct

[00:07:00]
thank you so any further discussion are we ready to vote Dr Albright I think we are ready for a roll call Vote Yes yes our next item for consideration is the first read of request for information here the

[00:08:00]
search for information task force was appointed in May of 2024 to among other things develop a process for Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education members to request information from the administration the task force chaired by board member Ronaldo is introducing for discussion a policy that would be added as section 4 are to the board's governance manual as well as a process that would be included as an addendum to the manual this is the first read of the proposed policy and process after review by the policy committee the proposed policy and process could be posted for 30 days for public comment and then considered further by the committee at an upcoming meeting and with that background information

[00:09:00]
call marito to provide her report before we enter into a discussion thank you Jose Dominguez I just want to give you a brief review of our work and as we were working on this we saw a structure emerging number one our first task force effort required researching other districts language policy analysis Martinez look to verify a variety of districts part of the Great City schools and outside the council for language ad hoc committee Independent School District in Seattle Independent School District 4 ft language number two simultaneously board members and staff were establishing and learning the

[00:10:00]
Fox platform as of August and based on notes of that meeting with Dr Saavedra not all staff had been trained in many key details important for staff use needed to be resolved however a board Norms document was developed to help guide board members and board services in its use of the let's talk program as a familiarity with the let's talk program grows the board services staff will develop new processes and we find existing processes let's also just remember that this is a work in progress and we need to show our Grace for the work that is emerging because this is brand new and and so it was one of those things as we were working even with staff those unknown questions that were supporting this particular policy you know what answered or that we were looking for you know the answers as we were moving forward with staph in their own

[00:11:00]
is it raining and their initial challenges that they were having we tried to look at some of those challenges but they were still many that were upcoming number three remaining work aligning and combining the existing RFI policy language high-level language and the procedure processes in two procedural documents we used a doctor of losses and the board into one coordinating section for the government's manual we have a patchwork of our five language and processes embedded in board Norms documentary 2024 and doctor of those boards superintendent working agreement Norms communication and constituted services for protocols we need to work closely with the superintendent and probably see analysts to bring the satellite documents into the RFI policy in the governor's manual and through the course of this work you know trying to answer all questions was one where we were

[00:12:00]
I'm trying to draft the language but at the same time the rest of those challenges since this was a new and incoming program and initially with the change of staff and Leadership that also devoted some of the things we worked on and then we had a new staff coming in July and then initially the program was given out to all the District in August and so that also is one of trying to figure out what were some of those challenges but as we met during those meetings we would offer challenges especially as we were receiving emails from community members and how do we quantify or classify some of that information when we were working with Dr Saavedra and sometimes they wouldn't even have the answers so we're hoping with time and the pursuit of pushing forward that we could work out all these Kinks as we move forward in this new policy I know that many questions that were formalized were also

[00:13:00]
showing us that as we're moving forward this breaking down of this policy and how we're going to initiate the processes and eventually work on protocols so that are we can have these ground rules ready to go as we initiate a conversation and communication that's all I have to say I just also would like to add that at our last meeting October 2nd what we were able to figure out was that we needed RFI language in three categories board requests for information from superintendent staff board request for information from each other from board members and then Community requests for information from the board and under that

[00:14:00]
elected officials requesting information of board members parents and constituents requesting information of the board and media in all its forms requesting information of the board and I think that is exactly how the new policy before us is drafted and with that I will open it up for conversation discussion I'm happy to stop and so I am I sent in most of the questions regarding the the policy because

[00:15:00]
I was looking at the helpful links and looking at the charter and trying to match what was in the charter for the RFI policy the committee into the document and so I don't like to just ask questions and not come with Solutions so I if it's okay I have I thought it would be easier if I showed you what some of my edits are which is why I am logged in here twice so that I can maybe just pull up my document to show what some of what my questions were and kind of where I had some suggested edits if that would be okay okay so Christy you might have to help me learn how to share my document you should be able to click on the application

[00:16:00]
I love that you're using okay so share do I want to share screen you probably want to share your application which is usually the second row and choose the screen you want us to see if that makes sense hey Google

[00:17:00]
more particular definitions around some of the language and so what I'm hoping to add here is what that language could potentially be so if you look at at the beginning so the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education all I did was insert requires accurate and timely information to fulfill its governance responsibilities and I inserted that at the top just as a way to like reiterate that the board you know in order for us to do our job we need to have accurate and timely information and then left the rest about prioritizes transparent on his communication as you go down the document let's see I just kind of moved the

[00:18:00]
I moved the information around just a little bit because to me it seems like we needed to start with the the biggest information first and then kind of funnel it to be more specific so again it restates that I think this might already be well that this is new to sorry this is new wording so let me highlight that the board believes an efficient and effective request for information process supports both the informed decision-making without and Julie unburdening staff resources because I do recall that some of the requests of this this policy was to make sure that the board receives what they need but that we're balancing that against unduly burdening the staff or the super

[00:19:00]
then with a lot of information or a lot of requests for information that you know could be Superfluous or could be things that we can find on our own so I just thought it was important to make that first initial statement that this is a balanced process and then the second one is just a reaffirmation that the board again will respect the delineation between governance responsibilities and operational duties which you know we have throughout our governance manual just statements that we're the governor we're the people who got do the governing and the superintendent involve some self and they're the operations side and these next two are new and what I attempted to do there was you can see in my questioning I did question what does readily available mean because for the way it's stated it just says they may request readily available information but we don't have a definition

[00:20:00]
what that is so again I tried to put a process forward that says first of all that board members will evaluate whether whether they're request for information is necessary urgent and an alignment with our responsibilities and then an encouragement of board members which kind of aligns with our board guard rails that we will we will go look for ourselves first to see if we can find that information independently before going you know directly to board services or directly to the superintendent then the next paragraph says if you know if we can't find it and sometimes we can't then we request information from the superintendent and then I put a definition of what readily available is and it's defined as information that exists within current reports dashboards databases or routine Communications and can be provided with minimal stuff effort

[00:21:00]
then that next paragraph which is in here it's in in the original one I think it's number three in the original one I just broke the that that that that that that that line out so we have readily available but then we also have a definition now if something is not considered readily available and then I that yellow is what that definition is is request requiring significant time or new analysis compilation of data or creation of reports that go beyond existing resources so in that yeah so this applies to information I'm reading number four the last sentence the supply chain information that board members cannot easily locate through existing resources what do you mean by existing resources like

[00:22:00]
the reports the dashboards and it's kind of a restatement of number three above I mean it could be redundant cuz number three above is your encouraged to utilize existing reports dashboards or Communications channels so that last sentence doesn't have to necessarily be there if it's basically a restatement of number three above yeah yeah only because it I assumed that you were introducing a new idea of resources so I will make a suggestion yeah

[00:23:00]
and really all I was trying to do in this top section was just to bring some more concrete definitions to the information that was in here the one thing that you will see that I took out is number two in the original which is board members when acting in an official capacity have the right to access different information documents and records official capacity includes governance decisions and actions those two sentences really make me nervous and I'd like to hear your conversation about that because I have I have notes for number two as well okay my so up at the top

[00:24:00]
requires accurate and timely information to fulfill its governance responsibilities that is my attempt to bring in the similar thought process that we have we have the requirement to have information but this number two official capacity to me is very very broad a broad definition and it just makes me so nervous to say that board members have the right to access whatever information they want because I would I would think that there and I know it says for the down in here you know FERPA and you know there's some guardrails listed in here but that sentence feels overwhelming and not not clearly defined

[00:25:00]
so here's here's and I appreciate what you're saying their board member Jackson and I came at it from a different angle because while we most definitely have governance responsibilities we also have are those different from our and I think they are and this is part of the ongoing the ongoing efforts of community engagement and Outreach to essentially teach the community elected officials and that's what's been waiting on my on my mind so

[00:26:00]
I'd like to see language that that also incorporates our elected our responsibilities as elected officials and our governance responsibilities does that make sense it's a healthy for me it's it's it's it's it's it's really really hard about how I communicate yes my constituents elected me and I am their voice I'm here to listen and I'm also here to fulfill a governance Duty set forth by in our pursuit of student outcomes

[00:27:00]
so I think it's a good opportunity to to put in language that honors both I guess my what I guess what I'm trying to burst out between those two is how being elected is different different than having a governing role because to me they're the same thing so I guess I guess if you can pass that out a little bit more for me because I'm I'm elected to govern to me I'm allowed to govern the Board of Education through my governments I bring in constituent voice I make sure that the superintendent is reaching the goals so I guess I'm using governance as the overarching umbrella

[00:28:00]
to bringing in constituent voice and you know overseeing the superintendent well so I think we we all received requests for information that are oftentimes outside of outside the the four goals and our guard rails twice now with with Charter Schools one time State authorized

[00:29:00]
turn off in the proper in the proper direction right let's talk all right so I think it's important to recognize that those governance does not always converge with an elected officials role and in particular when it comes to request for information and public the Public's right to know I think we need to navigate navigate

[00:30:00]
board responsibilities in so that makes it a little bit more cuz you know from what you were saying board response your responsibilities include governance as well as constituent responsibilities well people view us I think there's a role as an elected official most definitely and I don't think it's always in I think it's good to have governance in there because that's part of our new role we need to teach about our role as a government or responsibility with regard to governments even as we fulfill our role as an elected official and sometimes those two things don't match up but our job is to to respond appropriately and direct

[00:31:00]
I'm directing you to to where you can get that answer that you're looking for but I also like reiterating this is my role from a governance standpoint and I was going to say I think I think that's a dress below let's see I guess what I'm saying is I don't want it buried I just like you have it at the top I think it's important to in this right off the bat let people know yes we recognize our

[00:32:00]
ability as an elected official and as a as a I think what's what's worrying me about official capacity it's where it's saying have the right to access District information documents and records I just honestly I do not think that as board members we have the rights to access that information we have the right to request it we have but I just it seems like that is an intrusion into the operational side of some of the more specifics can we ask questions about it yes but I

[00:33:00]
I don't think that we have the right just by being board members to demand access to that information and and I know that you know further down here there's a whole you know list of you know what what we can be what can be accessed and all of that but I just really have a problem saying that we as in an official capacity or as an elected official have the right to that information because I just honestly don't think we do let me give you some history there was a time on the board when board members wanted to know the disciplinary report breakdown by demographics and that was like pulling teeth so that's not okay

[00:34:00]
and there was a time when putting the information that is up now with supper we take that for granted there was a time when that was not readily available and so you know I mean we hear from we at the New Mexico School Board Association we have access to information that other schools by demographics not so readily available so I understand what you're saying but

[00:35:00]
I don't know I think I think this language and I think this came from Austin which surprised me I think this is from Austin you know I'm just going to say something to that I think the clarifying of personal information versus overall District information cuz I know even if purple laws are broken when you get very personal based on individual family and their names and who they are but I think information based on the district like you were talking about the behaviors and the patterns and as long as that we don't need school districts or named people that sometimes and there are lines that we got to be responsible for but I think that

[00:36:00]
I can I think by stating what we are in the first one if we don't clarify it writes it can become a problem and I'm only agreeing with Courtney that that in there when we have the right to access right to access or the words that are concerning for me also because when we say that it's just like do we have that right for personal or and I know that is as we go into the whole purpose and that's further down and if nobody understands those things all they're going to see is the right and that's when we can fall into problems and so I was going to suggest that we can't you know can we bring some legal guard rail language into that I mean

[00:37:00]
our position is elected officials should give us a right to to some information right reasonable a reasonable amount of information to do our jobs and to be responsive to the goals and the guard rails so how can we work so we get to that I like the beat the and I agree I agree with with with what you're both pointing out

[00:38:00]
and I'm also suggesting that as elected officials in order for us to do our jobs we should be able to request information that allows us to do the job that we were elected to do but also the job that we are as a board we have agreed to do focus on students what about something like something like that

[00:39:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:40:00]
so how much of the details under accordingly are necessary here know the details under here lay out the like the step process that the board members should take its reiterating that we that we don't want to burden this stuff it's disgusting that there is a delineation between governance and operational and then it starts with the steps of board members to try to find it on their own then if they can't then they should go to then it defines what readily available is and then it goes then the third step is something is if something is not readily available

[00:41:00]
the formal request for information and then the rest of it is that stuff that was in there already where you know giving the superintendent the right to assign to staff that that statement that's throughout everything else talking about that you know if it's given to one board member it needs to be given to all and then FERPA so that's just the broad statement and then down below is where the processes so in the number five the highlighted section request requiring significant time on your analysis compilation of data or creation of reports

[00:42:00]
go beyond existing I don't know what you mean by resources Beyond reports dashboards Communications information The Avenues for information everything that you just mentioned before resources sometimes conjures up I don't want money to be the issue

[00:43:00]
that we don't get information oh you're thinking of it as a financial services that go beyond existing requests period

[00:44:00]
if we can have those existing resources or know what they are I don't know how we Define that but I guess that would be based on us about that sounds good

[00:45:00]
do we have anything in there about our what's the red button call under our let's talk is it bored or something is that part of the data or what are we calling that the red button that's okay cuz that's another Avenue this is where it really starts to get particular right now you don't want to create confusion

[00:46:00]
here is just the general policy statement as to how and when information is requested and what kind of information is requested okay so you know I'm really I appreciate I appreciate the the work you've done on this draft I just wish we had had it earlier so that we could have gone over it because I just did it today cuz I've been out of town for a week because I don't like to ask questions but not come with Solutions so I was trying to be posted and I appreciate that

[00:47:00]
I appreciate the like the conversation that we're having right now but my suspicion is that you've already you may have addressed some of what board member to mentioned and that was that bringing to Bear some of the documents and Dr avocado's here today and the stuff that I thought pertains to us kind of inserted it in if it wasn't already in there I mean there was some stuff that was already in there so I did look at a voice but I didn't see the board Norms yeah we didn't we didn't put it

[00:48:00]
although I think some of this is I think some of this is in there already but let's let's I guess what I'm concerned about is let's see how far we we can get okay but I would like time with this document Solutions Solutions and then gives the steps or the or the or the subjects for each one of these areas that

[00:49:00]
Defiance it more it just depends in a broader and then it details it more further I like it I do like it thanks I have Miss Briscoe from La Cueva honors English to thank for that she taught me how to do something they were both phenomenal phenomenal yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah do you want me to pop down here to the like the the process yes so if you could if you could take us through the questions that like what you added that address your questions that might hey what did I do so

[00:50:00]
I think what I did was yeah all I did in this section was try to incorporate the the general principles that we placed in the above section into particulars now like what is the process so you can see what that first sentence right here is an information request is necessary right it could be that it's not because we've independently found the answer on our own yeah board members should submit it through the distance let's talk platform which yeah you was already in here and then I actually and I kept everything else that you guys had the requested include details about the information needed the purpose and the desired timeline and then

[00:51:00]
the superintendent will coordinate with support staff as as needed that was all their the second one so number two is new so really this one it's not new I think I just restarted it the second one that is new where it says request deemed routine or non-urgent will be addressed through standard updates or existing reports such as our Weekly Newsletter and I when I first pop this in the earlier today I put the boards at a glance I was very specific but I noticed in the for i that we just approved to add a glance is referred to as the Weekly Newsletter so I changed it to boards Weekly Newsletter so that everything is similar or is the same

[00:52:00]
while essential governance related information will require the formal RFI process so things that you know Dr Blakey can just pop into the weekly out of glance perfect do that but if if not if we need to go through more the more stuffed process that's listed down below then we can do that and then this wasn't in here but again it's it's it's it's in our governance manual and other places that board members will participate in a transparent process to track and evaluate the volume and types of requests made to the staff that's listed it's listed somewhere else in our governance manual so I just brought it in and then everything else is what you guys already had

[00:53:00]
repeat what you just explained that you brought in from the governance from the government yeah which was the number three on their board members will participate in a transparent process to track and evaluate the volume and type of request made to staff like for example our one of our board guard rails is guardrail 5 board members will not be disrespectful of Staff time and resources and will establish a process for tracking the cost of Staff time dedicated to board support in order to reduce both burden and costs so that's just popping up our guardrail our board guard rail 5 so I have so I do have some concerns about this one

[00:54:00]
so what we have in the governance manual is more high-level language whereas this begins to get into I think burdensome behaviors like board members will participate in a transparent process in a process to track and evaluate the volume and type of requests made to staff that's like one more thing to navigate and I just don't we have a lot already on our plate I think just leaving it at a high level language for now is important let's talk

[00:55:00]
it automatically does that okay so we can figure out how to filter that reports assess staff input recommend policy adjustments identify what are constituents what their concerns are you know right so we need results

[00:56:00]
in the effort to track data we create more work

[00:57:00]
when is necessary so I would prefer to just leave superintendent those particular requests if it wasn't through let's talk so right now we track our time so several different time management tools where we track time that we spend with the board and then that puts together once a month for the board as part of your monitoring so we do monitor in that sense anytime we're doing board work and how often have we gotten those reports

[00:58:00]
I believe we're on our third month of tracking time and they appeared yeah we do it the last day of every month so we just finished Dr Albright's probably picking up the stragglers for November's time okay so it's been since number and those are being posted so I know that it was discussed during the Johannes on during the when you were doing your self evaluation tool and then I believe it's in the at a glance but it looks like Miss King is on yes what

[00:59:00]
what we're doing is we're tracking it monthly but will present it as part of yourself evaluation or your time use I think it's part of yourself evaluation so you'll get a report in January because I think one of the things that you're evaluate that you evaluate on is the use of Staff time so you'll see a report in at the January meeting is that the language that's there is that in alignment with what is has started what were in the third month of doing like is that in alignment with what is already being done on the difference will participate in the process to track and evaluate the volume and I think we do it on the staff side so I don't know if board members them

[01:00:00]
keep track of how many requests they've made of stuff probably right now we're not doing it per board member we do it as an overall time tracker so we don't have it by you know the actual board member as far as time and we haven't done it with what we're using that time doing so we haven't said that that's preparing reports in response to a board members so we haven't gotten in that detail as far as our tracking of time we have that I'm sorry that's what I was going to add as we do time but we don't do time but not type okay

[01:01:00]
at least from my perspective cuz I can see if like we're understaffed in the board office or if like there's a lot of requests coming in and we don't and the staff is overburdened with time that's being taken away from them working on something else so I mean it's helpful in that sense it is time consuming to track time but it is helpful data because we're able to see if we are understaffed or what information is being requested and I could add to that we we we we do the volume we also put a cost to it so we find out what hourly rates are and then multiply that out as well it's not fine I mean it's not science it's kind of estimated but it gives you all an idea

[01:02:00]
so it sounds like the concern is that so A Chair Dominguez that your concern is that it's now the staff side's already doing it but your concern is that now we're making a request of board members to participate okay I would say I think it feels like part of our obligation to make sure that we're not overburdening the staff with requests and so my sense is is that what that process is we actually do need to participate and maybe that maybe the participation is solely understanding what that volume and type is when we self-evaluate when we have our self-evaluation

[01:03:00]
evaluation and maybe that's what we do but board members will participate in a transparent process orderly to evaluate requests made to stuff again I mean you start getting into how you know how many questions are you submitting and how are they valid and who decides that they're valid I mean I think that at some point you have to we are elected officials and we do respond to you know the platforms we ran on and we're out to certain and aside from that just doing due diligence so

[01:04:00]
so I submit more questions on Charter Schools than anybody else is that is that a bad thing I just I don't think that it's a healthy I don't think this is setting us up for a healthy monitoring of governance my particular high school that like you know or you're doing more charters

[01:05:00]
special education like I don't think that's what it is I think it's how much time are we which we do quarterly anyway as a self-evaluation and it's important for us to know that because I don't think it's about the type or about the who I think it's are we are we going through those first steps of how we figured it out ourselves we found it independently I think having this this this this this policy is actually going to help because it's going to force us as board members to walk through those steps and think okay well can I find myself instead of just immediately going to Christy to say Christie I can't find this so maybe maybe having this policy I think it's going to be fantastic forces us into those steps but that's just my thought I think it's important

[01:06:00]
I will say this I've been on supper and have struggled with trying to filters and information only to find out after sitting next to Chris West oh you can't get that on your own you know just just email us and we'll give you the information I'd rather just go straight to but I don't want that I have misgivings about how how this will be used Dr Blakey do you have any sorry sorry it's helpful because we can see if

[01:07:00]
missing the mark and where we're providing information so I you know I understand it's burdensome to keep track of it but it's helpful to us because there's seven different individuals going to various staff and if it comes into one place then I as a superintendent can see if there are places that were not staffed very well or we're not giving the right information and so it helps to be able to kind of identify from that point from us it's easier to be able to identify if there's gaps in the information that were providing without the staff feeling that they're being directed to do something totally off so I have found that in tracking the hours it's been actually helpful to be able to see how staff is spending time on board and I've been kind of like

[01:08:00]
a little bit more specific on certain staff members like don't you know it needs to go through the board office don't just start putting stuff together for the board so it helps kind of collecting data does help us and how we're trying to work streamlining systems just the last thing that I was going to say was I think the reason that it is also important is it causes the board members to evaluate to make sure that we are not directing staff so by collecting this by collecting this data in a group sense

[01:09:00]
it's also just the reminder that we are like everything the only person that we can have conversations with essentially is the superintendent and that we're not having conversations directly with staff and so by collecting this data and by evaluating this data it's just that quarterly reminder of what is our governance job actually is so that's all I'm going to say about that so how do we track just a question how do we track like so we would track all our questions around progress monitoring around because that's mostly it's usually progress monitoring and then follow ups right that follow up questions that we have or like in this case

[01:10:00]
questions around audit or Finance or policy no I actually think I think it's becoming more challenging than it actually needs to be so if you'll see I just said board members will participate in a transparent process quarterly to evaluate request made by staff all that is is our quarterly self-evaluation like I am not I don't anticipate board members you know monthly questions are we quarterly evaluating that we are staying in our lane because I think that second sentence is actually really important for what our role is right like we we

[01:11:00]
you have to be able to see that data to we need to see Trends to we need to know if if there's policy adjustments that need to be made like there are things there is information that we need to be held accountable to as well no I mean I heard I think what I heard from superintendent was important like a particular office staff to do the work that student now comes governance is requiring and and the inverses are our questions helpful to that end okay so I can I can live with that getting rid of tracking and evaluating the volume and

[01:12:00]
I think that this creates more of that your requests and whatever you make to the staff is being monitored and trapped not track just monitored and to identify Trends and staff impact and whether we need to request the policy of yeah I agree with it so is is that did you say that was the last was the only thing that I added to what you guys had okay okay okay okay okay keep going so bored of Education internal request I think this

[01:13:00]
this is what you were saying that you guys identify that there were three levels of requests in one of those were bored requests to each other right you said to have to remember to get into constitutions New Mexico by only question about this about this whole section is if it's more of like a guardrail discussion but I just don't know I mean I guess I'm kind of the ambivalent about this section what did you guys what did you

[01:14:00]
interpret was like the need for board member to board member where would this where would this section come into play I guess is my question asking committee chairs for information or clarification is that we resolve any

[01:15:00]
that we have conversations before meetings right before a vote before meetings and that can be board meetings but it can also be committee meetings and so creating an Avenue for for doing that I think is one reason for internal internal requests can you remember or remember I'm going to look at the notes from other districts

[01:16:00]
I think how many times within the conversations cuz I know as a new board member not really understanding that Quorum piece when we're trying to communicate and the email system and I know that that I know that's not written in here but it was one of the areas that I know that was concerning when we sent out emails how many people do we have on it do we prefer talking with one another remember Quorum you know all of those particulars and I know that's one reason not to violate the opens meetings is something straight out of sfg

[01:17:00]
it's raining okay yeah so this is just kind of meant to give some structure to how board members communicate with each other yeah and also number four

[01:18:00]
Miss Martinez do you have any thoughts to add to maybe where this came from or the necessity of it I think that this was part of the conversation and this language was pulled in the early stages of the app locks work from one of the other school districts off the top of my head I can't recall which school district so I can tell you that it was I do recall that part of what was shared with the app from the app with with me in her early conversations was making sure that the development of this policy was this comprehensive as possible and being sure to

[01:19:00]
not direct but a little

[01:20:00]
I think some of these tenants tenants from sfg are important and five well until I mean I think board member Gonzalez if you weren't able to complete the

[01:21:00]
play by a certain time right so I think some of them even as I said in there and I think that's what we can sort of Define as our own versus I have more suggestions so my my first thing is right here is can some of this be incorporated into 4p

[01:22:00]
is community engagement with the board of education so let me give you let me give you my background on this one when I read the charter the way I read the charter was that this was more looking for more looking for information on how we take the data that we get from the information the feedback that we get from constituents whether it's other elected officials families or the media how do we take that information and process it through our system right how do we kind of similar to what we talked about above with how are we collecting that so that we are being responsive to what the community is asking us

[01:23:00]
so what I didn't think it was was what it what it what you guys did where it was very particular about is if you get questions this is how you should answer them right which is that first section like if somebody contacts you you should listen respectfully confirm that they've used less let's talk and all of that so what I did because I wasn't sure which what the premise behind this was is I left both of them so you'll see there's two sections so there's this section of if you get a question if you you know you get a question with constituents and you're talking with them directly here's what you should do listen respectfully confirm that they've gone through let's talk make sure you share information you know all the things that you guys already had in there

[01:24:00]
but then down below I said additionally to assess engagement and track the effectiveness of these efforts which is what I thought we were supposed what this information section was doing then I laid out a whole section of how are we going to engage with the community now this section I think can actually be moved over to Forte at least twice a year

[01:25:00]
we will have ongoing Communications with them so I think all of this or a good portion of that and and this is something that board member historic and I can talk about we can potentially add this into 4 pics then leaves this section up here okay so okay the original says guardrail for encourages apparently legal guardian student and Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations and the board of education is committed to community engagement and Outreach I took all of that out because a sinking forward

[01:26:00]
there could potentially come a time where guardrail for is not that particular guardrail right just 6 years down the road if we reevaluate our guard rail it could be that guard rail for changes so I took that sentiment and it changed it into the board is committed to fostering transparency trust and collaboration period and then took what you guys had as a result board members I changed it to will have regular contact because we will write it's not we may be contacted we all know that we are going to we will be contacted and we should have regular contact that's the thing it's not just that we're just standing there and we may be contacted it's that it's the truth is that somebody's going to call us but it's also a true is that it's our responsibility

[01:27:00]
need to be out there interacting with our constituents so I think so this this was already here that was already there as a result period

[01:28:00]
Are you standing up constituents engage with the district I would be more specific like I would because this I think it would be important to unless this section is going to have the title request from constituents community members elected officials and the media if that's the case then no sorry OK Google how are we you know so I think this actually

[01:29:00]
yeah okay okay so then maybe we should leave as a result the superintendent about the inquiry and confirm whether the individual has fallen District procedures blah blah blah so where is that that was just a style thing for me

[01:30:00]
we moved it to the second one because I thought the very first thing you should do if your contacted by constituents is just be respectful so it was just an order thing I just moved it and then the second one okay okay yeah and I took out inform the superintendent about the inquiry because I'm sorry I just did I took that part out and just said confirm whether the individual has followed District procedures because we don't have to inform the superintendent on every single constituent discussion that we have but what we do need to do right I mean if you get a question about if I get a question about the starting hours at Hubert Humphrey I don't have to inform Gabriella Dr Blakey about that but I do have to say

[01:31:00]
okay well did you did you submit it through let's talk did you talk to your principal did you did you take all of those other steps that you have to take first and you guys already had it in there right here referred questions you cannot answer to the superintendent okay so would you highlight in yellow number please so anything that's not highlighted Joseph but it's been moved

[01:32:00]
three and then number two was essentially number one but you put it up well and remove the superintendent from just confirming that procedures were followed including let's talk about the only thing that I added was a connection to the process above that if we can't touch the questions they go to the superintendent and then we will follow the process that we have outlined above okay six

[01:33:00]
6 was the same seven is essentially the 7 no 7 you changed when speaking hey Google and the statement of board members when they're acting individually to me those are two separate issues so I just I don't know and then number nine I think

[01:34:00]
it might be redundant to number 877 and 8 and then yeah for media increase and that's something that I can talk about when we evaluate the governance manual OK Google

[01:35:00]
oh you're welcome it's it's one of my favorite things to do is write policy yeah it works so good good good good good so goodbye on Board of Education

[01:36:00]
I am also happy to take another look at it and since you're the chair of this of the ad hoc I can send my suggestions to you over the next 30 days if you want it so I can do that and I just looked at this stuff today so I haven't totally processed but that this is the stuff that I could get right off the bat based on the questions that I submitted okay I think that I'm happy to just send those to directly to you if that's okay yeah that's fine how do you feel about that supposed to know I think that's fine I'm looking at it again and yeah I think you're right that we could use some more precise language we don't know what surprise are embarrass

[01:37:00]
that were avoiding if yeah yeah I think that I agree I look forward to improving that section internal requests don't know how to stop sharing we are done with discussion right now will be board member Jackson
