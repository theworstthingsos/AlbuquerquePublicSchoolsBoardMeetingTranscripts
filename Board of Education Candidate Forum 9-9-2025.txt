[00:17:00]

[00:18:00]
population and I will bring all of my skills and knowledge in the classroom to this position and I appreciate your support thank you very much for you now Courtney Jackson district 7 thank you yes I am Courtney Jackson I am the proud parent of two beautiful daughters who attend APS schools I am a liqueur graduate myself go Bears and lifelong at Albuquerque resident and the current vice president of the school board above all else I have spent my time being committed to putting students first I believe that at its core the work of the board is to focus on student achievement accountability and Community engagement not politics and not rhetoric through the goals and the guard rails that we have established I am proud to say that what we're doing is working our reading and math outcomes have

[00:19:00]
more students are ready for graduation and our families and Community are having a stronger voice I was elected 4 years ago to be a change agent and I have spent every single day since that time doing just that thank you very much Courtney are we up last but not least Kristen would district 7 my name is Kristen or I'm running for Albuquerque School Board District 7 in the Northeast Heights I am a very proud mom to a gifted student with disabilities and I have been a Relentless advocate for my child to receive support and services at APS and I don't think it's fair that my child gets Services because I'm her mom while other students go without so I'm running for school board to be an advocate for every child I have also taught English as a second language on three different

[00:20:00]
and I've spent most of my career in public safety advocating for victims to get the Justice they deserve and recently managed 12 million in our state to address violent crime thank you very much Kristen and thank you very much for introducing yourself and now we will begin asking questions that were submitted by the community and Danielle Gonzales you are first up and we'll rotate to your left and come right back to Mr Flores first question for you what is the difference between the role of the superintendent and the role of a board member yeah thank you this will be for one minute I'll start with the role of the school board which according to New Mexico State Statute is to approve policy to approve the budget and to hire manage and evaluate the superintendent all of that I believe needs to be in the interest

[00:21:00]
of improving student outcomes which means all of that the budget the policy and the superintendent evaluation needs to align to student outcomes I also believe it's the responsibility of school board members to be prepared to read materials to ask questions and to be strategic about their work and stay out of the work of the superintendent and their role is to run the district so all of the other administrative work being responsible for determining the strategy determining the curriculum determining the instruction hiring and firing and supporting School staff all falls into the purview of the superintendent thank you very much next up we have Ryan Lawrence Jr same question do you need to repeat it no thank you no Okay one minute this is something that I'm very familiar with I mentioned during my introduction that for the past three years I've served on the governing Council for Mount mahogany community school now it's just one school and APS is a large Urban School District with many schools

[00:22:00]
at Mount mahogany is similar to the responsibility shared by APS board members the Hallmark in my opinion of an effective board member is the ability to ask questions and that is where I will be leaning very heavily on my experience to ask the questions that are sometimes hard and are currently being unasked the board has one employee for APS that would be the superintendent and the board has to do their due diligence to ensure that their selecting the right candidate because the board is not in place to micromanage the work of the superintendent the board besides hiring the superintendent was also evaluate and potentially fire the superintendent thank you thank you very much Brian Mr Martinez do you need no thank you yes so the board of education has three primary responsibilities as it's been mentioned to create

[00:23:00]
stop District policy to hire fire evaluate manage the superintendent and to review and approve the budget I agree and I think that all of these things need to be we need to keep in mind student outcomes everything that we do needs to be centered around student outcomes these are Big responsibilities that the board has and if given the opportunity I would be prepared and ready to face those responsibilities on thank you thank you very much Mr Martinez why are you good do you need a repeat no thank you one minute so the school board represents the public in public schools school board members have two really important constituents one constituency is the schools and parents in their specific District but another constituency is

[00:24:00]
all the schools and parents throughout APS there's no question that the superintendent plays a critical role in implementation but I argue that we should look at implementation as a collaborative effort between the superintendent principals teachers and parents so I think implementation needs to be an ongoing conversation between all of these stakeholders thank you very much Courtney Jackson do you need a repeat what some people have already said we've been doing this work now for four years but there is a really clear distinction the fact that the board is the entity that governs and the superintendent is the one who implements the goals the job of the board is to set the vision to adopt goals to establish guard rails to approve a budget

[00:25:00]
is it in support of those goals and to hold the superintendent accountable to those goals what the board does is we focus on the what which are the outcomes and the why they matter for our students the superintendent handles the how by managing the daily operations Staffing curriculum etcetera I think one thing that's crucial to point out is that unlike say A legislature We Are One governing body we are united in our work to advance the goals and we are not seven individuals with seven different agendas thank you very much Courtney moving on to Kristen would you need a repeat what is the difference between the role of the superintendent and the role of a board member a good school board member is an advocate for every student to receive a quality education

[00:26:00]
are most sacred duty is to keep students safe while they're in the care of the district a good school board member provides strong fiscal oversight and ensures every taxpayer dollar is being used responsibly and effectively and the school board holds the superintendent accountable to the community and ensures the concerns of parents students and teachers are being addressed thank you very much Kristen we move on to our questions that helps students but also making sure that we're listening to our communities and the very real concerns

[00:27:00]
we know that we are supposed to create policy approve the budget and most importantly have that partnership to make sure that we're making real changes that our community wants to see and that it's rooted in the classroom and what our parents are saying on the ground it is important that we open up the classroom to the public and make sure that everybody has a seat at the table that is the only way this process works is by making sure that we all have a say in the students education all right thank you very much this is your question first school board decisions are often spark strong Community reactions both supportive and critical how would you engage with the community to build trust listen to concerns and respond to push back while still making decisions in the best interests of students 1 minute ultimately

[00:28:00]
they need to know what my values are and one of the reasons the many reasons why I'm excited to be here tonight is to share my values with you most importantly as a former special education teacher and sharing with you that my value is that all students can learn and all students can meet high expectations and my decision-making will always go back to a student-centered approach first and always if I am lucky enough to be elected to the board I would engage with the community in a number of ways I would rely on the district and colleagues on the board to figure out what has been done in the past in terms of Engagement I would be responsive in terms of emails as a even as a candidate I'm sure we've already received the same candidate questionnaires and I've done a good job of responding to those to ensure that folks know why I'm running

[00:29:00]
and what I would do as a board member thank you thank you Brian Joshua same question please repeat the question as Sir School Board decisions often spark strong Community reactions both supportive and critical how would you engage the community to build trust listen to concerns and respond to push back while still making decisions in the best interest of students 1 minute thank you for the question for a number of years and I've been a part of the West Side involved in the west side in a number of different areas currently HOA president of my homeowners association currently the president of my neighborhood association involved in many other boards in community events and activities across the west side so people know me in the west side they know where I stand what I do what I'm about a family oriented I have a young family where I decided

[00:30:00]
where we decided to raise our family on the west side because of all the great things that the west side has to offer and so my my values and ideas ultimately are to Center student-centered focus as well and my constituents as well as the rest of the community understand that that's where my heart is where my passion is and I am very available for everyone to reach me in contact me thank you thank you thank you very much yes all right question mark how would you engage the community to build trust listen to concerns and respond to push back while still making decisions in the best interest of students

[00:31:00]
I just want to say the most important word you said in that question is listen so I went to the Yazi Martinez listening session on August 20th and I learned so much from different parents about wonderful opportunities we have to make our schools stronger and one idea that I brought back to my own classroom is how do we celebrate the strength that students bring to us I'm a big fan of having Town Halls focus groups and I think we should audit our strategic plan on a bio annual basis which is another chance for parents and constituents to give us feedback thank you very much no I think I'm okay one minute thank you so yes obviously there are lots of hard decisions that have to be made by by board members all the time and I think that when way that we can build trust is by being

[00:32:00]
very clear about what the roles and responsibilities are while always maintaining a focus on improving our student outcomes focusing on their long-term goals and their Improvement I think one thing that I have tried to do is really explained that certain decisions everything from hiring principles to bus schedules are superintendents job and not the work of the board but that certainly doesn't mean that I have ever ignored concerns I do believe it is my responsibility and my obligation to listen to elevate their input when need be and to stay engaged during the process at all times so we recognize that not every outcome is going to satisfy everyone but if we're transparent and responsive to and maintain an ongoing dialogue we can remain trust thank you thank you Kristen do you

[00:33:00]
can you repeat all right scuba decisions often spark strong Community reactions both supportive and critical how would you engage with the community to build trust listen to concerns and respond to push back while still making decisions in the best interest of students 1 minute a good school board member is also a voice for the community this school board likes to talk about Community engagement but when I went to one of those Community engagement events to talk to my school board member about student safety I was dismissed and that's one of the reasons I am running for office many parents and staff in the Cleveland Community have shared with me how unhappy they are with the superintendent and it's the boards responsibility to ensure that the community is listening to you when the community is ignored that falls on the board

[00:34:00]
we need to restore transparency and there are some simple things we can do we can bring back the direct contact information for the school board members so community members can easily contact their elected officials we need to lift the undemocratic policy that prohibits some board members from speaking publicly about their votes we need to truly listen and engage thank you Kristen Isaac same question do you need a repeat decisions often spark strong Community reactions both supportive and critical how would you engage with the community to build trust listen to concerns and respond to push back while still making decisions in the best interest of students one minute I believe that that word trust in your question is so important first we need to start by rebuilding trust with the community that has been lost which also falls into what I said previously about opening up

[00:35:00]
the classroom for those that are in the community ultimately if we're following our values and we're taking care of our students and the most vulnerable students within our communities we know that regardless of pushback we are in good company it is important that while an APS board that we make sure that we are fighting for the majority of students and making sure that we are fighting for our most vulnerable and those don't have that don't have a voice so it is super important that if we're going to build trust that we show where in this fight for all students thank you very much with the Flores Danielle Denzel is do you need a repeat no thank you okay one minute thank you I want to take it piece by piece and starting with the building trust component I think the most important thing that we can do is to be transparent to communicate to communicate our timelines and to communicate our guard rails in terms of what informs what we can and can't make decisions on I think we need to be present in our community and I think we need to listen to Listen to concerns I think we need to listen to

[00:36:00]
buddy we need to listen to ptas We need to attend neighborhood association meetings we need to read our emails we need to host Town Halls we need a host Community conversations we need to listen to public forum I think to respond to push back I would like to acknowledge that not every decision is easy and there's no way to keep every single person in Albuquerque happy all the time that's just the facts and so to guide that I would always Center students and Families First Center students Center equity and center student outcomes I think you need to listen to multiple point of views and at the end of the day prioritize what is best for the largest group of students in our whole Community not just any one group of parents all right that concludes question number two we are rolling along here just one Martinez you have the first jump on number three here's your question and it is for one minute what ideas do you have to strengthen Partnerships between schools and families to support students success

[00:37:00]
yes thank you for the question so it's as a parent parent parent involvement is very important my wife and I are very involved with our students education I think that is needs to be something that's important for everyone it's a crucial part of our students lives to have parents being involved with their education whether that's helping them read at night whether that's helping them prioritize homework whatever it may be period critical the teacher parents relationship needs to be built on trust we need to have a teachers who really believe in our students that's very important when students believe when teachers believe in our

[00:38:00]
events that they can do anything that they want to do that also helps with the relationship between teachers and parents thank you thank you very much Mr Martinez do you need a repeat do you have to strengthen Partnerships between schools and families to support Student Success 1 minute thank you well I just wanted to mention that I have two children in high school at 8 p.m. I have a 17 year old and a 15 year old son at Sandia high and also that I'm an immigrant kid so I think when we talked about connecting with the community we need to make sure that we include those those English language Learners as we've heard from myself in a few other candidates I like the idea of town halls I had a great experience at the Yazzie Martinez listening session and I think we should do by annual

[00:39:00]
which give parents and community members a chance to say what they think is going well in terms of the goals and guard rails and strategic plan and areas where they'd like to see Improvement thank you very much okay what ideas do you have to strengthen Partnerships between schools and families to support Student Success all right thank you so much for that so I think in order to strengthen our partners between our schools and if families the first thing that we need to do and continue to do is to have an opening consistent communication with a shared focus on what students success is families are our children are our child's first teachers and schools are much more effective when they honor and build upon that Bond as a board member I have worked really hard and diligently to be out amongst my community

[00:40:00]
and I believe that our role is to continue to do that and to continue to do policies and allocate resources so that it makes it easier for our schools to engage families in meaningful ways some of the ways that we've done that is increased our community engagement events I usually go to PTA meetings but more than that I also spend time out with organizations who have a relationship with APS and that was fast thank you very much I really love about Albuquerque Public Schools is our community schools and Community Schools are really cool model that address the root causes of the challenges that families and students are facing that impeached student outcomes so they provide support services community

[00:41:00]
to ensure that every family and student has the tools they need to succeed so I'd like to expand on this model and recently I went to one of those Community Schools the Native American community school and they had a pow wow and I talked to several of the students there and many of them were engaging in a cultural craft traditional crafts in a multi General way generational way with their families and I asked them what they like about their school and they said they felt respected their needs were taken care of and they felt like they were a real Community thank you Kristen moving on to mister Florida so as many of you know education doesn't just ended the classroom which is why it's so important that we're investing in our community schools that were investing and parent training so that our parents can make sure that

[00:42:00]
sing a cyst the students with education outside of the classroom and that we have an open line of communication so that we actually have that partnership that we need with our parents as someone who works within the juvenile detention system I work with these families every day that do not have the support that they need and I've seen the devastating consequences of that so if we want to make any real impact or a real difference we need to make sure that we're supporting these most vulnerable students and their families and that they have the support systems outside of school so that they can actually succeed when they're within the classroom thank you very much Danielle Gonzales same question right thank you I do think the community schools are critically important and that we can continue to invest both in that model and in those roles particularly our community school coordinators I think part of coordinating between school and family is also engaging employers because that's where our families are during the day and so I think working with employers including

[00:43:00]
ingredients to make sure that we're providing work-based learning experiential learning and internship opportunities for our students I think the district needs to prioritize responsiveness and make sure that everyone in the district no matter what their role is respectful and response to all questions and concerns from the community I think we need to continue our parents and student advisory Council that the school level and at the district level and I think we need to communicate a holistic vision of success between our families and our students which includes academic as well as social emotional well-being and I think the best thing we could do to support our schools and our families together would be to advocate for paid family leave thank you Brian do you need a repeat I do not okay I am a strong proponent of the community school strategy I hope to provide more details about that in a later question the question was about Partnerships between schools and families I want to talk specifically about teachers and families and want to talk about specifically my experience as a special education teacher

[00:44:00]
100 % of my students have IEPs and I told my students at the beginning of the school year and throughout the school year that they were lucky to have an IEP and one of the big reasons why my students were lucky to have an IEP is because of the relationship between myself as their math teacher or case manager and the families one of the best parts of being a teacher is engaging with families oftentimes students and special education they hear about their deficits their families hear about their deficits one of the reasons why I was successful working with the families of my students is because even though we have to have a conversation about what we need to do to work together all students have strengths thank you very much Brian thank you very much for answering three questions so it's hard to give him a round of applause but don't try to restrain myself so we are moving along we are at question number four

[00:45:00]
are you here Bowman you are next up for number four and this is for 45 seconds 45 seconds timekeepers ready to roll question number four how will you increase Community engagement with parents and Educators and ensure all voices of your constituents are heard okay well this reminds me of the last question but I think one of the things that we need to do is figure out from our communities we spend a lot of time talking about the deficits in our communities but what are the assets and strengths which are communities bring and that will help each School help our teachers and our administrators to connect more closely with those communities and I don't like to have a skills based focused where parents and community members can help teach in the school's not on their education on their traditional skills or other cult

[00:46:00]
all right how will you increase Community engagement with parents and Educators and ensure all voices of your constituents are heard 45 seconds this is a great question because this is something we've been working really hard on over the past few years and to increase our community engagement so one thing that we are really working on that I hope to continue is to make sure that a major decisions that are made including the budget when we set the goals when we have a big decisions we go out to the community we make sure that we go out to you we don't expect you to come to us we have also on the community engagement ad hoc committee has set very specific goals as to families that might not typically come to events like that

[00:47:00]
and so we have a boar as a board have made an effort to make sure that we reach out to those families very specifically to invite them to our events thank you very much Courtney Kristen same question thank you so I already talked a little bit about how we would engage with families and students but I want to address the other part of that question how would we communicate with Educators our teachers and staff and I think it's really important to work closely with the Union the teachers union here with their concerns are and make sure we're providing a safe positive environment for our teachers and we're respecting the collective bargaining process all right thank you very much Kristen Isaac same question I believe it's super important that as a board member we spend more time in our communities and within our schools the best way to understand the very real challenges that are students are parents and our

[00:48:00]
Peter's faith is to be within those classrooms it's very easy to you know stand from a position like this and see things on a spreadsheet but unless you're on the ground with these parents and with these teachers you don't understand the issues as they are so it's super important that we're working closely with our Educators our parents and listening to our students thank you very much Isaac Miss Gonzalez same question thank you I wanted to know in about the point around all voices because frequently people think about Community engagement is meaning some voices or perhaps even the loudest voices or those with the most privileged so I think our work is really to focus on making sure that we're reaching those families who are not included in that group so I think the goals that Miss Jackson mentioned particularly around engaging Native American English Learners families of students with disabilities and families from economically disadvantaged backgrounds is critically important I think we need to do it from multiple venues and multiple formats including in person

[00:49:00]
surveys through Partnerships to forums through town halls and in multiple languages thank you very much again I would have really lean on my experience as a special education teacher and advocating for students with disabilities and students in all of the student groups covered by the Yazzie Martinez case one of the topics of conversation at Monday's policy committee meeting was regarding tribal consultation and I would like to focus the rest of my response on tribal consultation as an APS employee I had the privilege of attending one of the tribal consultations and there was too much talking by APS and two little listening to the tribes if I am lucky enough to be elected to the board I would help to ensure that we would listen to the leaders of the 23 tribal Nations represented here in New Mexico thank you very much last for question number four Mr Martinez

[00:50:00]
I definitely would rely on my community relationships that I have Community forums are good parent forums are good however I've been to these forums there's very few parents so involved in these forums so we have to find new and different ways of communicating with parents whether that be through social media or sporting events wherever we can find these parents get them involved get them engaged so that we can hear their voices I like the idea of going to them but we need to go to them where they're at and they're not at Community Forum so I'm sorry to say but thank you thank you thank you very much for your responses to question number four Courtney Jackson you will begin our first question you ready yes all right this is for one minute one minute timekeepers how can the school board adapt their

[00:51:00]
Lucas and priorities to the current needs of our community while remaining goal oriented and so I think this is a great question because it really focuses that focuses Us in on the work of the board right now and we have gone out to the community when we set the the goals and the guard rails and spoke to 2000 of people across the community to ask them what they want wanted us to focus on as we move forward with goals and so whether we were in the Northeast Heights or the South Valley no matter where we were in Albuquerque it unanimously came back that does the people that the community to focus on the four goals that we have and that is a very powerful Testament to the work that we are doing because it means that the goals and the work that

[00:52:00]
we're doing is focused on what the community is asking us to focus on so I I just think when we can continue to keep our focus on what is right for students get a community engagement continue to listen to those voices but definitely go out to the community thank you very much Courtney Kristen same question yes how can the school board adapt their focus and priorities to the current needs of our community while remaining goal oriented thank you I think it's important that the boards work is Community Driven and that we have Community Driven Solutions and the Martinez ruling really underscores not only how New Mexico schools have been failing students of color particularly native students and Hispanic students but also students with disabilities students from low income backgrounds

[00:53:00]
and we need to also think about how that means they're being excluded from the planning process the same communities and we do need to have government-to-government Tribal consultations I've been very privileged to represent New Mexico as in one of those as the violence against women act Grant administrator and so we need to be doing that in San Diego Pueblo is part of our district district 7 in the Northeast Heights so we need to make sure we're including those voices and specifically listening to what these groups need and what their Solutions are thank you very much Kristen Mister Florida's and the only way we really

[00:54:00]
focus on this is being within those communities like the rest of us have prefaced and making sure that we're actually doing the work that is important to the students in these families when we look at our Martinez Yazzie students we see that not only have they been let down but they've been let down repeatedly it's important to remember during this process that our students aren't filling us we're failing our students and it's important that we focus on those vulnerable populations within this process thank you very much Isaac Danielle same question yes thank you I think we can adapt to community remaining true to the goals by remembering what the community told us matters most what the community told us matters most is our our students learning are our students able to read are our students able to do math are our students ready for success in life whatever that may bring after post-secondary Readiness and do our after post-secondary and do our skip do our kids have the skills habits and mindset for Life success

[00:55:00]
that is what our community our parents and our students told us what matters and so I think we need to continue the course on those goals and guardrails I think as a board we also need to remember to stay out of the way of the superintendent and the district to enable them to respond directly to the school level to concerns and to other issues and remembering that we also have our guardrails which are focused on safety belonging Equity teacher voice and Equitable allocation of resources and I think the other thing that we can really do would be to Foster Partnerships to make sure that we're working with our local foundations and business communities thank you very much the goals and guard rails represent the vision and the values respectively our community not only are we lucky to have a strategic plan in place with goals and guardrails but goals one and two specifically focus on the needs of the Yazzie Martinez student groups and African-American students which is incredibly

[00:56:00]
Martinez case was against the state of New Mexico not against APS however as the largest school district in New Mexico in the state there is no way that the state is going to improve outcomes without APS with that being said the idea that our goal is to improve performance by only 10% points over a 5-year period is completely unacceptable and if I am elected to the board I will advocate for increasing those goals so we can meet the needs of historically underserved student groups thank you thank you very much Brian Johnson's again it's been said but we need to listen to our communities but we need to understand our communities we need to understand what the needs of

[00:57:00]
of our communities are whether that be specific languages or specific barriers that need to be looked at we need to understand all those things I also believe Partnerships within the community whether it be with the trades whether it be with businesses will there be with foundations any of these to help kind of facilitate this progress in again making sure that all of this is centered around our student outcomes thank you Joshua do you need a repeat so I like the idea of looking at low performing schools and focusing resources on them we know that overall our graduation rate is going up on average but we also know that there are schools and areas that are under

[00:58:00]
I also think it's important to emphasize the guard rails of Staff voice and support and making sure the school provides adequate resources the teachers are on the front line every day and I want to make sure that they can tell us what they think is going well but also that they have time to do work that they have extra clerks and extra teachers aides so they're not buried and paperwork and then being precise about ways to make sure that teachers get the resources they think is adequate for that Community thank you very much candidates that concludes question number five we are moving on to question mark and

[00:59:00]
progress monitoring data apart from their actual skills and knowledge when I think it's important to understand the Neuroscience behind how students learn and how children's brains develop as someone who has worked in trauma for nearly two decades I understand when the prefrontal cortex is shut off because you're in fight or flight you're experiencing stress at home or your scared because our schools feel unsafe you can't learn that's the part of the brain where you process information it's also the part of the brain that regulates your behavior so you can make good decisions and we know that students of color are disproportionately punished for having trauma reactions so when we need to make sure students feel safe we've had a record number of guns found on campus more than twice as many guns have been found in the last

[01:00:00]
4 years before the covid shutdowns more than 60 and APS has been pouring millions of dollars into Band-Aid Solutions thank you very much Christian Mr Flores do you need to repeat Okay one minute so I believe one of the most important factors that is affecting students is what was mentioned previously the very real gun problem that we're seeing in our communities how is a child supposed to be a good test taker or do well in school when for one their parents are scared to send them to school or they're scared to sit in the classroom we have sat alone for far too long and done very little about this very real problem and unless we address these issues and get in front of it we are going to have a tragedy like we've seen in other states we need to be proactive and to get in front of this and make sure that the students feel safe at school because without these students we don't have a future this needs to be

[01:01:00]
I can assure you that this is something that would be at the top of my priority list thank you very much Isaac Danielle thank you so the question what factors influence how or how much students learn and I want to first and foremost say that I think we need to have high expectations for all students and acknowledge that all students can learn and can learn a high levels we do know that school culture and school climate play an important factor and so I think we need to focus on those as well making sure that we're fostering a sense of belonging a sense of inclusivity and making sure that kids feel safe welcome supported and challenged in our classrooms I think we need to Value home language and culture and I think we really need to focus on building Partnerships with our city with the community and partners because some of the challenges that we're facing in this community are not being phased by the schools are alone or because of the schools alone and so I think we need to make sure that we are providing safe passages for our kids making sure that we're

[01:02:00]
after and before school programming making sure that we're providing enrichment opportunities making sure that all of our activities including out of school and summertime are engaging and also challenging and I think we need to be very clear again that we cannot accept poverty as an excuse thank you Daniel Bryan one minute building off of that I very much appreciate what you're very last comment that our community struggles with poverty that is not an issue that APS can solve when its own that is something that we need to partner with in terms of Our Community Partners or Statewide partners because poverty is a challenge for many of our students and our families the reason why this is actually a challenging question to answer is because there are many factors affecting potentially affecting student performance outside of schools but the bottom line is that as a teacher I had my students

[01:03:00]
5 days a week for 57 minutes school was a safe space students were at school for 7 hours a day 5 days a week that is such a large amount of time where as Educators and other adults in the building we can have such an impact during that time and we just need to be very careful about potentially having lower expectations for students because on because of things that are happening outside of school thank you very much Mr Martinez yes so as a parent there's no things that I look for you know in my children's teachers are to be successful what is great appropriate lessons great appropriate you know lessons that are being taught by the teachers also student engagement how am I doing how my my son and my daughter are interacting with in the classroom are they having fun in the classroom do they want to go to school that is very important and that's all done by a great teacher a

[01:04:00]
it was trained who is prepared every day to teach our students and most importantly I think again a teacher in a school in a district who believes in our students so believes that they can achieve anything that they want to do and that they can be anything that they want to be those things I think are crucial to the success of our students thank you very much Joshua where do you get could you read the question one more time yes I can what factors can impact students test scores from their actual skills and knowledge I want to focus on teaching styles student learning styles and outcome measurements as noted we cannot affect the outside environment but we can really affect the environment in the classroom we need to move away from a sage on the stage teaching style where teachers are just talking at the students and do more

[01:05:00]
project-based outdoor education Hands-On learning also different students have different learning styles kinetic some students are visual some listen and teachers should be sensitive that and in terms of outcome measurements I don't like the Relentless focus on standardized testing we need to find other ways to measure students' abilities and move away from this never-ending statistical assessment and I want more than one assessment in terms of figuring out what kids know thank you very much Brittany you have to last response thank you so I believe that students success is more than test scores I do believe that our proficiency proficiency rates are very important they're they're very crucial because they set the tone for our students to be able to move forward but we also have to ensure that every

[01:06:00]
El regardless of their background does have the skills habits mindsets and confidence that they need to thrive academically and personally the way that we can do that is by creating safe and welcoming schools we need to continue an ongoing process of engaging our families we need to build on a strong student and teacher relationship we need to continue our work on attendance we got distracted we have to make sure that we have effective special education supports and that the basic needs of our students are met and we are doing this through our guard rails by ensuring that we continue to have wrap around supports high quality instruction strong leadership and Community engagement thank you very much Courtney and thank you everybody for your responses for question number six just as a reminder to our audience of you can silence your phone thank you very much

[01:07:00]
but at the same time hold on I want to sell it this will be for 1 minute 1 minute timers challenging books that remove that involve diversity or lgbtq plus characters based on their moral or religious beliefs I am a strong believer that representation matters as a member of the lgbtq community myself I understand how important that representation is and it is to school that they see themselves and what is being

[01:08:00]
so it is important that we stand up against this rhetoric that is not rooted in fact but is rather rooted in propaganda and one-sided viewpoints we need to make sure that every student that goes into a classroom knows that they are safe there that they are welcome and that they are part of a community that accepts and Embraces them there is no room for that type of rhetoric within education public schools are there to educate and inform our students not to push any type of bias that some Affiliates may have thank you very much Isaac Danielle thank you I would start by saying first and foremost clinically opposed to any sort of book band or curriculum ban I do think APS has a strong policy already on handling controversial topics or speakers and handling how parents might make challenges to books I think all students stir Reserve access to robust content to multiple and diverse points of view from a variety of different sources I also think that

[01:09:00]
Librarians are experts and they know what they're doing and the folks who are selecting our books are experts and they know what they're doing and I think we all know that the best way to foster a love of reading is to be able to provide choice so providing choice and flexibility so that our students can choose what they want to read with support again from Librarians Educators and parents I think we all need to engage families in the process so that they do understand the content that is in our library that is in our schools and how is it is selected and how important it is for students to be exposed to diverse perspectives thank you Danielle right I am not Banning books period additionally I expose myself to ideas that I don't necessarily agree with all the time I'm an Avid Reader and I read things all the time that make me want to throw the book across the room however I stick with it and I finish the book because I might learn something

[01:10:00]
or I might have a different A New Perspective on a particular topic and as a white male from Delaware I don't just want to read books about white males from Delaware it's also important for any student this idea of Windows and mirrors when it comes to our books we definitely need to make sure that the books represent the diverse student population we have throughout the City of Albuquerque but also exposed people to people and cultures and ideas that might be very different from the environment in which we were raised thank you Brian Johnson

[01:11:00]
again I'm very involved in my child's educational process and I would would say that parents need to be involved in their children's educational journey and what they are doing in and out of the classroom thank you Joshua are you repeat the question one more time on community members and parents challenging books that involve diversity or lgbtq plus characters based on their moral or religious beliefs one minute thank you including taxes in Oklahoma are experienced this right now and if you look at the list of banned books they often want to get rid of not just lgbtq or stories about African-Americans Native Americans they also really

[01:12:00]
get rid of Classics Like To Kill a Mockingbird The Great Gatsby 1984 why don't we want our children to think but also this letting someone who grew up in a small town books were a way to escape to transport myself to another world but having diverse views also is a way of preventing bullying we can use these diverse views to create support for marginalized groups and I think that's an awesome knowledge among people who don't have it thank you so as a parent myself I understand that families want to be deeply involved in their child's education APS has a parent's rights and responsibilities policy that affirms a parent's right to access information and make decisions for their own children that means if a parent

[01:13:00]
concerns about a particular book they have Avenues to request alternatives for their child the boards role is not to decide what is right for each family that responsibility belongs to the parents families know their children best and they should have the ability to choose what works for them whether or not the board or I personally agree the job of the board is to ensure that every option is safe and meets educational standards so that parents can make informed decisions that are best for their children thank you Courtney New Mexico is 50th and education we should not be further limiting access to educational resources and it's important that every child feels safe and included in the classroom and yes that includes lgbtq students but it also goes for students

[01:14:00]
color and students with disabilities they deserve to see themselves in the curriculum and see their families too it was only a couple of years ago we had an APS teacher at off the breed of a Native American student without his consent we need to be expanding what we're exposed to so we can do better we are in a highly politicized environment underscored by the tragic tragedies of today and we have lost the ability as a society to converse with people we disagree with it's important that our kids develop the skill and that will have Ripple effects out into our community all right that concludes question number 7 thank you very much and thank you very much everybody for your attention those people on YouTube as well moving on we want to Rolling Along so thank you very much for tuning in with us so Daniel Gonzalez this question is for you number

[01:15:00]
this is for 1 minute timekeepers and candidates question number 8 how can APS and the board retain qualified special education teachers thank you I think the primary thing that APS could do to retain qualified special education teachers would be to maintain our What's called the set program the special education teacher training program which is a partnership between the district and the union it provides a path to licensure for anyone who has a bachelor's degree to become a licensed special education teacher and it allows them to do that while earning a salary and benefits I think this is a model of a type of residency that we know works from research and so I would say that we all need to increase and expand other residents to support all of our Educators I think an important thing that we can also do to retain and support our special education teachers is to support our general

[01:16:00]
and so I think we really need to focus on tier one instruction and are multiple multiple layers of Student Success I think we need to make sure that we are providing good instruction I think we need to make sure that Educators know how to identify students with disabilities and best serve them thank you very much Danielle Bryant first I would like to personally thank whoever asked this question it is very personal to me as a former special education teacher and board member Gonzalez mentioned the set program I am a proud graduate of the first cohort of the set program and I am very proud of that however after four years I was poached by the district office and I don't regret that however at the same time I am an excellent educator and I often think about what would get me back into the classroom what would have kept me in the classroom and for me personally it was

[01:17:00]
time serving as a special education teacher in this district is two full-time jobs it is being the instructor of record and being a case manager as well I give 100% to everything that I do especially when it comes to my students and like other Educators what that meant was staying late at school and then going home and working for my kitchen table the model has to change in APS thank you Brian Mr Martinez same question yes thank you I think programs like those are definitely things that we need to continue to do and expand on relationship programs things like that are exceptionally important to retain not only special ed teachers but also generally teachers as well I do appreciate the states investment that they give in increasing teachers salaries I think that is definitely a step in the right direction but on a district

[01:18:00]
APS needs to make our district our classrooms a great place to work we need to listen to our teachers we need to make sure that they feel appreciated and heard and do everything we can to ensure that they aren't working after hours on the kitchen table do whatever we can to allow them the opportunity to do the best job they can with the resources that they have thank you thank you very much so from the University of Pennsylvania the number one reason that people leave teaching no matter what the subject are the working conditions we do have a physical plant problem in APS a simple thing we can do is make sure every school has adequate heating and air conditioning it costs money but it makes a Better Learning and teaching environment also teachers of all kinds want respect

[01:19:00]
play want to be treated well by the principal and be treated by like a professional as we've heard there's a heavy workload among APS teachers so we want to make sure that we have adequate staff like student aides like clerks to help with paperwork and also that we reduce duplicate assessments between the state and APS and finally I advocate for more behavioral health counselors in the school to prevent bullying and take some of the emotional workload off the shoulders of teachers thank you very much so I believe that teacher retention starts when we have a district where Educators still supported inspired and part of something meaningful and teachers

[01:20:00]
strong goals and a compelling Vision when were they feel like their work directly impacts student outcomes and that they feel valued in that process I believe that's one reason the district especially over the past year has taken the time to evaluate the special education department and has used both outside and inside assessments to find to determine that what we really need is some more professional development for staff at all levels and we need to have more deliberate and well-documented individual education plans that clearly outlined the support and resources that each of those students need I believe if we can do that that we will ultimately improve our teacher retention but we also need to listen to our Educators and understand why they are leaving in the first place thank you Courtney

[01:21:00]
thank you as a mom of a student who received special education services I have talked with a lot of special education teachers and I want to include the special education service providers like social workers and speech and language pathologist in this as well and thank you for all that you do first when I hear from them they say their case load is so overwhelming and it's actually traumatic because they feel like they can't do a good job they're not able to provide decent services and quality education when they have too many kids in the classroom particularly if they have high needs and then they go into IEP meetings and then there's still not enough services and so many teachers and service providers have told me that they are discouraged from saying the truth and IEP meetings if a student's needs

[01:22:00]
but the case load is too high so we need to prioritize these services in the budget thank you very much Kristen Isaac you are the last person for number 8 so first and foremost our teachers are at the backbone of Education in our communities we need to make sure that they're well compensated and that they're supported and the only way that we really do that is by making sure that they these programs are well-funded for example there is 202 schools in APS and we only have three special education centers so making sure that we're allocating the resources over so that these teachers can actually do their jobs to make sure that they feel supported within the classroom and that they know that they don't stand alone in this and that is a community engagement and overall APS needs to do a better job of this we don't have an education without our teachers and it's super important that we make them a primary focus so that we can keep that retention

[01:23:00]
all right that concludes question number 8 thank you for candidates for your responses thank you too very much for that switch I saw that it's a good job all right move it along to question number nine if you need to take a couple deep breaths please do that as well stretch out so the First Response will go to Brian all right this is question number nine and this will be for 1 minute 1 minute what are you what are you doing what are you doing or plan to do to make our schools safer for students let me repeat that one more time what are you doing or plan to do to make our students safer for students one minute for too long the district has been relying on a system of if you see something say something and I don't need to remind anybody in the room of recent events period

[01:24:00]
in high schools in Muir high schools and thankfully someone did see something and say something the challenge with that approach is it allows the weapons into the building and as an educator I was in the classroom going through Alice drills with my students and having to answer some pretty hard questions Mr Laurent what are we going to do if someone gets into the room so I appreciate that APS is now expanding the conversation to include possibly clear backpacks or metal detectors are other detection devices and it is time to have that conversation we also need to have a broader Community Wide conversation about the root cause of why weapons are ending up in the hands of Youth to begin with thank you Brian I think about every day you know last year there was a good brought to my son's school which is a school

[01:25:00]
so it's clear we have a problem in our community with too many guns being on campus I'm actually been endorsed by Sheriff John Allen and we've had many conversations around this issue as he goes around the country there's lots of resources in technologies that are available for school districts to utilize to prevent guns from being on campus now these are tough decisions that we need to make but we have to do whatever it takes to keep our students safe and I will definitely look into all options if given the opportunity to be elected on for this board one minute so there are no easy answers to this question there are no easy technological fixes I think we should focus on prevention at the front end but I also want to talk

[01:26:00]
talk about some things that may not work that sound great but may not work so I've had a great experience with the academic counselor at my school nonetheless I think that having more behavioral and mental health staff at schools in APS would serve several positive roles including making our schools safer we've had about 20 gun incidents in APS in the past two years now we know that one incident is too much but 20 is a number which allows us to talk to and work with every involved child and find out exactly what happened so that we can create a prevention strategy also we have had great success with veteran and Drug diversion courts and I'd like to see a diversion program for these young people thank you very much thank you and student safety is the number one

[01:27:00]
priority of every single parent within Albuquerque Public Schools and and quite frankly any school and it requires both a strong school-based measures and Community collaboration what I have one thing I have done that we are continuing to do is I've championed championed an initiative that brings together the de APS APD the sheriff the doj and the FBI to continue discussions with our students about violence intervention and they're bringing that directly into the classrooms and I think this helps our students to understand the risk and to also engage in Solutions alongside law enforcement and Community leaders just as an aside and based on the events of today I think we all need to continue conversations with our kids and our community that you cannot resort to violence when you disagree so I well I'll stop there

[01:28:00]
I used to coordinate a human trafficking Coalition where I worked with law enforcement prosecutors and victim service providers all bringing very different perspectives of how they would address this issue and I'm someone who if I disagree with you in 99% of things I will find the one percent we can agree on and that's what the School Board needs to do because our kids need to be safe student safety is an escalating problem six guns have been recovered by APS so far in the first 15 days of school that would put us on track for 70 guns this year last year a third of the gun incidents were in the Northeast Heights this is a Citywide problem we need to improve early intervention in early identification services and training in our schools

[01:29:00]
we need to make sure disciplinary policies are being followed and that administrators are trained on them so teachers and administrators know where they can send students for support thank you Kristen Mr Flores one minute so I understand this issue because not that long ago I saw an APS as that student and have to sit through these drills I think it's important that APS needs to be proactive and make sure that we get ahead of this we need to make sure that we're offering more Mental Health Services we need to make sure that we're looking to see that every school has one point of entry that we look into low profile metal detectors clear backpacks in to make sure that we're investing in early threat detection systems and also we need to make sure that we're working in collaboration with our local legislators to make sure that we're creating and collaborating on policy that will have a long lasting impact not just on APS

[01:30:00]
put on our state and I know this personally how this impacts families because I work in these juvenile detention centers and I teach violence prevention so I understand the very real threat and what it does to our communities thank you Isaac Danielle you have the last response great thank you as a mom I did receive that text last year from my daughter at Valley that are going to have been found and it is terrifying and so this is a critically important issue that I do take and feel very personally about I do think we need a multi-layered approach to this problem which includes both proactive reactive and responsive Solutions and I think that's a balance of both hardware and what I'll call human wear on the hardware side we're going to have as we already have fencing cameras alert badges security vestibules talking about clear backpacks and maybe even metal detectors which I think we have to be open to as a school district on the humanware side we need to make sure that social emotional learning is fully integrated with academics the perform

[01:31:00]
he supports for mental health that we are taking bullying every single instance very seriously and that we are addressing that and supporting our kids when they're having challenges at school and at home all right thank you everybody for your responses that is question number nine you guys doing okay good weather this is a two-part question I'll take my time reading it and if you need a a if you need a for me to respond to it or to ask again let me know all right number 10 early literacy is foundational to long-term academic success what specific actions will you advocate

[01:32:00]
for to ensure all students are reading on grade level by the end of 3rd grade and how will you strengthen the aps strategic plan to make early literacy a measurable well-funded and accountable priority thank you one minute thank you so much well I think what our state is just done recently where early childhood education is free for everyone in the state is a big step in the right direction obviously where the first state in the nation to be able to do this I think that's going to be a game-changer for us and for our students moving forward second part of the question I do agree that with our goals as far as creating more aggressive goals for our students I think also going back to Parenting family

[01:33:00]
call man also partnering with the community partnering with families the schools everyone this partnership it takes all of us to increase the student outcomes but we can do it thank you very much Joshua where are you again same question could you tell me the question again yes I can early literacy is foundational to long-term academic success what specific actions will you advocate for to ensure all students are reading on grade level by the end of 3rd grade and how will you strengthen the aps strategic plan to make early literacy a measurable well-funded and accountable priority well I think this question goes back in many ways to the Yazzie Martinez decision I really am excited about the new Pre-K but Yazzie Martinez also recommends small class sizes and culturally and linguistically

[01:34:00]
relevant education I also think that a lot of reading in the classroom and if we have English language Learners or native students culturally relevant topics books they can relate to even bringing in people from the community who can make them feel safe I also want to say that you know when we have those small class sizes teachers can pay a lot more attention to each individual student and also students can help each other read thank you very much for you okay just so I am where advocate for all students reading on grade level and strengthen the plan to make it a priority is that correct okay okay so I I think that it's hopefully it's very obvious that I advocate for our goals every single time I'm on the dice or I am out and having conversations with our community I think that our goals

[01:35:00]
illegal number one early literacy are very powerful and have set the district on a path towards real Student Success the way that I believe that we can Advocate to strengthen the plan to continue to make it a priority is and we can continue our investments in the letters training the training that our teachers are receiving and continue the district-wide focus on structured literacy because I believe those are making a real difference in our classroom we need to make sure that we are at hearing to guardrail three that has a focus on high quality grade level instruction and that is the best way for us to move forward with Goal one thank you yes I can academic success what specific actions will you advocate for

[01:36:00]
ensure all students are reading on grade level by the end of 3rd grade and how will you strengthen the aps strategic plan to make early literacy a measurable well-funded and accountable priority thank you to look at what the current problem is the achievement Gap is growing at APS for our Yazi Martinez students especially when you compare the current test scores to pre covid test scores if we compare them to the lowest point when kids aren't even in school then I certainly hope after four years we would see a little Improvement and some student population are still headed in the wrong direction for example Asian students scores drop by about 10% and we need to ensure that literacy curriculum and teacher training make students from all backgrounds feel respected and are worth

[01:37:00]
active for different populations because we need to consider the whole child and make sure teachers in classrooms have the resources to support different populations thank you Kristen Isaac I think it's super important what was just pointing out currently we're seeing that part of a Martinez Yazzie population or Native American students are actually doing worse they're not getting better or just like some of our other students it's important that we start to invest in more diverse education models and partnering with our parents and communities and to really focus on that allocated funding model because equity and equality are not the same thing and not all of our students start at the same place so we need to make sure that we're meeting these students where they are so that we can make a real meaningful impact in their education thank you Isaac Danielle thank you so specific strategies that I would advocate for to ensure that all kids are reading at grade level by Third

[01:38:00]
are culturally and linguistically responsive approaches to education maintaining the focus on science of reading making sure that we're providing early interventions and early supports including screenings and partnership with our early learning providers and making sure that we're aligning everything including our budget to the school and that may mean some tough choices but making sure that we're approving high quality instructional materials that were using high-quality professional development the latest research and proven strategies and that we're improving our Partnerships with Institute of higher ed as well to make sure that teachers as they exist their teacher preparation program are prepared to teach students with cultural and linguistically responsive approaches and with the science of reading I think the first two components of the Strategic plan which you mentioned are actually clear expectations and rigorous instruction and so I think we need to maintain that focus in the Strategic plan and make sure that we are providing the superintendent and her team with the supports to be able to

[01:39:00]
you do that and making sure that we're asking for regular data to evaluate thank you Danielle Brian last response to question number two all teachers are reading teachers I was a middle school teacher so I did not personally benefit from letters training however once I moved to the district office I did complete letters for administrators APS needs to continue to invest in the science of reading and making sure that we are expanding professional learning opportunities to all Educators because we know what the achievement gaps look like and they're not limited to elementary school on that note I've already talked about the need to increase the goals and in this case goal one one of the challenges from my perspective is that gold one has been framed as the elementary goal and go to has been framed as the Middle School goal we do not stop teaching reading in third grade and we certainly don't start teaching math in middle school so

[01:40:00]
that the current Board of Education and the current Administration can immediately take steps toward is eliminating that particular distinction and involving Elementary staff members in a math conversation and middle school staff members in the reading conversation thank you very much Brian thank you very much everybody for response that is question number 10 good job you're rolling along all right so we're getting close to time so we're going to try to get through this really quick responses so just try this next question is number 11 for one minute and where are you here it is your turn to go first how should APS balance academic rigor while supporting the whole child 1 minute I think this goes back to the assessment issue I think we need to find different ways

[01:41:00]
to determine what kids actually know so I am uncomfortable with this very surface testing that we do and also we have like a lot of Technology involved with it I want to focus on deeper learning for our kids and I definitely want to make sure that our kids are engaged with techniques like outdoor education Community involved education where we can have parents or community members with expertise leading science reading and math and in terms of the whole child these are making sure that we have that community and parent involved connection will make learning more effective thank you very much Courtney 1 minute can you repeat the question yes I can how should APS balance academic rigor while supporting the whole child

[01:42:00]
so I believe that APS has a responsibility to ensure that every student has access to the resources and support that they need and so one way that we can can do both while balancing rigor and supporting the whole child and is to honor our guard rails the guardrails are there for a reason we need to provide high-quality standards aligned instruction that is also culturally and linguistically relevant that's guardrail 3 we need to ensure that there's Equitable access to wrap around support wrap around services and support systems which is guardrail one and we need to maintain our strong family and Community engagement which is guardrail for I think if we can continue to focus on those specific guard rails while also holding ourselves accountable and monitoring towards our very Resort

[01:43:00]
are goals I think that we can honor the rigor that is expected so that our children actually receive an education while they're here but also making sure that there are supported and taken care of while they're under our Care thank you Courtney Kristen can you repeat the question yes I can how should APS balance academic rigor while supporting the whole child to say on this one as a former teacher I love this question and the kids are the best part of APS and so first I want to say I don't think that those two concepts are at odds with each other the whole child and providing academic rigor kids are more than test scores but we should have high expectations for every child and then I was up to APS to meet that challenge we need to develop mentally appropriate curriculum that incorporates interaction

[01:44:00]
which have been severely impacted during covid in the shutdowns we need to move away from this cookie cutter curriculum that runs on Chromebooks we know how screen time impacts child brain development and this these curricula are placing corporate interests over the needs of our children thank you Kristen Isaac so I'm a strong believer that this cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach we need to focus on individual students and their strengths and make sure that we're fostering success with these students you know children are not numbers on a spreadsheet and the fact that education is taking a corporate approach to how we look after our children and rate them we need to start looking into testing models that are more well-rounded and focused on all students and not just the status quo so that we can give money to people that create these chests

[01:45:00]
thank you Isaac Danielle thank you I think this question around academic rigor versus the whole child is a false construct and I don't think it's fair to our students or our community to imply that we can't do both cuz we can I think our kids deserve both we know how learning happens we know that social emotional development and academic development are fully integrated and so kids need safe and supportive learning environments they also also need social emotional skills and cognitive development that meets them where they're at and brings them to where they need to be so that means we need to continue to enrichment activities like genius hour or Community Schools electives activities art music in all of our elementary schools we need to continue our focus on skills habits and mindsets and relatives and cognitive development and we need to continue to measure with multiple different metrics that includes both measuring academics as well as measuring our school climate and culture and

[01:46:00]
gospel as well as school climate thank you thank you Danielle Brian I am pleased that in the district strategic plan we have a goal devoted to quote and quote the whole child go for where we want our students to leave the district with the skills habits and mindsets necessary to succeed in whatever path that they choose after they leave APS this is the reason why I'm running I've had so many choices and opportunities throughout my life and I attribute them completely to the excellent education I received and every single student deserves the same education the quality of Education that I received in terms of the whole child I would from personal experience I would like to see the districts and the board have a conversation about advisory periods where I felt when I was a classroom teacher I did not receive very much support

[01:47:00]
and we are not going to meet goal for without Educators building those relationships with students and it's best done not just in an academic environment but an advisory as well thank you Brian thank you yes I believe we have to have high expectations for our students we also need to provide the support system for our students to deal with everyday life or the traumas that they're dealing with in their personal lives these can be through APS and in partnership with other community resources that are available believe that our teachers need to have strong relationships with their students they need to know what's going on at their home in their homes and you know how our students are learning how do they learn how do they best learn and also another thing I think is important is promoting the Arts promoting Sports

[01:48:00]
an activities extracurricular activities so that our students have you know something to look forward to some fun activities that they can do other than academics awesome thank you very much everybody for your responses that concludes question number 11 looking at the time we are we going to be mindful of your time the audience is time so we're going to move on to our last question this will be for 45 seconds and then we'll move on to some closing statements by our candidates and they will be for 30 seconds closing statements so just a heads up on the agenda so moving on to the last question and we'll start who left off last time we'll start with Courtney Jackson you'll be the first one for this 45 second question why do you why do you want to be a school board member and what strengths do you bring why do you want to be a

[01:49:00]
board member and what strengths do you bring 45 seconds I want to be a school board member because I have absolutely loved the work that I have been able to do over the past three and a half years when I ran the first time I ran on a platform of Reform of making sure that the school system was working for our students first and I firmly believe that we as a board have been able to do that we have been able to shift the trajectory so that the the focus remains on our students first and it has honestly been the honor of my lifetime to be able to do that the strings that I bring is that I am a rounded member of this community especially the community that I grew up in and I know what our my constituents are looking for

[01:50:00]
you very much Courtney Kristen same question 45 seconds yeah I'm running for school board because every child deserves to have an advocate at APS my leadership style is building consensus not division I've managed millions of dollars to support programs throughout our state and I know where every dollar went and how every dollar was connected to outcomes student safety Community engagement and improving student outcomes they demand more than words they demand action and I have the technical skills and professional experience and the personal experience as a mom who's had to be a Relentless Advocate to take those actions and get results thank you very much Kristen Isaac so the reason why I want to be a school board member is because I have Beast my whole life and my career in public service and helping my community I'm a

[01:51:00]
believer that if you see a problem you don't just sit back and wait for someone else to fix it you charge the issue and you get into the fight yourself and that's what if that's a value that's super important to myself and to the work I do I work in broken systems everyday so I understand the real grit and the leadership that it takes to fix very real problems and I'm running because I know that what I can bring to the board is a perspective we currently don't have thank you very much is Isaac Danielle yes thank you I have dedicated my life to work in education starting as a classroom teacher then working in education policy all with the focus on education Equity I know that there are proven strategies that work and we can bring those strategies to our school district to help our kids I believe that all of our students can learn and I want to bring that to the district that's why I'm running the strength that I have I'm a mom as I mentioned I have got all of my kids in our schools right

[01:52:00]
now so I bring that perspective I have a career in education policy and educational equity and I have already demonstrated that I can bring change reform Improvement and strategy to the school district I want to continue that work so that we can continue to improve student outcomes for all of our district Danielle right I am running to serve on the school board because I'm interested in systems change every single year student many students leave APS prepared for whatever they would like to do once they graduate with their diploma a lot of students do but not all students and that is primarily why I am running I mention in my last response I want every single student to have the same opportunities that I have been blessed to have my strengths I hope it is coming across this evening one of my strings is my communication skills and being able to communicate technical Concepts in a to a broad audience

[01:53:00]
I do think that that is the gap on the board at the moment if elected I will be able to ask the appropriate technical questions to make sure we're meeting the needs of every single student thank you very much Brian Joshua yes thank you I'm ready for the board because education and Community are my two passions and so this is a great opportunity to bring the two together I want to party education not only for my children but for all children across our district some of the strength I am a father so I do bring that perspective of understanding what parents are going through as far as homework testing all the ins and outs of every day of of children in education and also my community involvement I've been very involved in my community I want to serve people and I want to make our district in our city better all right thank you very much Joshua last but not least

[01:54:00]
