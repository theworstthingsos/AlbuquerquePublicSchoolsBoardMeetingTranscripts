[00:09:00]
and matching corporate scholarships this money can be a game-changer and allow kids to be able to afford higher education I wanted to work with you all to ensure that this money gets implemented across APS and students are able to take the PSAT again junior year there are 13 high schools across APS and I need your help reaching out to testing coordinators and the junior classes so they take the test this year how can I work with you to make sure this happens thank you so much for your time and attention thank you Mr Bradford our next speaker is on Zoom Bonnie Kavanaugh hi I am a APS school nurse and proud FedEx for the nurses I really appreciate all of the work that the APS school board has been providing with showing up and and having the decorum that is expected of

[00:10:00]
channels and I appreciate that so very immensely I want to send a shout out to my elected official representative Heather Benavides for always showing up and for always giving us your all for APS I do want to make a comment about Monday's meeting I think it was a fabulous opportunity for APS employees and a great kickoff with wonderful learning opportunities I am concerned though that there were not opportunities for folks like myself that particular day because I'm recovering from surgery having had surgery a week ago and I would have liked to have seen some sort of accommodation option please thank you man or next week is Desiree Stillman

[00:11:00]
does Ray you there yes I am here thank you you have one minute hi my video is not coming on my name is Desiree Spielman and I'm a special education teacher school and I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you I have two issues I would like to speak about the first is our outdated and often dysfunctional HVAC system my school has one unit for two classrooms which means I do not have controls for my swamp cooler in my room and neither do you have the staff another teacher has not had her swamp cooler working all week so she's had to set up her room and conduct meet the teacher in a room with clothes to 100 degrees and in addition the swamp coolers breed mosquitoes and fellow colleagues and I am starting tomorrow our students are being bitten by mosquitoes in our classrooms the second issue is our lack of in-person speech therapists my school is there no in person therapists and we have preschoolers as young as

[00:12:00]
that will only be able to access speech services virtually and while I tell a therapists are great we all know that not all students Thrive during virtual instruction and this being the only option is doing a disservice to our students thank you thank you our next speaker is in the room Greg Mullen you'll have one minute sir my name is Greg Mullen on the president and CEO of Albuquerque computer and electronics recycling company a year and a half ago my company was dual awarded an RFP 24.053 4 technology disposal we were doing awarded in the primary difference between our business and the competitor is that we offered to do a 50/50 profit share with APS whereas the other awardee does just a flat fee for technology computers and iPads and that kind of thing the date in the year

[00:13:00]
we've gotten zero of those items from the school while the other awardee the out-of-state company that was delivered has gotten thousands of those items I believe that APS is leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars if not a million or more dollars on the table by choosing that flat cost out of state provider versus Acer The Local Company here that's doing a profit share model you can take a look at the documentation and I provided additional information thank you thank you sir our next speaker is on zoo

[00:14:00]
mute an empowered Monday was just that yesterday I asked all the union Reps for feedback and although it was clear that we had some glitches they made great suggestions for next year and I just want underscore that they all talked about next year people are already telling me their ideas for new sessions overall the feedback I heard on Monday was reiterated yesterday the day was positive the PD was meaningful useful relevant and the participants loved learning from their peers a shout out to the team from making it happen thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on zoo good evening of APs District

[00:15:00]
positive feedback so I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your work going into a new school year encourage you to keep our kids at the center seek Community input and state transparent and open as we get into the fall I'm sure we'll also see some of what we've seen in the past and I lgbtq plus campaigning in or around our districts and I just want to say early and often that Librarians in our schools and districts are skilled highly trained professionals their job is to ensure families have access to inclusive information we already have a policy and processing case there are issues and libraries do a great job of taking to account age appropriate content guidelines our kids deserve to see themselves in books and in fact it's a lifesaver as a kid grew up homeschooled and had kind of a tough time acclimating to Public Schools books were a Lifeline for me so I want that for all kids I hope we all want that for all kids thank you to our Educators our leaders parents and community and I wish everyone a strong start the school year

[00:16:00]
thank you sir our next speaker is in the room hold on one second one think we're having a technical problem you have one minute and the meeting was a good first step for mending

[00:17:00]
thank you Miss tomato for your heartfelt apology and thank you Miss Dominguez for always reaching out when a parent APS staff member or student expresses frustration I'm concerned though that the board gets equal weight to parties who are not directly involved with APS students teachers staff family members are the voices who should be centered not business interests Charter School lobbying groups and out of state think tanks Byron healthy public schools are vital for our communities at large and these parties are welcome to express their opinion but they should not be the guiding force the profit motive gets in the way of what is best for our students in school communities I also would like to support Mr Watkins lifting the fact that immigrant communities are the policy is not really being followed it needs to be known within our immigrant communities at schools about this policy last spring it was great but it seems like it the know you're right signs are down and

[00:18:00]
hi my name is Carrie Kaiser and I have a kid in APS he's starting fourth grade tomorrow so I I wanted to ask the board to support the work that the policy committee has been doing and I hope that you will approve the recommendations to develop a tribal policy and a capital outlay policy and then also to revise the charter school policy so that those charter schools are also in alignment with APS schools so I would urge you to please vote Yes on item 6.1 6.2 and 6.3 and then since I have 30 seconds I also want to just speak and supportive Librarians and then the good work that's happening in school libraries that wasn't an opportunity I

[00:19:00]
add when I was a kid I didn't have a library that had diverse viewpoints and it was really amazing to experience that when I finally went to a public school as a 10th grader I think that's something our Public Schools do really well is to support all kids reflect all kids so thank you Librarians it's my son's favorite day of the week when he has Library thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Jaclyn Baldwin good evening brother high school I'm here to address the proposed policy revisions regarding charter schools first I want to express our sincere gratitude for APS serving as our authorizer this partnership has been valuable and we appreciate the district's oversight role in ensuring we meet our Charter obligations and serve students effectively our school is thriving we're meeting our academic goals maint

[00:20:00]
getting strong Community engagement and fulfilling the commitments outlined in our Charter agreement the current framework works well for both our school in the district however I have concerns about expanding District policies to govern Charter operations Beyond what's already established in our Charter contract Charter Schools were designed with operational autonomy as a fundamental principle not as a loophole but as an intentional structure that allows for Innovation and responsiveness to our specific School communities we already operate under extensive accountability measures state regulations Federal compliance requirements Financial Audits and the terms of our Charter agreement with APS I will send the rest in email thank you very much thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Jennifer are you there hello can you hear me

[00:21:00]
all righty I felt compelled to call in and say that I was shocked by the text messages that occurred recently between board member Heather Benavides and her I believe her husband using vulgar language to talk about another board member I think it's going to be just needs to be reprimanded at the least and removed from the board our kids at this time our kids need role models and leaders who can be respectful and courteous to others even when there are disagreements not those who stoop to bullying and divisive language and we need authority figures who behave responsibly and realize that their words have power but also have consequences thank you very much thank you all right our next speaker is on Zoom Lisa Davis once you begin can you see me I don't see

[00:22:00]
we can see you see you in here okay good evening thank you for all you do board members I am an APS graduate and a parent my family is deeply concerned about the unprofessional behavior of Mrs Benavides and her husband judge Joshua Sanchez who sent vulgar a messages about Mrs Jackson it seems like a conflict of interest for a judge in a board member to be married they could influence decisions with confidential information they've shown their untrustworthy and unprofessional their actions are very serious questions about their character and suitability for leadership to my knowledge she is not even apologized yet acts like a victim our family request has been evidence resigned and be off the board she has not even taken responsibility for setting this example furthermore I want to address that last year the superintendent's office chose not to appoint Ashley Kyle the most qualified candidate is principal for La Cueva this decision has contributed to decline in morale and many outstanding Educators leading APS it appeared to be driven by professional rather than by personal

[00:23:00]
better than professional judgment damaging long-term success of both the school and Community I strongly encourage careful monitoring of liquid I will send the rest in an email thank you thank you our next speaker is online Gail Gail Stewart yes thanks thanks for the opportunity I am here just to talk a little bit about the dyslexia screener that's required by state law for first grade students I read pretty carefully the early literacy information that's being reported on tonight to the board as well as the questions and answers and it's unclear to me why the first grade in the information the point of the screen to detect dyslexia can recognize the characteristics and should lead to more intensive reading and potentially

[00:24:00]
probation for some of the kids dyslexia is the most common learning disability and specific learning disabilities the most common reason kids receive special education eligibility and the Board needs to connect the dots between what is shown by the first grade dyslexia screener and how those kids are then treated throughout first and second grade thanks a lot thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Jennifer Price Jennifer can you guys see me okay we can we can see in here you'll have one minute awesome good evening with APS goals guard rails and strategic priorities

[00:25:00]
it is absolutely essential for a collective success I do not believe reminding this policy as necessary I'm lucky enough to be the executive director and principal at Gilbert sent a charter high school and we were recently one of only five schools recently rechartered under APS without conditions precisely because our goals already near the districts this retarder is proof that strong alignment can be achieved within the current framework policy changes can consume time and resources and maybe better spent replicating what's already in and be better spent replicating that what's already working APS examples like we're Independence collaboration go hand in hand producing results that advanced district-wide growth and achievement I recommend we leverage these successful models and focus our energy on scaling them through the already working Charter School divisions accountability model thank you so much for your time thank you our next speaker is in persons Sarah crecca

[00:26:00]
okay we're going to move on to our next speaker is a zoom participant and they are joining now Matthew are you there OK Google

[00:27:00]
who is important to you for the success of your students providing those that blanket goals for charter schools that already have contract and I believe we lost Mr Hall so he had 23 seconds left so if he rejoins we will ask him back so our next speaker is Renee Pacheco 1 minute behavioral changes and possibly dependency comparable to that opiate addicts these changes

[00:28:00]
dopamine releases causing a little tolerance and the child is seeking to more extreme content to experience the same level of feeling the study also said found that frequent pornography users experience of decreased heart rate showed anger sadness higher anxiety and depression it also impairs cognitive function like the ability to regulate attention and makeover judgments we already have a problem with children paying attention I'll be looking thank you and I believe we have Mr Paul back Mr Paul you there yes I'm here okay so you still have 23 seconds

[00:29:00]
positively to your goals and I would request that you vote no on item 6.3 and work through the performance framework and your Charter contracts as they come up for Renewal all right thank you sir our next speaker is in the room Aurora Silva you have one minute once you begin to not feel safe on campus continues of ice rates here in a broad across the country of culture of fear and anxiety since you can't attend school or can't focus on their

[00:30:00]
the big ugly bill that was passed in Washington DC over the summer is giving ice substantially more funding we can count on seeing what we have seen in LA to happen here as well I've also seen in her reports that pulling an harassment against students is increased but from other students in school members this is unacceptable and must be cause for media action we owe it to the students and their families and sugar school for me says she have a concern the community will take their concerns seriously and make sure that bullying harassment is stamped out we need to have a sister or next speaker is in the room Mary Herrera thank you good evening Madam president and school board members and superintendent my name is Mary Herrera I'm an EA in special education in a severe needs classroom

[00:31:00]
I'm here to talk about Children's Health and Wellness another study mentioned in the 125 + sexually explicit books in the aps Public School libraries concluded that early exposure leads to early sex unsafe sex sexually transmitted diseases and multiple sexual partners and yet another study stated that viewing would lead to sexual violence these studies are not just based on viewing pornographic material but also reading it in these situations children view each other as objects lowering their self-image in boys it could lead to sexual harassment either being the victim or the these books are available in public elementary school libraries

[00:32:00]
thank you or next speaker is in the room Lauren Mitchell jump 1 minute of the discussion around items 6.1 6.2 and 6.3 on the agenda tonight and I'm glad to see that those are going to be under discussion and I also wanted to talk about supporting our immigrants and really making sure that APS is enforcing the policy jail too and the procedural directive PJ 35 however sitting in the audience I realize that actually I need to speak up about something else and correct the record from everything that I've heard the issue around the unfortunate release of you know the internal communication between member of his and her husband was thrown into the public after

[00:33:00]
having been resolved following your guyses procedures by someone on the board and if I recall correctly you guys actually have a policy around who's allowed to communicate with the media it just seems very perfect to me secondarily it seems like it really violates your guys's goals and guardrails and I think it's unfair to let to misrepresentations about what happened to be circulated around the community and I would really like to lay responsibility for this at the feet of the executive committee and the leadership on the board thank you man you've been you've got over your message thank you our next speaker is on zoo you know you there yes can you hear me can you have one minute once you begin speaking of

[00:34:00]
APS student a comet made by the board president on July 16th that was made during a conversation about students with disabilities had a better monitor their progress the board president expressed that because the board lacks coaches board members aren't capable of asking strategic questions that focus on particular student groups true leadership strengthen us team members not limit you if the board president cannot Inspire or quit this board to support each other in this exercise we have much deeper issues I truly believe that the board members benavidez and tell me the divisiveness and disparaging remarks made by others have become a regular feature of board meeting and are undermining this effort to ask the tough questions in order to help the district find real solutions at those who want a rubber stamp progress monitoring reports to learn from their example as they move forward with action item 616263 this community is expected conversation in regard

[00:35:00]
614 is the legal and moral responsibility to maintain a two-way government-to-government dial with our tribal Nations that Duty should not be offloaded onto the superintendent and ask that you respect that responsibility act accordingly for the sake of our families our students and our values as a district thank you thank you our next speaker is in the room Miss Janet Sayers you have one minute good evening Madam president board members and superintendent of Blakey my first and I advocated for Del Norte High School in that cluster my first suggestion is instead of the timer being this gigantic thing and the person speaking being this little tiny box maybe we could flip it sometimes I frequently I watched from home

[00:36:00]
and so on my home computer the person speaking is like really a little tiny thing so I mean we can all see the timer anyway just nothing perfect okay A&W is mentioned in some news report the other day and I was curious if that's going to have any the decrease in funding of at the national level is going to affect that I did want to acknowledge that President Gonzalez was not by Noah and your award congratulations and lastly just had a wonderful jump start 9th grade at Del Norte today and I know it helped all the 9th graders across the district to to jump start thank you thank you ma'am

[00:37:00]
Megan are you there please speak off the cuff I think we should take the policies that are being recommended tonight period consultation with actual tribal leaders and not finding any other substitute for that voice it's important to me and my children we are part of the Aussie Martinez population and I think that should be about most important right now another thing is really providing the

[00:38:00]
security for immigration our students who are in fear of immigration and the authorities that are who may have access on campus and I also wanted to just have another voice of support for Heather Benavides board member Heather bed and videos and for what she's going through right now based on the actions of another board member and the leadership and thank you that's all thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Francesca Bueller hi thank you for your time and listening to Community Voices tonight my name is Francesca Brewer and I'm a retired APS teacher daughter of and mother to APS graduates and proud Highland Hornet tonight I would like to again voice my concerns about the government

[00:39:00]
post on our school board at the direction of for-profit Corporations who have a robust interest in privatizing public education while narrowly focusing on the outcomes of students APS has been directed to focus on student outcomes as measured by our children's scores in mandated and flawed tests in reading and math focusing on these test scores is incredibly misleading about the beautifully diverse students at attend our schools while being profoundly harmful to our community to get our students with a reading and math standardized test score ignores and races the Brilliance that all our students bring to our schools I urge the board to consider a more Visionary form of governance that focuses on our students stories history and Gifts while supporting our schools and educating them thank you thank you ma'am and our last speaker tonight is Sarah Crockett who ended up joining by Zoo there

[00:40:00]
yes I'm here do you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you and I'm so sorry I intended to appear in person because I think this is an important issue I'm here as an attorney and advocate for a number of children in foster care who are also a PS students I am really concerned about member benavidez comments with being disclosed and whether there is any type of policy as a board if not I encourage you to revisit your bylaws and hold each member including member benavidez at a minimum to the board designed anti-bullying and cyberbullying policy that all students and members of the school Community including employees are held to I actually reviewed the policy and it does not list for numbers because I think it is probably goes without saying that we assume all board members would at a minimum be held to the standard that our students employees parents and

[00:41:00]
any other participants in the school experience for children are held to whether or not it was intended to be disclosed the target of the bullying is a code board member I really call on this board to take this seriously thank you thank you and board members that concludes public forum thank you and thank you to our public forum guests the next item on our agenda is to consider acceptance of our progress monitoring reports for interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 related to early literacy our presenters for this agenda item are Dr Gabriella do it on Blakey the superintendent drunko Gonzalez the deputy superintendent and Sherry academic officer so we will allow them to come forward at this time board president I also want to introduce our new Deputy superintendent Dr Miller Wayne

[00:42:00]
he's joining us as of Monday so he's working side-by-side with Dr Gonzalez during this transition so it's his first monitoring report experience that he's being mentored here and we also have Miss Anna Chavez with us and she is our lead assistant superintendent for elementary school who is leading this work for gold one moving forward great well welcome Dr Mayer wine and Miss Travis to the day is for this conversation looking forward to it so as we said we're monitoring goals 1.1 and 1.2 but before we begin we do need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I've met with the board with the administration and believe it all criteria for an effective report have been met but I'll open the floor to anyone who thinks we may be missing any one of the elements does anyone have evidence that suggests from missing any of the elements of an effective monitoring report

[00:43:00]
all right seeing that we will proceed since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and their answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public to see each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us collectively understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails those questions must be smart meaning that they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results-driven and time bound so let's get started we'll go ahead and why don't we go ahead and start with our virtual participants so member Astoria do you want to kick us out off

[00:44:00]
yes I can pull up my questions right now okay thank you team on my questions are on interim goal 1.1 under next steps you specify that there is a next step to intensify supports for English language Learners and students with disabilities and first grade classrooms and I have three questions but my first one is how will you ensure that ESL students are consistently receiving high-quality linguistically responsive instruction throughout the entire school year now remember we heard your question and we are preparing to answer

[00:45:00]
good evening for president Gonzalez members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey it's always our honor and privilege to have this dialogue with you around the work we do in our schools and thank you board member a store go for the question and now that we've had Mike difficulties I have maybe lost track of the questions so whenever you could repeat it what strategies are you using to ensure that English Learners get culturally and linguistically responsive instruction every day thank you for that I appreciate it so I think there are several strategies that are listed and you know as we've been working this summer and thinking through how we've worked through our structures they know we've mentioned at some points to the board that we are really working very

[00:46:00]
go sleep with our assistant superintendents you directly supervised our principles on many of the issues that we know directly relate to particular yachty Martinez and African-American students what we want to eliminate is any Gap that keeps our very best practices and professional learning from cascading into the classroom and getting to the students where it's needed most to do that and we're really working closely and I'm happy to welcome Miss Travis too the table tonight to help his answer these questions working really closely with our assistant superintendents as well as our departments and really being very intentional about putting them together so that we can identify what those intentional strategies are and make sure that they are showing up in the work that we do when we're coaching specifically our principals because we know ones are principles are getting better at identifying those strategies and coaching their teachers then they will be able to have more of an impact in the classroom I would say

[00:47:00]
just to summarize maybe there's been too big of a gap between our district experts and the student and the attempt is to close back out thank you member store did you have a follow-up or another question yes I guess that is more of my question is what are we doing to close that Gap and make sure that throughout the year those gaps are being closed not just when assessment time is happening president that works around offering professional development not only for principals but our teachers and there's a couple of professional development opportunities for our teachers specifically

[00:48:00]
I'm not a worth mentioning and one is the Glad training that is offered throughout the year multiple opportunities we've taken as you know a different approach in regards to our channel 3 funds and we've Consolidated those funds as to allow a bigger economy of scale to offer more professional development in this area specifically for our teachers in the area of our eldest student population so I'm happy to share that our LCD department is now facilitating these opportunities for our teachers system wide whether or not they are a school that is a dual language or traditional school so that's something that I think is worth mentioning I also think that there's a lot of opportunity for Best Practices to be leveraged from are by language schools in relationship to best practices pointing to the work that was done on Monday

[00:49:00]
teachers learning from teachers and there's a lot to celebrate and every fall just to mention our district is visited by an International Conference La Casita around this very topic so a lot to celebrate in that regard in regards to ELD instruction for our students support to teachers and on the development of the coaching I of our principles great thank you were there any follow-ups to that or do you need more information I have two more questions should I wait let's wait and go to other board members and we'll come back around if they're not asked by others so we'll move to member top your Romero thank you good afternoon everybody so I have

[00:50:00]
so my question is like how specifically will the district rapidly intervene if a monitoring system to text that opportunity gaps are reopening near the end of the year what does that looking like for us thank you for that question because I think it's pushing me a little bit at the beginning of the school year to think about that system we are committed particularly through our teaching and learning coaches to data literacy in our classrooms and one thing we know about working in early literacy is that the assessment is critical not in the test itself but in the information that it gives us and

[00:51:00]
we've really been talking a lot about not only how we use the interim which we use to monitor progress monitor or interim goals but particularly how do we use common formative assessment and what does that look like across first grade second grade in particular so as we are working with the students we know what the skill is they're missing and how we can immediately address that I think to your question the challenge for us will be to keep the momentum of that work and not let our foot off the gas pedal if you will you know when we hit Spring Break and that is sort of setting in like how do we continue to use our common formative in the information we get to directly address the immediate academic needs of the students and board member Top Gear Romero I think one of the things that I have noticed

[00:52:00]
this year is that we are trying to make sure that we're aligning our system structures and support to the schools to be able to accomplish these goals and one of the areas that we saw was a misalignment was in our 90 Day plans are schools have so all schools have 90 Day plans with goals that were not necessarily connected to the work that they're being asked to do with these goals and so we've moved that work under the assistant superintendents who are the closest proximity to the school principal to create the systems and structures to be able to align those 90 Day plans and the work of the 90-day plan 14 who regularly reviews the data at the school to really make it so that they don't feel like they're monitoring too many different things but the systems are more aligned Madden president

[00:53:00]
example of how we've already taken that into consideration for the coming year in terms of finishing the year strong with our technology collection protocols this year we collect we began to collect technology early on May which left several weeks of instruction with a critical component or tool technology outside of the classroom and many instances so we know that we cannot finish until we're finished so really thinking about adult behavior and how we build systems to ensure that instruction and the tools to facilitate strong instruction are in place for the very beginning of the school year to the end of the school year and infantry and other collection protocols as difficult and time-consuming as they are are on us as the adults within the organization to figure out how to make that happen in a responsible way 8 thank you

[00:54:00]
1.1 on Page 6 about the summer reading program what intentional strategies are we implementing to ensure that children with disability English language Learners and Native American students seem meaningful value and benefit from the summer reading program particularly when these groups have historically been underserved or under presented in participation and outcomes design and then also in relation to our immigrants students with the fear of coming to some of these programs Madam president

[00:55:00]
very strong way to personally invite the students farthest away from opportunity to participate in this reading program the individual invitations who are Yazi Martinez African-American students at our priority and emerging School specifically to really have an invitation to really help our parents know you have several options I believe there was upward of 70 on the number upward of 70 Summer Reading Program locations in the greater Albuquerque Area Public Schools I think we have 14 or 15 of them community centers public libraries so we were working with these families the families your referencing specifically to be invited to come to participate because we've talked a lot about high dosage tutoring in our work before you as a board there is not a better example of individual instructions individual

[00:56:00]
this summer so that's one part of the answer that we're really proud of is the individual approach to support the students that took place the other thing that I would say is the partnership with the city and this is something new that we have not done in the past in regards to Summer programming is we know that the PED on summer reading program was partnered with APS but also the City of Albuquerque to run this program so we partnered with our on the City of Albuquerque to offer the program not just in our APS centers our APS sites but also in the community centers so that there's access to literacy high quality programming and also on the opportunity to attract the very students that were working to monitor in this giving goal so a lot was learned this summer a big step

[00:57:00]
forward in regards to are Yazi Martinez and African-American students in summer programs and I think you had another part to your question that escaped me it was about the Immigrant children and those being fearful and those not wanting to leave their home how did those programs also benefit them so we've done a lot of conversation a lot of a lot of communication to our school principals leading into the school year are Equity department has been very close almost

[00:58:00]
throughout the summer we had minimal concern come our way in terms of direct instances happening within summer programs or leading up to the school year but that did not deter us from having a strong training for our principals I believe it was last week were they received very concrete guidance in terms of interphase and how to in the instance of a agency visiting us be released for the summer program should be available in the coming weeks it will be getting into our department for analysis and for them to do their thing and then hopefully we will get it to the board thank you thank you remember benavidez

[00:59:00]
1.1 that we are on track but there is a very troubling statistic that I wanted to address on page I believe five of the root cause or of the presentation under root causes as of the 120th reporting date 31.4 percent of our first grade students were chronically absent if our students aren't in school they can't learn and our first graders don't have any control over this what strategies does APS have in place or are thinking about implementing to address this and how can we work with our families to support them board member benefits presidential what we are reviewing with our principals as far as assistant super

[01:00:00]
Attendance Center coaching pieces is what are our systems to address absenteeism not only to acknowledge who is able and has consistent attendance but also what are our systems to address how to catch students up or how to pull students to make sure that they have a review process or opportunity to that instruction that they missed as of right now in elementary that might be a little bit more difficult than in our secondary schools however we are equipped with Student Success teams that will also include health and wellness teams and attendance teams to create plans and then also create systems if the student has been absent that they visit maybe a certain staff member to be able to check in not only with social emotional pieces but also to work with our teachers to see what instruction was giving during that time and see how we can follow up either with

[01:01:00]
interventions or making sure that the teacher has availability with that student one-on-one during times when other students are possibly in small group settings or in other pull-out programs thank you I just can't help myself cuz I really need to access systems is really dear to my heart so thank you guys we are our New Mexico attendance Grant actually expanding the work we do with students access systems and to our elementary schools we currently have five fingers so when I talk about a feeder I'm talking about the K through 12 pattern that is student might go through Elementary Middle High School to really own that system so that we can remove the barriers because I agree when it's an elementary student and it's you know they can either get a ride to school or they can't and so what do we need to do through our

[01:02:00]
Community School impact coordinators for Student Success systems to remove those barriers thank you great thank you remember Dominguez so thank you so far I mean it's it's important that the public here all the work that goes behind producing this report right and I want to recognize that certainly because we were in a position that we have the hard questions to deal with what you're saying so I want to start with a thank you for all the hard work but I am going to ask a technical question I don't expect an answer but I'm curious about this is on the heels of board member this is question mark I'm just curious

[01:03:00]
how the crossroads program might fit into a strategy for chronic absenteeism and I don't expect an answer right now but just throwing that out there and I'll try to remember to put it in as an RFI but the board member Dominguez we can send that to you and his team have put together a pretty robust summary of what crossroads will be doing we can send that to you and how it fits into okay great thank you so my question has to do with I'm going to go back to students with disabilities while I recognize that the answer to the question regarding the disaggregated

[01:04:00]
and I'm looking at figure 4 in in that disaggregated information first for clarity what is what does actual mean on these graph lines is the the what the actual I'm not use the word to describe what the word is actually is what the final percentage was in so that's the data that you see the target is what we have as our Target for the year and then the goal is the final goal at the end of that series but what group are we measuring with actual is that like the general population no actual is the subgroups that were measured the Martinez and the aggregate is that all together okay okay thank you

[01:05:00]
so while I appreciate the answer to one of my questions around the kids with students with disabilities and the question was the same disaggregated graph shows children with disabilities had an increase in 2024 at mid-year but then dropped what is the district's thoughts on these and you all the answers mentioned well this is a temporary dip and you know the overall trend is positive yes however there is also a gap developing and in so for example in 2021 and 2022 that Gap

[01:06:00]
8.7 and then in 2020 to 23 it became 9.1 and 2324 it became 13.4 and 2425 it came down a little bit to 1 2. 1 6 9

[01:07:00]
and they're usually children with disabilities ale and Native Americans and all three of them I believe have developed a gap so what are the plans to address that thank you for the question I agree that when we look at the populations you mentioned we are always concerned if we're seeing those gaps growing as we're concerned with any different in our achievement data to that end with going to be really important in our 2526 school year is how we use that assessment data what we know about what skills the students are missing and how we use them are instructional practices to address that

[01:08:00]
so and I agreed like that's a very general statement and I want to recognize that but I I feel very strongly that when we use that data to identify a very specific skill our teachers know what to do then and our special ed teachers are experts and pulling on strategies that work best with students whatever their disability may be because there isn't just one strategy for all students with disabilities that is kind of the beauty of the IEP if you will the same with our eldest student like we have teachers who have a specific credential to teach English as a second language and so really leaning on the expertise but we're going to have to get narrow about what it is the student needs to learn in that moment and then I believe the student will learn it and the student will be able to move forward successfully thinking about Edition there are two things that

[01:09:00]
come to mind that I think we have to really work on to address that one is just knowing that the Gap is certainly of a priority for us and when I see him I get really worried and upset it's also a very large segment of the population so when we look at it like that number of students that are in these Target populations is a really large number but I think it's important to know that we have this intersectionality of our goals and in Gulfport particularly and in looking at how we see particularly looking at a sense of belonging in our students we see that a lot of our students in this particular subgroup are really struggling with that sense of belonging so it might be sometimes it is addressing a strategy in the classroom like a reading strategy for students sometimes it's like this core part of if we see these students particularly really

[01:10:00]
struggling in a sense of belonging then the strategy might not be a reading strategy it's more of a culture building strategy in the school in the classroom and so I'm really like interested to see when the when the team looks at these goals that they actually are connected more than they're not connected and there's a lot of levers we can pull in that the second barrier that we as Administration really need to help our teachers with is on collaboration time and planning time because what's happening is we know that teachers need to have the time to look at these data to adjust their lessons we talked a lot about the power of having small group instruction Ms Travis just talked about like pulling groups very strategically or individual students who have been absent but the teachers need time to develop that like Daily Times I have to do this and they're not getting that time to be strategic

[01:11:00]
about their planning and so you see as the year goes on they get less and less of that time and so they're less than planning isn't as strategic because they don't have the time to do it so we have to really figure out these schedules on how we can give teachers what I would say is like strategy time to be able to plan their lessons for the next day to make them very specific for each student because they all know you know that yes they have a different group of students coming tomorrow morning in their class and they had last year the standards are the same so the they have to have the time to be able to do the first teach with their kids but be able to adjust along the way they need time to really dig into what's happening through the year with different students and Dr Blakey thank you for bringing up a collaboration and planning

[01:12:00]
that is something that our assistant superintendents are also focusing on with coaching with principles so being able to ensure that our teachers understand student accommodations making sure that principles have created Pathways and eliminated barriers to having access to those accommodations and they may be technical tools text to speech type of things those are all those are all functions that help us understand what students understand so they may not be able to show what they know in a standardized way perhaps in a multiple choice or even a written form but if we can utilize some of our other tools with accommodations we will get a better understanding of student understanding and then we can figure out how to fill the gaps from there I have a final follow up so I'm glad that teach your time is on the radar for sure

[01:13:00]
and in line with my I have this logo on my email and it's climbing a mountain and you're giving a hand up right to get to the summit so I'm concerned about principal time also so how what is the mechanism for giving and I say this because I know there are some great things happening I mean I was at a school today that was just phenomenal but I know you don't they need time so how does that fit into the strategy board I am very proud of our assistant superintendent team we have developed some new systems to ensure that principals will be in classrooms with a goal of 80% of their time 20% on admin

[01:14:00]
need of time and tasks with the 80% of time will look like is a principles are walking through in non-evaluative observations offering timely feedback to the strategies and also some of the critical actions within 90 Day plans that have been outlined to address any of our goals that are in the classroom specifically with Elementary early literacy strategies we have also secured professional development from our departments that has been organized in a year scope and sequence that is about to be finalized and presented to principles so that they can plan out their year as well and be able to work with their assistance superintendent on their professional development plans to build those skills that are necessary in order to provide effective feedback and also make sure that their operation systems and their budgets are fully functional to be able to clear pathways

[01:15:00]
thank you great thank you remember Jackson thank you so much my question is in relation to 1.1 on the bottom of page 9 where it talks about support of high quality instruction through the end of the school year and this question has primarily been answered but there's a second part to it it's timely because my daughter was just asking me if we could shorten the school year and since we don't do anything the last couple of weeks anyway so my question in relationship to 1.1 is the original question was what specific motivational strategies or instructional adaptations are in place for students and teachers showing signs of fatigue and disengagement I think that you have answered the instructional adaptations throughout the course of this questioning with the

[01:16:00]
change of how the 90-day plans are coming about how the lesson planning and collaboration but what are the motivational strategies that you all are going to use as we get to those last final weeks of school to maintain my quality instruction to maintain a focus on learning and yet balancing it with the fact that yeah it's the end of the year there's a lot of parties in a lot of fun that's happening so it's a tough task but are you going to do it I'll start thank you board member Jackson I think the answer is again is sitting here in August I'm like oh yeah that's going to happen so I appreciate the challenge of how will we maintain that system as we do work through I think a lot of it is instructional and I know we've already talked a lot about instruction but that's sort of what

[01:17:00]
talk a lot about but it is in creating those really engaging opportunities school can still be a good time and academic in nature and particularly we understand the fatigue sets in how do we help our teachers build really exciting lessons that not only the students are excited about but the teacher is excited about you and how do we make sure they know they have that strategy time to do that and they have the permission and I would even dare say the incentive to do that in order to maintain student engagement we I mean we recognize that towards the end of the year there are certainly a lot of things to celebrate I would say the other thing we do is we get used to celebrating on a more regular basis is a part of our 90 Day plans as a part of our student achievement so it isn't just an end of the year thing that's what we do at the end of the year

[01:18:00]
that's what we do all along I think the other thing is that the the teachers and the district works really hard on these units of study and establishing scope and sequence and so I think by planning for the end like now is really important so actually one of the breakout sessions on Monday was a teacher showing how they did their backwards planning and I think that that is really important so if we want to see like how do you teach till the end you start planning for the end first and so the more that we have the work on lesson planning with teaching with the end in mine and then working backwards which is backwards planning literally I think that that helps with okay so it's April and then as a teacher you get to the point of oh my gosh how am I going to finish all of this by the end of May

[01:19:00]
there's no way I'm going to finish this and that typically is when you've done like the backwards planning that you realize there's not enough time in the air now there is like the human element of kids getting tired and after the state test there is this which the team talked about a little bit and the report there is a sense of like just burn out like well we already took the test right so it's like the fourth grader version of senioritis like I already got into college why do I have to keep going to school so fourth graders like already took the test you've been talking to me about all year so how do we make it more that learning is for Learning and the test is just like one part but we still have more work to do until the end of May so I think that backwards planning is something that we have to really work on and just to clarify so that is a strategy this backwards planning is a strategy that is being used District wide or is it

[01:20:00]
no it's a strategy that is in like the teachers planning we don't have a system of did you or did you not backwards plan but I mean I would say 99.9% of our teachers know about backwards planning now sticking with like let's like really have the time that kind of goes back to that time element to like how right now let's plan for the end as we approach the first day of school thank you thank you very much so I want to start by commending you in the district for this work so it's really exciting to see that we are indeed on track in reading an early literacy so something to celebrate my question is essentially related to the strategies and planned actions that show up around page six on both reports so there's a lot of different strategies here and

[01:21:00]
are a lot of different implications for the Departments involved so just reading through I know assessment technology curriculum and instruction Extended Learning team special education department family education department I'm sorry family engagement and language culture and Equity so there's a lot of different pieces in players and so my question is what strategies are you using to ensure not just collaboration across departments but real coherence in particular to make sure that we are serving the Martinez and African-American students of the board doctor's office over the last year about how we in the district use our time and how we meet and making sure

[01:22:00]
we're not meeting for the sake of meeting but really being intentional with when we meet the Cadence of meetings the accountability to the collective work and I want to cite a specific space in the academic cabinet meeting that Chief academic officer Sherry jet leads and that meeting has all of the assistance to pretends but it also has decided Departments of those departments in it and the Cadence is meeting every other Monday or good three hours for alignment in regards to the strategy to the work of the interim goal in relationship to the goal and that work is really growing and its justification and a lot of what you see here is a manifestation of that work in that space so I just offered that because I think it is a an example of how we have evolved over the last year and quite frankly I'm really excited

[01:23:00]
about how this space is going to continue to achieve what you can play in the question I don't know if Chief academic officer that has more to add to that no thank you thank you we will go back around to remember Astoria you indicated you had some additional questions yes thank you one of my questions was answers so thank you for that my other question is on the line graphs by student groups for 1.1 and I'm looking at the segregated data and it shows here that English language Learners have went up for since middle of the year to end of year and so have a black African-American students have went up from middle of the year to end of year but I'm looking at is our Native American students and how they went down from middle of year to end of year so my question is around

[01:24:00]
how students experience assessments and wondering if all students are receiving culturally and developmentally appropriate support throughout their time during the assessment period And if that looks different from each student group thank you board members of the question we have identified looking at our assessment strategies and protocols as a way to ensure I think as Miss Travis said that our students can truly demonstrate what they can do and also we can clearly understand what they cannot do and address that and to that end the schools will work on what that looks like for their student population of I appreciate having the idea that it also needs to be culturally relevant

[01:25:00]
Express because I'm not sure that's something we've emphasized enough and so how do we among the adults in the school truly provide that space and support for our students that is going to help particularly a first grader know I'm safe here I belong it's okay to show what I know it's okay to show what I don't know those are very specific strategies that are definitely related to go for but we have to do a better job of calling that Out Among the adults and identifying the adults who can be that person in the room for a child who quite frankly is experiencing something like assessment or probably you know the first few times that that's kind of a strange thing to do when you're sick even though we're all used to it we also have it's a great question and something I think we have to pay more attention to

[01:26:00]
we have a very fine what I would consider a high number of students who say that they cannot identify an adult on campus that they feel connected to and that was very concerning data for us and Dr Salazar and his team have been really working on how can we put in the structures to make sure that that is 100 percent that being said at the end of last year I was at a school that were just talking about in their staff meeting they were just like brainstorming you know and what they could do to help kids in the test and they had talked about actually having kids assigned their test by which teacher they choose to test with instead of who their classroom teacher is and I just thought I don't know if they ever did it or not they were just kind of talking about it at the time so it's not something that we've we've looked at but it is ideas like that that come from the school as far as once they find

[01:27:00]
what would happen if students say I'm choosing to be in Miss jett's class and she might have you know 50 students signing up and I could have two that come to my class that shows me to test with at what would happen if we have kids test with the adult that they feel the most connected with I think that kind of gets to what you're asking in a way of how can we be more intentional about it and personalize it more and I don't think as a district we have developed those strategies I think the schools are just starting to kind of talk about that thank you member story I just wanted to say thank you because you know first grade their little kids and we see going into our high school students that the biggest correlation between testing is mental health right and how they don't feel prepared mentally or emotionally

[01:28:00]
restarting young and being able to find that person that you trust or develop a space inside of the school or that where they feel okay I can take this test and not have a fear of failing or a fear of asking questions is very important so thank you both for for those strategies thank you so remember I told you I had indicated that she had additional questions so if others have additional questions actually I'm so sorry top your Romero go to you because you're a remote did you have additional questions no I don't thank you thank you so I'll go ahead and open up the floor to others are there other additional questions this is off the accommodations and the goal oriented piece I do have some concerns with the amount of time kids are on the computer especially kids with disabilities so I just want to know how about the time how

[01:29:00]
give me a mountain type of computer time provided to children with disabilities aligned with their literacy Focus accommodations and individualized goals and to what extent does this alignment support their reading and writing development and furthermore are accommodations implemented based on a generalized checklist or are they tailored to the specific nature and need of the children the students disability and then I'm going to ask for I think probably miss Travis and Dr Gonzales to jump in I do want to let you know that we are also we share the concern about screen time and we know from a lot of research and pediatric studies that we should limit screen time among children

[01:30:00]
and that does include you know like we'd all begins to add up when we're doing academic screen time to that and are Executive Director of Education resources has begun to draft and research on what would be best practices and guidelines in our classrooms for all students around the use of screens that's in development we want to make sure we're sticking very closely to the literature on that but as we think about I think there may be an issues of equity here there may be we want to make sure we're using our digital tools responsibly and to the best of our abilities particularly for our younger students so that is forthcoming and something that we share a concern about but I'm president of the board doctor Blakey what I would add to that in regards to accommodation

[01:31:00]
it's a call to action if you will in terms of the continued training and professional development of the IEP team what does a head teacher do on a compass what is their role how do we support not taking away the autonomy of the IEP team or the individual nature of what each team is called to do but how do we have our head teachers and our sponsor teachers to be able to go the latest support in regards to the research in regards to screen time in regards to the supports that are educational resources and teaching and learning Department have so that the dogs are connected because that will ensure that we are able to equip them with the power of information so that the best accommodation is put in place for the students based on the individualistic nature of

[01:32:00]
are teaching and learning Department are focused on with their grade level resource teachers and their ability to work directly with schools and provide different strategies that can offer a wide range of opportunity for students to show with they know we also recognized that digital instruction is just one piece one way where we can have students apply what they know but we also are looking and leaning into Panasonic experiences real-world experience is opportunities through our genius hours those are all additional moments in time where the standards understanding or comprehension can be

[01:33:00]
and applied as well as demonstrated so I really want to make sure that we all have that understanding and Remembrance that we have a team of grade level experts who are working directly with teachers and helping facilitate some of those lesson planning strategies to ensure that there is a balance thank you remember how much is there any problem I was just going to say there's no checklist thank you are there any additional questions I have additional questions as well to to one of the Strategic questions that I submitted but didn't get answered so period assessment

[01:34:00]
it also supporting students for better outcomes especially and I'm focused on on the three groups that show this increasing Gap and they are again students with disabilities English language Learners and Native Americans and I also need to point out that we hit it you all hit it out of the ballpark with African

[01:35:00]
question because I think as the team comes together everyone has kind of red or researched difference elements of utilizing data or what works in subgroups in various it's one of the reasons that I really wanted to put together a diverse team of thinkers in the leadership level because not everybody went through the same Administration program not everybody read the exact same books not everybody is studying the same thing everybody comes together with these different types of knowledge that I think pushes on each other in different ways and so I think that that's a it's an interesting question but like as a district we haven't said like everybody's reading this book as this research but you'll see kind of in the report will say we will reference different types of

[01:36:00]
sure that we have used in you know developing the answer or something that the group came together to look at as a white paper perhaps or a book that everybody says oh I read that to I remember that but as a whole it's not committed to one specific book or researcher that we're using okay so I understand that but there are key researchers and Keith thinkers particularly around that impact for example Native Americans and I'm I'm hoping to get the name of the book from the executive director of Indian education likewise I think there are

[01:37:00]
El right and I guess I'm looking for a sense of 100% like if I were to if somebody were to ask me like where I came from to say that this is what's going to work with you all students I may say well Dr crash in has done a lot of research that has guided me what I think we should do to work best but somebody else could say well I just read this book by somebody else who's so I that's why it's an end it never ends right we have to continuously learn to do better to do different so I can't say well I stopped reading and 2012 cuz there might be a book on her show I might have a book right now that I'm reading about different strategies of how to address something I see that it's important and miss you might be reading a different book so it's just that we're not

[01:38:00]
learning and continue trying to continue reading as a leadership team there's not one specific like book that we're using at the same time no correct I get it I mean it's research and so you're going to have a bibliography of of thinkers that guide you but I'm hoping I'm not going to hear BF Skinner because I just doesn't work with our kids who need relational curriculum or pedagogy and I'm sorry but I am a teacher and so that I guess but I'm going to share it with you the name of the book The American Indian mind in the linear world and that's Donald fix the call you know when when I hear

[01:39:00]
a language teacher who is Native American direct me toward a book I'm going to pay attention so again just curious but I'm going to move on to another question and you provided great details in the answer regarding the strategies and planned action regarding the summer reading program so I I appreciate you reiterating them in public but I'm curious about the answer to this question and the question was how are the three lowest performing groups children with disabilities English language Learners and Native American students specifically targeted and monitored during the summer program

[01:40:00]
and then the answer you mentioned the greatest to identify students demonstrating the greatest literacy needs an analysis of K-5 academic performance transfer from i-Ready and iStation with language learners but you also brought in Panorama to inform literacy assessment could you speak to that a little bit more please invite the students to participate in the summer league the summer reading program it was basically what you're reading here in terms of who are the students that really we need to encourage

[01:41:00]
participate in our reading program Open obviously to all of our students and there was opportunity for students to see why but what was the intentional approach that was used to ensure that an individual touch if you will was made to support on students and parents in being made aware of the summer program so these measures were used in terms of which of our priority and emerging schools I mean really focusing on those looking at the iStation data in regards to which students could really which students could benefit from the perseverance characteristics of sense of belonging and these different pieces so there was multiple measures that were used to give us a better picture of we should really Target and support because we know

[01:42:00]
who was a really unique opportunity funded to the public education department to offer on high dosage tutoring in literacy to our students and we wanted to make sure that the students that we are collectively working to support in the school were really encouraged to participate in the book okay so it's not like Panorama is producing something for you to use aside from the data know okay and I think we have covered all my questions thank you thank you remember Dominguez are there any other questions from the board all right thank you board members for this productive conversation now we must vote on whether or not

[01:43:00]
will accept the monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we have had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and her team and that we have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students is lined up with our communities vision for them in order to accept the report we must be able to we must be able to answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision for the goal is their growth towards that vision is there a strategy in plans sufficient to cause growth toward that Vision the answer to all three is yes then the board can accept the monitoring report confident that is accurate and the superintendent is performing is the does anyone have evidence that those questions should be no versus a yes at this point then we're ready to entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report

[01:44:00]
I move we accept the progress monitoring reports for interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 early literacy this is member Jackson thank you do we have a second a second this is member Benavides thank you we have a motion and a second please thank you and thank you to the team our next item is to consider recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy for this agenda item are presenter is Josefina Dominguez or policy chair thank you Lord president Gonzalez

[01:45:00]
does policy chair I'm proposing to the full board that the aps board approved the policy committee develop a board governance policy on tribal consultation the purpose of the policy would be to formally established a board-level governance policy on tribal consultation that honors tribal sovereignty complies with federal law and aligns with the aps boards commitment to equity inclusion and

[01:46:00]
particularly for Native American students and their families the reason that matters New Mexico is home to 23 Sovereign tribal Nations the Navajo Nation 19 Sovereign Pueblos Mexican little Apache Nations and the Fort Sill Apache tribe APS serves a significant population of Native American students including many with disabilities the Martinez Yazzie Court decision and our board goals prioritize historically underserved students requiring more than just a symbolic support a government policy distinguishes strategic leadership from administrative actions and ensures that consultation is not merely performative

[01:47:00]
but instead meaningful timely and effective there are legal and ethical obligations the every Student Success act section 8538 requires local education agencies or Alias and boards are School boards are specifically cited as least to engage informal consultation with tribes before adopting policies or submitting plans that affect native students executive order 13175 and the 2022 2023 uniform standards for tribal consultation reinforce the requirement for government to government engagement at the highest levels of authority recent Federal guidance stresses that probably leaders expect consultation

[01:48:00]
with elected boards and Senior officials not only administrative staff their current gaps in the aps policy the aps board has passed resolutions regarding indigenous student outcomes without fully adhering to tribal consultation requirements we did so in November of 2023 and I voted for it out of sheer ignorance thanks to board member home warranty toes vigilance and guidance I realize that I had an obligation to correct that error as policy chair no current policy governance policy exists to ensure proper consultation before adopting resolutions mou or other major decisions affecting native students the absence of a formal policy creates legal ethical and Equity vulnerabilities

[01:49:00]
proposed action is that I recommend to the I recommend that the policy committee develop a policy for the aps governance manual for the Board of Education committing the board to formal consultation with Navajo Nation the 19 Pueblo and Apache Nations as well as Urban indigenous leaders collaboration with APS Indian education parent committee as required by law ensuring board level approval of policies and agreements that impact Native students happen only after such consultation has occurred further proposed well actually I'm not going to propose this become initiated later an added benefit to having this tribal consult

[01:50:00]
governance policy is that we would get strategic alignment APS has his priority the Martinez yassi compliance the policy would impact centering equity for Native American students one of our another priority is equity and cultural responsiveness the impact of the policy would prevent tokenism respecting sovereignty the third priority is governance leadership the impact of a policy would be to set a Statewide example in ethical effective tribal consultation is legal compliance the impact of such a policy would align APS with the 8538 which I mentioned earlier and the executive order 1317

[01:51:00]
and so on the final note I will say this policy is not only a legal requirement but a moral imperative and a clear signal that the aps board is committed to equity authentic community and family voice and government-to-government partnership with the Sovereign nations of New Mexico so that is my case for such a policy great thank you very much for the presentation do we have a motion and second to consider recommending the development of a new tribal consultation policy motion that we recommend the development of a new tribal consultation policy and this is board member benefits I will remember motion and a second so we will open it up to discussion is there any comments questions or additional

[01:52:00]
Amber Jackson thank you this question is I think probably better indicated for our Administration experts I'm just wondering if p e d or any of the tribes that we are Consulting with have given us any feedback on changing or refining our tribal consultation policy we will have missed Campos are chief of equity come and answer she has been in contact following our policy meeting to get some more clarification is part of our team

[01:53:00]
Indian education I am taking in that role personally so not only as part of as my role as chief of equity that specifically as serving as the role with Indian education I've been miss compost thank you very much more connected to our nmpd Indian education division particularly assistance secretary when he goes so I know assistant secretary want to go has been working on developing a pair definition of what tribal consultation is in particularly after the government to government leaders and developing that shared definition that is still a work in progress

[01:54:00]
they are still working on that and my understanding from the assistant secretary is there a finalizing that that also includes other dynamics of that shared definition including what that would look like for school board representation as well so we are waiting to hear back from them but I am very pleased to hear how nmpd nmped is working directly this is not something just from nmpd but secretary want to go is really working in collaboration with our tribal leaders and developing that shared definition and then again they will provide that to us and then give us recommendations on how to move forward just a follow-up I guess if p e d is working already on the skydance and the shared definition and working with tribal leaders would you recommend that we move forward

[01:55:00]
consultation with our tribal leaders so I would like to hear what our tribal leaders are offering in terms of that shared definition and an true Spirit of tribal consultation with their recommendations are moving forward I think we're all in agreement that we absolutely not just APS but the state itself we really do need to look at tribal consultation we need to make that much more on authentic and real practice it shouldn't be just one system and I believe that is what the the discussion is about so not only just the formality piece

[01:56:00]
giving recommendations to USA school districts and how to make that even just more than formality piece I mean from a Revelations themselves period thank you and then I believe the there was a two-parter to member Jackson's question was whether you'd heard anything from ped and tribes related to this potential policies and I think you answered the PED part so it has the district heard anything but I'll let you have you heard any feedback from tribal leaders as far as the need for an expansion change adjustment to the policy that we already have and we have we have a policy already so have you heard anything requesting from the tribal leaders what I consistently heard throughout this year and also in previous years just from our tribal leaders is again just how many more opportunities to have much more authentic

[01:57:00]
consultation I don't think we've gone to the point kind of like the Nitty Gritty about what that means in terms of policy or specifics and I think that's where we need to go now is to really get into kind of the the meat of it on there I think again it's kind of been very surface-level everyone agree we need to have better consultation what does that actually mean and really also getting that really direct feedback from our Travel Leaders asking them directly what does that actually mean like what do you actually want to see in this I don't think we've been there yet so I would really like to have that opportunity this year to really get at the heart of that with our Travel Leaders again in consultation with NPD right thank you other questions if I may or president I think this is a very important conversation

[01:58:00]
from my district knowing that I have you set up Pueblo as part of my constituency and I also just wanted to remind the board that this conversation is really so that we can vote in favor or against the board the policy committee having these discussions in which Miss compost have just said right so understanding what PD is saying understand what tribal government is saying about wanting consultation with him APS so I think it is necessary for the policy to committee to continue those conversations and what that looks like it's not necessarily saying that we're building a whole new policy that is going to be without those conversations but I think this specific meeting today is to discussing the policy committee to do that work and understand what tribal leaders need from apes and how we can accommodate if needed anything right I know one of the biggest concerns for that I'm hearing is

[01:59:00]
how can we get a bus stop how do you set up Pueblo so our students can stop leaving APS and going to Los Lunas or other districts so yeah I just wanted to point that out and just state that it's super important that we have these conversations and not just in a discussion on this on the diet but also in those committees so we have more time to talk about what is coming from PD and and information on this compost is giving us thank you remember Astoria are there other questions or comments I have a comment remember don't worry too I think I don't want to think but we have a great Junction right now especially PD is is also providing the question and also wanting to listen to tribes I also think that 8ps could also join in on those conference stations because I think that we stand at a good place to be a leader in this and I think that if

[02:00:00]
he truly take this opportunity not only to listen to tribal leaders but I also think in negotiation piece with PD at the table and even with us as board members it would be very helpful to not only address the concerns but I think it's also a great Point within the state of New Mexico to be Standalone to make this happen because everybody looks at us and then they follow through so I think we're at a great opportunity and thank you for your words and for really listening thank you thank you very mucho other questions or comments I just want to clarify something I had a question so what I'm hearing from you is Pete is currently in the process of revising their guidance overall which will include definition of tribal consultation

[02:01:00]
and your direct answer is that if it were up to you eventually you would wait on this policy until that guidance comes out cuz we don't know what it's going to be and so my question is what do we know about the time frame of that guidance from pedal is member support superintendent Blakey my last conversation with assistant secretary juanico was I believe that a week and a half ago and her communication was finalizing so I don't want to speak for this assistant secretary but saying finalizing and in other meetings I've been out in the past month it sounds like it sounds like they're going to probably get us something in the fall on this I know she is really wanting to move forward on this this is something that's very passionate for her as well as to really have this authentic consultation and I'm really excited like remember

[02:02:00]
we have a really good relationship with the Indian Ed division of ped we're all on the same wavelength I guess if you want to say that and to really be making some good movement on what we're looking at in terms of authentic representation and not just the formality pieces but how do we really have those really personal discussions with our tribal leaders and not just our tribal leaders but another kind of recommendations I think the community is understanding you know like for instance of public about her she's very busy and a lot of times you know it's a very formal role so our opportunity to meet with that position is someone limited however their education director other members of the public who are really doing the day-to-day work making sure that those relationships are really tight and solid and having

[02:03:00]
very clear communication that is one thing I've noticed in the past 6 months of overseeing Indian education is again I think our our staff and our educators are coming from the heart but I have staff who are in contact with so-and-so from a certain tribe and so and so forth and try and I saw that the summer connection with some of our teachers just phenomenal but our teachers are off contract this summer so they were emailing them and they're not particularly looking at their emails so again how do we get very clear communication where Michael is to have contacts APS particular Indian education we get that information right away and we're able to answer them right away on their great thank you you're going to make a clarifying comment yes so I appreciate everything you've said and and I want to

[02:04:00]
clarify that that you speak from an administrative point of view what I'm discussing here is a governance policy that distinguishes strategic leadership and consultation from administrative action and I want and the language that comes up over and over and over again from the time I started researching this a year ago in January so that was 2024 and I spoke with I'm going to forget his name last name was from the US Department of Education the languages consultation is not merely performative it is Meaningful timely on effective and it

[02:05:00]
must begin with the policymakers the board of education is that body and whether or not our tribal leaders understand that yet I think my impression when we spoke with assistant Secretary of Indian education juanico that was part of her work and she mentioned and reminded me if I'm wrong for Tomorrowland

[02:06:00]
before I have to do I'm getting this wrong certification at any rate she was shooting for mid-september so I would argue that this is the prime time to begin those conversations in a policy committee and we will still have to check in with assistant Secretary of Indian education any additional comments or questions okay so I'm trying to put this into a flow chart here cuz what I what I'm kind of hearing is some board members have talked to assistant secretary go you have talked to assistant secretary juanico I'm going to assume that superintendent

[02:07:00]
he has also talked to superintendent juanico and what this is potential and what I think this is highlighting is that we have a governance manual that outlines the process as to how policies are developed for the board and the district my concern is that if you are having conversations and you are having conversations and you were having conversations and then I have conversations we're all hearing different things and there's a reason that we have given dysfunction to the administration to the superintendent this is an administrative issue it's the district it's the school district that is the local Education Agency they are the ones who are supposed to be having centralized conversations with the tribal leaders

[02:08:00]
there's a policy in our governance manual that is the superintendent's responsibility to let us know as the board when a policy needs to be developed in relation to potential changes in statutes or regulations that come from the state so my question whoever wants to answer it Miss compost or superintendent leaky is if we don't have guidance yet from an MPE is far as a regulation or a potential statute doesn't make sense for us to create a policy when we don't have when we don't have guidance yet additionally we don't have from what I understand we don't yet quite have Tribal request for this from a centralized Place correct so I would say that it's important to

[02:09:00]
p e d is working with the tribes to create these guidelines that then will come to the school districts so I would just caution the board on creating policy without tribal consultation what could happen with this particular case in talking to assistant secretary and to miss Campos is we could very soon it sounded like possibly probably September receive guidance from the New Mexico public education department based on their tribal consultation of coming up with the guidelines they could direct us to then create policies that we need to change or establish to meet with the new guidelines are I believe the assistant secretary did mention that she wanted there was a desire to include more

[02:10:00]
bored in the tribal consultation so I suspect that that will be part of the guidance we would then according to the governance manual bring it to the policy committee to then develop or redevelop our current policies based on the guidelines we get in the very near future thank you so it's coming but it might just make more sense right now it's not to stop the conversation it's not to it's just to maybe pause the conversation until we have guidance from nmped who has been in consultation with the tribes tribal leaders to one recommendation that assistance secretary want to go just gave a general recommendation not just for

[02:11:00]
current processes that we can just start kind of looking at those and just seen kind of brainstorming and looking and seeing what those look like are there are areas that we want to start like our kind of more concern or Pockets so she did recommend looking at current processes we already have in place is a good proactive measure while we're waiting thank you any further questions or comments have a clarifying questions so I just want to clarify the process so if we if this motion passes this evening then the policy committee has the responsibility to create this policy and then it comes back to the board for final approval okay any additional comments or questions

[02:12:00]
I guess after hearing this conversation what has me concerned now is even hearing the feedback from superintendent Blakey like I feel like we are not we're not setting ourselves up at the right time I understand the intent but I feel like there's still a lot of missing pieces to this and we need to ensure that we're aligned with ped before we move forward with this so I guess not necessarily a question but more of a comment thank you very much I was going to add my comment that this isn't a commentary on the importance of tribal consultation or the importance of Engagement with our native communities but rather a process issue and so part of the purpose of student outcomes focused governance is we went through the trainings was to put in the focus on the goals and the guardrails so that individual

[02:13:00]
numbers do not try to move policy specific to their each individual agenda and so the thing that I worry about is the slippery slope of that I think we all agree that tribal consultation is important but if it's not aligned to directives that are coming from the state or from the superintendent then that is board members just advancing our agenda at any other time and it will board member may decide I want to do a policy on this that or the other right back in the same place where we establish a process right back in the same place period whereas we had established a process for making sure that our policy had an actual flow coming directly from the superintendent so I do have concern about that and I think just to Echo some of the comments that have been made I have significant concerns about advancing this given what I've heard directly from the administrative staff that it would not be helpful to do so right now

[02:14:00]
so that's my comment on the issue and then I think we can go ahead and proceed to vote so Dr Albright if we can have a roll call please vote Janella story I vote Yes and just wanted to also throw in that part of the purpose of tribal consultation is to Foster relationship buildings and engagement with our other communities and that's one of the big things that we heard on last week in our in our community training Community Workshop is we're not being active listeners to our communities so just fostering relationships and trust and I feel like this is a good way to start that when I told him what he thought I vote Yes but I also have a comment to president Gonzalez this isn't a Personal Agenda and its historical you know it's been a great concern for many Native American

[02:15:00]
families and communities cuz the historical factor of the government in itself has not has mistreated so many tribes and the lack of not just as a board member Astoria said this is about relationship building and it is not a Personal Agenda and I would hope that down the line that you see it differently because just being Native American on this board I'm offended by that comment and frankly I will say yes to this and I'm hoping that we do move forward and that this is an Open Door for those who have been silenced for centuries and I hope this changes thank you I vote Yes and I think we have an excellent opportunity it's going to come back to the board for a vote and then we can discuss it done but this is a great opportunity to be the leader in the state to to do this important work

[02:16:00]
yes Crystal Tapia Romero know it's not the right time yes this is precisely the time well overdue Courtney Jackson no I think we need to wait for guidance from nmped before creating the policy so the motion carries and our next item is to consider policy recommending the development of a new capital outlay policy again our presenter is supposed to Dominguez policy chair so Capital outlay decisions investments in facilities building and infrastructure are among the most permanent and expensive decisions

[02:17:00]
decisions shape student learning environments impact equity and influence Community Trust an issue that was raised at was it last Wednesday Thursday feels like a century ago but it's been an issue since first semester and and it's not interested in rehashing Old decisions but I want to learn and reflect on previous decisions and how we proceed better currently there's no government's policy that ties Capital outlay approvals directly to our adopted and New Orleans with that without that connection we risk Miss aligning long-term capital Investments with our academic Mission and Equity commitment

[02:18:00]
as they are currently and I want to stress as they are currently stated and with the current progress monitoring report data Capital outlay employees I want to stress work hard toward equitable distribution of resources nonetheless we have faltered in this area and we need to address Community Trust so in alignment with our board goals goals one and two early literacy and math proficiency Capital Investments prioritize facilities that improve learning conditions for historically underserved students because it would have to be discussed in policy committee perhaps looking at

[02:19:00]
the new alignments along priority and emerging schools they would modernize campuses upgrade classrooms and provide Equitable access to technology infrastructure and be strategically directed to schools with the greatest instructional needs again priority and emerging schools goal 3 post-secondary Readiness to expand dual credit participation and career certification Capital planning must intentionally fund CTE spaces dual credit classrooms and transportation Solutions aligned with our current realities as we learn from our progress monitoring reports this ensures disengage student population are not left out of the post-secondary pathways with regard to

[02:20:00]
skills habits and mindsets a new policy would would ensure safe inclusive and engaging learning spaces such as wellness centers collaborative hubs and outdoor areas essential for fostering the mindsets we want in our students Guided by current data Capital outlay decisions must support these environments especially for Martinez Yazzie targeted populations and are most disengaged students reinforcing guardrails through Capital planning would benefit the district and the board with the district securing 9.16 million for student supports I mean have that number

[02:21:00]
wrong through the recent work of with the city the board must ensure that facilities and programs can deliver mental health and Community Based Services equitably and this is under guardrail one wrap around supports a governance policy insurers Capital funds meet actual student needs and not convenience or political pressures guardrail 2 equity and resource allocation while APS drives for Equity Capital dollars risk being influenced by political clout or the loudest stakeholders I think this is just the reality forever a policy ensures funds are distributed based on objective need facility condition instructional priorities and student demographics not on influence or tradition the commitment transparency will strengthen Community Trust

[02:22:00]
communities historically excluded from District planning must have a real voice in capital decisions and I'm thinking in particular the capital master plan committee which is still a mystery to me I don't know who the members are a governance policy can codify expectations for inclusive and authentic engagement in capital planning processes and finally guardrail 5 staff support and voice learning conditions are teaching conditions facilities directly affect staff morale Recruitment and instructional quality a governance policy insurance that educator input on working conditions is Central to Capital spending decisions and so the why of this policy matters Capital outlay decisions have long lasting impacts on equity

[02:23:00]
Community Trust this is at the heart of what we do as a governance team so the government's policy would align Capital spending with the district's academic goals and guardrails based on progress monitoring reports ensure transparency and fairness in how decisions are made again based on real time progress monitoring reports Center decisions on students families neighborhoods and staff not politics are convenience and ensure public dollars are spent not just to build facilities but to invest in Student Success and most importantly in community neighborhood while being so I urge to the board to prioritize developing a capital outlay government's policy that will safeguard aps's values

[02:24:00]
decision making and puts community and Families First thank you remember Dominguez for your presentation do we have a motion and a second to consider recommending the development of a new capital outlay policy I would like to make a motion and a second so we will open it up to discussion are there any questions

[02:25:00]
specifically the budget development part of the policy well first of all it talks about that that the board will approve a budget that honors the community's vision and values and complies with all local state federal laws rules and regulations and then when it gets to the budget development section it does talk about how the superintendent and the staff will present updates to the budget as the budget is developed particularly about timeline legislative analysis enrollments Staffing levels and salary projections revenues and costs inflationary factors any significant issues related to change changes or items of concerns budget projections and forecasts and I think most crucially which is they think the points that you're getting at is evidence of how resource allocation aligns with the boards goals and Roads and the district strategic plan on it then goes on to say that the superintendent will share the

[02:26:00]
cheese vegetarian priorities with the board based on input that is gathered in a variety of ways through in-person virtual hearings and surveys as well as Community engagement events I added that myself it also talks about the board's fourth guardrail requiring the inclusion of current legal guardian student and Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations so I think I can keep reading but we do have this budget policy here that addresses these concerns that I think that you are bringing up I've already said that part I'm also concerned that creating a new capital outlay policy that is a board policy would cross over into management and take us out of oversight especially because Capital outlay implementation including timeline strategies is an execution

[02:27:00]
play some Administration and it belongs with the superintendent if we also look at the budget policy if you look in the budget management section we already have oversight on major Capital expenditures based on the fact that the board has to approve all proposed District purchases and expenditures that exceed or are expected to exceed 500,000 dollars so we already have we already maintain or hold on to that Authority through the budget policy we also have a finance committee already that provides ongoing oversight they meet every month to review the capital planning to review the outlets to review the budget and we all have the opportunity to attend those finance committee meetings even if we are not dedicated members of the committee so we do have the opportunity to provide recommendations and then like a previously said

[02:28:00]
we are already embedding the student outcome focus into our budgeting process if you look at the budgeting approach a budgeting approach section it does say in support of the board's goals the budget will allocate resources to schools based on community grounded definition of student needs so I think that while I understand your does your concern your desire to have this policy I would respectfully say that we already have a policy that that is in place that addresses the concerns that you have put forth thank you remember Jackson other questions or comments I had a question and I think this is for remember you overview you mentioned capital outlay

[02:29:00]
employees and I just wanted to understand what's the capital outlay employee so I think it's important to Capital outlay is a funding source it's not it's a source of money we get from Capital funds that then is a funding source we don't have Capital outlay employees necessarily we do have people within the finance department that are employees that oversee the capital outlay funds and I think we have maybe five and they are within Finance thank you for that clarification and then my second question I think relates to what you said because I'm a little confused capital outlay is a funding source

[02:30:00]
do we typically have policies related to specific funding sources are there other policies related to specific funding sources know all of the funding sources are within the budget policies and so overall the board does have authority over the budget so if you recall during the budget process and her team will show like that pie of funds and so there is a part of that pie that are the capital outlay funds that come through the budget that you see we also have any Capital outlay funds that are expended do you come through the finance committee for approval La funds go through the finance company and then I guess my last question is similar to the previous agenda item in terms of weather from your

[02:31:00]
dictates that policy recommendation should come from the superintendent and the administration and since this is not I would like for you just to weigh in as to whether you think this policy is needed I think as a capital outlay policy I'm having a hard time understanding like a policy on a specific line item of the budget so I think that through the budget policies we currently have that that matches now what I've heard in misdemeanor talking is more maybe questions or concerns about the capital master plan which is a separate kind of conversation in a pretty robust way of looking at the facilities as a whole and so but as I do not think that there is a capital outlay fund policy that would be

[02:32:00]
with outside of the budget in the finance committee thank you so are there any other final questions or comments I just have a question coming off of this discussion that was just had from Remember The Mingus it is there a distinction that you would like to make between Capital outlay versus Capital master plan policy well the capital master plan is impacted by Capital outlay funding and so I think the issues I raised does that answer your question before clarify more yes so the issues I raised have gotten lost in the existing model and process and governance policy which is our responsibility as a board link this directly to community

[02:33:00]
and I think that's the piece that needs to be lifted up and it's hard to lift that up for consideration when Finance in a finance committee given the structure of it at the moment so for example are finance committee we meet for 15 to 30 minutes and yes we have an opportunity to to go over the packet but there is no discussion about the umbrella the values of the Visions driving Capital outlay funds during a finance committee so that's what I'm trying to

[02:34:00]
Lyft for consideration here remember come from legislators their line items and those are separate from the funding of the capital master plan right yes so every year schools request specific Capital outlay funds to their legislators for projects needed at their school so that Capital outlay comes in the forms of play structures intercom systems a lot of the vestibules they're really the school has quite a bit of autonomy in requesting

[02:35:00]
best friends those are the capital La funds that we request every year from legislators that then come to individual schools from the specific pot of money that each legislator gets number Capital outlay funds that are requested by the schools then the schools and the communities that they serve in theory they're the ones that are kind of driving like they identified the need for their individual schools and communities and then can request those Capital outlay funds from their legislators yes so we kind of guided a little bit cuz we do the project space on it so I think you know the district kind of says here's like three or four things which one is your school needing and then the government Affairs team basically goes to lobby for those they are not always

[02:36:00]
several of them aren't several of them are but yes it's pretty driven by the school based on the different items that the district gives as items that can be requested lots of yeah shade structures intercom you'll see them they do come across through the finance committee as well I have a question if I may yes remember Astoria just going off of this discussion superintendent Blakey we had some funding that was requested last year for the festival that we did not end up getting from legislature because of I guess allocation differences with this come from the capital outlay that I can send that in a RFI request that was Capital funds that were requested through a different they were Capital funds not requested to the district so that's that was tied up in a different

[02:37:00]
space but I can we can send you the information on on those specific funds yes I know that it was a junior bill I was just wondering if it would still be around that same like correct it is capital funds it was just a different entity that requested it but yes those are capital funds and remember the name is I know that you're familiar with what happened with that location as well with this policy help situations like that where we would be able to have more Authority around where that funding or how to receive that funding wouldn't necessarily because it was a different entity and it went through the Department of Finance so that's specific would not be fixed through this policy that was a city issue yeah we were moving from 8 p.m. to the city I believe in that location

[02:38:00]
I'm happy to send you the the information on it no I was just using it as an example for my own understanding of if we do have a policy around Capital outlay what exactly are Authority would be as the board member in as a board member and remember the meaning of his eyes of you know our responsibility I don't know if that question made sense and thank you remember a story about a member did you want to respond to that yes so a government policy as I see it is to articulate and align while to articulate the vision and the values that we have translated into goals and guardrails so we would want to align and honor the goals in the guard rails very directly

[02:39:00]
Capital outlay funds and how they are spent and I think I can't say it anymore clearly than that there's succinctly were that's not happening in a finance committee because it's such a big topic and again are among the most permanent and expensive decisions and you know about there are lots of questions that have come up and I'm fine request on specifics but what has come to my attention as a board member is that this is a big pot of money

[02:40:00]
and are golden guard rails need to be aligned with that big pot of money thank you remember the meanest just a follow-up would you say that if we revised the budget policy that member Jackson brought up considering that it has a lot of information that you want on the capital of La policy to say something like in finance committee meetings will allocate certain amount of time for Capital Outlet conversations would that be something that would kind of be the same as like an outlet policy I'm just trying to figure out what the difference is I guess between the budget policy that we currently have compared to a new policy and if we can revise it in order to fit your needs of this conversation I think that would be something we talked about in a policy committee if

[02:41:00]
forward with a conversation on developing or let's see what does it say here yeah I think that could happen in as part of the conversation thank you again for us how much is a lot of money or is it a lot of money or what is the scope that we're talking about here we can get that money or we can get we can get that amount and send it to you

[02:42:00]
each legislator gets I'm just looking at Joseph and Daniel to 1 million thank you to distribute among their area the states wherever they choose so capital outlay is it's a small segment because some schools don't get any Capital outlay money but we have had years when we've had generous Capital outlay Sarah Lopez gave a million dollars to Rio Grande High School for construction but usually these are projects that are 10000 20,000 of school it's a pretty small it's a small amount per School of little projects that the schools request of capital outlay money and I don't know off the top of my head but you figure each each

[02:43:00]
legislator gets a little pot of money that's in some give them and some don't to separate schools thank you for the clarification that was my understanding also and I guess I'm wondering if maybe there's some conflation of capital outlay funds versus funding that pays for capital projects capital projects are funded through bond that is a much larger amount of money and that comes through as we just did as the bond package so you will have seen how much we put forth through those so those are that is for capital projects and that's Bond money thank you any additional questions or comments on this one or president I just have one last comments I just want to understand that what you are seeking from the board is approval to

[02:44:00]
work with the policy committee to research this topic create a policy put an hours of research answer all of your questions and all of the questions that have been asked up here on the diets especially the ones where there seems to be confusion create a policy and then bring it back to the board for final approval that's what's happening here yes okay okay so you're asking us to give you permission to do a lot of homework and create a policy that may not end up being approved anyway and I'm not saying that in the way that to discourage you I just want everybody to know that there's still another level that this policy that is needs to go through okay so and I have a question a clarifying questions so before we had our policy or I'm sorry or maybe diet and I'm

[02:45:00]
two committees that we got rid of one was Capital outlay committee and under that we talked about capital projects Capital master plan and so I'm I'm confused why Capital outlay doesn't include capital projects which were included under that committee I can't answer that just because I don't know how that was named necessarily but I can find out and get back to you on it but I don't I don't know how that capital projects Capital Money Capital can be used in different ways so but Capital outlay specifically is the funding source and I don't recall

[02:46:00]
in those meetings though I could be wrong but I think Mr with Jim J's on cuz he would know more of how those work I don't recall the board approving the capital outlay projects that went to legislators now the capital master plan and the bond does currently include connection to the goals and guardrails separate than the capital outlay money but capital projects and the bond package that we reviewed with everyone has how we align the capitol master plan to the current goals in the current bond package so what's the umbrella term for all of this because when there was a capital outlay committee it seemed that lead us to

[02:47:00]
believe that Capital outlay was the umbrella term for projects bonds and very directly Capital outlay funding from elected officials I would say maybe a term would be Capital just in general that would include everything is this I mean it's still it's a it's a pot of money and I think it's important for that pot of money to have to have to be aligned to the goals and guard rails in a very significant way that gets lost

[02:48:00]
so yes to board member benevity this is suggestion but these are the things that we would hash out and figure out thank you remember Jackson you had a question what no I was just I was just going to when we were with the capital outlay when we went through the policy diet when we got rid of remember we got rid of those two that you mentioned it was because when we were having that discussion there was the acknowledgment that it was the operational versus the government's role that each side played and there was an acknowledgment at the time that it is the district in the superintendent who have the the Deep Finance knowledge the budgetary knowledge that they are the ones who who make those decisions and then bring it to us

[02:49:00]
we don't lose out on our ability to to influence as far as Community input but it was the acknowledgment that the expertise for Capital I mean even tonight there's Capital outlay there's bonds you know that was the acknowledgment that that was where they have the expertise and that we have the expertise with the vision in The Valleys so that's why that whole policy diet that committee went away correct opportunity to make several comments and questions and I worry that we're getting background to just making our case and so I'd like to suggest we move to vote if that's okay we have a motion in a second and we have deliberated yes yes okay thank you for that so we do have a motion and a second so Dr all

[02:50:00]
wake me up a roll call vote please stop you have a mirror Josefina Dominguez yes to the charter school policy for this our presenter again is Josefina Dominguez our policy chair so our board has adopted clear goals and Ally schools the publicly funded and under apses umbrella currently operate without a consistent government

[02:51:00]
during public forum all that is would be taken into account the Gap this Gap weekends oversight fragments accountability and risks in equity for students across our system so regarding early literacy and math proficiency APS has explicit targets to improve outcomes for historically underserved students the the problem is that we have had Charter School renewals come before us and we haven't had consistent or accurate data and this is something that has come up in conversations with Charter School

[02:52:00]
principles for lack of a better word without a government's policy Charters are not uniformly accountable for student progress in literacy and math nor are they supported by the district that authorizes them to provide accurate data and I think that is critical we need a line expectations for instruction Assessments in your interventions to ensure every student benefits whether in Traditional School or a charter this requires an agreement between APS and the charters we approve and specifically their governance councils correct goals for

[02:53:00]
participation possibly bilingual seals possibly industry certifications and social emotional skills I think what I'm after more above above all is a conversation with governance councils especially because we are the authorizers and let me remind everyone the charter schools that are with us they have an option to be authorized by the PEC but if they're going to be in relationship with APS it's got to matter and I don't think it has to be an adversarial relationship but it does have to be a relationship directly with the school board and the governance councils this would guarantee that every

[02:54:00]
High School regardless of the school model we would be committed to reinforcing the guard rails for an equitable and coherent system special education services in Charters we know that children with disabilities oftentimes are recruited in and then pushed out and that's an issue that's got to be addressed very directly with governance councils a policy would close gaps and prevent disparities from growing unchecked curriculum quality and cultural responses to send by standards for culturally and linguistically relevant

[02:55:00]
that again I understand we're in the middle of contracts all this gets discussed which we don't even do now it would be discussed and negotiated Charters must adhere to some level of expectations for curriculum rigor and alignment and again if we are going to authorize them there's got to be an agreement about how we are going to support them and at a time that we are right sizing and repurposing traditional neighborhood schools we have to ask the question do we have the capacity for supporting 30 + Charter Schools staff support and family and Community engagement transparency and authentic community and family

[02:56:00]
engagement should be non-negotiable a governance policy ensures Charters uphold APS standards for family voice and public accessibility staff support and voice staff working conditions professional development and inclusive decision-making and Charters must reflect District values and labor standards codifying these expectations protect staff and enhances Student Success so in conclusion the case for the policy is such without a governance framework District authorized Charters operate in a gray Zone there's too much ambiguity every time Charter Schools come before the board for authorization I feel personally like I'm rubber stamping and I'm not getting accurate data and that's not only unfair to the board it's unfair to the charters

[02:57:00]
the lack of clarity I'm sorry without a governance framework District authorized charges operate in the gray Zone as do we have publicly funded but inconsistently accountable this lack of clarity weakens coherence and how we serve students particularly Martinez and Yazi we need Charters and we need to work together with Charters to develop a plan to adequately share the responsibility for Martinez Yazzie children rather than creating exclusivity and we risk widening inequities without or with the lack of clarity

[02:58:00]
responsibility to all students in its jurisdiction a clear enforceable governance policy will ensure transparency accountability alignment and above all collaboration with those schools that come to us for authorization so that every APS student in every school is supported and prepared for success I do not see this request as an asymptote Charters are equal we have some incredible Charter Schools helping us with kids with kids that get kicked out of APS and they do an admirable job they're just not they struggle with enrollment issues and so

[02:59:00]
how do we come up with a plan that benefits all students but is responsible from an APS board perspective and also a governance Council on the charter side thank you remember Dominguez for your presentation do we have a motion and a second to consider recommending the revision to the charter school policy I move that we consider recommending a revision to the charter school policy this is board member benefits I will second this is Boardman thank you we have a motion and a second so we will open it up to deliberation are there any questions

[03:00:00]
he might also be for Mr Escobedo I am very worried that we're about to get ourselves sued that we do not have the legal authority to unilaterally impose District specific requirements upon Charter Schools baby that's comment maybe that's a question but if either one of you can comment on that I'm very concerned that we're about to overstep our legal Authority on charter schools have Dr Escobedo come up good evening also going against national standards

[03:01:00]
I think part of what I would like to say to you is that what was described of what we need to do in the Outreach is exactly what our team does our schools thank you any additional questions is that again State Statute or federal law to provide revisions in general terms now but but you did say that you're concerned that we might be but it's not illegal to just think about revisions to to propose them it's still has to come back to the board to be approved but

[03:02:00]
UPS is providing adequate resources and systems for those charter schools to be able to be held at those higher standards and that will also potentially take from our funds that we are already kind of you know not in the best moment with that is actually with Federal funding right so I want to just say that and have that simmer as we're having these discussions is if we're going to do something like this that that it has to be equally thought

[03:03:00]
which means systems resources funding whatever that looks like thank you member of astorga other questions from the board member Jackson okay so just a couple things so this was this was discussed in policy committee and it came out of policy committee and that exact same concern of I think I think if we go down this route we are going to find that we are going to be sued we're still here we're having this conversation there's a potential it's going to go back to policy it is still going to stand that if we try to overstep our Authority within the statutory obligation statutory framework of the state then we are we're playing well let's move it let's move it here let's move it there I think we just need to

[03:04:00]
a fourth grade conversation right now to say we cannot impose our district specific requirements upon charter schools now are there ways that we can potentially work that in are there is there a way through contract language is there a way through performance framework language is that something that we are already doing that that potentially is addressing the concern and that is being put forth right now so when we when we work with our schools whether they are currently under their eyes we are asking them to break down all of

[03:05:00]
semester conversations about where they're singing successes and where they're saying you know concerns and so I think part of what we're talking about here is really being done by our office already and I think it's happened in a natural way that the schools have embraced it and really have seen that the goals that you all have said they want to meet they can meet them you know they want to strive to that to have the ability for our entire Community to rise together thank you Doctor Escobedo I have a question and it is is APS currently fulfilling its legal obligation related to Charter authorization and then my second question I think will be for both the administration and remember overview I heard

[03:06:00]
frequent reference to inaccurate data so can you just clarify for me what is the inaccurate data that you believe you've been presented with so let me ask the question do do we have charters on our Snapper on our dashboard number of those reports to have triple quadruple concerns have been rectified and we are aware so I hear reports directly from that they would prefer to be more aligned somehow they have their own reporting system is that correct

[03:07:00]
so we do not require our systems to pull and do their data so some of the data is available on WhatsApp for Charter Schools but it is what's available consistently for all schools so sometimes I'll have to cycle assessment data that isn't connected to our systems where our traditional schools are that makes sense so what's the impact their what what are some of the challenges that because I'm I'm getting reports that there are challenges and really trying to figure out it is their responsibility being Independence okay so I understand your point about their independence

[03:08:00]
but we as we as an authorizer have an obligation to ensure that that they are going to function without those challenges somehow someway because it impacts their reporting to us we are symbiotically connected and I don't I guess I don't understand why we started in 2023 an effort to collaborate with the governance councils and we did that one summer I think it's important

[03:09:00]
we have some kind of policy and process understanding that governance councils have got to be in touch with the Board of Education governance governance that is missing right now and I think there's even a desire for that thank you for your case making are there additional questions for Dr Escobedo for the administration or related to the agenda item I have a quick comment just on what was being said because I have also heard the same concerns about data and wanting to continue conversations with a PS4 and the governing councils and potentially providing similar goals with my graduation requirements and different things like that so I would love a further discussion with Dr school with the board regarding charter schools on that and how we can partner just

[03:10:00]
I wanted to shout out that I have heard similar concerns thank you remember Astoria if there are no additional questions we can go ahead and move to a vote so Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please I want to be clear that my vote is not a commentary on Charter Schools it's a yes for the committee to have the option to revise the policy and bring it back to the board to defend and promote in the board has final approval so yes Courtney Jackson know so the motion carries and we will move on to our next item which is to consider approval of the consent agenda should we have a motion and a second for items 7.1

[03:11:00]
1037.8 iMovie approve the consent agenda for items 7.1 through 7.8 this is number Jackson and a second can we have a roll call vote please so we will move on to our next item which is discussion items agenda item 8.1 report from the student voice ad hoc committee and a recommendation so our presenter for this one is the chair of the student voice at hoc Committee Member of school thank you for president I will keep this pretty quick cuz I know it's getting late I am member Gonzalez were on The Voice

[03:12:00]
talk committee and what we were really focused on is student voice on the board so what we did was created an application for students who were interested in helping us understand what students would like to see on the board considering student voice so we sent out some applications and we picked an intern who was helping us really roll out what the opinions of students was and how they wanted to be represented on the board so as you all got your support document and it's on diligent if you haven't read it yet is some ways that we could engage youth in board works so one of the biggest ones and most popular ones that we've heard in community and from students is having a student representative on the school board itself and there was different conversations of whether this student position would have voting Authority so there could be more conversations on what that looks like some other ways

[03:13:00]
engage students on Boardwalk where student advisory councils and these were specialized issues so when the biggest ones that came up was mental health that we heard and I know that more things like school safety and gun violence were also really big with their students we had a student town halls and forums which is also I want to shout out president Gonzalez for having her Town Hall as a student Town Hall to get more information from students about how they found in their schools and our goals and guardrails we also have student focused reports or presentations so similar to our progress monitoring and conversations that we've had of community members of they don't know how to access information or what's going on on board work tailoring it to students so that they can find information if they wanted to or having it with less language and you know more fun I would say for students and also incorporating student feedback in policy development so again if we had a student representative

[03:14:00]
committees some of the impacts of student Representatives would be to amplify student voice and foreign policy changes and build leadership development and then there's also a recommendation from our internal Mara that states that her opinion is to have a student advisory Council on the board so much like our superintendent has super Sac where students come and express concerns or things that they want supported more to the superintendent we would have the same on a board level and doing that for a year and then from those students who participated in that student advisory Council they would be two students that are elected to represent on the boat on the board and her recommendation is first students who are elected to have voting power on the school board so I know this would constitute some policy changes and some more conversation with that is what our internment recommended and what the student with

[03:15:00]
recommends and and again we have our specialized advisory Council topic the number one was mental health for students and making sure that they can bring concerns to the board and have real conversations about what it's like for students inside of schools and what supports they might need that they're not getting already from some of the District programs that we have in place or maybe ways that we can you talk about coming together to amplify some of those resources that are already in place so this is a step one and some of this conversation of how to get some more student voice on the board but I wanted to recommend those ideas to you all and I also just wanted to point out that I asked for a continuation of the student voice ad hoc committee to president Gonzalez on a specific goal of engaging students and community on the topic of gun violence in our communities because of the losses that we've had throughout the years so yes quick summary thank you remember us to

[03:16:00]
so we'll go ahead and open it up to discussion questions and feedback on that recommendation so is there any of that for many members of the board just a quick comments and I know safety is a real issue right now and whatever we can do to offer a environment of psychological safety physical safety conducive to learning student outcomes will improve so thank you thank you for other comments or questions I like the idea of having student voice on school board and I'm just wondering if we might have

[03:17:00]
play buffer year before they actually get a vote so that we get a chance to to hear from them and work out I mean it's a big job and and providing support so that they can be their best board representation it's all I know these are just ideas right now but I'm throwing out that idea as a possibility and I'm referring to it as a buffer a year a learning and reflective year but yes I do like it's intriguing and and absolutely I think student voices important I just want to say that yes that's exactly what the plan would be is to

[03:18:00]
have students involved with the process of being on a board and learning and being part of that at quote unquote advisory Council for board members so that they can kind of use it as a leadership pipeline so though after they have time with us on the advisory Council those who are interested in running to be the the representative for the students on the board would have that also that experience of what it's like to run a campaign be elected and do all of that from student body nice thank you any other questions or comments remember tomorrow thank you for this work I think I know last year when we heard from the students panel that came before us you know they did speak about incidences and other things that we as a board did not think about or have any relationship too so this is very vital as

[03:19:00]
should we move forward I think it's all the adults in education we often forget that we are serving students and children who have no voting matter and decision-making so I feel this is going to be a great opportunity to not only listen but also to really balance out our education system to where children do have a voice so thank you for this and I'm really I'm really grateful for all the work you did thank you remember tomorrow other questions or comments I just wanted to shout out my member with me president Gonzalez cuz it was a lot of a lot of work that she did on her end too so thank you so much for helping me with my leave and everything going on of course thank you so I just wanted to take the opportunity to sort of summarize that we have a recommendation from the ad hoc committee that we move forward with establishing essentially not a super sack but

[03:20:00]
some sort of student Advisory Group that advises the board and they would do that for a year or so and then during that process we would also explore how we might be able to add a voting student member so that's the first recommendation which I'm hearing General support and enthusiasm from the board for the other piece of the recommendation was this concept of sort of topical advisory councils and so remember Historia did raise the issue of the top issue that came up for the students was mental health and there's also significant need for student voice and engagement around safety particularly safety with firearms in our community and so in just want to put to the board as we think and to the superintendent too as we think about engaging further in the separate will continue to have the ad hoc committee meeting continue to process and figure out how we do this work but when it comes to

[03:21:00]
and I guess my question for board members is do we want to move forward with both this process for having sort of I'm going to keep calling at the board sack for lack of another better word but a board student advisory commission and they're helping us figure out student voice on the board and then do we also want to have the topical student advisory Council and if so are we doing that on mental health or school safety so the floor is open to feedback to those questions so what I say we go right back to students and ask them what topic well that's what this comes from is their topic was mental health their primary topic was mental health member Astoria suggesting that given recent events we might want to consider gun violence as a topic I would say that we go with what students are directing

[03:22:00]
to honor the spirit of of the ad hoc so yes remember Jackson know I just have a quick question yes I think absolutely let's move forward with the first half my question is on the second half with having a board sack how is that different than the information that the superintendent is receiving from her super stack like would we be getting different information are we getting this similar information on the research of the interns that we have this would be a separate body of students that exists just to provide feedback to the board so a compliment to the super sack but a different word sack so there's been no other details or conversations in terms of

[03:23:00]
what that looks like how many students how often do they meet where do they come from how do they get nominated none of that stuff so I think that's the stuff that the committee would need to go forward and figure out I think the other question that seems implicit implicit in your question is this issue around duplication of effort and also capacity and so if we're to set up an additional advisory Council who's responsible for managing that we certainly don't want to create extra work for the staff and so if there was an additional advisory Council set up we'd have to figure that out the third option is it could be just be the super sack who then engages and provide advice to the board as well or it could be a subset of the super sack but the details at all dressed yet so maybe one thing that needs to be still flushed out on that second part is that there is

[03:24:00]
so as we've been talking about there is that implicit difference between what the board work does and with the superintendent does and any board student advisors would would need to be trained brought up to date on what board work is versus what superintendent work is so just something if I made that's exactly what the advisory Council would be is the students who are interested in serving on the board as a student representative so they're kind of getting that like introduction to Boardwalk what does that look like and then helping bring some of the student voice that is connected to board work to that advisory committee so yeah you're kind of right on it so I'm hearing again support for this concept of the this board student advisory Council and then also I think nodding and agreement but if we do a topical whole student advisory

[03:25:00]
cancel it should focus on Mental Health quick question why can't we combine the two why does it have to be just one or the other and that's maybe that's a dumb question and it's not obvious to me but I mean I know it's really good and that's it for conversation as well I think part of it was about the scope all right so if it were related to mental health that would be more in line with administrative work and so we would be hearing from students around what are the priorities or issues concerns related to mental health but largely that falls under the superintendents per view same with gun violence and so it would be opportunity for us to hear from students but we don't have as much direct responsibility in action versus developing the super sack of I'm sorry board sack that would be more focused on just Ford responsibility in action so we can also since we'll continue the work of the committee explore that question members should this

[03:26:00]
board Sac that will meet for a year also provide feedback on the topical question so we can consider that I think the other thing is that we can also recommend to the superintendent that the super sack address or consider mental health and then I don't know maybe a report back to the board or something do people feel strongly about any of that or just or comfortable delegating back to the committee to collaborate with the superintendent and staff on the next recommendations comfortable delegating back to the committee yes all right right thank you and thank you remember a story for the work and for the presentation we'll move on now to the next discussion item which is agenda item 8.2 an update from the community engagement ad hoc committee on the state of the district event and for this one our presenter is

[03:27:00]
Jackson the chair of that ad hoc committee thank you okay so I'll make this short and sweet since school starts tomorrow and the state of the district address is going to be held on Tuesday August 26th from 9:00 to 10:30 at Berna facio we are not going to have any sort of Engagement breakfast beforehand we're going to go straight into the address we are going to have we will have the very robust student involvement we will have a student MCS we have a band performing for us as a student get there a student performance of the national anthem then we will go into remarks by our board president that will focus primarily on the aps schools and guardrails and maybe a little state of the Board address

[03:28:00]
then we're going to move to guest remarks by Dr Michael Richards the Executive Vice President of UNM Health Sciences he is the way that it was described is that he is our Target student he is somebody who started as as one of our students and has obviously gone on to to great things so he has a great story to tell and then we'll move to a video presentation and then into Dr blakey's speech about the state of the district after that in order to kind of keep it a little bit more interactive we will move to a fireside chat with a superintendent Blakey and board president Gonzalez in which they will be taking questions from two more students one who was in the middle school or one is a high schooler so that will be kind of interact

[03:29:00]
then we will close and again we'll have student student musicians throughout student emcees and to students everywhere for this so what we are asking of the board members is to once again please contact your organizations people that you know people that Community involvement make sure that they know when the event is again Tuesday August 26th from 9 to 10:30 we would love to have a lot of people in attendance if you want to run a full-page ad in the journal that would be awesome and pro bono right so yeah that would be fantastic but this is the the second annual state of the district but it is the third time in 3 years that we have gone in front of the community and it is just a great way for the superintendent for the board and for

[03:30:00]
cast to be transparent and open and honest about how APS is doing and I think that we have some good stories to tell and so I am open for questions if there are any questions from the board thank you member Jackson for your presentation are there any questions from the board for your presentation and thank you to the committee for the work on this really exciting and looking forward to the state's second annual state of the district address and so with that we will go ahead and move on to agenda item number 9 which is the president's report and so as usual we'll start with public forum and acknowledging again that public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that they were hurt and that we are working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that we

[03:31:00]
Public School libraries and Librarians District professional development expanded PSAT testing welcome back from the district quality working conditions HVAC teletherapy technology asset allocation supporting Educators policy committee recommendations the policy on Charters early literacy goals and statement for State mandated first grade dyslexia screener and integrity in anti-bullying next I wanted to share the we do have another ad hoc committee that has been actively working so it's sad hoc committee on evaluating board guard rails so this committee has much and has begun to develop a plan that will include the does include the development of interim guardrails which are intended to be measurable and specific as well as a process and timeline for how and when the board will evaluate against the board guard rails final recommendations from this community will be submitted to the

[03:32:00]
I'm in September for consideration on in October next is I wanted to provide a brief overview of progress against guardrail 2 board members had the opportunity to review the guardrail to report and to ask questions but because it was on the consent agenda it was not discussed so the board did adopt guardrail to with a clear expectation and that's that the superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated in equitably the two interim guardrails 2.1 and 2.2 help us to monitor whether the district is meeting that expectation and we're pleased to report that APS is not only meeting the mark But exceeding it under armed guard rail 2.1 the district set a goal to ensure that at least 65% of our classroom of classrooms and priority schools which are those with the highest needs were covered by long-term substitutes and APS didn't just meet that annual Target but it hit

[03:33:00]
100 years ahead of schedule so this is super exciting and didn't want to let that moment go without acknowledgment just because it was on the consent agenda also every classroom with a teacher vacancy had a consistent qualified adults in place providing students with a stability and support that they need to succeed so every single classroom with the teacher vacancy did have a consistent qualified adult in place which is another huge success that we want to acknowledge and express appreciation for for this work underground 2.2 the district committed to providing more direct support to principals who are in priority schools through instructional visits by assistant superintendents the goal was 75 visits for the year the district completed that's my drum roll not just 75 visits for the year but 225 visits tripling the annual Target

[03:34:00]
passing the 3-year goal not just the one your goal but surpassing the 3-year goal of 150 so something else to celebrate that we didn't want to go let go without mention these visits provide important coaching professional development and aligned leadership support grounded in a tiered model that ensures the schools with the most actually do you receive the most attention so thank you to the aps Administration and the team for this incredible progress together these results show that the district is serious about meeting Garden real too so serious that they've already exceeded it so congratulations maybe around the blocks super exciting not just to meet our goals but to exceed them so the next update that we have is

[03:35:00]
change to the community engagement ad hoc committee membership and so as established by Charter this committee is ad hoc but we are rotating members through and so we have actually been able to rotate through all members to serve a period of time on that ad hoc committee and so we will now be setting out the current Representatives and subbing in new and So currently on the committee we have member benavidez and member top your Romero so just want to express appreciation and gratitude to members benavidez for your service on the community engagement at hot committee and we will be starting over with the cycle of something and members which will come back to me who started so the community engagement will now be member Jackson and myself and then we'll cycle in the next member and I'm not quite sure why we went in the order but the next one who went on after me was member Dominguez and so

[03:36:00]
after that perhaps we'll remember that will change the other cycle but we can figure that out if you're interested in serving and then the next update is we discussed in the last board meeting our time use and so thank you to remember astorga for serving as the secretary and leaving that process but also to member Jackson for filling in while member of story was out I did the time use tracker for the last quarter and in my presentation neglected to name the time you tracker for the next quarter this one we are going in a much more logical order and so we're going from District 3 me to District 4 remember benavidez and member Benavides will just responsible for doing our time used tracking for quarter 3 so that's the president's report the next Board of Education meeting will be Wednesday August 20th at 5:00 p.m. and the Alice in Bruce King educational complex here at 6400 Uptown Boulevard North East and live streamed at 8 p.m.

[03:37:00]
and with that this meeting is adjourned
