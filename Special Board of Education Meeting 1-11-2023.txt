==================================================

[00:00:00]
issues and tonight is going to be the discussion of the Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education implementation of student outcomes Focus governance superintendent Scott Helder and Ashley Paz from the council that great City Schools going to have the floor and start presenting and believe what we're going to do here is just you guys are going to present where we are and all the things that were happening or what's going on and Ashley is going to help facilitate our conversation as we go through the actual decision or just looking at our goals and and getting to an outcome on that so welcome thank you

[00:01:00]
facilitator is going to take point for the moment yes great thank you so much my name is Ashley Paz and I am a governess coach from Council of great City Schools tonight I'm really excited to be helping facilitate this conversation for you all and I'm going to start off by doing that and celebrating some of the work that you have done up until this point so I really want to take us back to a couple of months your journey on your board has the journey that you all have been on really began in October we had an initial conversation and highlighting that the reason that school systems exist is to improve student outcomes and for that purpose the reason that school boards exist is to represent the community's vision and values in pursuit of improve student outcomes as we go

[00:02:00]
this conversation around your function oh no Community let me stop my other stream and that might make it better okay great are we going in your area I hope there's not a storm or anything there is not you can hear me now you're cutting in and out it's not the best so hopefully we can okay

[00:03:00]
okay that sounds good so I'll let me start over so I want to take us back just to briefly discuss the journey that you're bored has been on so we began our journey by addressing the fact that the reason that school systems exist is to improve student outcomes and for that purpose the reason that school boards exist is to represent the communities vision and values in pursuit of improve student accounts as we dove into this conversation around your function of representing the vision and values of your community we lifted up the way that you the board clarifies those visions and those values in a policy this method is two-fold first you listen to the community to understand what their vision is you do this by asking the question what should APS students know or

[00:04:00]
what to do then you take that Collective vision and write it down in the form of goals when you do this you have to make sure they're smart and they describe exactly what the biggest priorities are for improved student outcomes next the board has to listen for the community shared values you do this by listening again you write down what you hear as guard rails these guards are specific policy statements that describe the non-negotiables that the superintendent should adhere to while on the path to accomplishing your goals in other words we ask what must the superintendent not do or stop doing in order to guard the community is that for each of these goals and guard rails children specifically the children that APS is charged with empowering through knowledge and support from

[00:05:00]
graduation these children are Center in your conversation we want to give the resources so that they can execute on things that they know and things that they're able to do throughout their career with APS and after graduation so that they're able to be productive members of society this should always remain front and center so in October you adopted a time line that was both deliberate and aggressive you recognize the need for a different way to engage your community that expands the table where decisions are made by creating new space for the most chronically under heard voices while also hearing from the people who give their time and energy to the school district throughout the year at the same time you recognize the need to act with deliberate speed so that the superintendent and his administration May effectively create

[00:06:00]
plan that is in alignment with these priorities that you will set and formerly take action next week at your January 18th board meeting so subsequent to that your board has put in the hours to engage in your listening work you went out to a broad number of community organizations not to share not to dominate the conversation but to really just be in service and to demonstrate that service to the community by listening your staff has taken that listening and together we have worked to compile the feedback into a summary document that you all have been provided in advance of today and that really highlights the high-level themes that came back from what your community had to say in addition to the summary you were provided all of the backup information and I know that many of you have actually taken the time and you've gone through and

[00:07:00]
pieces of feedback if not every single piece so I just want to thank you for the energy that you brought to this work and congratulate you on executing this portion of your responsibility as board members and representing the vision of values of the community so before moving on I have to celebrate some of the efforts that were put in by your teams so first and foremost I would like to celebrate superintendent Elder for overseeing this effort and creating the conditions for you all to be successful next we cannot proceed without acknowledging Dr Gabriella Blakey and Dr Christie Albright answered the call all of you and both of their organization and attention to detail you all have received a respectable amount of feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders 2024 individual participants to be exact

[00:08:00]
for contacts another District around the same size as you recently went through this process with three times the number of sessions over the same time period and they had less than half of the participation that you did this is a direct outcome from the priority that all of you set for this process to engage individuals from historically under heard or unheard communities you wanted to ensure that you were able to hear from folks who have a unique communication or participation needs that traditionally prevent them from engaging around these types of processes in response to this priority your staff organized unique sessions for families of students who represent who received special education services and for educators and even hosted one session exclusively in Spanish for

[00:09:00]
Spanish-speaking families in their native time each of these sessions was facilitated by at least two of you from the board of education but I know that many of you attended multiple sessions even the ones that you weren't facilitating so it's important to remember that while this is a new process the work was deeply informed by the expertise and past efforts from members of your APS staff and folks in the community who are holding us all accountable it is especially important to celebrate the members of the committee who pulled these events together faculty members that helped Linda Hand while these all took place I've already acknowledged Dr Blakey and Dr Albright and like to add to the list by thinking Monica and the communications team Brian Garcia and the Community Schools coordinators all of the Zone Associates and principals very nice Gutierrez Julie Sanchez on Antonio

[00:10:00]
Refugee department so it's easy to look at what needs to change what are the things that need to be improved I would really be remiss if I fail to acknowledge that prior boards crawled so that you all could walk on the path on the path to continuous Improvement It's always important to stop along the way and acknowledge the journey that your entire system has been on while maintaining the focus of the work that still needs to be done so as you see these individuals who have just acknowledged throughout the community as you're walking through the halls of APs be sure to give them extra high-five lots of congratulations and thanks because they really did pull off an amazing feat in making sure that these Community listening sessions went off without a hitch so additionally while you all have been working on community listening

[00:11:00]
Elder has been pulling together data that describe some of the districts I need areas this data should answer the following question what information can help you understand the current reality for students in APS where are the places that students are currently struggling which areas with your focus can be leveraged with an investment of resources to create the biggest impact for students for improved student outcomes this information will give you a way of understanding where are the highest needs exist here in just a second we're going to hear from superintendent Elder and he and Dr seguro will walk you through that and a little more detail so all of this work leads us into this evening where our task is to go through some of the data that's been provided over the past week information that will ground our conversation and what is happening in the lives of your students

[00:12:00]
Additionally the vision and values feedback you've gathered will ensure that your conversation is informed by the collective wisdom of your community with these two sets of information you will begin the process of drafting your goals that describe the outcomes you want to see for students and the guard rails that describe the values that must be honored along the way that's the nature of the work will be doing this evening before we dive in any further what questions do you have what questions do you have specifically about the process we've got through so far or what our plans are for this evening are there any questions like ready to go great so before before I turn it over to superintendent Elder I would like to just give you all an opportunity to comment I know a couple of you had

[00:13:00]
ask for a moment to celebrate the staff and the work that has been done so far before we really dig into this conversation so I want to just provide a quick moment for any comments to happen go ahead well I just I want to say thank you to the staff and I want to point out that came to me as you were summarizing Ashley 2024 participants now I'll be the first to say that I wanted to see more representation and given groups but you know the fact that we had that kind of turnout is a testament to what the district has worked on for at least two administrations and is it

[00:14:00]
enough no we're never satisfied and we shouldn't be but I think it's important it's significant and it needs to be we need to build on it but it's also noteworthy because I had a moment again today when I called I forget what school and I heard our superintendent speaking Spanish and you know that may not be a big deal to other people but it's a hell of a big deal to me because that was my first language it was not easy to access School often times and it was a smaller school I was very fortunate my school district was you know two high schools and and very District this

[00:15:00]
it's a it's a big deal and I'll leave out my other so at least two administrations have made it possible for us to get that kind of turnout so thank you all thank you all any other comments before we move on go ahead board member Peterson's people who are not in this building don't realize how hard people hear work and all of the other work that everyone on staff has to do did not stop during this process that everything they did everything that was done to pull together the listening sessions and all of the Outreach the compilation of data was above and beyond what is already a heavy lift

[00:16:00]
so I'm just a huge thank you to everyone for making it possible thank you any others good everybody's ready to start going I'll just also add thank you so much too feedback from community members as we were walking out the door was pretty much thank you for hosting and I will say I was the nervous one because the first school was going to be over at Rio Grande and I think we were going to do it within two weeks and and it was it was so well received we are adding tables at the last minute to get more people there so so I know a hard that the team worked and I really appreciate but everybody did and in my session with Ashley she you know she definitely noted that out to me as well and saying it's just how remarkable it was and in terms of what we were able to pull off in a short period of time because we did do it as quickly as possible and I was nervous thinking that we were going to have you know as good as a

[00:17:00]
I would have loved for it to have been more I think everybody wants it to be more but I think it gives us a good Baseline and it's a good place to start so I think with that we'll just continue and I think superintendent you're on the hot seat period because I thought it would feel a little weird for her to hear us and this is the first time doctor here and I have had an opportunity to present together so if we're a little choppy please forgive us we're going to move forward I feel good what you have in front of you is a very short document we were advised early in the coaching with the great City schools that this tonight's presentation

[00:18:00]
the best and if we could keep it under 10 that would be acceptable so we made acceptable tonight and it was hard because there's a lot of things we can talk about first area we were instructed was to review data with you and I got to be honest there was a temptation to roll this app for team out to start digging deep into the data again and do the dog and pony but the reality is we've done that with you and you guys have listened to it you're intimately aware of the data points and we can get into a whole lot of stuff if you want but I thought it was just really important to review probably some of the major data points that have impact so on your first slide you going to see the percentage of students ready for kindergarten this is an observational tool it's done within the first few weeks of school it's a little subjective but there are some things that they are specifically looking for to to charge and you can

[00:19:00]
you see that about 64% of our students are enrolled ready for kindergarten we wonder if the states push for early childhood education if you won't start seeing some improvements in that and of course with our work that we may be doing with the Early Childhood centers in the future if we're not going to be able to help ourselves but there is a general sense that students who come to APS are a little behind and in some cases they're quite a bit behind this simply says this gives a percentage of kids who are enrolled ready to go to kindergarten do they have the supports at home to make the advances they need do they have all the tools and resources in place just doesn't say anything to that it just simply says these kids as they are where the next page we look at the percentage of third grade students proficient in English language arts and we

[00:20:00]
specifically selected third grade for a number of reasons and what we know is that only about a third of our students across the district are proficient in English language arts as assessed by the NASA we have seen variations of that numbers throughout the years depending on the assessment but it's never been a number that anybody was going to run up a flagpole and and dance around with joy it's an area of improvement something we're concerned about and we also wanted to look at third grade because that is a pivotal point where our students are transitioning from learning to read to reading to learn and so we know at that point there's very specific strategies that we put in place to ensure that they can have success in their opportunities to learn in their further grade levels

[00:21:00]
10 3rd grade seems to be the grave that everyone points to and says this is really a pivotal point and I think that's what the research demonstrates why that's a big part of it but there is a lot of talk about third grade so we looked at third grade your next slide stays in third grade I do this really just for to make a point on the next slide but we want to look at the percentage of students who are proficient in mathematics and third grade so about 22% of our third grade students overall you can see that across the board there's variations looking at the different subgroups not surprisingly some groups are performing better than others many are performing significantly better and and that's something that we need to be aware of as we move forward but I pulled that slide for was really to look at 8th grade goes down a little bit you know

[00:22:00]
but you start to see some shifts in some of the sun some of the groups don't move at all some move a little bit English Learners dip a lot I think it says something about our system and we're doing some research on to why that might be we understand that there's been some changes to the access test and how students enter and exit is changed so there is a we believe a correlation between those two items but this really got us thinking in the terms of the formation of the goals and the interim goals how we would start to look at things and we began to realize the beginning to realize we know that we need to improve instructional materials there needs to be more consistent assessment and reaction to that assessment and support for people around that so in line

[00:23:00]
with what we heard from the community and in line with what our data presented us with somebody I just wanted to emphasize 8th grade specifically why 8th grade just to note that 8th grade is the last grade for the students are taking the namassa state Assessments in reading or an Ela and Mathematics before they transition to high school so as we move on we begin to really start thinking about what would some high levels of third grade students scoring proficient

[00:24:00]
what's the weather like numbers there but just to clarify when we visited with her she said that we have one Baseline data point and that we can't project grow until we have a trend line so we need a second test assessment to get a trend line and then we'll be able to project the actual number so we will have a number for you as soon as we have the results off the next and a SSA I'm just looking at developing a predictive model to look at our insurance assessments to see how many of our students are demonstrating proficient or advanced in the interim assessments as well as the summer of assessment versus who is not so that we can utilize that date in a predictable way that'll be helping us when we are beginning to look at the end of Assessments we'll talk about those more videos

[00:25:00]
but how do we know how well what what's the correlation in terms of success on Masa compared to success on the interim assessment and that's what sappers now working on so we'll have a predictive model hi leverage do not come number two is to increase the percentage of 8 students scoring proficient or above in mathematics is measured by then and Masa again as we remind you they should a new state assessment of May 2226 for every minute now so we are waiting for second Point develop our trend line and give you your five model student goal outcome 3 so we danced around a little bit with this with the council we really have a hard time in terms of some of the data points for the high school students they don't take my so they take the SAT

[00:26:00]
and that can sometimes be a struggle one of the things the state measures is on is graduation rate the council has suggested the graduation rate may not be the greatest measurement because sometimes that is hindered by force is far outside any students control or adults control but we have proposed a concept of looking at an increase to increase percentage of second year students who are on track for their on-time graduation so high school is something that I really focused on and when we look on average National League 40% of our 9th graders fall off track for graduation after their 9th grade year and we know that the likelihood of them dropping out after they fall off track greatly increases because then they fall into the credit recovery cycle and

[00:27:00]
that is not always the best way to to learn also looking at you know at Algebra 1 is usually what 9th graders take and that's got to be like a gatekeeper class for 9th grade because that's the first non arithmetic math class that students are faced with and it also comes with some research has shown that comes with some negative feelings intimidation anxiety so it gives this will give us the opportunity to close the look at those 9th grade courses making sure that our students and staff have the supports and resources that they need make sure that we have strong alignment instruction and assessment and there's a lot of research around that if you wanted to further look into that doctor Elena's worth from the urban Education Institute from the University of

[00:28:00]
Chicago does has a ton of research on that Algebra 1 being where students start to fall off track for graduation so that is going to be one of I guess are are lead measures when we look at how we are approaching this specific goal and finally when we went to the community sessions we really listened to the teachers we listen to the staff who are quite interested in some of the responses of community members and the students I'm having the advantage of really listening to the students they talked a lot about the need for soft skills they talked a lot about the need for horses that prepare them for post High School whether that was a career or college and I just want to feel more aware of some of the things they talked about included financial literacy horses that can be in capsulated in some of our course but

[00:29:00]
what times are picked up elsewhere and we understand that one of the things that people like about APS is that we offer a wide spectrum of courses and of interesting things for their kids to get involved with they can sort of pursue that so our fourth goal was to look at the percentage of students that are doing what is called a computer and in the CTE World someone who takes 3 years or four years of a course pattern is a computer that's interesting data it tells us a lot about the kid and the kid to really pursue something that they are interested in more about so he took that concept and we've expanded it we know people want the Dual language program they really want to buy lingual program so we want to see what we can do as we can continue to expand what's going to happen if we do open another language School in the community so the

[00:30:00]
who are Coronado can pursue it all the way through 8th grade and her high school with that much experience we included a dual credit kids who are interested in really getting a jump on their college career and can they get two or three or four credits and dual credit JROTC is a course that many of our students really find valuable and that they want to be a part of and so they pursue that and it speaks to concept of Engagement and being a part we know that our students more successful when they feel like they're part of something quite frankly when they bounce in and out of classes they don't ever really commit to of study they never really get that sense of I belong to this finally we also included the Fine Arts Visual Arts and Athletics because many of our students that's the connection for them to keep them in school to keep them engaged

[00:31:00]
we would really like to do is try to get more kids who are little little lost and try to find their Niche now some of the drawbacks on this one that I found out about is it's very difficult to chart everything okay so for example if you're on a speech and debate team and you love speech and debate and you are learning to speak better than any human has never spoken we may not be able to chart that because it may not be a class at school but they so they're going to be some areas we just can't grab at least easily but these were the ones that we looked at was that these are courses these are things that came up repeatedly in the community a pretty good job and we may do a good job but we want to not throw

[00:32:00]
out in search of of solving all the problems so these areas those are the four outcomes we are are suggesting you guys are welcome to whittle it down to three whatever you want but this is what we brought forth our suggestion for interim goals if you pursue Martinez the concept here is that we can improve instruction for those who are struggling for all if we can do it better job with our struggling groups we can bring them forward so it could look like in this goes back to the predictive model that Dr Segundo was mentioning first grade Native American students will prove efficiency 24/205 now we need to get a little bit more

[00:33:00]
data on how accurate that growth model really shows us how much better they're doing or if it really predicts that they're going to get to grade level proficiency but this really works well with some of the work we began this this past year on the instructional walks that I described to you where we're sending time with the principles and we have a data dashboard with them and we show them you've got this many students in this group and you've got this many students in this subgroup and they're not proficient where's the blend where's the Democrat demographic impact where can you get one kid two checks if you move them up you know and it really will help us to focus the the intervention if we can get really good day and really work with the schools on working on those instructions so

[00:34:00]
we did recommend that we include African-American students in the interim goals not necessarily identified in Yazi Martinez but it's a subgroup that we shouldn't ignore him and impossible guardrails this was really hard for me I'm going to be honest because it's a concept that I spend a great Review Office school buildings are classrooms that are missing with District wide vision values and goals we need to you guys made it very clear that it's not just in the classroom

[00:35:00]
I have to really be brave and and not make modifications the superintendent will not take approaches which neglect the cognitive and academic development social and emotional development or the physical and mental well-being of students there was some concern about some zip codes doing better than others or resources you know not flowing equitably and equally you know based off student and so we are putting the guardrail in to make sure that we can be held accountable to make sure that we're not putting in policies that will harm kids superintendent will not allow curriculum and instruction that is not District aligned and approved District research base challenge it's going to take some effort but we have high quality instructional materials

[00:36:00]
we need to use them and we need to use them consistently and we need to use them across the board do they always have to be used every minute of the day maybe not but we we certainly can allow Freedom as far as supplemental materials we can certainly allow me to feed them around how we work with kids but we need to utilize these approved curriculums and and use them well so that's something I think it's a good guardrail superintendent will not allow resources to be allocated without transparently communicating how the allocations are bassline sufficient to operate all schools this one needs a little bit of wordsmithing I think I was trying to capture your sense of budgeting and your sense of money flowing to schools in a way that they can function

[00:37:00]
fairly and that they have the resources that they need doesn't necessarily mean equally in the sense that everybody gets the same lump sum right but some schools have needs that we just need to make sure that we are clear about it and not not not not not not doing it behind anyone's back or not being transparent about it and this last one I just don't know how we don't have something along these lines so many people are worried about school safety so many people are worried about you know just what's happening and in the country in the the nation so the superintendent may not allow a breach of safety policies and procedures that result in an increase in threatening or unsafe circumstances for students and staff so miss pause that is as I told you

[00:38:00]
so with that we stand open to be part of the work and part of the conversation and so I believe Ashley you will help facilitate our conversation from this point forward correct okay yes ma'am but that I can so first of all thank you I think we're good now at least on my end you're coming through it seems to be around turning on my camera and turning it off but I think we're good now so I'd like to first of all say thank you for that presentation superintendent

[00:39:00]
exceeded expectations and and with the self-awareness that you and the district leaders have presented with those guardrails or with the proposed areas that the board May focus on or may choose to focus on so for the next purpose for the purpose of continuing this conversation and getting into the nitty-gritty I want to go through the board and I'm going to I'm going to ask you the first first of several more difficult questions so like to start with probably at the end with board member Gonzalez and just work our way down and I would like for you to I would like for you to answer this question what are two student outcomes that we may focus our goals on that is a high priority for me and my interpretation

[00:40:00]
of the feedback that we heard from superintendent Elder so just in what the student needs assessment that says not taking into account yet what the community feedback says what are two student outcomes that we may focus our energy our resources our time on that would be a high leverage area for us to consider so starting with superintendent Gonzales I'm sorry board member gets all of us so I would say improving Proficiency in math and reading and y'all can just go down the line and while you're talking I'm going to be taking notes

[00:41:00]
there's a whole lot of conversation that needs to go into that but that's pretty straightforward we'll have lots of conversation tonight and I would say improving proficiency of course in reading and math with the focus at elementary as I know it's really difficult when you have a child who can't read and they're in sixth grade and you didn't catch him in elementary school it gets more difficult as time goes on plus we don't really have reading teachers at that level you know so I think that we really need to focus on on those young girls early literacy thank you for Aragon and I

[00:42:00]
I really want to highlight that you you made it very specific on S2 which students and so that is perfectly acceptable if other board members would like to follow suit on that in that line of thinking about the bar has been set higher I mean I'm also in agreement that you know proficiency definitely in reading and math I do like the the notion of like if we start early and we we do that well I like the focus on Elementary and I also like looking at that in the middle school so we don't drop them out you know before they get to high school proficiency for for mathematics and can I ask a clarifying question is

[00:43:00]
play different than reading cuz I cuz I'm hearing proficiency and reading and math and my question is is reading a subset of ela great question yeah that's actually go ahead you can answer this better than I can play cards but it's basically it sets of reading proficiency level okay so basically to align with the assessment that's available to us okay so then just to clarify then yeah I agree on Proficiency in ela and Mathematics and I know we're only supposed to do too but my third is also see to eat okay thanks so just to get away with everyone else said you know I think that has to continue to remain a priority is focusing on reading and math and I will say what board members and said specifically with our younger age groups because we all know that lays the foundation

[00:44:00]
104 what's going to continue on in later years but I'm saying that but I'm struggling with the Middle School aspect too as that's coming to mind but you know where I'm at I'm trying to think how how to put this how are kids come to us in particular American Indians black Hispanic English Learners come to us ready to learn and then have a 38 percent drop an 18th drop of 40% drop something is

[00:45:00]
speak well it can't just be about proficiency because they came to us proficient in something and so it's more complicated than just proficiency so how do we what language do we construct that says that we will take them from their proficient kindergarten cells it's got to be developmentally appropriate right and but we cannot have a job and and that gets into

[00:46:00]
yeah I got to see myself in that curriculum I got to see myself in that classroom and can somebody give us I mean I don't know what else but I agree that we need to focus on proficiency but it's a little more complicated I think we need to focus on the gifts they come with and getting them Beyond I don't know that's and I want to be clear it's absolutely fine that you don't know how to articulate that and this is actually a great a great next place for us to go so everyone across the board everyone that said math and reading congratulations you're all focused on two very specific areas of

[00:47:00]
student outcomes and they're all the same this may be the first time I've ever witnessed this so congratulations expanding the conversation expanding the conversation board member Dominguez takes me to our next question is is proficiency the metric that you as the board would like to create create space for you to have that conversation we lost you on the question so the question is is proficiency the best area for you also focus on and there there is no right or wrong answer this is literally a decision that you as a board have to have to come to together as a consensus that you should

[00:48:00]
I think clearly that this is that is the metric that was proposed by Administration but this this is definitely a place and the time to have that conversation about what does it mean for students to be proficient and if proficiency isn't the metric you want to look at what what would you like to look at what are your other options what are their Solutions do you have to provide I like to respond to that so I think I feel very strongly 100% the proficiency is the best area to focus on I also don't think it's the only area and so in the context of being given permission to propose to goals I proposed math and reading certainly I think we absolutely need to focus on social and emotional development whole Child Development and I would push for that to be

[00:49:00]
I also would push for a third goal related to Social and emotional development or School climate but that wasn't your initial question but I do think there are ways to to say that to say and I've looked at other District plans the District of Columbia has the goal that says X number of students will feel loved and supported or something like that they use the Panorama student survey to measure it and they align that to a lot of other things so I 100% think we have to focus on student outcomes we cannot go back to our community and say we listen to you if we don't do that and I don't think we can speak with a straight face to families and say we're not going to help your child learn to read so I do think we have to do that and again it's not the only thing thank you

[00:50:00]
go ahead I don't think anyone has ever said we're not going to teach your child to read I think going back to board member dominguez's issue you know there's a difference in assessments and I think this is the obstacle that faces us and as I look at guardrails the absence of addressing cultural a cultural students are in that second grade that because and this is this is partly hypothesis and partly knowing kids that students come to us in as kindergarten entries being whole people they are seeing by their families

[00:51:00]
Community seen by their peers around them as whole total human beings and then we go about making very clear the mismatch between who that is until you can sit down on the first week of school and instead of the computer and take the ice do Ice Station and show proficiency and so there is this automatic immediate sudden Schism between the whole whole human being that they come to us with and what the academic expectations are and we give them very little time to grow in that so you know partly it's what assessment are we looking at and how are we dealing with it what are we asking kindergarten children

[00:52:00]
so I think that's in our mission needs to be how do we take them as this whole human being keep them as a whole human being and and give them the skills that they need to be academically successful in this Society in the school district but we but as soon as we make that two separate things we missed the boat and how we support the students who come with the biggest mismatch between who they are as they're holding with their family and who they are asked to be the second they walk in that kindergarten door and so I think it's not that I disagree with having the proficiency goals it's really and truly concerned about how we set up everything from the internet are they being successful or we can already label them as being

[00:53:00]
efficient in those skills and and how do we move them one of the things that we always struggled with as a staff looking at it proficiency rates is that we could show based on assessments that overall virtually every student that walked in the door each year that they were with us despite what despite what the assessment for the fact that students screw more than a year and APS they would grow a year and a quarter sometimes a year and a half occasionally two years but every time the goalposts moved so even if even if

[00:54:00]
the week the first week they walk into kindergarten the goal post for what it meant to be proficient always kept moving and so they may have grown a year and a quarter but they still didn't hit that proficiency Mark and so I mean I think that's one of the things in the inputs and outputs document that we were giving me food for thought what do we really want that to look like because lots of data showed that the more kids the longer kids were with us the better they did not the worst and so how and it still doesn't mean that we get them where we want them to be but I think that if we start off with that initial premise of them not being whole people we set the

[00:55:00]
we set up every relationship that goes on in school for failure instead of really figuring out how do we answer that so I think that having I am in total agreement that I think we need to have an actual goal that holds us accountable to the social emotional well-being of students and that has to have very strongly that cultural component of who they are when their whole human beings when they walk in the door how do we keep them as whole human beings thank you okay so just to speak the same same language so when we're talking about goal posts who are they moved by the adults so that behavior or something that has to change it's not the kids moving the goalposts it's the adult

[00:56:00]
what are moving the goalposts and then it's adults that are changing you know the tests and so then we come in we have a new test and so if we want things to really change then we as adults have to stop moving the goalposts so I agree there with with member Peterson the other thing is I kids have got to learn how to read and write and do math the very best that they possibly can now do I believe as you all know that a test measures all of that I know it doesn't and I would say as a teacher I did not send 67% of my kids on to the next grade 67 of them were not noted grade level so that's why I say I know a test doesn't say everything but if anybody out there can tell me how we can measure proficiency better I am all in if it's not just going to be by a test I'm good with

[00:57:00]
that but right now it seems like that's all that we have but I don't know if this is I mean one of the things that I was looking at was looking at I know that students that fail Algebra 1 are likely to drop out so if we had that is something that we looked at in math and I know there are 8th graders that take you know algebra one and we looked at those kids instead of you know a test score we look at how many kids got to see her better and we improve that so we don't always have to look at you know a test score to know their proficient to me and I never have got this why they have to take a test when they have already passed all their classes through high school and then they have to pass a test to get you know a diploma and that just never made sense never made sense to me but if you all have a better way to measure what teachers see I'm all in

[00:58:00]
I forgot the question what was the question is proficiency the best area to focus on proficiency to to the two Educators who have been in the classroom and know what that what that looks like for you I mean and I do agree with board member Gonzalez 2 around the whole issue of social emotional and a whole child approach because we do lose that somewhere I think we start kindergarteners are assessed in a different way because they're assessed as from a different observational tool that has nothing to do with proficiency on like I mean we don't we don't test them on their ability to name their colors or I don't think we do I don't know if we can change it I mean you know so it's like

[00:59:00]
it's more of a proficiency I mean it's it's an assessment really around you know their health their well-being their you know their ability to to sort of come into a class but I wholeheartedly agree that we are kids need to learn how to read and write do language all of those things and do math they absolutely need to be able to do all those things I just don't know if the high stakes test alone is the way to assess that we've made progress because I think you know I am sad when I see the the scores and you see how they just don't they're not they're not testing well because that's what it is telling me is that the test is that they just didn't test well is part of that because they didn't understand the instruction enough or some of the materials I don't know I don't know that it's just that but I do want to be able to tell the

[01:00:00]
unity in some way but I think parents more importantly want to know if their student is making growth you know is there student learning and is there you know are they making progress that's the most important part and a student is not just judged by the end of the nmsa the Namaste or that test or the SAT test at the end it's really that performance all along and it's really being able to sort of getting back I think to what everybody's talking about like this whole child you know how did this child just actually engage you know commit to coming to class being in being engaged being fully you know part of the process so proficiency is important to me but not I don't think it's the only I don't know how you test it because I'm not I'm not an educator I mean it's not my it's not my background but it just seems like one assessment alone is not

[01:01:00]
the you know the skill of our students so I know surprise I absolutely think that proficiency needs to be a standard that we use and one thing that I think kind of strikes me is the reason that we need to use this assessment or proficiency as an assessment is because that's the tool that we have available to us we have the New Mexico and SSA tool that is available now to president of his point we also do have assessments as we move along we write as we're and I'm looking at Dr Segura as we move along with focusing more on to our kids know the standards we are going to know that as we move along and so I think some of these conversations are

[01:02:00]
discussion of what are the interim goals going to be because the end goal absolutely we have to know if our kids are proficient in ela and math and we have the tools available to be able to do that along the way as we're learning whether or not they know the standards we have the wrong formative assessments summative primitive is along the way thank you so I was right formative assessment we also have the ability to track that and and and and and and possibly those are different assessments to what everybody is saying you can look at other ways to assess whether or not they're meeting the standards But ultimately with our overall goal of student outcomes we have to test for proficiency and I also want to kind of throw in here

[01:03:00]
I I I I I I I I I I feel strongly that we need to leave here tonight because we did tell the public that we would do this I think we do need to leave with some numbers in here some actual metrics so I'll just throw that on the table and I think that was the question right proficiency I'm not moving on to anything else right now okay so I'm going to throw this statement out there and then I'm probably going to backtrack a little bit so proficiency is the destination and we've all heard this and growth is a journey you know really trying to figure out because I believe we proficiency is the metric for us to measure you know the success of our student in a way because in at some point too I'm even going granted I didn't teach elementary mine was Pre-K I feel like I'm responsible for the Pre-K kiddos that were proficient but I like

[01:04:00]
measurement cuz we had to do assessments beginning mid and end of the year but the way we measured skills was based on Master like we measured the assessment based on Mastery of skills like we actually observed them doing you know math and reading it wasn't an actual assessment but it was something that was Hands-On to determine if they were ready for the next step and based on the curriculum and lesson plans that were developed for each student and part of me even questions to is the assessments that were providing do we need to go back and look at on how it's distributed at administered and think of a way because I even think of my own kids when they had to do the test many of them just circled bubbles if I'm being completely honest they went through cuz it was long and it was tiresome and they wanted to be over and they just started circling and they were all seasons you know because our exe is the best option

[01:05:00]
and part of me even wonders like how many of the students are really taking into understanding the importance of the test that they're taking do we need a break it down do we need to put it in shorter segments to where it doesn't seem as overwhelming for them because I'm not in any way advocating to get away from the the tool that we use to measure proficiency but I'm questioning more how it's administered you know so that's kind of where I'm at 2 because I really believe even if I even think back my time in school like it was I hated those tests but I'm pretty confident that I mastered the skills to be able to move on and you know do what was next so it's just thinking of a way that we can distribute it and administer to where our students understand the importance and I think we were missing that stuff because once we do I think we would actually see a

[01:06:00]
in some of our scores but to go back to what board member Dominguez said earlier with seeing how they're coming into us at kindergarten and quickly by 3rd grade those scores have dropped dramatically we have to be able to recognize that too and put a plan in place because ultimately the only thing that changed in my opinion was their school environment and we have to recognize that to be able to give them the support and we have to Pivot from what we've always done to get a different outcome so I don't know if that said anything but I actually have I actually before we move on to Birds I want to sit with some of what you said board member tapioca Romero so you talked about the difference between actually

[01:07:00]
executing the assessment so how you know taking the snapshot that's that's an important part of the thing and it's the board's job to Monitor and to understand what the data says when you look at this information but you also hit on something that I think is the next logical place for this conversation to go in and that is as a board what are the things that we can control what are the things that we can influence and how can we how can we do how can we influence these things so you talked about and actually remind me what you said around changing the way that the assessment is executed or administered and tell me and and I would like for you to think about what what are the things that you as a board remember the board the board

[01:08:00]
what outcomes are going to be your focus and then you monitor those outcomes along the way so as you were pursuing this conversation tonight how many you frame your work to actually influence change in those areas and what are some steps that you may do as you move forward in actually monitoring and having these monitoring conversations just just briefly we don't have to spend a lot of time on it but I think it is an important conversation to just acknowledge the board's role and be really really clear about what the things are that you as a whole how you can create the conditions from the top of the organization for these changes to happen so Ashley is that like the next question because we still have board member Dominguez on the end it didn't answer the original first question it's not it's not

[01:09:00]
how can how can you as a board member influence influence the areas that you just mentioned around like the actual administration of the test for all the sake of transparency I'll explain a little thing that I did so I reached out to several charter schools that I saw in our area that still meet like they have a demographic that is you know minorities that low income that still have a lot of the challenges that most of our APS students but they're coming out to be proficient with their test scores so I asked what are you doing differently you know then what we do and you know on our end and most of it what they've explained to me is just again the way it's administered meaning the time that it takes to go through the test they'll even separate students that might need a read

[01:10:00]
part of the question when to allow them to fully comprehend of what's being asked versus them just sitting and tuning into the computer and go through it I know we have that option but we don't have enough staff is what I'm hearing to offer that to all of our students so that was a big difference that I'm saying so part of it is just going back like can we offer that as an option can we offer smaller groups that are joined together versus everybody has this block schedule in your in a room for an hour and a half two hours taking a test you know so that was something that came across my mind because I'm like how I don't I'm not here to reinvent a new process but let's just learn from other schools that are doing it right that are based with the same challenges we are and what are they doing right that we can all work together for the betterment of our students so nothing complicated just

[01:11:00]
yeah so I thank you thank you for adding that additional clarification so I want to take a moment before we move on to Josefina which we're going to I haven't forgotten about you but this is an important reason to stop to stop and kind of remember what the boards actual Authority is and what you were able to do within within your role as board members and so I want to measure expectations to ensure that everyone is very very clear that you are special for this conversation but even as a whole that when it comes to the strategies around how the testing is administered how these things are the actual who's in the house and the wise are things

[01:12:00]
that are explicitly the superintendent his administration's job to they have to make those decisions because they are the educational experts even though everyone on this board is highly accomplished has expertise in all of these areas and and I know that I know that you know that but because we have more people who may be watching members of the public it's just an important distinction to make the reason that I am carrying us through this conversation is because this conversation can what it can do is it can inform the superintendent of the of the different priorities of his board and the different directions that you all maybe that you're mine be going in as you're making these decisions so I just want to make it clear that you're not having these aren't just arbitrary

[01:13:00]
conversations that you're having that something will actually be done with this and I'm taking copious notes as you're talking but on so on that note thank you so much for letting me pick on you for for a minute Crystal cuz I know you love to be put on the spot so all right let's move on to Josefina board member of Dominguez let's go back to the question and looking specifically when looking at student outcomes through the lens of math and English language arts or math and reading we're discussing measuring proficiency versus some other metric and I know I know you've shared you shared on this but just kind of a final thought for you and then I'm going to post another question and you can go you can go down the other direction so you're not going to get an argument okay so full disclosure I was an apt shirt I know about

[01:14:00]
the importance of proficiency and I'm also a proponent of April or or but I'm partial to AP because I think their institutes are one of the best professional developments that I ever attended and teachers do know the difference because when I wasn't in an AP Institute I was bored out of my mind and doing other things on you know grading or ignoring the presentation so yes so proficiency is absolutely important and I say that as an English as a second language student who struggled with English but it brought me back to before I can say yes all that is important it brought me back to Early Childhood literacy that has to be the

[01:15:00]
and that's got to be part of our goals because I'm looking at these kindergarten ready for kindergarten scores and it just verifies that kids come to us with something but but they come into either a an unwelcoming and maybe not intentionally but it's it's an unwelcoming or even hostile climate and the more we can more resiliency we can give them in early childhood like I'm looking at American Indians 53 percent we need that up

[01:16:00]
62% 66 for other minority groups English language Learners are 56 students with disabilities 45 we need to give them a boost even before they we start talking about proficiency so yes proficiency is important but equally important is a welcoming a welcoming environment and I can speak to that because I was one of those kids that got spanked for not knowing what the teacher had said and I went into the bathroom and giggled and what not and then I was thrown into a all of us because we were all Spanish people and then we went into a welcoming environment another classroom where

[01:17:00]
learn how to dance and sing like an escuelita you know it makes sense but I think I can add to this conversation about is Early Childhood literacy it has got to be a goal somehow and I know that when I talk about Multicultural climates Multicultural education are not going to improve unless the Multicultural climate and education is a part of it thank you so much thank all of you so much but especially thank you

[01:18:00]
very very important start to the work that we're doing tonight so I'm going to come back with the next question but before we do that I want to remind you all that while you're a seven-member board you're actually an eight member governance team your governance team is comprised of the board and the superintendent and I think that it would be a failure on my end to not include superintendent Elder in this conversation so Scott in relation to the conversation around proficiency for for ELA and for math what what do you have to add to the conversation and what insights do you have that might help the help the board or add value to the conversation before we move on to our next student outcomes

[01:19:00]
do you like to focus on well members of the board thank you for your comments are certainly a wide-ranging and informative some of it though we have in there and I do believe we could actually respond with some tweaks you talked about the whole child that I think the concept and we did try to pick that up on guardrail number two but you're right the lack of a cultural component to that is almost intentional in the sense that we weren't quite sure how to phrase it is it is a cultural background is it a cultural experience we knew you would pick up on that and anticipated some some guidance on that word smithing so but we certainly could add that we of course have there's examples across the country of of other types of of goals maybe along these lines the reason we picked proficiency I think is mostly practical my job is really to drive

[01:20:00]
outcomes and and to get things done the state measures is on proficiency it doesn't measure us on growth the difficulty if it was me and I and a perfect world I can make it happen we'd have a beginning middle and we would measure growth for students cuz then we could really talk to them about what they're doing because you know you have some kids that were exploding and just making tremendous progress you'd have some kids who were just getting it done and making their ears growth and if something were struggling and we really would have I think a much clearer picture but it's much more difficult for us to do that and to track so that was really just in terms of what can we do in the current setting with the tools we have and what's expected of us that was where we lived to proficiency there are other things that were brought up as far as

[01:21:00]
danced with that we weren't the problem is they're not always in algebra one when they come in right I think you sort of alluded to that and some of them take it in 8th grade and we've got something to take in 7th grade and some don't take it until 10:30 so it's a hard it's not a it's not a clean cohort there's some issues with with that one but we we could look at that again so I do think from our perspective and please correct me there was a rationale behind laying out proficiency versus something the public understands so that was sort of where we were coming from and we can adjust guard rails to pick up Elementary

[01:22:00]
members of the board I do appreciate all the comments in our work to try to listen to all the input and to incorporate everyone's values of what we feel are important for our students we know that when students are proficient when they graduate they're going to have successful outcomes in their life and so it is not something to be taken lightly and I think that having a strong focus on proficiency is the goal is really important I agree with board member Mueller article on in that the goalposts do change often and it's by adults I was telling superintendent Elder that we have as a state we have switched some of Assessments for our students over three times in the past four years and so

[01:23:00]
we don't have Baseline data that we can lean on and when we look at that when the park came into play there was a lot of resistance and negative connotations around the rigor of it that assessment and testing became this enemy and it shouldn't be it's something to inform us as Educators families students and going to what board member tapeo Romero stated that as adults we do have to message what that means in our classrooms as a district in our schools to reframe the conversation to let our students and families know why we're doing these assessments and the importance behind them to gauge where their students are so we can better support them and their growth and learning toward proficiency toward graduation so I think all of these

[01:24:00]
things are really important and then also looking at how I really liked board member Gonzalez is you know that question from the District of Columbia how many students feel loved respected supported valued Challenge and how we measure that we I want you to know that we have looked we are looking into Panorama and Rhythm to to measure how can we measure SEL because SEL means different things to different people but ultimately how do our students feel in their schools in those classrooms and that's where we're really encouraging those you know our teachers I I know that they're working really hard but really emphasizing the importance of relationships and building those caring relationships so that every student and every school has at least one adult that they can go to if they need help or support but I think you know looking I think about like the opportunity to learn

[01:25:00]
survey that we gave once a year like how can we get that student input and feedback more frequently to be able to measure over time is it improving do our students feel better and safer and valued and challenged in their classes in schools so I think all of that is really helpful for us as we refine the goals thank you both so much for that that additional feedback so let's go back to board members we have talked about math and English or English language arts or reading however the board would like to phrase it let's move on and talk about the other some of the other areas of focus so the superintendent has recommended two additional high-leverage High need areas around graduation rate and around the not the graduation rate it's

[01:26:00]
actually students who are on track for graduation which is which is a different metric than the graduation rate and it is what we would call a higher higher quality goal because it is when you measure graduation rates you're starting to you post the risk of unintended consequences but this so focusing on students who are actually on track for graduation that opens up the possibility for a lot of different ways that the superintendent may present that information and the metrics that the board made her along the way so let's turn our attention to these two these two areas of focus so one is around second-year students who are on track for graduation and the

[01:27:00]
last one is around postsecondary Readiness and students who are completing a third and fourth year sequences along a multitude of different options for for programs and classes and courses that could help them be better prepared as they move on to their next phase in life whether that be college or going into the workforce being prepared for careers or trade school or even into a military leadership so let's think about those two student outcomes specifically but also I want to provide this is an opportunity because for you to maybe suggest other student outcomes that are important to you that have stood out during this process as you reviewed the student Trend data and you've reviewed the

[01:28:00]
feedback from the community I want to just highlight briefly before before we move on that the main areas that came back as Trends from the community feedback we're around post-secondary Readiness it included soft skills actually soft skills was the highest behind English language I think it was English language arts and then soft skills or maybe I may have It reversed in my head so you've got soft skills English language arts critical thinking and cultural competency so I want to be specific that this is this is student outcomes this is what students know or what they're able to do so this is not when I talk about cultural competency it's not adults being

[01:29:00]
call Shirley competent towards students it is students having those Cultural Literacy skills around their their interaction with the world around them so how a student is able to perform or interact with cultural competency through their own journey and their education so let's start with board member Jimmy Jazz and again you can pick from one of the ones that have been mentioned or even just named another student outcome that's important to you so two that are not English or math student outcomes that are important to you well so the way I looked at

[01:30:00]
and I'm talking about the vision frequency by session chart it's page 4 of 7 in Albuquerque board I don't want to move my cursor it's that summer you gave us but soft skills tells me that parents are concerned about their kids well-being and we have to address that it's not my personal choice because I want you know I'm the teacher and by the way by the way when I talked on the remedial English classes and I taught them apology it wasn't exactly what I was teaching the honors kids but

[01:31:00]
was apology and I tried it myself on that so that's where I lean but then I look at what our community said and and it's both it has to be both are our kids our kids are in crisis is not over and and we need to accommodate them we need to give them a safe environment to to work through their traumas at the same time they can't get in the way of other kids learning and that comes back to restore your practices

[01:32:00]
so another thing that struck me that I think we have to address if you go down to Tribal Council I'm so proud because it just verifies why I chose teaching much to the Chagrin of my Administration I might add which speaks to the whole Multicultural education problem that we've got going on I chose to teach ceremony by Leslie Marmon Silko and it was a darn good book hard but there's a way to teach it and what came out of that is I mean it aligns with this critical thinking cultural competency these are higher level thinking

[01:33:00]
and the fact that the tribal council was able to articulate that as the number one issue tells us again what we know that the disconnect that exists kids come to us with something and then we fail them we are at the moment but we are metaphorical in our thinking kids come to us with that so I don't know we have to come up with a goal that brings all of that together I do want to touch on the superintendent of schools high leverage outcome number three though

[01:34:00]
I don't want to use graduation rates and I don't think that's what you're doing here but I can't just be about graduation it's got to be about proficiency rates and how their measured in conjunction with graduation and when we talked about graduation I think that has to be not all kids are going to graduate in four years life happens so let's give them let's look at the 50th and some cases I don't know if I've helped you with I think I have this is really much harder and much richer than I thought it was going to be so I want to I want to stop you for a second don't apologize for speaking your Truth for

[01:35:00]
bring your interpretation of the data and sharing your expertise with this board that is the purpose of this conversation tonight no one is going to be talking too long no one is going to be oversharing anything the reason we're having this conversation tonight is for you all to put all of this out on the table and to reinterpret the feedback that you've received as goals and guardrails so you are spot on with the feedback that you're giving everyone has given an incredible amount of Engagement and information that I am again taking great taking lots of notes on so you you do you speak your truth and I'm going to I'm going to help turn it into something

[01:36:00]
quit saying that AP quality classes are strictly for College Bound kids we need entry-level employees with those skills and so that's why I taught my remedial classes that way I've held back all year long but tonight I'm telling you I am a promoter of April because I think it's going to prepare us for great Carpenters greatly electricians yeah a great work force and and college ready kids and that's it

[01:37:00]
so for me personally I was tossed between soft skills and the critical thinking aspect but I believe I'm leaning more towards soft skills cuz even as I look at my own staff within the people I work with day in and day out and I see that they lack confidence empathy time management and sometimes I will I feel like shaking them and be like if you just believe in yourself do you realize how far you would go or I remember my mom always telling me like bacon until you make it like that is the confidence that you act like you belong there then people believe you belong you know but if you go in doubting who you are all automatically going to be set behind and so I just feel like it's those soft skills that I wish our students

[01:38:00]
what they were capable of regardless of you know where they live regardless of their demographic this is like they're going to go in and kick butt and make it happen and know like nothing's going to stop them but I think many times they go into these situations just completely forgetting who they are as individuals and still trying to figure out their identity and want to be adults but their frontal lobe is not developed yet and the whole sense of reasoning and you know that comes with and even adults struggle with that but I think that is a skill that if our students really mastered we would see a huge difference just in their performance and the outcomes beyond graduation you just hit on a very important distinction that should be made

[01:39:00]
if you have if you have read the backup material if you've read the actual feedback from the community you'll know that the majority the vast majority of the responses related to a soft skills were students having soft skills will help them be successful in their career in college after life so whether that be being able to organize thoughts into into taking notes so that they can be successful in college whether it be the ability to be a productive member of a team or a collaborative member of a work group every single one of those I'm almost certain that everyone of those were focused on building soft skills during from kindergarten

[01:40:00]
listen to high school so that they can be successful after graduation from high school so while we talk about soft skills and I think the superintendent Elder has done a great job at articulating this in your post in the proposed post-secondary Readiness metric that soft skills is not that far off from post-secondary Readiness in order to truly be post second ready for what happens after secondary school you have to be able to have these skills these soft skills to be successful all right moving on to board member Jackson so thank you for saying that because I was going to kind of comment on the fact that I used soft skills differently that the way I interpreted this this response was that it is about how you're going

[01:41:00]
the ability to effectively interact with others once you have graduated and and I do think that that's important whether or not that needs to be one of the ultimate student outcome goals I don't know yet so I'm going to kind of set that aside for a minute and if you don't mind I'll probably bounce a little bit but if I am looking at the student outcome three and four that we have in front of us I'm going to start with four because I'm completely in favor I think we need to have an outcome that specifically addresses post-secondary Readiness I see if we look at the feedback of the The Vision by the session's that was huge and in the conversations that I have had leading up to this point there is a huge desire from

[01:42:00]
our community to not just focus on the kids who are going to graduate and go to college I think we we got on this I don't know for the probably when I was in school is it was never a conversation of what you could be a contractor I wish somebody had told me that because I'm the one that changes the toilets in the house I mean we're oversharing tonight alright so I would have loved somebody to tell me that but it was stem stem stem stem and this is the direction that you have to go so I wish somebody had said that and I think that we're at a critical point now that we need to to focus on that I'm slightly concerned about the wording of of student outcome for it does seem very Broad and at the same time possibly vague but that could be just my understanding of it but it does seem it's it's it seems like that's where you're trying

[01:43:00]
you had all these other things that you wanted to do so we threw it into student outcome for so I would like to keep it but I would like to kind of look at it a little bit more see if we can become a little bit more targeted on that and I think like one of the questions I had was the athletic I don't know how this is a course necessarily but I think that's probably just of course so there's of course okay many of our students pursue that letter of course they'll take three years of an athletic course okay so it's part of their commitment to the team that's actually in the curriculum it's part of being on the team like it doesn't necessarily have to be it's not all teams haven't so it's certainly something we could look at okay we saw it utilized in some districts and not in others so we were putting it in we tried to select elements that we felt were important to our

[01:44:00]
community and Athletics is one of those elements that you'll hear it repeated time and time again Athletics is what my son goes to school athletics is why my daughter is is there she loves this and if she didn't have it now we won't thing is there's some teams that don't have an athletic score so they won't be able to track so it's going to it isn't a little awkward measurement but it is a course okay so that answers my question I mean I'm all for it goes but I didn't realize that it was that there was actually a course there so so anyway I I think do not come for that that kind of encompasses the post-secondary Readiness that is is crucial and that we're asking for student outcomes three I am I'm teetering because I kind of agree I don't think graduation rates should be an outcome because

[01:45:00]
where is the potential of being able to finagle graduation rates but I don't I don't think that that's what this is saying necessarily but I don't think graduation rates necessarily need to be one of the outcomes that we are are measuring a question that I wrote is is this more of a high school assessment is this more where you guys are attempting to to kind of measure some of those like the act and sat assessments and also possibly pull in middle school because I mean we have Ela or we have early childhood and we have potential high school but still we're kind of missing that middle school middle school section anyway so do not come three is a little bit of a

[01:46:00]
it's a different way of looking at without looking at graduation rates but we are rated on and our schools are definitely focused on it allows us to begin the process of early intervention with students who are in danger of not graduating on time but we know is that freshman year is pretty rough for a lot of our kids and the algebra one was mentioned it's our number one gatekeeper course we've got to improve that so the idea is at the end of the second year what has what is the school stepped in work with the kid the family and terms of either Credit Recovery or grade recovery to get him back on track so they come in that year three not feeling even further behind but actually okay I can do this now I am actually going to make it again I understand it it's it's a difficult concept

[01:47:00]
and it's like I don't think it's nebulous but I do understand so I mean I guess I guess my question is which goal based on the visions that we received back for the frequency which which vision is this goal attempting to address well I think it attempts to address the concept that they're actually going to have a post High School experience that's not maybe just the GED though I would really love quite frankly gedz supposed to be equivalent and the you know there are kids at their path that's what we don't we don't include them so we talked to her about the five-year graduates you know way we measured graduation in the state's pretty little different than other states so but it's really trying to address the one that we didn't have much for high school we were wanted to have something that was high school specific

[01:48:00]
and really dealt with the need to keep the children engaged to keep our students in school and give them the opportunities to be successful post High School okay so if I can interpret it back so kind of student outcomes 3 and student outcome for as they're written now both kind of address post-secondary again remember we heard a lot of students and we had we felt that this board has been pretty clear that it would like students to be included in this type of work and the students really focused on they really were not a lot of conversation on the academics give us more about saying we think what we're getting is good they like what they're getting they but they wanted

[01:49:00]
more of these soft skills more opportunities to explore remember all this was done not in a vacuum either because the two weeks ago whenever we were talking about graduation requirements potentially changing you know all that's going to have an impact on this stuff too so but I'm trying to encapsulate some of that student voice and some of that Community desire to have those those elements you're describing now okay definitely more in the in the four and board member for us to Monitor and have a strong Focus so that our High School freshman are not falling through the cracks because they do and we've seen that not just in our district but Across the Nation 9th grade is that pivotal year you're the students are having to earn those Carnegie units that they didn't have

[01:50:00]
Elementary Middle School so it's them having to learn like oh I actually have to earn this Credit in order to move on to that next grade level but it it with this outcome I'm hoping it will shift the the adult Behavior to be focused on that so that we can put systems in place so that these kids don't fall through the cracks and when students do fall behind we have a mechanism to support them and their families and their teachers and I recommendations are based more on student visa on the community feedback Community feedback is useful and I'm really glad you did it it was interesting we learned a lot but we wanted to reflect the community feedback but our recommendations are supposed to be driven by students to graduation is technically

[01:51:00]
which kind of I think you're starting to help me to understand how your delineating between these two which kind of brings me back to the soft skills because I'm hearing you say that this is maybe where soft skills you've kind of drifted into two number three and it brings me back to Dr Segura the handbook that you sent that has the criteria for lifelong for Learners and it kind of addresses the the soft skills that I think is what we're talking about is the the lifelong learner critical thinker strong work ethic respect and others ability to set and Achieve goals self-advocacy and motivation ability to adapt to change growth mindset collaboration and cooperation in 21st century skills

[01:52:00]
I'm wondering I think those are things that were hearing or missing from from our education and so that might this as a suggestion might be a place to add something like that we can play with that one of the things I need to remind the board and this is important I believe as well none of our state assessments have any of those words in them none of our teacher evaluations all around much of that none of our principles are evaluated so there is a larger system that we would argue I think this is where you've been around all night there are flaws in the system and sometimes we things that we value we're not measuring because nobody says they want us to measure them so just remember that's the system that is difficult

[01:53:00]
put press to adapt to because it's not something we were told to be focused on so if I may the reason that we're sitting here is to reflect the values of our community and our community through these surveys and through these interactions told us that soft skills were important so I don't know I don't know we'll figure it out I get it but what I'm saying is I mean we are hearing from the the board members I think are saying we need to look at the whole child we need to look at preparedness and these are some of the things that at least I know my community thinks is important so and then I think just the last thing that I want to before before I move on is and Ashley this is the conversation that you and I had that I just wanted to highlight is

[01:54:00]
we're talking about you know these three to four potential student outcomes but and correct me if I'm wrong Ashley overarching this entire thing and should be stated from the outset is that the overall expectation of all of these is for high rigor and high expectations for all of our students and so that was a conversation that Ashley and I had that that we don't have to write that particularly into our goal because they should touch on all of our goals am I right Ashley yes yes so let me let me respond to that so inside of everything that we're doing right now is the understanding that students will change until adult Behavior change that is that is literally what we are getting getting at through this entire process that

[01:55:00]
I've been going on when you as as you begin to firm up your goals which we are really excited about this conversation and you are a lot further along than I think you understand that you are inside of each goal that you adopt you have to ask the question will this will this go spur change an adult behaviors with with that understanding that adult behaviors have to change if we're going to improve student outcomes so that in and of itself is setting an expectation for for high expectations for the entire system and if there are high expectations for the entire system and they're going to be high expectations for students as well I want to be clear that high expectations should not does not

[01:56:00]
and should not mean unrealistic expectations or unattainable expectations part of a smart goal is the A and smart is attainable you have to be able to actually achieve it even if achieving it requires a change in behaviors So to that end yes absolutely this is this is you creating beginning to create the conditions for high expectations and higher there may be things that you land on where you decide that you know what this isn't the this isn't something that we're doing right now and I think even you know go three is a great example because from what I understand this is not something that is currently being tracked by APS but this literally would require a change in adult Behavior it would require a change in the data that the district is currently tracking that's not commentary on the on whether or not you should adopt that

[01:57:00]
it's just literally an example of something that requires a change in behavior is that response to your question yes ma'am okay so before we move on I want to so I I heard you say a lot the the one or two student outcomes that is an additional additional thing that you think should be focused on is post-secondary Readiness is that it or is it there as well or do you include soft skills with post-secondary I don't know I am 100% on post-secondary Readiness I I I I I do like student outcome for I think it needs to be tweaked a little bit but I don't know like can you come back to me on that because I

[01:58:00]
student outcomes 3 I I see the I can see the need for it from what you're saying but then I wonder can soft skills come in as a guardrail I don't know so yeah let me let me provide a little bit of clarification on that so the way that the superintendent Elder and Dr Segura have presented the the fourth student outcome that they that they put out for you that they said this is a high leverage High needs to not come it actually does encapsulate both soft skills because you're focusing on things like Athletics and Fine Arts and the things that aren't necessarily academic metrics while also so it encompasses both the soft skills the things that create a well-rounded child

[01:59:00]
while also providing opportunities to focus on things that prepare students for Success after After High School through those academic areas so through CTE or foreign language so we can get we can get down and we will get down to the you know the the word smith thing and all of that shortly but just as a high level what I'm hearing is that like post-secondary Readiness is is the focus if we can maybe squeeze some soft skill into that it would be it would be a bonus is that accurate yes thank you sister you know I do want to take us back to what should APS students know and be able to do by the time they graduate and I fill those soft skills are a piece of that

[02:00:00]
so when we look at what superintendent Elder discussed earlier regarding the potential shift in graduation requirements part of that proposal from the state is creating that profile of a graduate and that can be we have a profile of a graduate but we have to make it come alive in every classroom so when it comes back to the messaging what are these soft skills that were working toward and building with our kids so by the time they graduate they're very well versed and they can also do self-assessments on where am I on this where do I need to work those are things that we can put in place as far as those soft skills go to measure them kind of overtime I think the difficulty is how we aggregate that information and then desegregate it to see where we are because that

[02:01:00]
what happened in each classroom but how we make it to the broader District I'm not quite sure but I think that's something that we can continue to discuss because those are things that can happen to be able to address those soft skills that we feel are important to our kids as they transition to postsecondary okay and you're saying that would fall under the current student not come three with or or them okay okay thank you thank you for that clarification what I know cuz I came into this conversation with you Ashley and when I first looked at student outcome number three I was like oh I didn't like it you know because it was like it's just a it's okay and it's important I think it's really important to make sure that we don't have students that sort of fall off the cliff there but

[02:02:00]
what I like about for is that it really gets us closer to thinking about students and sort of moving towards that self-efficacy because it's their testing themselves in places in ways and doing things that maybe just really sort of pushes them into other things and I think it's going to help it helps our students you know to welcome Challenge and to welcome rigor because I think I'm hoping that that's what the goal is right is that we want students to and because doctors who said something really important too is that by this point in time to I'm hoping that we have students at all can do you know some their own student let assessment right in terms of where am I too and sort of creating that ability to be just kind of self-aware a lot more just you know where am I personally those are really critical

[02:03:00]
when I think of soft skills those are the things I think about too is just that young person who's who's out has a plan has a thought feels confident have some self-efficacy and it's a lot like what type of Romero was talking about too it's not like not losing that confidence and that you know this is going to be this is this is me I've got an identity I you know I feel confident in terms of of where I want to be I think I have trouble with just the way that this outcome is worded because I think it's it's like too many and I and I don't know that you know I mean I want students to successfully complete those things I really do because I think those are really good I think it really also helps to set the bar with our adults around setting higher expectations and not having low

[02:04:00]
mutations in some situations and it could help us to sort of look at the data in terms of where the gaps are because I think that's where we're going to start to see that some students may not have access to rigor and that's part of what our problem is in our district I see that happen a lot in the South Valley there's just not as much rigor and the ability to engage in all of this so so as I'm thinking about this I mean I'm just I like the fourth measure I'm not so hot on the on the third measure I think it does help us to sort of I think it's it's a step in the direction of putting kids on that direction of you know it's like sort of assessing themselves learning how to do that you know just to start to really have a plan and

[02:05:00]
thinking about the next step planning process and like what's missing in there too because I think next step is a is a good tool but it's not it's not utilized in a way that I think could be really valuable for young people I've seen it implemented and used really well and my example is with my stepdaughter who you know instructor over at Cibola High School was an excellent process I remember when she came home was tuned in and turned on about her next step plan and we had several dinner conversations about what that meant to her and so I think it has that ability because what we started to see and her was her own assessment of herself and here this is the course I need to take here's what I need to do next and here's the plan for myself and I like the idea of also having a student outcome focus on that High School level I think because it then we're covering from

[02:06:00]
Elementary Middle High School and it helps our community also I think understand sort of like that path right here I'm going from here to here to here and so I'm excited about having the fourth one for me it's just I'm just concerned about some of the wording in the way that it's it's put together but I think it's getting to the to the Crux of where I see that piece where they're talking about soft skills Ready Mix culture even competencies like self competency critical thinking of these pieces in there would it help if we removed all the listings list so we would have the the completers identified elsewhere but just for the purpose of the goal in your concerns about wordiness

[02:07:00]
I don't know yet I'm really I'm struggling with it cuz I like I like where it's at in terms of you know a successful graduate something something about a successful graduate and it's you know as demonstrated by something I don't know I I can't think in my head right now out loud but it's closer to me on this one than it is on three and that's all just stop there and we can do we can do the word smithing in a moment but that's you you've definitely answered the question so let's move on to board member of Peggy what do you think what are what are the other two student outcomes one or two student outcomes

[02:08:00]
are important to you beyond math and English I mean I have I have a whole bunch of thoughts on this I'll try to I'll try to focus so hey you this is the time for you for you to say your piece so so when I mean when I'm looking at outcome three of course graduation is really important but a lot like you know what are we and this is maybe a question that's superintendent Elder can answer is when you're looking at second year students on track for on time graduation and it's based on the metric that they have completed all the courses they need to have completed and passed them by that second year is that correct basically because remember that there are enough there's actually a few credits built into the system for some reason

[02:09:00]
wouldn't necessarily be off track to graduate yeah because there's some wiggle room in our system but you're 99.9% correct okay that's close enough okay so then with our graduation requirements changing and we're going to have less requirements then that means there's going to be less wiggle room only if you all make the change the state model you have the right as a board to establish your own District graduation requirements which we do currently okay so we're going to be able to say you have to go down to 20 so we're not going to have to or the electives and all that because then I think that would also have a big effect if we go down to 4 electron from 7 we couldn't do student outcome for not do that you're absolutely correct okay cuz that was that was one of my big questions what kind of a

[02:10:00]
you are not interested in wiping out electives and we've heard that from the community as well and I don't think it's in our interest either so okay there's that that's good so when I'm looking at outcome three I am too kind of you know if he on that one because I'm looking at you know our proficiency rates which obviously we're going to move to try to you know improve those over the next five years but graduation getting that diploma doesn't necessarily mean that you are literate in math and in reading and so does that really matter as much as making sure our kids are literate

[02:11:00]
etcetera and so I'm kind of going you know when we look at our kids graduating they're not all proficient so I'm just I'm just iffy on I'm just iffy on that one you're not hurting my feelings okay okay about saying that we did walk in one of the initial Things We Said was we brought four thinking you might go with three so if you went with four you come back and walk out with five either way it is what it is so you're being very nice if you don't like the goal if you to you I mean I'm not trying to be nice and I think it's very fair to say that I'm not sure about the school okay okay and so if I was looking at something to you know dealing with our high schoolers you know our 10th 11th 12th graders or whatever I would be

[02:12:00]
more interested in looking at their you know sat and improving cuz we did see I know that member Jackson had pointed out when we looked at those score for the SAT it took like a significant dive and I can't remember remember Jackson was at 3 5. 5 2 5

[02:13:00]
I personally think critical thinking is part of postsecondary Readiness so I think they just go together and I think soft skills does also but how most people talked about post-secondary readiness was that it was important for the kids to to be ready for after their you know all graduated they're out in the real world that they still needed to be literate financially in reading and writing that they had to understand their strengths and their weaknesses that they needed to you know work on on those weaknesses and focus on their strengths that they needed to know how as I remember a lot of the responses were talking about being able to advocate for themselves so when they're they have to have some kind of

[02:14:00]
what can I get when I'm going on in the workforce in the military in college but you know kind of legal frame what can they ask for cuz I don't think a lot of students realize that still when they're in college they can ask for extra time to take tests and there are things like that that are important for them to be ready in the real world and I know as member Peterson has pointed out like to be able to advocate for themselves when it comes to you know you can't do this when you are in a workplace and for them to understand that you know you can't pay me this much and this is where I can go you know to Workforce Solutions and you guys can help me there and I think those things are really part of you know post-secondary reading Nest also is like are the post-secondary Readiness also is if you're going on to college and that's where you're headed are you going to have to do a lot of remedial work so

[02:15:00]
those are all things I think that they need to to know when it comes to this so I don't know if there is or not I'm sure that I'm sure that member Gonzalez knows is there like a post-secondary Readiness rubric or a test that you know our kids could take that could kind of help them and I think if we did that I think that and had that as part of the postsecondary Readiness the kids would know what are they good at are they going to need to take remedial courses what are their strengths you know when I I know they do that at you know like you and him or CNM and a lot of kids don't know what they're good at or you know what their weaknesses are and I think that in order for our students to be successful after they leave us to have successful outcomes and whatever they do we need to play on their strengths and they need to know what they are

[02:16:00]
I'm trying to think of what else is in there I just think that if I would I would rewrite the student outcome for and have it really dealing with postsecondary Readiness and somehow rewrite it understanding that critical thinking and soft skills are all you know are all going to be part of this but if somehow I mean I just don't know exactly I think that it's like you know successfully complete I don't I personally don't know exactly what that means does that mean they passed the class or does that mean that they took three or four courses like I don't know what I don't know what that means so I think that would be helpful to just make it more succinct somehow I don't know I'm I'm just kind of thinking out loud but I think

[02:17:00]
if we could somehow add having some kind of making sure that we put in their post-secondary Readiness I think that that would help like we may know that that what that is but I want to make sure everybody understands that and maybe if we do come up with some kind of post Readiness assessment that our students could take by the time they I mean to me I think that should be taken sooner than when they're seniors because then they've gone through all through high school not knowing what they may really you know be good at and what their strengths and weaknesses are so that's where I'm at is that good Ashley that's good and I want to give Superior an opportunity to respond I think you had a couple of questions in there sure just off top of my head the tricky one to use

[02:18:00]
because we don't give it to students with disabilities so we've got an area the reason the SAT scores dropped was we went from College Bound students taking it to make it into the state line everybody so you brought in a whole group of people that never intended to take the sad and had no real interest in it another concern with trying to raise SAT scores but I would like to see as a byproduct of better education could also turn into test prep that would be my concerns but that's what we're using right now I'm not there are assessments I don't know of any posts High School assessment we're just talking about that over here that's probably the closest we would get to kind of what you're thinking about I just think it would be very helpful to our you know to our students cuz sometimes I asked some high school students you know what are you good at what do you think you might

[02:19:00]
I'm not good at anything which is part of soft skills is giving them the confidence but you know I just think everybody's good at something we're all really good at something and we have to make sure our kids know what they are good at because every single person in the world is good at something and that's part of adult behavior that we need to make sure and get that across if a child doesn't know that they're good at something well why not has not a single adult ever told them that you're really good at this so that goes back to adults so we still do ask for the it is offered through Junior ROTC and they open wants to take it so other students who are not in the program thank you

[02:20:00]
board member Peterson one of the things that I heard from virtually all of the listening sessions and maybe it's something that will be encompassed if we set a goal for social emotional learning but at every listening session I heard something about the importance of empathy and the importance of students being able to advocate for themselves and have a real sense of their relationship with the world and and how to impact that and the other thing is real strong sense of giving back to the community especially in my in my communities I heard people over and over again really talking

[02:21:00]
the importance of students relationship with their community and the impact that they have and so I think that somewhere in our goals we need to read and it may be partly a guardrail sort of Outlook but I think depending on what kind of social emotional assessment we until we used I think those are things that might be incorporated into that because I think it definitely long with along with identity and culture in those things I think it's an impact on how students receive themselves and feel about themselves and their emotional help so and that sort of brings up the my

[02:22:00]
serve the umbrella concern I have with all of these is that when we talked about proficiency by his measure you know it's not it's not something that you know law of nature the professional proficiency rates are set by publishing companies by politicians and so with all of this I'm not saying that we don't need to measure it and for sure I am not saying that we don't want kids to be proficient and you know and we want them to be critical thinkers and that was the other part you know I think we all heard that strongly from the community but my overarching concerned about proficiency by focusing on the test scores

[02:23:00]
consider detrimental instead of helpful and I think particularly about early literacy development that for instance having students proficient in third grade in Reading maybe more contingent on them having real strong language development and a love of learning and curiosity and exploration and kindergarten rather than focusing on Phonics skills for instance and I think there's some ways that we can prove that I was looking at the San Francisco's and I think I have something that will come up with the guardrail part for how we protect against that that we don't let

[02:24:00]
proficiency aspirations lead us into bad practice in what we do with children and I think that is always a danger I think the focus is on test scores of No Child Left Behind let us into doing some really detrimental things with children and I think we're paying the consequences right now so that said I'm not sure whether we completely rewrite I think period it seems like we're all

[02:25:00]
working around that trying to arrive at what what can that look like in a way that's measurable but also reflective of how comprehensive it is because they're really trying to be a pretty comprehensive encapsulation of what we want and just really kind of struggling to find so what what do we look at specifically to measure that I don't think that it's very helpful it is it is and I want to be clear that the the measures that super has provided they are starting point they are starting point that will ground the board in the current reality for students in APS you're bored you all very much are are riding and through the process of this conversation or rewriting

[02:26:00]
the metrics and rewriting the the goals that are that are grounded and what is the reality for the students but also informed by the wisdom of your community and so I definitely want to make it clear that superintendent Elder has done some amazing work you all don't get to just take what he what he put together and adopt it you have to do the work and and really engage in this conversation which you are doing an incredible job at so on that note I want to I want to just make sure that I've got you clear so what I heard from you are social emotional learning I also heard some you also mentioned early literacy development relationship with communities are those what it what is your final answer

[02:27:00]
to what are the student outcomes that are important to you to to one or two just high level what are the student outcomes that are important to you so I think I think students having a sense of beer I think it's their empowerment what it comes down to is their sense of being empowered in relationship to the world in their Community that's great that's that's responsive thank you Danielle thank you

[02:28:00]
so before reviewing the draft goals that were seen the draft goals that were presented tonight I was reflecting on the initial feedback from the survey and the community conversations or the listening sessions and so given those I had written down the need for a graphical related to social-emotional development and School Readiness kindergarten Readiness or early childhood education so I think those two need to be in there I'll start by saying so the national commission for social emotional and academic development Define seed as a three-legged stool which is looking at the three components of school climate social emotional skills and applying those social emotional skills and academic setting and you don't have social emotional academic development until you have those three components so it's a disservice to prioritize anyone over the other or to eliminate one because it's a three-legged soul and it falls down on that and

[02:29:00]
no just reflecting on that definition I mentioned that I was looking at the some other district schools and I think I said something similar to what the District of Columbia Public Schools has and I looked it up which is 100% of students feel loved and prepared and then they have their metrics as measured by the Panorama school climate survey and so this is based how this is based on student voice student director and how they're telling you how they feel I also wanted to respond to a lot of what I'm hearing so far and a little bit of what to Doctor Who said before which is the stronger recognition that academic skills alone are not enough or post-secondary or lifelong success and Dr Segura sighted Elaine's worth of the University of Chicago and it's so happens at the University of Chicago put together a framework for young adults success is called the framework for young adults success which looks at all of these

[02:30:00]
seed indicators and what is necessary and so a lot of the stuff that we're talking about here is within that framework and measurable through their survey which is the five ease survey which measures challenge measures belonging measures all of these things that were talking about so I think it is 100% possible to set a goal related to the types of things that we're talking about and to be able to have an input of adopting a survey whether that's Panorama five or something else and tracking and measuring it over time and disaggregating it by students at groups so the I just want to look up the framework for young adult success and it identified the three key factors to to life success and so beneath these three key factors there's lots of indicators but the first one is agency and I have heard conversation around that agency is defined in the course of one's life rather than simply reacting to external forces so you can track measure and influence agency is measurable and malleable integrated identity which is a strong

[02:31:00]
this is where a lot of the racial identity cultural competency in those factors come in which again can also be measured in is malleable and then overall competencies are just some of the other stuff that we're talking about in terms of progressing so in terms of different measures and approaches I'm a much bigger fan of the foundation for young adults success than Panorama but I think the important thing is having a goal and having a measure I will also say that we have lots of conversation around the proposed goals here and I took I wrote down when superintendent Elder was describing outcome for I'm sorry I've gotten feedback I talked too fast so I'm going to take a breath that the description was around completion and this is how we identify completers and in the social and emotional development literature the metric is grit or resilience and those are all so embedded with measures with

[02:32:00]
self-regulation is another one that can also be measured and so I think it's important to think about that how this student outcome number four can be reframed to be the the social emotional academic development measurement that with the interim measurements would be looking at climate academic progress using social emotional skills and learning of social emotional skills so feel very strongly about Siege as a goal the second thing is I mentioned that I felt that we needed Early Childhood Readiness or kindergarten Readiness or School Readiness as a goal one because we know how important that is and in broader school Success and life Readiness and how much of contributed is to broader Social Development and skills and in terms of less likely to have a life of crime less likely to get pregnant more likely to have a higher income all of that important data

[02:33:00]
turn off a lot about the brain development and again we were just talking about the Constitutional Amendment here in the new funds for pre-k so I think it's really important for us to have a goal for the and us as a board to hold the district accountable for leveraging those funds and resources to provide our kids what they need and so you know as a goal I think we could say something like improve kindergarten Readiness and if we're not going to be using numbers tonight then that's sufficient numbers but it's clear that some of the interim measures could be measures could be related to establishing Pre-K classrooms or even I was looking at the city schools academic kpi indicators for which there's a lot on Pre-K enrollment by Group by subgroup and comparisons so I think it's really important to have an early childhood Readiness or School Readiness indicator so those are two that I would add the other thing that I was really noodling over is the importance of real focus on

[02:34:00]
populations or subgroups in general and so clearly that can be integrated into some of the interim measures as they are here but I would be interested in a conversation around one goal that clearly states the need to make progress with those populations and so maybe that ends up becoming a guardrail but I think it's really important to keep our eye on those populations specifically and I would advocate for some sort of a goal related to that and then responding to what is proposed here for high leveraged student outcome number three to it I don't love the language I do think what we're trying to get out what the goal here what we're trying to get at is correct and I can Envision some inputs related to early warning systems and early warning indicators and putting those systems into place but I think really tracking

[02:35:00]
mathematics in 8th grade is feeling English and 8th grade and it's attendance attendance less than 80% of the time so if we're integrating those into early warning ticket breathe again early warning system I think that would help then you know in the context of this I was thinking about this relative to another type of graduation goal and like my colleagues I did look at some other districts and I do Columbus City Schools have a goal number three for Columbus City Schools is the percentage of the class of 2028 who earned the portrait of a graduate seal will increase from 0% to 25% by June 2028 so I think given where the state is in the process of developing a portrait of the

[02:36:00]
I think something like this might make sense and the interim measures here go as far as you know what happens for 5th grade students with completing a portrait of a graduate project and increasing that looks at 8th grade students and 10th grade students so it's essentially looking at how that filters down through the system so I thought that Columbus City Schools School Number 3 was a potential good example for us as we look to a graduation type goal or I also looked at Chicago which has kind of broad 90 students are on track to graduate which I think makes sense 90% of students are on track to graduate but on track to graduate being the language in which case some of the measures that are here for three and four are really become interim indicators and again sort of to the early warning system you can look at those from those that perspective and it just to respond to

[02:37:00]
the question around post-secondary Readiness measures there's a Institute of organization called The College and Career Readiness Success Center ccsr which tracks College and Career Readiness indicators post-secondary indicators they do look at all 50 states and what each state defines as post-secondary Readiness and what measures are used in each state so it is things like work keys accuplacer and all of those things that do exist so I think it's entirely possible and plausible for us to establish a post-secondary Readiness goal which we could be looking at some of those actual quantitative measurements as well as some of the course take the CTE course taking course taking coherent patterns all of those are on there too so I think there's a way to have a clearer goal around post-secondary success where these things become the indicators these things

[02:38:00]
thank you for that so board member Gonzalez you mentioned a lot of new new content to the conversation are you brought a lot of new I think very valuable content to the conversation that is not out of line with what your colleagues have brought forward as well I want to give an opportunity to superintendent order to share his thoughts with some of those things especially as it relates to the social emotional development SEL type type type type measures and the framework for young adult success among other things so I want to just create a create a little a

[02:39:00]
a little bit of an opportunity for a conversation around around those specific measures just because they're new to the conversation superintendent yeah I'm just collecting my thoughts of she does speak quickly makes it hard to keep up with you I think what I'm hearing is that there is an interest in an SEL goal and I think that's fine but I do I think we're going to do another work session I have a feeling that this is not going to write itself I I would need some time and my team needs some time to look at seed in the framework I've seen before I don't know how to apply it thoroughly but I think it would probably mess with some of the work we're already doing over in that division with Castle so then maybe there's something

[02:40:00]
I agree that the azzy Martinez subgroups have to be included in this that's why we're suggesting them as part of the interim measurements because I really do believe that if we can improve instruction for our most vulnerable will improve instruction for across the board I don't I'm not opposed to discussion of them as a goal or a guardrail I have to hear some language on that the portrait of a graduate seal is really interesting so like all of you I went looked at other districts too and I got to go to schools just popped up today so I have not had an opportunity to really look at that we have done some work in the past with the greater Albuquerque United Way and Michigan graduate and they produced a fairly complex not 100% sure that would work well in a in a tight measured goal

[02:41:00]
but we can look at it and see if we can modify it some way to make that work and then maybe that does meet what you're saying as far as having a graduation goal or a post-secondary schools like I said we had talked about work keys already well maybe work keys and there's obviously a lot of measurements we would need to I guess get more specific exactly what we're trying to measure and and I need to look at those assessments and have a sense of what they are none of this is none of this is impossible and and again I only worry is that I keep hearing goals getting added and I know we're talking about taking some of this out and moving it and that's fine I just remembered I think some of those measures and this and what

[02:42:00]
superintendent is what she's talking about is like if we are going to do something that's like a graduation goal or it's even a social emotional it's part of that interim goal maybe having using an assessment in that piece or a new assessment to help us get there too so that we're not just saying overarching that the goal has to name that that's going to be the only assessment we're going to use but maybe we test out some assessments and we're utilizing those as ways to sort of inform Us in terms of are we making progress so I mean that's kind of how I digesting it because it was a lot but not necessarily so I think my point was it's important to have a seed goal a goal related to soft skills social emotional academic development and SEO okay period so how the district wants to set that goal or what measures or what priorities I'm not quite agnostic on but I want to respect my Lane

[02:43:00]
add pudding for that there are lots of examples from other districts that have done it and there's lots of measurements I have heard a lot from districts and a lot from folks in the education sphere that we can't measure these things and that's not true so like University of Chicago is where the five years was piloted Chicago public school is a massive School District I think the five years is great if we use that that'd be awesome if we use panorama that'd be cool I'm just saying we need a social emotional or School climate goal and we can measure it and so as it comes to inputs like yes the input would be Adopt A School climate measure adopt a student survey and then the interim goals would obviously be related to initially update completion and lots of states and districts have put in accountability measures around that too so I'm happy to share examples I had shared a really comprehensive email with Dr Garcia when

[02:44:00]
he was here so I could just pick that back up and move forward and over sure so I really appreciate this conversation because it really is rooted in changing adult behaviors everything that has been mentioned so far and especially in the conversation that or the discussion that board member Gonzalez always been excuses in education about what we can't measure that how is that measurable and she just demonstrated that they're actually are ways to measure these things that's not commentary on whether or not that's something that you're bored should select as a goal but we are at the point where we need to start drilling in and defining what are the things that the board wants to create is priorities in the here and the now so as as we

[02:45:00]
play progress in this conversation and we will come to guard rails so I don't want y'all to think that we forgotten that but the goals are the most important thing and so those are those are the areas where we're going to spend the majority of our time so what I've heard lifted up from as common themes from each member of the board so everyone has said reading and math High priorities post-secondary post secondary Readiness came up a lot there's a lot of there's a lot of discussion discussion about how you measure postsecondary Readiness but it is it is something that I believe this board is definitely aligned on within that conversation is is how soft skills relate to post secondary Readiness it's something that you embed into an as in

[02:46:00]
get into a full post-secondary Readiness goal or do you pull it out and create a separate goal around soft skills one of the ways that you could do that is actually by focusing on scl which as board member Gonzalez she highlighted several of the areas that get measured by these various assessments that are out there there's a lot of conversation to have within that area as well and then of course Early Childhood is something else that was lifted up not by everyone but by several of you and I was saying even a majority of you so as superintendent Elder mentioned you've added you've added things that you could focus on but we can't focus on everything during our two days Retreat together back in September you were all giving the the analogy of you have one one gallon of gas

[02:47:00]
Celine so if you're driving a pickup truck how far will that gallon of gasoline get you maybe depending on the type of truck somewhere between 7 and 15 me if you take that gallon of gasoline and divide it up among three different trucks or three different Vehicles those vehicles are going to get you different different distances if you start to divide it up among 10 Vehicles you're going to be lucky to even get it to turn on so that that is the next point or so the next place of discussion that I would like for us to focus on and then I want to have this discussion about what are the things that should absolutely be our focused that's question one and question two that I want to just let you know that it's coming is how to how who are the students who we want to

[02:48:00]
be focused on board member Gonzalez brought up that Jazzy Martinez definitely should be included in the interim somehow the board doesn't get to select the entrance though those are the superintendent things to select the board creates the goals and it's important to remember that when the board is writing goals the what they write is what the board has control over and when the board stops riding the superintendent starts interpreting which is already shared that he would he thinks that it's a high priority to focus on his student groups for your interims I would also like to I would like for the board to consider even adopting your full goals around the specific student groups of that fall within the definitions created by the Aussie Martinez lawsuit or something

[02:49:00]
Martinez settlement and with the possibility of adding in the additional student group of African-American students so so with that let's start with the first the first discussion between Early Childhood soft skills post-secondary and SEL if you're if you want to if we're going to limit it so for the purposes of this conversation that have already happened these are these are the priorities that you said math and reading are two that are already they're already I think that those are you have a mass consensus you can only adopt three to five so if you were to adopt a goal around each of these areas Early Childhood soft skills post-secondary and SEO that is going to be six

[02:50:00]
so you need to at least cut it down by one but remember the more goals you have the less Focus you have so how do you want to divide your tank what are the things that if you focus on the most are going to give you the biggest bang for your buck while still honoring what you know what the vision is of your community so and and also another thing to remind everyone of your goals are student outcomes you're not coming or what students know and are able to do so they're going to be something that like restorative practices and rigorous expectations the type of Cultural Literacy that the adults have for the students in the in the way that their educational program is being delivered those are things that are not going to be student outcomes but they would be operational areas

[02:51:00]
is that you may choose to focus your guard rails on so we're still very much on the conversation of goals and specifically student outcome goals so I want to so we've we've done the round robin a couple of times now I just want to throw it out and get and just get kind of popcorn feedback who who has an opinion who who would like to share first on what they would like to see our priorities yes the Early Childhood goal since we don't have all the Early Childhood kids how would that be worded what about early when you're talking about students coming in we have the private providers we have students who don't go to Early Childhood service and we have some of them so my only

[02:52:00]
what's the who are we measuring just the kids we had the purpose of gold language for your inputs you would be established Pre-K classes established easy hubs provide training and developmental blah blah blah for your interim measures that would be what you're talking about here and those would change over time as your population of three and four year olds grows over time okay I'm getting you because this was a quick exactly what you said is the question I had about Early Childhood you don't have control over improving what needs to improve before the kids get there so they get there and you do the observation tool but you didn't have those children so the only way you can improve kindergarten Readiness is dealing with a parents

[02:53:00]
the kids at home or dealing with schools that you have no control over and my interpreting what you yes okay that's what I think that's why I think that was a difficult one because then we have to have a goal over parents doing things and kindergarten Readiness by opening up Pre-K classrooms like that's the that's what I'm trying to get at and again providing training and resources and developmentally appropriate like there are real things that we that all districts can do to improve kindergarten Readiness and again the goal is to serve those kids with developmentally appropriate culturally responsive curriculum how does that I guess I'm trying to take it back to like how does it fit with what the feedback was from the from the community that we listen to because I didn't hear that come up I mean I mean I think it's important I think it's part of the it's part of the

[02:54:00]
the Continuum for sure but I think and I think we can get there with the pieces that were talking about maybe it is part of the interim work if we had a literacy goal right if there's a if there's and this is just me thinking so if we have something that can speak very easily to the community we listen to you yes literacy is important and maybe one of those interim goals is around and we don't write those because I remember we don't but it's really speaking about the the work that you know to get there to help improve that would also be this focus on one of our you know one of the strategies that the district has around the early piece of the early early place where I'm struggling with it a little bit is because I'm kind of going back to the community listening sessions and

[02:55:00]
I just didn't hear that part so that's only part I'm struggling with and I would say when I doable I would just say when I was saying we need to focus on elementary students with kindergarteners are part of elementary school so I think that's included in there so that we're going to improve you know proficiency rates or increase them so in my opinion it is included depending on how we write the one dealing with Ela so so if we're going to improve math and reading we have to better prepare three and four year olds for kindergarten but like like like there is no other way and if we have this money available from the state we have to take advantage of it and if we're going to take advantage of it we have to offer high quality developmental development on your response of Education I don't want to get into the details of what are the interim measures I'm proposing

[02:56:00]
accountable for Early Childhood Readiness because because we know from the research base how critical it is to Lifetime success so as I read and hear families talking about wanting Equitable access to resources what's the resource an opportunity to have a high quality early learning experience as I see in here families wanting kids to just be able to read you do that by having high quality play based developmentally appropriate Pre-K like that's that's where it's at actually provide some you know I guess a little bit inside on that because that's obviously that's my world and I see one based on our own statistics they are entering at a rate where they are proficient you know so but back to when we're saying we need to provide access there is access it's not just public

[02:57:00]
so we can't neglect one over the other so in fact most of the district is actually saturated with Pre-K programs and it goes back to parent choice if a family chooses to do private faith-based Montessori public they have those options currently available to them and what's good is those metrics are currently measured through the New Mexico pre-k program they get assigned a student ID that that should you know carry on as they go to public Ed so if I'm basing it again on our data that we have here it is showing that they are ready and I feel like our resources are better allocated in my gosh and that disparity between Kinder and third grade just my opinion right now you're talking about literacy rate completely different than the kindergarten readiness

[02:58:00]
I think our concern is the lack of control we have over the parents decisions to go elsewhere and what might happen with those students coming in I would I think we want to get to the point where we are the the choice for parents cuz it makes so much sense but at this point the money is in the country stations I understand that and I feel like it's the common pretending to say that we can't do anything to respond to the challenges that early childhood level so I mean I feel like it's whether it's as I said School Readiness whether it's early literacy whatever I share member Peterson's concerns about academic push down and so I'm a little hesitant to establish an early literacy cold because we know how to play that has played out in the past I have no idea what this

[02:59:00]
65% kindergarten Readiness metric is is it an observation like is it that they're potty-trained you know because actually there's a you're just looking at it a little while ago and I don't have it up anymore but it's a pretty comprehensive rubric that they are observed and there's things like fine motor skills there is appropriate play like they know how to play on the playground there is some reading in element to do they recognize you know pictures or separate from letters and that that means something different and then it goes all the way up to Canada child recognizes many as 20 letters but there's a whole rubric that goes if they appropriate position commands so it's not just a reading now I would say this that I agree that we need to improve the instruction in there so those kids can score higher on

[03:00:00]
you know that that assessment but again not they don't all come to us and that's my only get that I mean I guess I know I'm sorry I know you can just respond to that I like other board members are responding to this drop in Readiness and it's not a drop because it's a completely different indicator measurement tool etcetera so we can't compare 64% of students are ready to what we see later in third grade like that's not at all the same measure but this just doesn't pass the sniff test for what we know about how our third graders second graders and first graders are performing so if we look at i-state because we're testing at 3rd grade if we look at iStation or whatever other interim formative teacher developed assessments that exists for first and second are kids aren't on track because if they were we wouldn't have these third grade scores so again my priority is that we do something to better serve our early learning students so that we can reach that third grade goal sorry

[03:01:00]
so before before we move on board member Peterson I want to just provide a point of clarification that might help this conversation along a little bit so when evaluating what your priorities should be and when setting goals it's important for the board to understand that any any priorities that you set any goals that you create or accountability measures for the superintendent has to be something so they have to be areas where he has the majority of control we usually use the the standard of 80% of control and so if the majority of your students and this is this is a question that I'm asking because New Mexico is very different from a lot of the states that I have personally worked in or boards that I've worked with in that you don't have Universal Pre-K

[03:02:00]
play and so you don't have a lot of control over the students that come to you as the points that have been made so far so if if there is not a majority of students or maybe it is a majority and that that's the answer but if there is not a consistent number of students if you if the superintendent doesn't have control over that measure then how would you ensure that the the metric is focused on something where he does have control so going on to board member Peter said and then that's just food for thought for the conversation you know I just want to respond to the fact that

[03:03:00]
not all families do have equal access to to preschool and there are lots of reasons for that one is I mean I was talking to folks the other day about the fact that one of the real barriers to parents taking advantage of APs I mean first off it's very limited the programs that aren't connected to IEPs and child find that are available with an APS but the other issues extended day that parents end up having to opt for private providers because if you have a half day program and a full day job you are completely unable to meet that need but as APS is able to take on and provide more opportunities

[03:04:00]
to do the Partnerships that make that full day care a possibility and I think it's something that we have to take on very seriously and I appreciate it being put forward as a goal I'm wondering if given given the inability to have maybe that 80% control if it shouldn't be a guardrail that says the the the superintendent shall do nothing to I can I hate free in the positive that the superintendent needs to work to guarantee expansion of access to program from Early Childhood through high school that it can be that says it without making it accountable in the same way

[03:05:00]
emphasizes the fact that we we've got to make it accessible to families that don't have access right now what's your question is drawing a distinction between soft skills and seals and I don't agree with that distinction so I just wanted to understand more why you're doing that that was literally just the words that I heard from someone with things like Financial

[03:06:00]
financial literacy would not be a soft skill it would be a post-secondary Readiness so response is related to financial literacy where they could have been literally our students need to be more financially literate or they could be they could have been more more more specific students should be able to write a balanced budget they should be able to create a budget track a budget they should be able to manage a bank account they should be able to know how much money they need to make to be to be able to break even every month those kinds of

[03:07:00]
financial literacy which is very much a soft or it is not a soft skill a post-secondary Readiness skill so what are what are the financial literacy areas that could help make help prepare students to be successful after high school that's how it related and just so you know when I was going through the and coding all of the responses if someone gave a decision general you know financial literacy or something that was related to to that area they would get coded as both postsecondary Readiness and Mathematics because it fits to fits under that same area unless they have if they if they had multiple priorities they only get three response only got

[03:08:00]
maximum of three three categories and it fit within so it really depended on if there was you know mathematics based numeracy counting numbers those kinds of responses or then they would go to math if it was very specific to financial literacy skills that would make them successful after high school that is very specific in their response to budgeting managing a bank account managing money those would be financially or post-secondary Readiness get back to like identifying the goals if I send everybody the Broward schools link because I think they have a really clear

[03:09:00]
manageable example that we can follow and their first goal is early literacy proficiency and I think under that we can work with the suggestions we've made the second goal is I mean there's is algebra proficiency but we can tailor it to math proficiency this is the one that I really like if you jump all the way to the College and Career Readiness acceleration the fourth goal I like the way it's set up I think it captures what superintendent Elder and she falls off schools officer chief

[03:10:00]
we're trying or are trying to accomplish with their suggestion but the beauty I think I fell in love with the school because in the interim gold they use language like the percentage of minority students and we can borrow that for the other goals the percentage of Martinez Yazzie affected students or anyway I did want to draw your attention to this because I think it could make our work so much easier so what I was going to do at the very beginning was try to summarize what board member

[03:11:00]
when you asked about like what goals and it seems to me that what what what what I took the summary it took from it was keep one and two keep keep student outcome 1 and 2 adapt 3 and 4 and what board member Gonzalez is asking is then and to also add ese which would bring us to five now I understand there's some discussion around I'm sorry I'm sorry well I think though that oh right but I think that the scl the social emotional that she's talking about can be adapted into one of those goals until like outcomes three and to which I think a social emotional goal can be adapted into outcome three

[03:12:00]
so that his SEL because correct me if I'm wrong did you say seat s e e t seed social emotional and academic development speed can that incorporates both soft skills and social emotional learning correct and school climate so seed can be adapted into outcomes 3 so that we're hitting we're hitting that and and then I know that we're keeping so we have two proficiencies we have a seed we have a post-secondary and then there's a discussion around out in ECE now just as a clarification Ashley maybe this is for you this is supposed to be for five years right so I think what remember Gonzales is doing is maybe doing like a

[03:13:00]
my head thing is this is for 5 years and then over the course of 5 years this has the potential to grow but I also am hearing that we don't have the data right now to be able to really incorporate that goal so I'm so I'm trying trying to figure out both sides of this I wonder if this is something that in a year once the state figures out the funding figures out this Constitutional Amendment the right sizing has occurred we know what the ECE is actually going to work or we have a better idea of what you see is going to look like can we add a physical in here so yeah so the so remember the when you adopt so if you were goals you adopt the more Focus you have if a year from now you have three goals then that leaves it open for you to

[03:14:00]
add at least two more goals as your as you all progress so if like for example if you wanted to if you wanted to adopt a reading math and post-secondary goal then you could add something that so give so one you could just adopt those goals and then over the course of the next year see what the state is going to do around their funding and I may I may be mixed up on the on the different Focus areas that you're talking about based on your face what I'm proposing right now is reading proficiency math proficiency feed gold so adapting outcome number three to incorporate seed and then outcome number four which is post-secondary Readiness we already have

[03:15:00]
there's just some discussion about adapting that and then in a year we relook at or revisit ECE once we have more data and have more the 80% he can get it I just got I got I got mixed up on the between rerouting go 3 and then go back and adding for so or adding five sorry one more thing so but if we do that in order to honor the the values that board member Gonzalez is bringing forward we do kind of incorporate ECE as a guardrail and probably in in number one right yeah well so you don't get to pick the guardrail are you don't get to pick the interim you don't you don't get picked the interims guardrails okay

[03:16:00]
Early Childhood so if you wanted to so remember your student outcomes the things that students know and are able to do those are your goals your guardrails should be operational action or class of actions how many you were so what what may be a guardrail that specific to operational action or class of actions around early childhood education you should know I'm not going to make this easy for you and operational action or class of action so an adult outcome what is an adult outcome or what is what is something that so it's your guardrails really shouldn't be stupid your guardrails really should be the operational things that the district

[03:17:00]
does around around those issues so I think board member Peterson touched on it that the superintendent she said in the positive but the superintendent will work together will work to increase access to expansion of VC the superintendent would not know you know cut or would not limit the expansion of the expansion of Early Childhood we can certainly do that what I heard from Member Peterson which I support which was really much more around allocation of resources and resource equity which I think comes through loud and clear in the values that we heard expressed during the community conversations so again looking at other examples Columbus City school has as a guard rail the superintendent will not allow any region to be without strong learning committees Community I'm sorry it was super super

[03:18:00]
Equitable learning opportunities or strong learning or whatever like we could Wordsmith that but for me I think the important thing is that equitable distribution of opportunity and and that is so I want to be careful with this cuz I don't want to get us off of the goal conversation but for the purpose of the guardrail conversation I think definitely that is one that you should hold on to because the the highest Trend that came back from your Community Values is around the Equitable allocation of resources and Equitable access to and distribution of resources so that means that whether it be and you know race-based Equity ability to equity like there are a lot of different types of equity and which which is because there are a lot of different types of inequities Focus

[03:19:00]
sing on Equity as a whole is that is where you get into every student is going to be given the resources that they need to be successful in in and in their time with APS and post-graduation so yes I just don't want us to go down that rabbit hole right now because there's going to be because there's there's a lot of room for it in the conversation so how many goals are we at 4 I'm proposing kind of summarize you can put your suggestions so math literacy speeds 8:25 been here since 5:25 so let's let's take

[03:20:00]
let's take at least five minutes to just sort of catch our breath or take a break I think that's a good idea so we'll come back at 9:27 or I'm sorry 8:27 8:28 now walked out the door but we just need a quick break okay sounds good I'll see you back in just a minute

[03:30:00]
get people to come back I think we still have a few so

[03:31:00]
Pepsi

[03:32:00]
okay I think we have everybody back so maybe Ashley you could help us kind of like summarize where we are you know it's it's 8:35 and so I know we've passed out peanuts good well so first of all I want to thank everyone for their input and energy that they've brought to this conversation so far this isn't supposed to be an easy conversation it's not supposed to be an easy process if it were everybody would be doing it but as we as we all know the things that are most worth doing are very rarely the easiest things so with that I want to highlight kind of the the things that have been put on the table right

[03:33:00]
so you have a unanimous agreement so far that math and English language arts should be a primary focus of your goals additionally there is an agreement around post-secondary Readiness the specifics about how to measure post-secondary Readiness is still up for discussion but you have you have identified this as an area that you would like to focus on do you have so those are we're going to go ahead and just take those are the three overall Focus areas that are going to that are going to be goals that you that you develop so in addition to those student outcome areas to focus on you also have on the table early childhood education soft skills and social

[03:34:00]
emotional well-being this is and and all of those kind of Encompass a broad range of things that could fall within them so for the for the purpose of the conversation let's let's move on and talk about about these last three areas one at a time so first let me address so let's put on the table SEO you have so the first question that we generally want to ask when when evaluating your goals is how are you going to measure it and so board member Gonzalez is actually brought forward a couple of a couple of ways that it that it could be measured it is my understanding and I would like a little bit of clarification since I'm not in the room and can't can't can't can't can't can't see everybody I can see the Border I can see Scott and Chanel so but I can't see

[03:35:00]
you all at the same time so I'd like to see a little bit of clarification on what everyone's Comfort level is with the measurements that have been proposed and I want to be clear that because it's something that is unknown or that you're not completely comfortable with it does not mean that it gets pushed off the table it just means that it may require a little bit of further evaluation or additional discussion by the board so one of the things that you make that you as a board may choose to do is say this is something that we definitely want to make a priority but we need a little bit more we need to do a little bit more work to Define how how exactly we're going to do that and that is completely acceptable that's completely acceptable for this area and the other areas that are that are currently on the table so around the issue of seal and specific to the measurements that

[03:36:00]
been I propose and I was actually sitting here while you were taking your break kind of doing a little looking up some of the the Frameworks that board member Gonzalez recommended and I think I would just from you know a cursory glance they look like they could actually be really robust measures but it's important that the board not adopt anything that you have that you don't have full clarity on and so just to further the conversation I would like to turn to superintendent Elder and Dr Segura and get their feedback on if you were to pursue making social and emotional health and priority what are the ways that both including what has been put on the table or other ways that you may measure that goal Scott

[03:37:00]
a number of tools tossed out today the one we're familiar with this Panorama we're learning more about the seed assessment which is a 43 items student self-report survey good for middle and high schools so we could definitely work something around that I would have some questions in terms of you know it's another assessment and then what is the the number we're trying to move I guess we're going from zero because they have no money now I don't I don't have all the 43 questions in front of me but

[03:38:00]
I think we could write something along that it would just need some significant Wordsmith and then a sense of who would own that inside the district so we'd have to figure that out as well but I would prefer if we're going to do an SEL which I think we've already sort of started in the number of ways it is it's it's doable with with some answers and some time to really figure out a little bit that the house and where Force the soft skills are just about right now and then we'll come back to the others but I want to I want to I think it'll be most efficient if we just address them one one Topic at a time okay so moving on let's let's go back to round robin

[03:39:00]
and start with board member Dominguez Ashley oh yes go ahead I wanted to say something please sorry about that I did I did want to share that there has been quite a bit of SEL work that's taking place within the district with many individuals across cross departmental as well and so we really tried to hone in and create a strong central group but with that they've come up with a draft of scl standards and I can statements so the work is taking place and and it's just kind of coming together to refine what that would specifically look like and I feel just a little uncomfortable determining or finalizing that tonight like I don't want to be there's a sense of urgency absolutely but

[03:40:00]
I don't want to be rushed into putting something in place for the sake of it if it's not really thoroughly thought through to make sure that we can do it and do it well and so and I don't want to dismiss any of the work that people have already started working on I want to see how we can compliment that or enhance that in a way that is clear and so that we can put in those interim measures overtime that make it easy to interpret I respond to that so I don't think we're expecting you to choose the tool tonight or the framework cuz those are both really complex deliberative processes I think what's important is that we set a goal that says it is important for this District to focus on improving School climate and social emotional

[03:41:00]
and my only point is that the best tools measure more than just the student skills and I'm happy to share lots and lots of resources cuz I did spend big chunk of my career working with districts and States on this and there's lots of like we don't have to create any wheel new wheels so there's just a lot out there already thank you thank you for Gonzales and I do I do want to be clear that you are expected to to name your measure tonight and so that's kind of what I'm getting where I'm getting at and when I say that the board must if you're not super clear on what the language is it that you would like to move forward with then the best thing is the best thing to do is say this is something that we want to create

[03:42:00]
my priority around but it needs a little bit more work that doesn't mean that you stop that you put the entire process to Halt what it does mean is that it you can come you could potentially come back to it once the district has adopted it and the great thing is is that you're doing a lot of work around the Strategic plan with the tuned I'm sure that they they probably have resources and ideas as well they're and you don't have to set the expectation that you don't adopt it for another year but you can set the your top priority and then you can you definitely shouldn't wait you know how fast probably past March because you do have work that is that is happening with the tune and in order to align things with the budget in order to start a lining the Strategic

[03:43:00]
and and doing all of that work you know it doesn't it's not going to happen overnight but it's the work they should be able to start moving towards that pretty soon so if you wanted to create to say here's something that we would like to create another priority around but acknowledged that it needs a little more work you can absolutely do that so on that I just want to and maybe maybe you can figure it out tonight it's really just a matter of how you want to proceed so specifically around the conversation on SEL making seal priority what how are you each individually feelings and please try to keep it you know what just for the sake of time we're not in the super rush I mean you don't want to be here all night

[03:44:00]
try to keep it response is kind of concise but starting at the end with Josefina and working and working the way back towards Danielle if you can just kind of give me your thoughts on making SEL a priority I'm in agreement that we need absolutely need SEL as a priority with all the very specifics that board member Danielle Gonzales at 4:00 I appreciate it yes okay so I do like SEL as well I feel like I'm not going to answer your question for me I'm and I know they could be one in the same but SEL soft skill ish somewhere there my

[03:45:00]
biggest concern is that we don't because I know we could have up to 5:00 is a whole lot personally I'm comfortable with three I know and I know I told you I feel like I'm going back on what I said before because I want to see us at as a district be successful like I want us to make like I use your gasoline analogy and I want us to be able to you know get the momentum behind us and really have the outcomes we want and then add more as needed but that's where I'm at seal soft if we can put those two I would like us to adapt outcome three which deals with the graduate which I think was a was a priority for you Administration Administration I'd like to adapt outcome three in a way that

[03:46:00]
the dress is The Graduate using the social emotional and academic development Focus because I think what the s e a d incorporates is what we have said we want our graduate to look like done I think it's important I'm sort of in the middle because I like with top with Crystal thinking about how we can be succinct and I'm thinking that the high leverage student outcome number four the students in grades 11 and 12 who successfully complete but that part of that completion or part of that Readiness is also a demonstration of their SEL in there as well that they because

[03:47:00]
secondary piece was that they were also social social emotionally ready but I understand the significance of it needing to kind of write up throughout throughout school so at the same time I'm also thinking it needs to be really well-written as part of a guardrail so that's my that's my thoughts so I am I'm good with you know the ELA I'm good with the math so I'm good with those two I'm good with outcome for being post-secondary Readiness just fixing the language obviously I'm good with three I just think just like we often do we want to do so much and then we don't do anything really well and I want to do this really well and and that's what we do with programs and we keep adding programs and then we're like oh

[03:48:00]
we don't know because we have so much so I think we need to like really focus on doing something you know absolutely fabulous and so if we're concentrating on Ela and we're concentrating on math and making sure our kids are ready for career you know Military College whatever traits whatever they want to do and when I look at post-secondary Readiness it is it includes all of those soft skills and it includes a lot of what social SEL is all about when I looked at it you know it talks about resiliency and it talks about Connections it talks about feeling that you're part of something and so I think that that is part of postsecondary Readiness so I would go for those three so we could just do them really well so I'm glad that you pointed out

[03:49:00]
Gonzales the foundations for young adult success because I think it really speaks to a lot of things I strongly feel like we need a standalone SEL goal and the reason is that we keep giving it lip service is being important and then mushing it into all sorts of things where we don't dedicate the resources and if we don't I mean I hate I hate to admit it but the reality is if we don't assess it we don't value it and the only way we are together and consequently everyone else puts it on the back burner and I don't think we can afford to do that anymore and it starts from preschool all the way to high school and and keeping

[03:50:00]
it is something that only gets measured as an exit measurement will make us not focus on it and I see I see schools really struggling right now to implement restorative practices and they need resources and unless we say that this work is critical and deserves a priority in the budget it's not going to happen so I I think if we give the superintendent of a month to to sort of put in the specifics for which assessment is the best alignment with the work that is already being done but I think but I really feel like we need to walk out tonight saying there is a definite placeholder for an s e l gold and

[03:51:00]
you're going to come back within the month to to solidify what that looks like with with specifics Dido and since I still have the floor I will say because there is confusion there is a clear distinction between schools or other things and the difference is the school climate is the learning environment it's what happens around the kids it's what adults and school systems are responsible for and there's also that's the reason I like the foundation for young adults again is because it's embedded it's noted in things like the castle framework which are much more about individual skills and there's some questionable research around the extent to which we as adults can influence individual skills and some racial bias in there so I think it's really important to think hand-in-hand climate and SEO tools that can measure it the other thing I would

[03:52:00]
when is we're talking about social emotional learning but learning is social and emotional that is literally how the human brain works that is the way that we take in information and there's an explosion of research that shows that so if we're not going to prioritize what the research page shows around how the human being brain Lawrence and how important physiologically that safe environment is then we're doing a disservice to our ability to meet the math and reading goals so thank you all for that okay so I think so this is good information now we're going to move on to the next one early childhood education is this something that individually how do you all feel about having a standalone goal for early childhood education

[03:53:00]
I want to inform this conversation with the with the reminder that you have you have to consider the the level of of authority that you're superintendent has over that student outcome so you know it whatever if this is something that the board decides they would like to focus on which is which is something that would be acceptable and want to make that clear because of the way that the state of New Mexico is structure which is different from a lot of the other states that you have looked at information or like the example goals that they have because there is there is such a difference in the way that Pre-K and the Early Childhood is funded and the programs around that and in the state of New Mexico versus Ohio or Columbus I'm sorry Ohio or Florida or even Texas

[03:54:00]
that that is going to influence the way that you write the goal all together so let's go backwards now starting with Danielle and working towards Josefina how do you feel about early childhood education I think it made it clear how I feel about early childhood education being the one who put on the table as a potential goal I'm happy to pull that back on this feedback and find ways for us to establish a guardrail that prioritizes Equity access and whole child support how many in agreement so I really I really don't need to be doing anything that resembles taking a vote just so I want to I want to keep you all legal but your feedback whether it be yes or even if it's a simple as yes we should make it a standalone goal or no we should not make it a standalone goal

[03:55:00]
so at this point in time I think it should be part of our guard rails for Equitable access and I'm good with a no I agree with board member consolidates and also board member Peterson I'm not sure I agree I think we we table it for later yeah I believe the language needs to be what we discussed earlier Early Childhood to families vulnerable families or something like that ok Google

[03:56:00]
so okay final final one soft skills does it need to be a standalone goal or should it be should it be embedded with the social emotional Focus or post-secondary Focus what do you all think where you started let's go back with Josefina and work our way back keep going back and forth back and forth including the soft skills under postsecondary

[03:57:00]
the soft skill element or topic under the post-secondary high leveraged you now come number four that we've talked about already and wordsmithing it to look like Broward County's blah blah blah okay so I'm repeating my first statement from that whole seed framework right that's it I agree with Crystal Tapia Romero yeah I'm not sure that soft skills is something that is separated out of social emotional pieces for me either I think it is part of that

[03:58:00]
and I mean I think it's part of postsecondary that's just what I that's what I think so and it can be both it's really important question is more like when we're writing this or rewriting this Ashley where would it like honestly work best when you're talking about I know we said that outcome for would have to be Rewritten and you know stressing that it's post secondary Readiness but the way I know we all like this CTE and JROTC and dual credit you know that those were important but how successfully completed like we're it's like kind of not very clear so I don't even know how that's going to be Rewritten and how we could include soft skills in there or best to included in the number 3 that's so some of

[03:59:00]
a lot of those areas inherently build soft skills Fine Arts that you know Fine Arts JROTC like there a lot of it is embedded within it you learn soft skills within all of those areas remember soft skills are are the functions that help help you be a more high functioning adult executive executive function your ability to collaborate as a team or as a member of a team there's a I have a book that this thing that talks about all of the different types of of soft skills that exist in the 21st century workplace but they are inherently embedded in the items that they have listed in under the postsecondary readiness

[04:00:00]
SEL is very much a soft skill that so it could when I say that it could be both it literally it's not that it can be both it is both I mean so it would be best to leave it up to the experts over there who would know where they could put it in I mean I just think about all of those and how much I learned when I was in drama and you know when I was in student government and when I was on a dance team and all of those you know all those soft skills are all things that we learn and those are just things that I think a really good teacher just naturally teaches also starting from the lowest levels so I think it's just all in there a good teachers going to teach all these soft skills as well they're going to find out what the kids are really good at you know I mean I teach kindergarten is like oh my God she's the best you know she's the best artist like you just

[04:01:00]
do all of that I think so I think you guys are going to have to make that decision I think it should be in the postsecondary but yeah just from our perspective we just kind of like to see the language dropped and just do postsecondary Readiness I think with that said some of those Broward County stuff is is fine they do two courses to match completion which is fine we adopted it actually it was either Austin that helped us with this particular goal so we were in agreement with the language

[04:02:00]
where to find horses I'm again like I said earlier we're totally agreement I think dance team and speech and debate and all those things have a place we just can't measure it it's not it's not as simple as following course completion what about participation it's it's it's it's just not as easy it would require I mean it's not impossible I suppose but it's it's a different where that's encapsulated is kept in a different systems we can look into it but that's the reason we didn't do it initially was simply like the idea of having kids talk about options they like the idea of of not being all academic courses I would argue but there are geared towards something afterwards so I think you're right

[04:03:00]
I think all night so I think it's sort of caught period the question on the floor is do you want to have a standalone soft skill goal it is definitely embedded in these other two areas and in post secondary and seal it's the question on the floor is do you want to have a soft skill goal can I change my boat yes this is Crystal I'm going to say no me too but we're not voting but yes you can change your response this is Barbara we do not need it thank you

[04:04:00]
great thank you all so much all right we have four priorities that have been that have been identified we're still we're still kind of loose on the SEL but that let's not worry about that right now let's focus on post-secondary Readiness so what I'm hearing is that you definitely want to make post-secondary Readiness a priority so the question the question I want to put on the floor is how so if you want to increase the number of students who are identified as being ready for whatever their next phase in life is how will you measure that and so what what the administration has put on the table is completion in a number of different number of different courses whether it

[04:05:00]
play CTE I think there was a CTE coherent sequel sequence foreign language Fine Arts academics the I don't have it in front I've got my I've got multiple screens up so I'm still I'm getting it getting it there CTE coherent sequence JROTC dual credit foreign language or Athletics Fine Arts or visual art sequence I would like to what I would like to understand is so so let's start with the first part of this and this is where we're going to get into the words nothing so the percent of students in grade 11 or 12 who successfully complete a third or fourth course in a non-core subject on an approved list is there anyone so far who is up and up until

[04:06:00]
that that first semicolon is there anyone who is in disagreement with that language or would like to see a change to that language so I have a question on that okay are we saying 11 and 12:00 because it's too broad if we say 9th through 12th or why is it only those two grades cuz I know we could do dual credit we could do a lot of those in 9th and 10th President of 11 12 or is that too broad again it would not be able to get that okay that was it thank you that's a great question and thank you for asking for that clarification Scott you were about to add something one of the suggestions

[04:07:00]
horses so that's the reason we done with the three was the CTE computer but that was just because of CTE does that we could look a lot of kids you know that two classes of a foreign language is great for getting prepared for college and that's it so we could look at that as well I mean the 32 thing was sort of debated back and forth we're happy to make an adjustment based on that also occur that they don't get to the fourth or to the third yeah many times that just aren't enough doesn't have the ability to provide a third-year courthouse's but they are full full full full full full and I think

[04:08:00]
I'm in support of possibly shifting it to a second or third course because then we in the high school we start having to really focus in our sequence of courses which eliminates more of the Singleton electives so tough decisions and who is teaching those and then it gets into prep periods and all of that stuff so I think maybe looking at that changing it to second or third and then I don't know why it's not there but we really would like to see the bilingual seal at it on that I don't know so is there a so really that first colon sorry that first because it starts to introduce this list is that correct

[04:09:00]
switch off APS so yes and I'd love to see the the bilingual seal added I like the I mean I don't want to limit us to like what it is because I think the district could make some determinations on that because the other part on Readiness for this also the difference that makes for a student is an opportunity for mentorship work-based Learning and an internship so you know and if they have the opportunity for that that also makes a huge difference so the question the question on the table is updated just until the cold and so without getting we're not going to get into all of the specifics on the what is listed yet but just up until Nicole and does anyone have any would they like to add

[04:10:00]
play the conversation or do they have any desire to do anything different I think Peggy has her hand raised I just have a question so they can complete where we're going to change it to a second or third course from 3rd or 4th so on and then we're just going to not have that list correct so that we're not talking about the list yet we're going to we're going to get to that but just just my question is so they can take two or three courses now do the all the two or three courses all have to be in Fine Arts all have to be in visual I'll have to be and so I I can see that that may be isn't specific here that maybe somebody can say oh I'll take one dual credit course and I'll take you know One Fine Arts course and one Visual Arts and so I personally don't think that that's specific that's how I understood it but I think maybe that needs to be made more specific we just made it over here

[04:11:00]
make it to a minimum of two consecutive courses okay so you read my mind because we change the language I have I have a couple of questions how many electives can a student fit into their schedule is having exposure to a lot of different things so by the time they get to high school they already have some ideas

[04:12:00]
another thing that crossed my mind is ethnic studies for instance some schools don't offer more than two ethnic study options which is a whole nother conversation that making sure that they have that pathway forward and so that brings up my final question or point is if there's a student who serve bounced around some really trying to figure out where their interest is the next step program and accept or an addition to about the development of The Next Step plan

[04:13:00]
board member Peterson and members of the board I feel strongly that that third goal are the third outcome has a lot and everything to do with that next step planning to ensure that kids don't fall through the cracks and that they are being canceled to on what their options are as far as these courses for the complete to become a complete and what that entails anyone else likes to provide input just on up to the colonies it starts with the percent of students in grade 11 or 12 and is it supposed to say increase the percentage of students in grades 11 and 12 or what's the score

[04:14:00]
and

[04:15:00]
that is going to leave what is successful up to the Judgment of the superintendent which I mean I think that the

[04:16:00]
I just want you to get into the mindset of thinking of having very clearly articulated goals so it's it's the board's decision whether you use the successfully completes terminology or who earns and and if you use the earned terminology what would they be earning so the way we have it written over here at the moment and it's looking pretty sloppy Grease the percentage of students in grade 11 or 12 who earned credit in a minimum of two consecutive courses in a non-core subject from an approved list

[04:17:00]
that sounds good and so next question what happens with that list is does the board approved that list who decides what the list is and how often or can the list be updated well I absolutely feel that the list is kind of a work in progress as things shifts throughout our state and priorities shift we've seen that quite a bit we have to have the flexibility to say oh well this is a new maybe pathway that we're creating in this in these schools that we want to allow our kids to be able to participate in so we would add those to the list I don't want to lock hold us into a list that is limiting for our students to be able to access and I could see this video to be adjusted a little bit because we're going to include by lingual seal which is

[04:18:00]
industry certificate that our kids can take advantage of I would want to add it to this list to be aligned to actual post secondary success and I think the vast majority of questions about athletic courses I heard your explanation it engages students but I don't know that it actually prepares them for post-secondary Success so I'm fine with that but I think brother

[04:19:00]
the purpose of putting kids in a football class is to keep them engaged that's School climate I have seen these athletic classes I don't think they actually prepare kids for post secondary success I took basketball about is a class and you didn't learn about short muscle long muscle

[04:20:00]
I would keep it in I keep it in made my daughter take a physical not Physical Therapy but human anatomy because she was doing the athletic one space like I'm happy with things that have an Evidence I will get on that now like you know what kinds of things that participating in I think would be really helpful to know because I think it will also help us to understand you know if there are gaps and especially if we look at the Martinez Yazzie

[04:21:00]
are they engaged in these kinds of things are they not and if they're not what's the Gap and why are they not doing that so so I like the measure I think it's fine with the end of the colon and its planned and giving you the district the flexibility to look at that because I agree with you with things that are happening around career pathway Planning and Development I know school districts are up against it in terms of what kind of Partners you can come in and get into to support those certificates and that training so yeah I think it'll be great superintendent Elder and I were just speaking to kind of addressing 11 and 12 if we can strike that and just put the percentage of high school students because there are some students who have maybe in

[04:22:00]
trade already completed two of the versus so can you read it again and a minimum of two sequential list period period period period I want to ask one more time and I know we got some some response but on their list so clearly it's something you want to have flexibility on how much flexibility does the word

[04:23:00]
what to provide can that list be updated throughout the year can it should it be updated annually in in August or in June or what what are what are the terms that that surround this list or do you feel comfortable leaving it up to the discretion of the superintendent which as it's written right now leaves full discretion to the superintendent and thusly his team my thought on this is because we're going to have a progress monitoring report I personally would be uncomfortable if that report was changing whenever so I would prefer if the list if the list needed to be updated it was not updated it was only updated yearly

[04:24:00]
it's based on how we're going to be monitoring I like that I'm okay with that but I do want to like reiterate that it needs to be evidence-based for supporting kids and post-secondary success because we know which kids get shunted into the low quality electives or Pathways that don't lead to living wages or all of those things and so I just want to make sure that we're actually creating Pathways that contribute to living wages especially for kids of color and low income kids about athletic I don't think it's rigorous I don't think it leads to post secondary writing this but like what is the space on is this just based on like Word of Mouth the kids tell us that it keeps him engaged in school and so they go on to do better and post-secondary or is there

[04:25:00]
a way for the administration to get to address SEL right or soft skills soft soft skills I mean but it was one way to I take your point of it because I do see that they have to have a certain GPA to continue to play and be on Sports additionally they are able to receive scholarships to continue on and play in college I even think of even my husband he received a scholarship to play baseball at UNM based on his performance and Athletics in high school so can I

[04:26:00]
can I offer maybe a suggestion to that long scribble of lying that you guys have is maybe this would help address these issues if we said something to the effect of an approved evidence-based list or add add some sort of phrase that addresses the need to and it's not to say that like if we're talking about Athletics is not to say that Athletics doesn't have evidence with it but I think what we're saying is we would just like to see what that is and what is the evidence demonstrating this yes to but again like you guys are the experts on that so if we're saying that this is a post-secondary Readiness outcome that's important to us then and you are telling us that Athletics

[04:27:00]
is part of that post secondary Readiness then I guess then the ask back to you is that's fine can you just show us what that is that help I don't need you to show me cuz I know what does so I don't really need that I don't personally need that word in their evidence based approve list is that what you and I'm good with keeping Athletics and there as well well I'm not saying anything out I'm just saying like if we're going to have to prove it they have to prove that the crystal to have to prove it for it to be on the list that is helping with post-secondary Readiness and I'm not saying that it's not I'm just saying like if the goal is post-secondary Readiness and

[04:28:00]
we are trying to hold the superintendent accountable then this just adds that accountability and it's again it's up to them as the experts to tell us what that is I got right now could probably tell us how he feels that Athletics is post-secondary Readiness and go distinction between Athletics as an extra curricular and Athletics the course so having kids take a third or fourth course in athletics like I have some reservations around incentivizing that because of equity issues so is there evidence that having kids take three or four core sequence in athletics leads to post secondary success okay but I don't I know in practice oftentimes which kids take those classes as electives because they're easy because they're not aligned to

[04:29:00]
I'm not talking about extracurricular I agree with you on that too cuz I what I've seen is that you do have students and it does a great job of engaging them in their you know and staying in school making their grades but it doesn't necessarily prepare them for the next step around a job it may prepare them as an athlete and potentially you know get into school but I agree there's really nothing that's tied to the career side of it that that side that just sort of leads them to that I mean when I think of post-secondary reading Nest to I mean I'm thinking of like industry recognized credentials dual credit AP you know the rigor the things that demonstrate

[04:30:00]
is absolutely wonderful because it definitely prepares them a lot of ways we've seen that the CTE definitely prepares them I still have some concerns about some of our CT because I don't necessarily agree with it tends to be very vocational and some of the students that they they bring there's not a lot of rigor sometimes and so you do have students that are very marginalized I feel like very that they get some good skills in there but I don't sure that it really that are that there's a lot of rigor in some of our CT that's just me and there's a chance that this might prompt the athletics department about Anatomy but that's one

[04:31:00]
example is the number of examples of courses in athletics I would probably agree that is the sports class just basketball class probably is not going to meet the standards that board member Gonzalez is asking for athletic trainer some of the health classes even though I'd say some of the weight training not necessarily that it's preparing them for wild post academic success but it gets an interested in health and I'm going to since we're all speaking from personal experience my son got involved in weight training in it really helped him understand that having a healthy lifestyle and it helped him when he went to college and that's an adult I think that you're right that probably just rolling the ball out is not necessarily what we're looking for here that's not necessarily was thinking so we'll go back and read it or will bring in evidence and we'll go from there

[04:32:00]
all right so I really I really really appreciate this conversation you all just just developed a fully formed goal like this is this is definitely something to be celebrated the reason we asked the reason I asked these these very specific questions of you is to get you into thinking about what what can come down the road if this Athletics example on the list is a great it is a great depiction of how this can play out in real life and when I say that when the board stops riding and the superintendent starts interpreting this is exactly what I'm speaking to if you if you want to be super clear about what the expectations are you need

[04:33:00]
put it in writing so if if the expectation is that this list be decided based on empirical data then that is something that that you need to outline and whether you say you know non-core subjects on an approved list presented to the board once per year based on that is evidence-based or if you so if you want to get that specific then you can get that specific if you want to get broad just understand that in with that breath you are giving up a specific level of expectation so with that does everyone feel comfortable with the with the goal as it was last stated and does anyone need to hear it one more time before moving on no

[04:34:00]
space for visual arts classes you're going to have to show evidence based for Fine Arts you're going to have to I mean you're going to have to show all of that as well so I mean when you think about that I'm I'm just so I mean I just want to know what you think superintendent and

[04:35:00]
well honestly are we going to have to present obviously we're going to present once and after that whatever is on it's only we try to add new things that has to be evidence based not coming back every year period and that's exactly what I was looking for so when you when you change the expectations for that you have for the superintendent you're creating conditions for expectations to be changed for students across the district what happens in the boardroom could be seen in the classroom and this is exact representation of that mindset so with

[04:36:00]
is there anything else that anyone would like to add before we move on what do we have what is the current weather is increase the percentage of high school students who earn Credit in a minimum of two list list list maybe updated annually about

[04:37:00]
kids like my daughter who was you know Fine Arts I just really am concerned is there evidence for that there's a whole Commission on arts and education okay but the most so I looked up an article about that and they what they said was that in the end know it's more ACL that that it really didn't impact academics but but that SEL was equally important and I can try to talk to somebody about this girl because I was looking for I wanted it to have an impact but but but I think in the end the argument was it

[04:38:00]
because it has a positive impact on students wanting to go to school and an emotional with has a valuable emotional result which I guess which is what is the evidence that it helps with post-secondary education and this is a post-secondary education goal right right and so much and I'm not making an argument either way I'm just saying that that evidence doesn't necessarily have to be in in academics it's I mean if we've also talked about this is the area where we're incorporating a soft skills so if the evidence is that its benefits

[04:39:00]
the soft skills that we've talked about that's to me that's evidence as well I just as long as I as evidence was academic when we were saying that so maybe now with you clarifying that that's not necessarily I think if we're going to change the list what I'm saying is show me the evidence why tell me why how does this help if this is a post-secondary education goal tell me you expert I am certainly not the expert you expert tell me how this helps with post-secondary Readiness does it increase their ability to deal with adversity does it help with their academics does it help set them up for success for going into a trade you are the experts I am not just show me the evidence once a year when you want to add something to the list

[04:40:00]
so how would a course like that not prepare you to you know you decide you want to coach well I think you could have get you ready for postsecondary Readiness but we're saying if there is no evidence to show that I mean I think a class like that would help get you ready to to be a coach or whatever but I would say that connected to that is the students identified career pathway that they might identify for themselves but so if an identified pathway for them is around you know human anatomy or coaching or Athletics then yes it would be but how are you pretty you know what I mean I think

[04:41:00]
secondary ready in the school what are we incentivizing and what are we wanting the district to do to improve post-secondary Readiness and again my point is around avoiding Pathways that are dead ends for our kids so would we then focus on a minimum of two eighty dual credit CTE Fine Arts foreign language pathway

[04:42:00]
I worry about I don't know if students like they have to take more than two I believe to get sequential courses to get a certification so and that is usually through a dual credit program okay okay but it would be sequential yeah yeah I would just like for us to really hone in to make it very clear and focus so it's not that free for all because as we collect this data and monitor progress we need to be very

[04:43:00]
clear about what is the goal and if it's post-secondary and you all are determining what we want to include I feel like we don't have established career Pathways and all we just don't have a grateful to have it takes time money for resources but until until we have that we could be inclusive of Career Technical education Fine Arts and foreign language horses so you're taking out JROTC Netflix

[04:44:00]
leadership skills Bill responsibility but there are some kids who take it and they do follow that path and that needs to be measured so Athletics is out though I think under these conditions honestly when it first began I think it was sort of a when we first got this goal yes it had some post-secondary to elements to but we also have student engagement student interests and again that was trying to capture that student voice at this point I'm not 100% sure that I'm going to be in it in the conditions that are being established if I go and look and discover that I can then we will bring it back and review it annually at it we need to add like numbers okay okay

[04:45:00]
believe that for any number of teams those students are expected to take that class in order to be on the team I do believe I'm not sure if that's still the case but I think it has been so then the issue is do they still have the flexibility I mean this shouldn't I understand the concern about rigor I'm not arguing with that but I also don't want to set it up for students and not being able to be on an athletic team because they have to make this requirement I don't have to we're not I don't think we're aiming at 100% increase

[04:46:00]
all right thank you all for like just being so deliberate around this conversation I feel like we're at a place where we can move on is is that the feeling of everyone on the diets are good okay except that with with Google that's that's where we're going next so this girl I want to make sure that we're we're good on that now let's go back to goals one and two I'm going to talk about these in as a group even though there are two very separate goals you're going to have very separate expectations around them but I feel comfortable having the conversation about them both together and that they're pretty consistent I think I've not actually seen a district that doesn't have and

[04:47:00]
not necessarily 3rd grade English but an English school and a math goal early literacy tends to tends to be the predominant English goal middle years math tends to be the predominant mathematical I think that everything so unless anyone has any objection to focusing on those areas then I'd like to move to the to the specific part of the students the student population at these goals are focused on do you have any questions about third grade or 8th grade okay so one of the questions or one of the things that has been put out there is that you have the expectation that when when the interim goals are brought forward that they be around the Mart

[04:48:00]
as student groups I want to reiterate one more time that the board does not get to pick the interim goals the superintendent picks the interim goals and while you've heard the superintendent say that these are the interim goals that I really think we should focus on it behooves the question is does the board want to get very specific around the the main goals these two main goals of English and math that they be focused on those Martinez student groups and with the addition of the African-American student group or do you feel good keeping it broad with the understanding that the interim goals may not be specific to Yazzie Martinez something like something like

[04:49:00]
what's the percentage of Ozzie Martinez and African-American third grade students scoring proficient or above in ela yep and I like that and additionally so these this is important for clearly for the English language arts Vision that your community brought forward but one of the other things that came forward from your community was around cultural competency students need to be culturally competent your by focusing in on student groups you're not necessarily so it's not necessarily adding cultural competency to their skills and their abilities but you are highlighting what is who the students are that need to change around very specific cultural indicators and that's both

[04:50:00]
add multiple I'm talking about multiple types of cultures so it could it could be argued that some of the strategies in order to that would have to be implemented around these goals are going to require some some level of cultural specific or culturally relevant pedagogy that they may choose not to do that they made it so does every how does everyone feel about these about making them specific thank you Danielle for for sharing when I think I'm not for it we're here to educate like all of our kids and increasing proficiency for for every child's aps's not just here just for the Yazzie Martinez kids I know we're doing everything we can

[04:51:00]
so that is just not something that I will ever I just won't go for it I just think that is just racist for heaven's sakes I just won't and I'm talking as a person of color so I just cannot believe that we would ever do something like that and exclude so many of our kids so I can't I just can't actually and the other thing on this goal also when we are talking about we're talking about all students from kindergarten to 12th-grade

[04:52:00]
to be making sure that every student is proficient if we don't include is it Ice Station that measures that so I mean I think that that would be something that we'd have to to add there probably as well alright cuz we're not we're not going to be able to measure all of our students on that because everyone doesn't take that test for the third grade students for the third grade well I'm talking about when you're looking at increasing the percentage of students and we're not being specific about it being third grade where it's just increasing the percentage of students now I wanted it to the difference in the documents yeah this one says third grade third grade

[04:53:00]
provided you with because this is the students that you focus on must be so it's important to be informed by the superintendent but it has to be a decision by the board okay so we're just talking about just we're just talking about third grade students I mean I just having been a third grade teacher having been a kindergarten teacher first grade second grade teacher when you're just talking about waiting until the kids get to third grade I taught third grade and I had third graders who came in Reading at a kindergarten level and so it's so difficult so if you get catch them when they're much younger it's so much easier to catch them up then

[04:54:00]
I had 3rd graders and I had to get them to the end of 4th grade reading and they're reading it a kindergarten level I wouldn't expect the greatest teacher to be able to do that to be able to get them through you know kindergarten first second and third and so I think when we're waiting until that we're just waiting way too long but I think the whole purpose of this so is that this is the this is the end goal I mean it doesn't mean that we're only teaching third graders we're teaching all of them so that when they come to third grade they are ready I agree with board member Gonzalez on the focus only because if you look at the numbers on this it's blaring and that's where we're at and if I know I have said this many times that even in just my sister if we turned out around we turned the ship around because that's the group that is struggling the most so I just want to say it's not that we're not teaching everybody else

[04:55:00]
pairing them all up so that by the time we get to that third grade proficiency exam or whatever we're doing here that hopefully every 3rd grade teacher has a student that's coming in and has already received quite a bit of you know of assistance so it's not just the third graders so the argument in favor that is to understand we would have interim goals and we would have some of those interim goals would have to deal with students in first grade second grade right address that we would not only be teaching or only focusing on the subgroups there's a good argument that if we improve instruction for those who are struggling those who are not

[04:56:00]
it's better for everybody and that's that's why when some districts look at this they focus solely on subgroups and they work because that's where their biggest disparity is and so that would be an argument we had looked at it differently and had laid out you know that everyone and then we would use the the subgroups as our our focus our interim goals but just so you know with their interim goals will exist to deal with the younger grade so it's not just going to fall upon any specific grade and understand that it has a real purpose now in terms of preparing

[04:57:00]
the reason being again being here to represent what I hear is there's a perception that some students are not some students are not receiving the same benefit or resources based on the

[04:58:00]
opposite of being high-performing or being in a different district and so I think where I don't disagree that the achievement Gap definitely needs to be closed and I think that that can be done in the interim goal but if we are presenting this to the community I think we need to send a signal to the community that all of our third graders are important and then in the interim goals this is where we can address the very specific Martinez groups that are obviously needing needing more support but if we can address those in the interim goals and those areas that what that's going to do is naturally increase the overall goal and so I I prefer and I like the way it was written originally the only thing that I would add is specific numbers as to like increase from 19.6 to

[04:59:00]
I don't know whatever whatever we decide and and one thing that I did write down from 12 hours ago when we started this process that we don't have a trend line that we couldn't develop a trend line and and one thing I wrote down was I don't think we need to develop a trend line because we can set the trend line and we have we have historical data that would allow us to set a trend line so that we can walk out of here with actual metrics for this goal but my preference would be to keep it broad to keep the student outcome number one broad as well as do not come number two broad and then hit the specificity closed the achievement Gap in the interim goals and so I just want to remind everyone that the board does not get to pick the terminals there is no there is no it is very specific

[05:00:00]
play the superintendent's job to to say what the measures are that you're going to look at and so you know it's it's great that that you've heard superintendent Elder say that it definitely is is a priority for him at the same time it's it's just my job to make sure that the board is very clear with what they're expectations are so you don't have to go one way or the other but it's the conversation that needs to happen around the Baseline I strongly strongly encourage this board to not push the superintendent so so first of all you're not going to leave here today with the with the with the forecast its forecasting is not a simplified process it's not something that you

[05:01:00]
you can just say that we're going to create the trend line because the trend line is is student outcomes they're they're the ones that set the trend line based on their performance and so what's based on previous information previous data from the state they that information can help inform of what it may be and you're superintendent actually has attempted to do that for a couple of these it it is my strong strong recommendation that this board not move forward with any kind of forecast based on that historical data from a different assessment because that assessment is different than the one that is currently being used and it's it's not the transfer from that assessment or not going to be the same as a assessment and it really and you know it's really should be 2023

[05:02:00]
is the is the year that we're in that's the Baseline that you should be starting with because going back so we're already halfway through the school year we can't you you literally cannot have the expectation that I mean you can have the expectation but it's not necessarily an acceptable expectation or an achievable expectation to set that you're going to start moving the needle between last year's Baseline last year's data point and this year's data point so those are those are just considerations of the board but remember that this is about setting expectations being very very clear with the expectations that you said and then once those clear expectations have been set then the you are

[05:03:00]
more likely to have a successful system of accountability not that we had to put numbers down I thought that was something that we were going to have to do so it'll be it'll be from it'll be a placeholder from X to Y Sol from X in 2023 to Y in 2028 but that would be your five year old you just you you can't I mean you you could but it would be really in my opinion not the best decision for you all to make to move forward in that way but the Baseline will be measured in May so the next test is taking in May at that point you have two points then you can draw a line and then you know whether that line so for example one of your one of your mattress I can't remember if it's

[05:04:00]
English or math last year score was 36.6 next year so this may the students could go to 37.6% or they could go down to 34 it's that next line that that next data point that determines whether or not you're trending up or trending down if you don't know which direction you're going that's going to inform the the different strategies that are that are implemented and the types of resources that need to be allocated I mean the problem too though Ashley is that we are putting this off because I know we are going to take the test in May but we may not get the data until when did we get it this year like August or September or something it's usually August yeah I mean that's putting and that's why you can't you can't really include this year it has to be so

[05:05:00]
play 2023 is is the starting point so I'll just help with the little bit best is in April head swears 6 weeks so we don't pause on this but and we can definitely set the I think if we're telling people you better do a beginning of the year you better know where your first and second graders are because it's coming and this is how you know we're looking at things will be okay and if yes Dad gets so scores out we should have them before the school year starts but we can start talking tomorrow at 8:15 and we have a lot to tell them

[05:06:00]
you're going to improve math we're going to improve we've got to we're going to have a social emotional or an s e a d goal we're going to have you got that for me I'm good we have something to tell them and I think my point was that we also have the public that's watching that we need to have something to tell them as well and so you know I we we we we we informed them that we were going to walk out of here with with Golds and metrics and so I think that concerns me I understand the rationale behind it but I mean it it concerns me to walk out of here with without having completed our promise you the community and I think what we can do and actually correct me if I'm wrong but so

[05:07:00]
I think the second data point is critical so that we know you know which way we're trending but I think we just need to make sure that we communicate that that it's not that the work that it's not coming it's just that we're going to wait for this next assessment and then we can set what that goal is you know what that actual metric is going to be or the percentage that we want to increase on there so I think we're we're coming out with the public that yes we did our task in terms of identifying some high-level student outcomes that we want to have and some goals that we have we can be transparent with the communities say here's what's working what's hard for us right now is because we don't have that second assessment and but we're going to add it and we're going to we're going to set up a goal for ourselves it's going to be very specific and we'll have to come back and do that I think we just are transparent in our board meeting saying and giving ourselves

[05:08:00]
6 weeks is what ped is telling us well check out the timeline from that but saying you know to estimate that we will have it for sure hopefully for sure hopefully I like her I said that you know that we have it by the start of the school year we are debating let's be realistic we're not going to over five years we're not going to set a goal less than 10% so I mean that's minimum I believe and then we bass up that so if you needed something to say look I'm a board member and I'm not going to settle for less than 10% over this year period so if you need a number for your constituents I think you can have a number for your constituents and we just let them know that this is going to be to get exact requires another day to point because I'm sure bye people who know that comparing test to

[05:09:00]
preparing separate test especially since those tests were pre-pandemic and we're now post-pandemic world and these kids are different is really risky and we're not it's not going to be accurate and I think I'd prefer to be accurate I think you'd prefer to be accurate with this type of work so this is the first time hearing that we're not going to have numerical tests I mean numerical gold I had not heard that at all so I've been operating under the assumption that a goal is a smart goal so that said I do agree with Scott and not only that I mean there's again tons of educational research which shows what rate of growth can look like and it's easier to go from poor to Fair than it is to go from fair to good or good to great so far is at 19 whatever percent it's realistic to say a 10-point game

[05:10:00]
because I thought we were going to come in and said numerical goals I spent a lot of time looking at other districts today looking at districts across the state looking at what Gallup McKinley has done Santa Fe Rio Rancho also looking at the Council of great City schools and based on that Improvement of 16 % points makes sense so I think we need to clarify just and I know you've got this right but I just need to clarify the way it was said we're not going to have a numerical goal tonight we are going to happen in America called I know well I guess I'm pushing for Google was board member Jackson as well again because we told the kids we told our constituents we told our community that we would do that and I don't think it's beyond us to be able to say will grow by I think 16 percentile true to our word and it feels like excuse me

[05:11:00]
great City schools and so Ashley had informed me she had this discussion with you to do ahead of time so I guess I'm informing you now that this is the coaching we received I am completely comfortable with you saying the minimum will accept is 10% and once we have the actual trend line data will expand it but I'm also if what my statisticians are telling me is we really could use that second date of point and what the castle Grace City Schools is saying part of this process as you should have at least two data points tonight I feel like that's the coaching that we are getting and that's why we're I'm just sort of going well I was told to go with and I will say I was actually surprised as well I had a conversation with Ashley today too and I was like because I did ask her it's like I don't

[05:12:00]
I'm not a statistician or or that part so you know I guess for my part I was just willing to accept that coaching as well because but I did ask that question it's like I thought we were going to come out with a with a goal and what I understand is that we will have a goal we just won't have it completely fleshed out tonight and that I mean so I think it's just I think we can you know decide if that's I guess is a board if that's what we want to do not do you know I'm sort of on I still am not sure a question could we obviously we don't know what the starting point is versus the ending but we could at least say we would want this percentage of growth as a number within five years right because of Middle School

[05:13:00]
so going from this to this because we don't have the I guess I know what 19.6 is and if we know that 10% is reasonable I don't know why we wouldn't walk out of here tonight saying 19.6 to 29.6 and 5 years and I don't understand why we have to have the second number to prove any sort of trend because that's like a teeny little part of what happens over five years and if we if we already know today that we want our kids in five years to be at 30% proficiency rate or 35% proficiency rate why don't we just say that now no matter what the starting is I guess I if we know 10% or 16 percent or whatever is something that we're comfortable with I just why don't we just say that and

[05:14:00]
so if I may and so first first of all I want to take ownership of some confusion here because I over it was over the weekend when I realized that that there that there was a problem with the data and then Scott and I visited and got really clear on exactly what the conditions are so that and Danielle I think you're the only one that I haven't been able to have a conversation with that was specific to to this specific issue the reason that you can't do that is that if so if the current reality for students is trending down then your your your strategies are going to have to be very different than if they're trying out

[05:15:00]
if they're turning down then you're in a more drastic intervention situation then if they're going upwards you don't know what direction they're going until you have two data points because you you need you need two points to form a line so you can say on the same you may say okay so now we're moving up but we're really low so maybe 10% is it's fine that's a minimum but we want we actually are capable of going 15 or 16 or 20% of those are this is the information that none of you as school board members are expected to know because you're not statisticians you're not data analysts it's the it's the people within the district the professional Educators who you have hired and who are you were paying for that expertise

[05:16:00]
we're going to be able to inform that information so that so to make a a short answer to a big question that's why you have to know truly where you're starting and just one point in time doesn't give a full range of information it doesn't tell you the direction that you're going and you you have to know what the direction that you're going is before you can say this is this is how much we can improve by and and it is it is not out of the outside of what is using the placeholders up from to why even Broward County who has been mentioned several times tonight some of their goals and even their insurance because they don't have those data points yet and even two of the ones that

[05:17:00]
proposed they're not even being tracked so you don't even have a single data point for that so it's it's just so first of all I should acknowledge my role and not not setting better expectations around exactly what you're going to leave here with but you have if you can leave with the fully articulated goals minus the starting point ending point with placeholders for the starting points and ending points then you have very much done your job and with the expectation that what what is coming is real numbers for your starting points and your ending points and knowing that you're going to be setting much better expectations for what happens over the course of a year and what happens over the course of the full five years because remember you want to you want to adopt five year

[05:18:00]
but you also have to have annual or yearly targets for each of those goals so you need to know what the what the trajectory is by each year so you know one year one year of growth may give you a two-point increase the next year you may get a three-point increase it's never going to be a straight line and sometimes it you may even have a plateau in there somewhere they your Administration will be able to tell you what is possible based on their expertise and understanding of what is currently being invested in the way of resources and energy employees and all of that and then how how they're going to change behaviors to create those increases and at what rate those increases will be able to happen I'm really confused because I'm even looking at Broward County and they do

[05:19:00]
targets so so at the same time I hear what you're saying because it does say you know they're going to grow their Ela from 52 and June 2265 by June 2027 so and and I see that they do have some things that are just Baseline I don't I mean I don't know I guess I'm just I and you and you know cuz I kind of struggled with you a little bit on this one in the conversation so I don't know I don't know what to do here because this is not my area of expertise for sure just in terms of setting you know Baseline and so on and so forth I am worried I mean I know that we're talking in the superintendent is going to go tomorrow he's going to talk to to principal's yes we're going to have a mouth and you know this whole thing on literacy I don't know what

[05:20:00]
why can't we say we will increase by 10 and this is an honest question I get your point about statistics and I think early on in my term here when we were talking about increasing test scores and we were throwing out numbers I warned about this because I was married and he always said be careful you have to you have to fully understand what you're measuring up against your original assessment so I understand that but I'm wondering can we can is it

[05:21:00]
to say we will increase by 10% points or by 16% points so you can you could say that in the interim between now and when you when you have the two data points and the but I turning back to the framework on page two of the student outcomes Focus governance manual and actually talks about what are the things that make up an effective goal and so it requires you to have a starting point and then ending point what if you said 10% then that will give you your starting point in your ending point you have to identify the month and the year that you start so starting date in a month that mentions the month of the year and an ending date that mentions the month and the Year this tells you when the snapshot was taken so you can't

[05:22:00]
you're not going to evaluate you know January 2022 versus November of 2023 because those are two separate points throughout the year so you can do that it's not it's not an effective practice to say 10:00 period and that actually when this framework was started that was actually the way that they did it and then we were all corrected that this is not the most effective way to create a measurable goal you have to have you have to be able to articulate what your annual targets are going to be so you could say from X Y with the with the minimum of 10% but it that can't be the final

[05:23:00]
that can't be the final piece of data that you end up with it it really can't do is that because we're going to have some into a monitoring and the pieces of I can't even talk cuz I'm tired but we're going to be doing some monitoring the board comes back so there's nothing that says that we can't modify a measure I mean I I kind of feel like we do need to have something yeah I agree and I mean and I would argue things are drastic and I don't think that it would be out of line to set a goal even if even if you know for not come one if the data comes out in 2023 and we've dropped to 30 or 28 or whatever it's still not out of line to say that we should be at I don't know 16 to that goal that we should be a

[05:24:00]
48 you know that's it no more about well that's why I think yes like that's why I spent so much time looking at other districts and looking at New Mexico today to look for what's attainable and that I mean and again it's more attainable we are and giving the current circumstances so I hear you Ashley on the strategies are going to be different but again that's what the district says we said the goal so I hear you owning that I wasn't supposed to switch not just for me but for our community like we all went out there and said we're going to set measurable goals and then we're going to come out with no numbers so that just feels like contributing to this culture of low expectations

[05:25:00]
so so that's fine if you want to set so if the board if the board shoes and that's what I'm hearing is that you would like to have metrics assigned to your goals by the time you leave today so if that is the case then what then looking at the illegal just get it to where we are right now so if right now or in 2022 the metric the measure in 2022 was 19.6% no sorry I don't know what I'm looking at 32.6% so if you go from 326

[05:26:00]
we'd like to just say set it at 10:00 let us see what comes out and maybe we can adjust it to hire because it needs to be attainable and it needs to be fair and we're not using and you're doing it based off what we saw this District do that I understand that I know it's also 10:30 at night and thanks that's just what I'm asking as as the administrator I mean our community about wanting to keep those high expectations

[05:27:00]
so again I think 16 is achievable attainable realistic if we want to get out of here with a 10% goal and I think that's all I'll take it because it's a numerical and that's what we promised our community and I would say it looks like we can do 16% I would love to do 16% because the kids deserve it I don't have a problem with that I'm just going to something that we just might be set it up for failure take the middle

[05:28:00]
I'm not sure who promised numericals to whom when because that was not a part of the conversation that I heard what I heard is that the community wants kids who are competition reading and writing and knowing where they want to go so I can live with more than 10% I can live with you know bottom line or seriousness is not based on what number we put here because there's not a year I've been in this profession for 50 years and there's not a single year where we haven't looked at test scores and had someone come and shake their finger in our face and say you better improve this by 10 points by next year bye the difference is that we are seriously looking

[05:29:00]
at what does it take to move the needle for our students in the seriousness is that we are saying we are setting goals that will be realistic we are developing a strategic plan which will help with setting those interim goals and we're setting the guard rails and if the seriousness of this work is based on we're going to pick this number out of the sky or that number out of the sky that I don't think that's a sign of what serious you know what it comes down to what are we going to do and on that note I will say we need to put in the language the specific language for the Martinez identified groups which includes low income Native American English language learner and students with disabilities because that covers about 70% of our community

[05:30:00]
can we add low income if we can move the needle for them we know that kids who come to school with the academic language that they need the security in their house and and the kind of stable family economic status they're doing okay we are not going to back off of what they get we are going to make sure that we keep working for them but the group that we get hung up on over and over again or the kids that come to school without all those things in place and what does that mean for setting priorities and if we don't figure out as a district as a board how to set our priorities for where we really Target our resources what kinds of support do we give to staff what kind of support do we give to families what kind of support goes into school Community for making

[05:31:00]
student successful we are not going to get there so I don't care what we do for the number make it anything you want the seriousness is that we are altering what we do for students that are not being successfully served so I have language that I'd like to suggest thank you points within five years third grade proficient or above and that wouldn't make sense third grade Martinez Yazzie students as measured by the New Mexico

[05:32:00]
and black students African-American students as measured by the New Mexico Masa IMDb me up and if that happens I am just saying I'm going to get up and I'm going to walk out so I'm just not we're here for all of her kids

[05:33:00]
all of our students no matter what color they are or how where they are or what ZIP code they live in I know they are and I'm just not I just can't I want we're here to represent every single child and to say that every single white child that may not be a Yazzie Martinez they could be a Yazzie Martinez child they're not scoring where they maybe another white child would I just saying I'm just not it doesn't work with disabilities and etc etc but I'm not excluding the 30% so I have to think

[05:34:00]
that in order to hit a broad goal of just 3rd graders or grade three the only way that that can happen is by addressing the Ozzie Martinez and other students but that would have to be addressed in the interim goals and again perception is reality and I'm concerned that if we set a goal that is while arguably would address the need we still need to let the community know that all of our students deserve an increase in their proficiency rates for kids who are already I mean the increase is different when

[05:35:00]
are we going to then different percentages for different groups and the interim goals have different different percentages that's a question I understand what you are saying I honestly do I really do I know that you have to we have to move that achievement Gap I totally get that perception is reality and we are going to have community members who are going to look at this and say oh so I my third grader doesn't matter 70% of our community has a perception to right and smoke up right and and that 70% will be

[05:36:00]
I would assume very specifically within the interim goals here's how I understand it and what is that the original way that you're suggesting it leaves out a whole subgroup and you guys are saying we just need to ensure everybody's included right are we are we against the obviously everyone's going to receive the same instruction the same resources the same teaching style and those who need additional support they are allowed to receive that and we could even add that in the guard rails but we don't have to isolate a particular group in the context of what the goal says right

[05:37:00]
I mean it's not about isolating a particular group it's about identifying where it's setting priorities with limited resources where should the district direct those resources and that's our responsibility to as a board so based on the student outcome performance data that's in front of us with limited resources and forced to make some hard choices yeah the district should direct those resources towards these student groups that does not mean that other student groups the 30% are not going to get educated or not going to get resources or not going to get extra curriculars they're going to continue to receive that but the focus really has to be on improving outcomes for the 70% I think I think that's what I'm saying too I'm just

[05:38:00]
Flippin flippin the language right like flipping you're you're saying address it here and the other 30% will be addressed here and I'm asking if we can flip it and say we're going to we're going to do everyone but then the specificity comes in the in the underside but I mean this might be something that we take it we don't take a vote but we take we like cuz I don't know that we'll come to agreement okay so here I don't know I was hesitating about having to say this keep in mind that this is if our Administration gets wiped out tomorrow God forbid and all of a sudden sorry why some horrible natural force okay

[05:39:00]
then then what the interims then what these are supposed to direct anybody in that position as to what we expect these are our this is our value statement and interim goals are set by Administration so this is where we put ourselves on the line and I'm saying that you can't yes you are correct there is no way that you would be able to address the the Gap if you guys got wiped out tomorrow Dinosaurs the new person coming in

[05:40:00]
look at that would look at it and say okay we need to improve Proficiency in third grade how am I going to do that they're going to go and they're going to look and they're going to set their interim goals to be so we'll just disagree I would prefer that there is a broad goal and that the interim goals to hit specificity that's just that's what my preferences and that's what I am voicing I hear you could we just do SEL that would be an easier goal at this moment no I mean I'm going to I'm just going to be here anytime soon I mean I'm just going to go back to what board member Peterson said it's like

[05:41:00]
it's really it's just I mean this is really high stakes in terms of getting down to the seriousness of it I mean whatever darn number we put in there I had to stop myself there whatever the number that we put in there it's disappointing I will say it's disappointing that we can't even come to like acknowledgment consensus around that there is there is a gap there is a big gap and the students that are in that Gap the Gap keeps getting bigger and it's gotten bigger and it's gotten bigger and I'm hoping I'm hoping that you know whatever the inputs are or whatever we're going to have is actually going to focus on that but I also know I mean I'm not lost on me at all that when it comes

[05:42:00]
limited resources that we're going to have to do and pull together is that we're going to have this very same argument again about why those kids should not be the only sole focus when we know that they should be because that's the group that has grown the Gap keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger we need to just stop pretending that it's not I mean it's getting bigger and we have to stop pretending that we have not invested in a meaningful way to really turn that time and I'm I'm just worried I mean I also am with you Barbara it's just like we just put whatever you want and we'll just do it but the proof is going to be in I know for like in my district the proof is going to be in his am I going to start to see those scores start to go up and that's really what is going to have to happen and I'm hoping like

[05:43:00]
that when we look at that and we look at it across all of these particular demographic groups that that score percentage raise is actually increasing it exceeds the rest of it that those 70% of those kids that their numbers are going up at exceedingly High rates because we have put enough resources and we have done all the things that we need to do to Target that particular group that is just been been left behind so I don't have a I don't I mean I just like I'm at this point I think one word exhausted I don't like to have a goal at this point I think I'm comfortable with just putting a number in because I think we're going to get where it's going to get really dicey when we have to start making some decisions about how we're going to

[05:44:00]
can you use our finite resources and we're going to have them and I'm hoping like hell that we do have some really strong internal goals that will help us to push because the district's going to push us in the ways that we're going to make those investments in those groups because we are going to see and we're going to have to see an incremental increase for those groups of be really big so for the purpose of moving the conversation along and I think that everyone has kind of made made their position clear so we've got two things on the table the first is the level of specificity you want to provide around your student groups do you want to specify in these two goals around English and math do you want to specify students that fall within the categories named in the you'll see Martinez settlement that's the first question

[05:45:00]
second question which I'm hearing a resounding yes but I do I haven't provided the specific coaching around what happens in the event that you do choose to just put in a number so before we get to that I want to just go down go down the line starting with Danielle ending with Josefina and saying yes we should include I believe that we should include Martinez student groups or no I do not believe that we should include Jazzy Martinez student groups at this time I want to be clear that you don't so if you chose not to the interim goal so the interims would be reported at the time so whenever you adopt the goals whether it be next at the next meeting or if it needs to be at a further meeting down the road which I'm

[05:46:00]
kind of thinking that might need to be the case but it's based on the amount of time that we've spent today when those interim goals are developed and presented to you as a board if they are not in alignment with the vision of the of the community that you represent then that's the time to make it more specific you could also choose to make it more specific right now which I think there have been some really some really clear arguments on why that you may choose to do that and I want to be clear that this is not the specificity should not it does not come from a place that is political in nature it comes from you have the literal expectation that has been set upon you by the state of New Mexico that these students should be made the priority so if you as a board can make the decision to follow

[05:47:00]
the state has said and make them a priority or to keep it Broad and just focus on all 3rd graders and all 8th graders and with that being if that is the case then understanding that you may not have the level of specificity that you're expecting in your interims so we'll start with Danielle just on the just on the question of how specific you want to get around student groups yes I think Jazzy Martinez an African American student should be included in the goal and yes I think we need a narrative we are committed to the success of all but we've got to focus on the groups that are not successful at this point and then Martinez

[05:48:00]
and know all kids are just as important no matter what color you are everybody is important and for us to say that these kids get I mean they do get this extra help in Title 1 schools there there's all this money that does go toward many of those students and so I just can't believe that we would do that to not include all students when we say we're here for everybody I just can't imagine doing that I mean I personally couldn't do that to that 30% you know of children and I just couldn't yes I think we should have a stated goal with some specificity that includes a group I would like to keep the goals Broad

[05:49:00]
and include specificity for the goals so my gut is telling me that it's yes that we need to be very specific about the groups that were targeting based on the data that's presented to us ditto and Martinez and African-American students need to be stated okay so the next question that I have on the table on the floor or that I would like to put on the table for you all is around what around your starting points and your ending points and I want to before we start going through these responses I want to provide some clarity around a couple of things so if the board decides to

[05:50:00]
I move forward with the language that you will increase over that you will increase for by 10% over the next five years that that does not meet the criteria of a smart goal under student outcomes Focus governance the reason it doesn't meet the criteria of a smart goal under a student outcomes Focus governance you have to have a starting point and you have to have an ending point by saying 5% over or 10% over 5 years does not give you a starting point and ending points so through the framework it should be very clear of what the starting point is and what the ending point is so that there is no confusion about exactly what your what you mean so that that's the first the first thing that that's a decision for you all to make I'm here to provide you coaching you don't have to

[05:51:00]
you take it upon your discretion so that's the first thing the second thing is without so the reason that this is important when you don't have a clear line of trajectory then it is impossible for you to know what is realistic and what is attainable so if you say a minimum of 10% that is that is something that you can absolutely do you're the board it's your prerogative if you do choose to go that way you are so it's creating a situation that could provide headache down the road at some point you will want to have more clarity around what you're starting

[05:52:00]
are what your ending points are and understanding what you're able to what is able to be accomplished over the course of year to year if you don't have those annual targets which that language would not provide your your your creating a condition where there's ambiguity around your goals so it's it's your prerogative of how you want to move forward it's my responsibility to make sure that you are being as effective as possible based on the data that that we have at our disposal that says this is this is the behaviors that highly effective boards that move the needle for students in districts where students are actually increasing their outcomes so with that said I want one of the things I want you to

[05:53:00]
think about is what what are the how many how might we move forward that is both honoring the commitments we've made to the community while also being realistic and by setting goals that are smart so measurable is absolutely something that is that is part of smart I'm not suggesting that you do not adopt goals that are not measurable I'm simply saying that you're the metrics the literal numbers are you you're giving placeholders until you have that second data point if you choose to not do that which is again your prerogative how many you move forward that still honors having

[05:54:00]
smart goal so that that means that they have to be specific and attainable and in addition to being measurable so I'm just going to I'm just going to start with Danielle and go go down the road again Ashley can you stop for just a second please thank you for September 20th

[05:55:00]
and we do the same thing for math proficiency so September to September metrics well only because I think we get did I hear that we get results in August the percentage of third grade increase the percentage of third grade Martinez Yazzie in African-American students scoring proficient or above in ela as scoring proficient or above an Ela as

[05:56:00]
Bird by the Massa by 10% points from September 30th or September 2023 to September 2028 is that what you're saying go percentage 10% cuz here's the thing that the numbers that we have that that were given to us those were all scores so now what I'm having a hard time is we don't have a specific for Ozzie Martinez we write so we don't have we don't have the Yazzie Martinez in the African-American pulled out that we can aggregate right now so now we can't create a data point from here to here we potentially can create a percentage but we can't we don't have that data to say what I mean we've got to do some quick that's why I said increase literacy proficiency by 10% points

[05:57:00]
so here's a suggestion and because personally I wanted to leave with a percentage of metric but honestly at the end of the day I want I'm going to trust Ashley like Ashley is the expert here like she has done this more times than we have and to trust her advice of saying that we should not put that in there because I don't even like the 10% honestly like I really think that is not even a like a rigorous goal for us and I would I'm just proposing obviously what

[05:58:00]
we decide as a whole is what we do but I think we need to just trust her expertise and not put a percentage in there as of now OK Google I'm going to propose that the Cardinal discussion be moved to a later time and just focus on the goals just because with the with the way that the direction that the conversation has gone I think that the guard rails that you have

[05:59:00]
thrown out earlier in the conversation might need to be reworked a little bit so I want to just take take that off the table and say let's just focus on the goals for right now and then we can we can recalibrate and figure out when we when we need to bring forward some guardrails or when you can discuss the guard rails on the timeline so if we're going to be able to vote on goals probably in two weeks maybe consider girls

[06:00:00]
to approve a budget aligned to these goals like does that give the how much are we pushing back other dependencies within the district that are that are related to the dependency sorry superintendent Elder will have to respond to that I think I've expressed this a couple times but this will you just said in the goals now allows us to start trying to figure out how to realign some things right I think when we talked before you know it's a two-year process this is put us back I can't deny that I'm very hopeful that we're going to be able to at least show you a template of a budget that shows were making those efforts to begin the process of moving resources beginning this year and then continuing and I think that's part of the strategic planning as well so some of that works still has to be done but it's probably going to slow the roll on a couple of things that

[06:01:00]
where are you but I intend to bring these goals back at least on the 18th which is next week and if you guys to approve them and we're just going to have to do some wordsmithing I'm going now that you've changed some of the language on the the math literacy which I'm fine with I have to be thinking of goals now and that's going to take a little bit more work there's some other things that so we my people we've been you know we're listening to you guys people there's a lot of people listening they're working we're trying to figure out this percentage thing to this 10% 16% there's but I'm trying to do this after 10:00 at night I just I'm afraid they're going to make a mistake so hopefully we'll be able to add some clarity on that as well so my thing is if you guys can just get the goals pretty well worth Smith we'll get those to you before the weekend and that's stupid

[06:02:00]
I have a feeling what's going to happen is you're going to send me some stuff back and you're going to say no not quite not quite right and and we'll try to get that if you have some I've been watching people write down guardrails and stuff you got to suggested guardrail I'll listen we're going to have to go back and funk you with those now too because those are going to be a little bit different too but it's nothing major it's definitely definitely right about and I don't know about doing them next week but that's up to you guys so I think other than the fact that we are not I was taking this sort of 10% idea as a general 10% and then once we can figure out what the actual percentages are will apply those to each of the subgroups but we're not

[06:03:00]
will move the district

[06:04:00]
so then we're we're at the point then with what board member Dominguez proposed as the 10% but knowing that are we I'm so lost are we just not yeah it's like what are we doing I think we're going to grab food and then I think we do want to get through just the goals tonight and then yeah but I'm okay yeah cuz I'm just thinking about the 10% whatever it was so anyway I need to go you percent as 10% tomorrow okay so are we are we in recess

[06:05:00]
break cuz someone just brought some food in and everybody's about to eat their shoe okay sounds great thank you just let me know when you're ready to come back

don't care nothing about the moon I don't know that my grandfather's roommate in college was Tom Landry so I'm a lifelong California and you're ready to go back into session when you're able we're ready let's do it let's go okay

[06:12:00]
we're going to get through this we're going to get through our goals we're going to finish this Chop Chop let's do it really quickly we're worn down and I just want to say that because just at this time of night as worn out as we are we're not going to make great decisions I just I just have a feeling we're making decisions at this point because we're exhausted and we've been warned down so I think we've we have come to agreement of some things that we need to do recommendation mentioned earlier there is work in the district around SEL currently we don't have that work here in front of us we would like
