president Gonzalez the stream is life Welcome to the Board of Education meeting I call the meeting to order I want to remind those speaking during tonight's meeting that we are using closed captioning on the YouTube live stream so please speak as clearly as possible with that we will move to the Pledge of Allegiance I asked that you stand if able and join me in saying the Pledge of Allegiance in English and Spanish the United States of America and to the Republic

[00:01:00]
moment of silence so I'd like to ask for a moment of silence for those who have given their lives in service to their country

[00:02:00]
play next on the agenda is our roll call Miss King may have a roll call please don't worry about are benavidez I'm present because the top of your room here Courtney Jackson next on our agenda is agenda option agenda adoption with item 2.1 so we need a motion for the adoption of the March 20th 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda the March 20th 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda with the exception of items 6.4 Amendment to the aps Board of Education government's manual emphasizing the board president's role and seeking legal council on boards and I was going to read the next part of my script which says

[00:03:00]
heard the aps Board of Education governance manual board members have up to 4 days before a meeting to request items be removed from the consent agenda and placed on the action agenda for discussion and consideration this is the only time before or during board meetings at items will be open to be removed from consent agenda for separate vote the New Mexico open meetings act requires that a final agenda be posted within 72 hours of the meeting so her the governance manual we cannot address the agenda during the meeting so is there a motion to adopt the March 2020 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda as is I move to adopt the March 20th 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda as posted this is Crystal second here we have a motion from Member Jackson and a second from Member popular Romero can we have a roll call vote please Janelle stoica yes and then

[00:04:00]
for which we need approval emotion for approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on March 6th 2024 and the policy committee meeting on March 4th 2024 before we have that motion I just want to add the March 4th policy committee meeting minutes show that the committee voted twice on item 4.1 that was an editing error the committee voted only one to recommend for approval the superintendent evaluation process as amended when making the motion to approve the minutes please note the change and with that may I have a motion I moved to approve the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on March 6th 2024 and the policy committee meeting on March 4th 2024 noting the amendment as stated by the board

[00:05:00]
will you please share the instructions for public forum thank you welcome to our public forum guest when you signed up to speak you were asked to review rules and expectations which are presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires at our agenda specify an advanced the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum isn't a dialogue among speakers and the board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room

[00:06:00]
my name is called online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room and tell it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public comment if there are 22 or fewer speakers you will each have two minutes to speak otherwise you will have one minute tonight we have seven speakers once your time is up you will be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message you may email board and at aps.edu in addition for those of you here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you Mr Gonzales will you please introduce the speakers thank you board member historica our first Speaker this evening is Sam Columbus I am Sam I'm the campaign manager for a 24/7 for tobacco free schools I'm here because on November 7th of 2023 the New Mexico public education department put into affect the new rule requiring that all public school districts have a comprehensive

[00:07:00]
tobacco policy under a truly comprehensive tobacco policy tobacco and nicotine use possession and distribution are prohibited by anyone anywhere at any time so currently APS has just the staff and visitor policies to update I was taking a look and right now the student policy for tobacco looks great and so does the advertising policy So currently they're just needs to be additions and updates to the policies for staff and for visitors I'm happy to be a resource in this process it is my job to help districts with everything that they need to adopt comprehensive policies and we have different sorts of resources that we can help include including example language tobacco-free signage that we can send free of charge to all districts we've already sent it to El Dorado High School a tool kit with resources and faculty training resources as well that's really it there's been a lot of progress

[00:08:00]
are you ready with the district's tobacco policy and which is great and I would love to be a resource as a PS continues the journey towards tobacco-free schools and since I have some time these are what the signs look like this is our window decal and we have other signs that are larger and posters we can send as well but thank you for your time and I hope you have a good day thank you our next speaker is last name Kidwell I don't want to say the first name incorrect Chapman you have 2 minutes won't you begin speaking good evening I'm here to speak about the right size and committee I don't think it's me since last August but I've been following its progress for the last year and I just have concerns about how it's affecting the communities of the schools that are being affected by the decisions that it makes and this is the only place I can come to speak about those

[00:09:00]
based on the parent engagement survey that I just completed the questions were pretty universally based towards families who may or may not stick with APS families who may be considering private or Charter Schools that's not me my children went through Washington Middle School still language program start out at Coronado and now one of them graduated Albuquerque High one of them graduated from Highlands but I know that there was a plan in the works to possibly add a Middle School portion on the Coronado don't know what the status of that is but again that would have devastating consequences for Washington which has the oldest dueling language program which we are working hard to keep staffed but since there aren't enough dual language teachers within APS then we have a trouble there and if you add on an additional middle school for Coronado that problem becomes worse I have reached out to corn

[00:10:00]
how do I have tried to like build a bridge with them it's been tough going I've emailed the new board members I would love I need like 20 minutes not to to Really dive into this and my concerns but nobody's talking to Washington nobody's looping Us in we don't know what's going on it's really frustrating but you know as a parent who believes in education who believes in my kids that the way I support it is but my kids showing up for it I'm going to stick with APS even when I don't feel like sometimes that the district is sticking with me I'm not going Charter I'm not going private I'm here but I'm trying to engage and all I ask is that you all lupus in and help us you know keep us informed and then listen to our concerns about the plans that you have thank you thank you our next speaker is

[00:11:00]
Lopez Morales no can I don't need that period and building success for the guard rails so leave that here

[00:12:00]
I was recently had a very pleasant discussion with Benavides about some of these items Marcella Jones are not laughing and she says her hair is die makes her look younger mine didn't die I'm a older guy so you probably don't know who I am but I was my APS for 34 years and I was a principal of Grant Middle School about 13 years ago we were the first Community School Community Center in the states and I support the Community Schools I had a pleasure of meeting at 10:30 comma community school so I feel the board continues to have that phone schools so those are two points to learn to make tonight and the strategies English Middle School

[00:13:00]
we re-engage the program their failure rates drop dramatically and Grant building on successful Manzano in Sandia so I hope you'll be happy to look at that packet and also in the packet I included a member that you didn't Optimist Club and we sponsor a camp to Camp shaver scholarships for kids 35 to 45

[00:14:00]
play hope you have a chance to review if you have questions please ask thank you thanks for breaks our next speaker is on June Mr Coker I'll take care of it Mr Coker are you there yes I'm here you have two minutes once you begin speaking sure my name is really here to talk about math I do want to do a quick aside on the change to the governance handbook I guess because those of you who weren't here during this whole back when a teacher had a Native American students the community to be had with the board on you know the way that decision started the very end and through that conversation that I had followed up on the preceding months it had came about that basically that you are allowed to buy the state law and the Sunshine laws to add or remove any agenda item during a meeting this is just able to do but very specifically you can't really

[00:15:00]
and with this constant back and forth that I had between me and the previous board basically they said they disagree with the Attorney General on their ruling and that's what this comes from I just find it interesting that you had to put it in your own personal policy because the state doesn't actually support this interpretation of the law but specifically for mathematics is wondering back to the provisions that we do have or at least from this Golden Girls aren't necessarily accurate you can go to any school and just ask and roll almost always in the single digits especially in high school in particular this is a problem of curriculum this isn't necessarily a problem of like policy or anything that you can really do unless you want to start actually adding in curriculum but it is also failure of Technology one of the biggest problems that we have is that none of the students progress individualized progress tracks between grade levels and tracks between School

[00:16:00]
and what we need is an actual holistic it was described as like a a teaching plan for my little brother for his family Living Services is where basically you can have these paper that says how to teach you know my little brother how to do the things that were expected to do with him it's a program that follows him to anything in the state and it basically helps any ongoing teacher or Community coordinator with him to be able to teach him proper way that works for him this is a system that is very easy to do it's already been done again from my little brother that would need to start implementing an APS when you start looking at more Innovative practices to actually address the core problems with mathematics in particular just on a bass on example the large portion of our mathematics assessment is based on how well you can read the questions and actually two minutes please wrap it up quickly and as you can see

[00:17:00]
please try to innovate thank you Mr Coker our next speaker is in the room Mary Ingram do you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking yes my name is Mary a reminder that have been passed these Six Flags that we chose were passed last spring and signed by the governor we're collecting signatures in all 33 counties this will allow us to place these laws on the ballot in November 2024 so that the voters of New Mexico can decide whether they wish to keep these laws or not they're two laws that severely change our elections

[00:18:00]
weather for related to children and removing parental knowledge and writes many of these things can occur in schools that energy to go to not my kid nm.org or NM bad bills.com and take a look and see if you agree that we should keep on these laws or referendum and stop them with all the signatures as to get them on the ballot in November 2024 and may God bless our New Mexico Children and Families thank you thank you ma'am next speaker is Dr sanela Dr Samoa you have two minutes once you begin to

[00:19:00]
call doctor in Minister the world economic forum's great reset greatly emphasizes the necessity to Advanced sterile sexual lifestyle increase abortion use vaccine to increase sterility and cost more debt and anything else to depopulate the world they are determined to save the planet from too many humans who are allegedly the cause of climate change formerly known as global cooling and then global warning global warming so should not be global warning warning this could be one of your own kids to your heart and soul Parkview humans will make it much easier for them to fully control Global digital control system on the other hand at local level the APS school board members should create emphasize the necessity to Advanced educational lifestyle of Reading Writing and arithmetic not sexual lifestyle of perversion mutilation

[00:20:00]
castration of sterilization do you ever wonder why New Mexico New Mexico is still dead last in education and top three and crimes in suicide for many years are you okay with that with no more accomplished not knowing the difference between right and wrong if not then please listen to your constituents and kids parents who knows what's best for their children section 22 Dash 5 Dash 4 of the public school code a local school board shall have the following powers of Duty subject to the rules of the department develop educational policy for this school district educational policy starting with Reading Writing with sexual policies of perversion mutilation castration and sterilization which are actually abortion and transgender among students thank you and God bless you excuse me thank you and that concludes public forum

[00:21:00]
instructions this is not a dialogue but an opportunity for you to share your perspective so thank you for your participation in that we will move on to agenda item 5.1 which is accepting the progress monitoring reports for goal to and from goals 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 for math proficiency are presenters our doctor Antonio Gonzalez Chief academic officer Dr Shanelle Segura chief of schools and Dr Richard Bowman Chief academic and strategy officer and perhaps Mr Troy Hughes as well tonight should we as I just said we'll be monitoring gold too and interims associated with it before we hear our presentation we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete so we need to consider whether or not the report has all of the required elements these elements are number one the goal

[00:22:00]
does the report clearly show which specific goal and interim goals are being monitored number two the data does it clearly show data for the three previous reporting periods preferably on a line graph B does it clearly show the current reporting period C does it clearly show the target reporting period as requested during our last progress monitoring session the administration is working on annual goal targets that it plans to share with the board in April so we do know that it does not currently have annual targets but we will buy April the next element is the interpretation does it clearly show the administration's understanding of system performance relative to the goal with evidence sorry 3 Evans and plan does it clearly show supporting documentation that evidence is the superintendent's understanding of system performance if the school system is not at Target or the superintendent

[00:23:00]
misunderstanding of system performance indicates implementation is not on track then does the monitoring report clearly describe systemic root causes strategic responses including rationale and any needed steps so there has been Q&A with Technical and tactical questions submitted by the board members in advance as we're continuing to work on refining our questions we've learned that many of the questions we submitted in advance were actually strategic so thank you for answering those strategic questions we're going to try to continue and maintain just strategic questions during this monitoring session I should also know that during the Q&A there was a question as to whether the report includes all of the required elements and an assessment of the report is missing an interpretation of why the district considers itself to be on track given the data so my understanding is that the administration is prepared to answer that question

[00:24:00]
however the guidance that I have received from our coach is that because that interpretation was not provided in advance we should consider tabling the report so that's for us to be aware of as we move through the conversation I think if it is table that would simply be the opportunity to put your explanation that you're I think going to provide during this meeting and perhaps during the PowerPoint publicly posted in advance with the rest of the progress report and then we would come back in our next board meeting and we could adopt or accept the progress monitoring report without discussion if all of the answers have been responded to so are there any questions or clarifications on that before I turned it over to the administration for the presentation I will turn it over to you before thank you madam chair members of the board and Dr Blakey

[00:25:00]
we are happy to be here this evening to speak on the progress of goal number two focusing on our students outcomes in mathematics for 6 7th and 8th grade we do appreciate your questions they're really helpful guide us in the work and they also provide us insight as far as what your interests are around the work as well we this process of progress monitoring has evolved since we started we've learned a lot each time we go through this process and as we transition between superintendents we know that the process is going to evolve even more so we do thank you for your feedback and your input as we try to work to make them as clear concise and just easy to to understand and comprehend overall so thank you for that before we get started I do want to introduce my colleague

[00:26:00]
who is he's the associate superintendent for goal 2 Augustine with our Middle Schools staff leaders and students so thank you for being here all right so as we begin looking at interim goal 2.1 that states that the percentage of 6th grade students identified in the Yazi Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency or above as predicted by i-Ready will increase from 16.6% in May of 2023 to 22.6% in May of 2026 so when we look at the progress in the specific interim we can see that since the fall of 23 the average math proficiency rates for 6th graders grew by 5.7% points from 17.5 to 23.2%

[00:27:00]
when we look at our specific student groups are you Ozzie Martinez and African-American student groups they grew by 6.4% points from 9.9 to 16.3% additionally students in our targeted student groups they haven't yet returned to the pre-pandemic math Provisions rates but we are getting closer and exceeding mid-year rates from the past two years by nearly 4% points so when you look at midyear from 2022 to 2024 we see a growth from 12.4 to 16.3 in Grove we also look at your math Proficiency in the targeted group is close to the end rates for the past two years so our mid-year rate this year

[00:28:00]
16.3 percent students proficient or Advanced and that's comparative or close to the end of your rates for the previous two years the concern with this data is that well are targeted student groups are making progress and seeing an increase we're not seeing an increase at the rate of speed and outcome as are all other students who are not in our students targeted groups which did see increase from 45.6% to 62.9% with

[00:29:00]
goal of grade level proficiency or above as predicted by i-Ready will increase from 13% of May of 2023 to 19% in May of 2026 so as we go on the journey to look at this specific grade level we see that our math proficiency rate for 7th grade students grew overall by 5.3% points from 13.2 to 18.5 when we look at our targeted group specifically in the 7th grade we see that they grew by 6.5% points from 6.4 percent the beginning of the year 2012 9.99 as we compare interim assessments for the targeted groups of students over the last couple of years we see that they have stayed on

[00:30:00]
steady in where they are when you compare your mid-year and end-of-year assessments we do have some concerns like 6th grade we see that our students in the targeted groups are not improving at the rate of other all other students so we recognize that that is a constant from 6 to 7 grade we see that our 7th graders who are not Yazzie Martinez group from Fall of 233 143 percentage points from 37.9 to 5022 so we see that as a constant with the 6th grade moving on to 3 is a focus on our 8th grade students identified Martinez decision plus African-American students who demonstrate grade level proficiency of

[00:31:00]
Addicted by i-Ready will increase from 14% in May of 23 to 20% in May of 26th so since the fall of 23 the average math proficiency rate for our 8th grade students grew by 4.5% points from 14.2 percent to 18.7% the proficiency rate for our Yazzie Martinez and African-American student groups grew by 5.5% in points from 7% to 12.5% when we look at progress the mid-year math proficiency rate of the targeted group cohort increase over last year when students were in 7th grade so when we look at their mid-year the same cohort when they were 7th graders last year was 10.3 per cent and this year as their 8th graders at 12.5%

[00:32:00]
the meteor proficiency rate for our targeted student groups is higher than it was at this time in the past two years and near where it was pre-pandemic so we can see from the year 2020 to 2024 we are at 12.95% some of our concerns like in the 7th and 7th grade our students in our targeted student groups aren't improving at the rate of our student group the other students who saw an increase of 15.2% from 38.9 percent to 54.1% and again like the other grades are targeted student groups

[00:33:00]
yet returned to pre-pandemic math proficiency so this chart is grade level or above Proficiency in math and we can see that the blue line is percent of 6th graders the red is 7th graders the yellow is 8th graders and the green dash dash line is our 5 year old so this demonstrates different cohorts of students at different times of the year whether it be beginning of your middle of your and end of year for the past few years that's reflected in the other charts when we look at the next chart this is looking at the same cohort of students over at 6th graders so we can see at the beginning of the year that

[00:34:00]
is a slight decrease when we look at their middle of year we can see that there is an increase for their middle of year and looking at the line from start of 2324 - 2324 it's a pretty moderate increase and so we are hopeful that the projection will demonstrate at the end of your assessment that our students will be higher than previous years we do have another chart I'm not sure if you will have this chart with you yes okay so this one here is just mid-year comparison

[00:35:00]
your viewing and so we can see that in the 1920 22 23 and 24 year when we hit the pandemic we see a dip which is natural but now we're starting to see that Progressive incline in the curve and so again with this information in the data we are hopeful that we are going to continue to see these games over time and now we can talk a little bit about what's going well in relation to this school and the first thing is we can celebrate that all teachers district-wide have access to high-quality instructional materials and interventions we are excited to complement these materials with units of study which will bring them to like even more so that we are able to support our teachers with units of study that they're able to use as tools especially our new teachers as they're able to break up the curriculum

[00:36:00]
and execute that work we know that all of our middle school principals are trained in math interventions and have access to monitoring tools so they have been trained not only on the intervention work but how to access the data to coach their teachers to support their teachers with ongoing training and professional development we're really excited honestly because we're almost finished with our first walkthrough to monitor on Route 3 which is a monitoring the use of District to proved instructional materials and that will continue on Friday as a little bit of three rooms to be able to inform the board on soon in relationship to the use of high quality instructional materials grade level standards in differentiation in our classrooms all schools have critical actions that are aligned to go to as part of their 90-day plans so they're taking this work and they are

[00:37:00]
macro work in making it a little bit more of a micro version in their school level 90-day plan and all of that has happened at every one of our middle schools so specificity to the work is becoming more and more realized more than 95% of our middle schoolers took the i-Ready interim assessment that is a huge we know that students enroll and with raw daily transfer schools will be able to be able to hit that Mark and even exceed it is something to be very proud of so we have concrete reliable data that we are able to present to you School scoreboard illustrate leaders impacting go to progress walking to schools we see that the data is coming to life so data literacy is becoming something that's being embraced in our campuses so they're able to have conversations on an ongoing basis as opposed to waiting for annual assessment data to come at the end of the year they look at it just for

[00:38:00]
the following year know these conversations are happening really in 30 day increments as they inform themselves in a adjusting their 90-day plan and ongoing training to strengthen their data literacy and continuous Improvement Cycles is ongoing with our schools and principals we know that there needs to be Improvement in some areas a couple that we want to just bring to the attention of the board is we recognize that the support to increase and improve the use of District adopted materials is ongoing so really we have them in the hands of teachers we have them in the classrooms but I'm going support for implementation ongoing support for Effective utilization of these tools is something that we will have to do really moving into the future as a support to not only this school but all of the

[00:39:00]
what does and specifically on guard rail 3 conspiracy in applying multi-layered systems of support approach in math instruction specifically with targeted and intensive interventions is something that we know needs to be worked on we have had deep conversations about on Intervention and its correlation to enrichment and acceleration for all of our students regardless of the level in which they are achieving at we know that the push needs to be relevant and obvious for every single one of our students so how do we support our teachers in making that real for every one of our students so we are in scheduling season in the world of it and those are conversations that we are having with principles as they have one leg in this school year and another next school year in setting up the systems and structures to do things just like this

[00:40:00]
as we anticipate on moving the goal along and the continuous Improvement and hopefully growth they're in we've done something a little bit different to contextualize next steps and we hope to bring this aspect to life even more as we move along the progress monitoring journey is connecting our next steps to the Strategic priorities within the context of the Strategic plan so they are not separate initiatives they are one and the work plan the Strategic priorities within the Strategic plan we hope to bring to your attention and make connections as we move forward with showing the Strategic priorities brought to life within the context of progress monitoring for example we recognize that under strategic priority to rigorous instruction we need to support that high quality District adopted instructional materials that we

[00:41:00]
woke up earlier quality teaching committee developing grade-level units of studies to support quality classroom instruction those units of study is something that we are really excited about and the plan is really to have the first several units available to teachers at the beginning of next school year so we can assist them and getting a strong start to the school year as we continue to build these units of study for the entire year for ELA and math K through 12 so we're working with our teachers really frustrating teacher voice in making sure that these schools are applicable and usable by them and it's heavy work it's a lot of work really connecting dots and making them relevant support for their work and a developed a district wide approach to math acceleration kind of talking about that intervention and

[00:42:00]
celebration for every single student within the system is something we are in fact hoping to embed into the professional development at the launch of the new school year with this topic being really front and center in relationship to strategic Priority One which is clear instruction is posted scoreboards illustrating lead measures impacting gold to progress so that there's that culture of data literacy there's that continuous focus on the journey that each school is taking based on their 98 plan which is informed by the school and finally strategic priority 33 engage students is really making sure that we have all of our students engaged in relationship to consistent application of the multi-layered system of supports with Target

[00:43:00]
didn't specific interventions for our students so just wanting to connect this to the work of the Strategic plan Our intention moving forward is to bring specific strategic priorities and name them in the work of the next steps as we move forward and really connecting the work of the goals with the Strategic plan and with that Madam president members of the board We Stand ready to answer your questions great thank you dot Bowman we will now open up the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we've asked questions that are technical or tactical we had the opportunity to ask questions that were technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting so we will not be asking those tonight and I asked for support from other board members to ensure that we're not as an example technical questions are questions to understand how

[00:44:00]
is measured tactical questions are to understand how or by whom something is done so we're going to focus on strategic questions but your questions to understand how something aligns to the goals in guardrails I also want to know that we have received training on ineffective questions as well so we are going to try to refrain from using those also examples of an effective questions include anything that is really just a board member opinion or a recommendation around the what the superintendent or the district should do so we will refrain from trying to give you advice on what to do in the guise of a question anything that is a statement request that doesn't reference the data included in the report or requested by the board anything that isn't actually a question but it's just a statement or an opinion any statement or question about what will happen next to the isn't grounded in previously asked questions or again in the report and

[00:45:00]
no I want to know again that we there was some concern around whether the report included all of the criteria I think you did provide much of the needed criteria including in the line graphs that we saw which allow us to see students compared year to year and a year year year year year year of year to year and beginning of the year to year I think the concern is that information and that interpretation was not included in our progress monitoring report so since we didn't have it in the report we may not accept the report but we also may not decline to accept the report we could just table it until later so that's that's that and there's one another that I have here but we'll go ahead and move to question I'll start on the right and we'll go through one question at a time and then

[00:46:00]
so my question is specifically around when we talked about support support for the staff I guess I want to know exactly what is support me and are we talking about training are we talking about accountability how are we measuring what support is in order to reach the outcomes that work but support strategies are you using to read support strategies are you using to reach the final goal of the or outcomes thank you thank you the aligned professional development that we give to teachers but also to principals so that it can get to that second layer where principles are then

[00:47:00]
go to go into classrooms and Coach their teachers provide an ongoing feedback to the teachers so I think it's it's this ongoing process multi-layer from District to the school by means of getting to that classroom because we know that in the classroom is where the real change is going to happen and so providing our principles they've been through 2 years of really impactful professional development to help craft their knowledge their approach and expertise and so now it's utilizing what they learn in the content specific professional development to then go back to the school rain within the school with all the teachers and provide that feedback as they visit classrooms Madam president Trump's in response to that specific

[00:48:00]
what is a recognition that a relaunch a refocus on the standards is something that we know we need to really delve on and build off of as we move into the new school year at a very fundamental level by grade level what are those essential standards what are the standards relevant to math for example in this case and how do we embed them and bring them into life in the units of study and I think we're really the hope is that we're really going to see something really pop when we get these units of study in the hands of teachers the compliment the materials the second point is I'm going to support for our teachers and principals in the use of the materials for example we've been doing these walkthroughs to really inform ourselves of what's happening in our classrooms

[00:49:00]
recognize that materials will never be the Silver Bullet independent of high quality teaching so supporting our teachers in their pedagogy and their methodology and their practice is absolutely critical as we complement the materials with that so our teachers and our principles have gotten training just a couple of weeks ago at a principal's meeting we really had a conversation with our principles around how do we ensure that if a classroom is not what is high quality instructional materials we know what district adopted is but if it's not being used what is the conversation that we can have the indicators of really being a support to what is being used and really being

[00:50:00]
are you friends with each other as we really promote what's happening in each one of our classrooms so that's another example as we move forward and finally as we do these learning walks and these walkthroughs feedback to the schools on what we're seeing in short order so as we walk away our soccer team has been very generous with their time and expertise and committing to get our schools kind of a read on this is what we're seeing so that our principles have another at their disposal to have conversations with their staff as we journey along the line of the specifically thank you and ask one more relationship to the tool that we talked about how quick are we getting the feedback to principals and teachers so they can make

[00:51:00]
adjustment says needed Madam president we've had these conversations we conclude on Friday so we are we are done with our 3 week window and we will have visited I believe over 200 classrooms district-wide to provide the next sample and our commitment from our soccer team and somebody will pitch me if I'm not correct is really as early as next week to get that date so that they have their school level data so that they're able to have a read a measure feedback I mean if I'm up and I have a team going into a school to kind of provide some I want to know I mean I want to have feedback to be able to discuss at a staff meeting to visit with teachers about to support teachers as we move along so

[00:52:00]
very soon thank you thank you remember thank you for your presentation I have two questions my first one is what strategies has your team used to close the learning Gap that students have experienced due to online learning during the pandemic and how can us as board members support these efforts and improve students so Madam chair board member historico and Dr Blakey we have really put a strong effort into our multi-layered systems of support and training our teachers on what that looks like schoolwide to make sure that we are trying to really Target the needs of every student and that is a big challenge but I think we're now utilizing we're starting to hear the utilization of common language sharing of best practices and we also have additional tools and resources I know that we

[00:53:00]
partnered with paper for additional tutoring and we finally got it to where students can access at 24/7 so that's also exciting and we've seen an increase in the use of so there's that we have looked specifically at like our Master scheduling process because a master schedule will make or break a school and we have been coaching principals have been identifying you know key areas of support looking at Equity across schools to see who has what and why and why this school may have this and this one doesn't so we've been working on that but I think specifically targeting those the the learning loss that took place during the pandemic is a real strong focus in the MLS process

[00:54:00]
is there an opportunity in the grass that you presented just now for a root cause analysis for an in particular for our Marty and African-American subgroups I don't know if opportunity are you considering

[00:55:00]
because I'm not saying that in the report in particular with the subgroups that we've focused on that and a good example of that is at each School level they're 90-day plan calls for a specific and intentional root cause analysis around later one instruction in this case math so since we know that one of the things we're celebrating is that every middle schools 90-day plan is connected at this point to this school it is fair to say that a root cause analysis has been done around this content area in relation

[00:56:00]
we can definitely bring examples or share examples they exist at this time at every school's 90-day plan and that is something that is readily available I think if we're talking about the school's 90-day plans we do have those archived on our internal site and we can provide as many school

[00:57:00]
I am being told that that's out of our lane so that is content for the superintendent Administration to be evaluating and assessing whereas we shouldn't be reviewing 90 Day plans but I think the question as to understanding root causes of the challenges and strategies to address the root causes versus symptoms is the relevant information that we do need and can have so as that progresses I think that would be helpful to to be sharing any more follow-ups not right now I don't feel like some of the questions I asked initially were answered fully so I don't know if it's

[00:58:00]
I think I'll do an email which I think is entirely appropriate particularly if we table the acceptance of the report so they'll be an opportunity to ask more technical tactical and more follow up and make sure that we have all the information we need in order to know if the criteria is there to accept so remember I'm going to be this thank you first of all congratulations on getting 95% participation on the interim assessment that's fantastic and I'm sure it was no easy task and so my question which I know is strategic because I submitted it ahead of time and was told that strategic I'm going to ask it again so within the progress monitoring reports for each grade level 6 7 8 the first comment under what is not going well is the need to increase the use and support for the use of District adopted curriculum is the use of the curriculum optional for teachers and if so what is

[00:59:00]
what strategy is in place to encourage its use if mandatory does a strategy exist to address the use of non-district adopted curriculum at a presidential materials in every one of our classrooms and it should be facilitated without exception now the question comes into play if materials are being used that are not District adopted and that is really the place in which we find ourselves working with our principles to really look at the different indicators there's nine on three of us culturally linguistically responsive research-based Etc that facilitate a conversation so if not this what

[01:00:00]
and talk to me about how it meets the aforementioned criteria as to ensure that it is a high-quality material that will facilitate the teaching of grade level standards so absolutely we celebrate the art form the creativity of teaching we want there to be innovation in the classroom but we feel a responsibility as a district to make sure that we provide the Baseline in the materials in which we provide and that we support with the number of schools that we have supports a real question and our ability to do it well is another question on right now we have several resource teachers throughout the district to support our math departments in their roll out and implementation of the curriculum and really helping

[01:01:00]
let him get as close to pass as possible to doing what we're asking within the school any follow-up sets that we need for a progress monitoring report and one of that is evidence evidence that shows and under the superintendent understands how the data looks the way it does and throughout your presentation I heard the Youth of the word hope a lot and I too am very hopeful but hope is not a strategy and so what my question is is how how can you

[01:02:00]
show a direct correlation to the increases that you are seeing to what it is that you all are doing instead of it just being a natural bump that might have occurred anyway so my question is do you have evidence where you can say this worked really well at a school that had a and I'm not asking you to name specific schools but did you look at this is really working well we saw an increase here we and this is a strategy that worked really well here and there was a decrease or maybe not a significant of an increase over here or what did they do differently was there a compare and contrast to show specific evidence as to why we're seeing these increases Madam chair board member Jackson and Dr Blakey

[01:03:00]
we pulled the data and we identified the growth of the top 10 middle schools and the ones who had the least amount of growth and there were some anomalies like wow what are they doing and so I know that our associate in team are looking into that I would have to say what we would we have had a very strong focus on this and trying to align what is happening at the district down to the school level down to the classroom I think a stronger alignment that's ever happened in the past everybody is like I said utilizing the same language as the same understanding of where the what the goal is and is working toward that we have goals which is a big deal

[01:04:00]
so I think just that shift in Focus we're looking at like I said Master schedules to look at the time that is being allocated to literacy and numeracy within the master schedule how intervention and acceleration is taking place within the core class versus being pulled out to have that were the kids then miss their core instruction so I would say again we are expecting our Middle School all schools but specifically for this school are middle schools to be tracking how they are what they are doing at the school site level based on their 90-day plan to monitor they all identified a lead measure maybe it's going to be that they are taking 20 minutes you know each day to focus on something a specific skill and

[01:05:00]
monitoring that over time and so they're doing those specific things with the outcome in mind so we don't have direct correlation I think that would take a deeper dive so we can we're starting to do that but again when we look historically at the data we can see that the trajectory is is positive and so and word president and members of the board and to to go on that subject I have asked the team as we kind of do this transition and I'm getting more involved in the work of the team and doing the progress monitoring I have asked them to look at what the top growth in schools are and which schools are struggling because I think to your point there's a lot that we can learn from

[01:06:00]
positive practices that are being done currently in schools and the more principles are we might have a school that was struggling and went the wrong way and we saw some schools that had huge growth and if those principles can have that conversation I think it gives them some realization and some promising practices that they can incorporate and then we could build on rather than trying to pull something out like you know from somewhere we think is a good idea but to see what's actually working in our schools for some of our kids because we have when I reviewed the data at Quick Glance for school we have some schools doing some pretty amazing growth that is beyond the like trajectory of what would be the norm and we have some that are struggling and I think the more we're able to build those connections so that schools are able to coordinate with each other to see what they're doing in order to get those girls I think that will have a faster increase in

[01:07:00]
we see in the classroom as far as the proficiency this Madam chair board member Jackson and Dr Blakey one of the things that you're seeing here in this set of monitoring reports is that it does start with the goals and what you're seeing over the this last year is a lot of work developing the methods by which we intend to track both the goal and the progress towards the goal and so it's kind of tricky to go back a few years and say well what did you do now that made changes back then or were you making changes back then when we didn't have the focus of the goals to sort of guide that work and so I would just say like kind of these are sort of still early conversations in the basement lighting conversations but you are seeing you know now we did go out to 200 some other classrooms and say are we using high quality instructional materials we didn't

[01:08:00]
really know the answer to that question a few years back at least not in a in a quantifiable way and so these goals and guard rails have helped and build the structure to measure it and I would anticipate that in the future not just like we're looking at the top 10 the bottom 10 are also working on a more sophisticated methods to practice and to be able to say stronger to make stronger inferences about what and why so this is Early times is kind of like the summary of that it's early times we're building the structure and in the future will be able to see more yes and again I the work that you guys have done is like Monumental and very much appreciated what I'm slightly concerned about is kind of based on what you just said is that the message is being determined

[01:09:00]
right now so if we look at like just looking at 7th grade math where the mid-years are all the same how how how how can you how can you say that we're staying if we're staying steady how does that correlate to us improving or being on track to 12.99% increase I'm looking at page 10 years from 22 to 23 and 24 or all within like that 13.05

[01:10:00]
I want to get to member don't worry too but I think my question might be related to what you're trying to ask so maybe remember don't worry too thank you madam president and board members you know I'm looking at all of this it is the lack of how are we going to move forward and I know with all the multiple visits that have occurred could you tell me when we're looking at the multi-layer system of support and doing things differently what is going to look like and based on your visits how did you determine that that needed to change and so it could be so we could be more effective in reaching these goals

[01:11:00]
Madam president member Tom burrito members of the board Dr Blakey kind of two questions or two thoughts on the first is how do we identify the multi-layer system of support as an area of intentional Focus as we look at this goal and I think part of that conversation is a couple of things recognizing the need to ensure common language system-wide around what this is and it is not the beginning to the process or to special education but rather it is an opportunity to intervene to support to be strategic in the way we are individualized with our students in a very scientific way is something that we recognized

[01:12:00]
baby is not as comprehensive or has not been done as well as it should be the good news is we now have mlss coaches that are deployed district-wide to support this work and to ensure that we are doing it well and facilitate staff capacity with this now for is for we the argument can be made that we need more but we are learning a lot from the input they're giving us and that input that they are giving us we hope to we hope it matriculates to other departments so that we build a broader span of MLS support within our curriculum and instruction Department within our Language and Cultural Equity Department the work of Title 1 etcetera so that we're building a culture of acceleration and intervention

[01:13:00]
I'm within every one of our departments so that the facilitates common language and common support to schools so that's the first thought in relationship to that piece the second part of your question I think had to do with the walkthroughs is that correct and what we're learning through the walkthroughs yes what are you saying that you know one because you mentioned it has to be done differently and with these multi layers of support so I was just asking what do your walkthroughs are you saying that needs to be done differently thank you madam chair board member tell me more it has been a really great experience to be in the schools and in the classrooms to see what our teachers and students are doing when we say we need to work on mlss and the process

[01:14:00]
what were primarily seeing is a steadfast commitment to layer 1 and there is not a bridge to layer to within the classroom so we're seeing a lot of whole group direct instruction and I think you know we also have seen small groups but I think that's more of a collaborative structure rather than an intentional practice to take some more time to give more targeted support to certain groups of students and so when what we've learned is that we do need to work on layers too and also for the students who are in need of even greater support more intensive support what does that look like within the school and what are we doing as a district to support the school to be able to implement that without really

[01:15:00]
having to pull students out of their Core Curriculum and if I may not have President Trump in relationship to that is I think a lot of what you are referencing may be found within the context of guardrail 3.3 differentiation and through our process of Designing the tool that is being used to gather the data that we're going to use to inform our next steps I'm excited to see what that looks like in relationship to the notion of differentiation within the classroom so that that can help us inform our professional development or support our conversation I think I'm not going to come from looking at the data and being able to inform our next steps as we conclude on Friday this

[01:16:00]
what's the official run through ourselves thank you anymore follow-ups to that number to it's one more as we're talking about the high quality instruction and that were that our teachers are receiving could you explain just the pathway that this is proceeding for our substitute teachers I would appreciate just you know the steps that it's taking the not only give them the high quality instruction but are you seeing outcomes with that or are you saying benefits through that or have you put those things in place so I think this one maybe tactical okay substitute teachers were not mentioned at the report okay that's good then that would be a fine tactical email follow-up question I will do that thank you

[01:17:00]
all right so I think this Builds on member Jackson's question and I think member astoria's question around targeting students particular students who are experiencing the greatest gaps so in your presentation you said students in the Target group aren't improving at the rate of other students we're not seeing an increase at the rate of all other students so my question is if we're not seeing it increases amongst those student groups the target groups how can we write this on track and why aren't we seeing increases amongst those Target groups so I think the fundamental question for me is why are we considering this progress to be on track versus off track because I would be very comfortable with an assessment that our progress is off track because as I look at the state and as I look at second digit single digit proficiency reach rates I think we owe it to the public to be on

[01:18:00]
list about this is not acceptable but I guess what I'm looking for is just given that students in Target groups aren't improving can you justify why you're reading them on track by everything overalls on track Madam chair members of the board and Dr Blakey when we looked at the data and interpreted the data we looked comparatively at middle of you are beginning of year longitudinally as well as middle of your end of year and so with that we did see increases and are Yazzie Martinez and African-American student groups we did see the increase we didn't see it at the rate of our other students but we did see an increase and so with that if we look at our Target it looks based off of historical

[01:19:00]
data and trajectories that we would be on track to hit our goal and so that is where we looked to see our students are progressing and the trajectory is at a pretty good incline to meet our goal the president and members of the board as doctors said we are at the midpoints higher than we were at the end points or just about the same of May and the goal itself although we see the Gap the goal itself as written doesn't address the Gap particularly its addressing the growth of the students identified in this decision so although the team added in what the Gap looks like

[01:20:00]
that isn't necessarily connected to meeting the goal itself right but I guess the question is then how can you meet the goal if Yazi Martinez students aren't accelerating at a greater rate and so it doesn't involve the rest of the students and the growth that we typically see from middle of year to end of year historically is on track to hit the 22% or 19% which admittedly is a is not a very it's not a bar that we would like to stop where we would like to stop but and if I stated with that particular goal the girl that we typically see is on track to get it

[01:21:00]
again do we want to stop at 22 percent for 19 percentage is that students in the Target group aren't improving or aren't improving at the rate so if we're going to try to meet these goals particularly from Martinez Yazzie students we need to improve at an accelerated rate they need to be improving at a rate more than the Noni Martinez students and so for me it was very helpful to see in the report the beginning of the year to beginning of year and end of year to end of your middle of your 10 middle of you and so having that and having different types of graphs going forward informed that I think the question that remember Jackson asked around sort of the correlation and because we're here a lot of we hope and we think and we don't know which is why for me I feel that the interpretation of the evidence are not in the report I think for me in the prior goal to reports we were very Baseline like

[01:22:00]
we had just the Baseline data and just the beginning of year so I was more open to accepting but now I think since I'm still hearing so much of we hope and we think and we don't know and not seeing the complimentary progress for me that's concerning so we will go back through the line to see if there's any other questions that are strategic in nature from the board I have one just going off of board members are some examples of good implementation of high quality instruction and interventions that you did see during your walkthroughs and how can we engage more schools in using these strategies or processes Madam chair board member historica and Dr Blakey in our walkthroughs when we visited two high schools we were really pleased to see that when we went into 9

[01:23:00]
play classrooms they were utilizing they were all learning about Romeo and Juliet and that the teachers were utilizing the resource to help provide access to the students to be able to access the grade level standards that was something that I don't know that we would have been seeing even last year when we walk into Algebra 1 classrooms we would see the same thing and students would be engaging in the work teachers would be utilizing the instructional materials to be checking for understanding students would be self-assess working and groups to problem solve together and so I think those are some of the things that we are looking to continue and to hopefully you know that it will grow throughout the district this was just Dr Gonzalez and I going to two of our high schools we saw about 35 class

[01:24:00]
which was really it was really exciting and again you know when we were in an 11th grade classroom and they were reading you know the same thing students were engaged in the same instruction having access to the same methodologies teachers may have been using different tools to teach but the materials that they were using were similar and so that was encouraging for us because we in visiting classrooms before I don't know that we would have necessarily seen thank you I want to Circle back around to Dr Bowman's comments and correct me if I'm off on I heard you say that there is progress will be it not where we wanted to be so there are

[01:25:00]
success would you that are there are there is success for the subgroups and so what what are what are you all noticing about what's working in those situations the proficiency for the subgroup is increasing so it's not it's not necessary saying that there are absolutely Pockets that can be determined from this particular report however I would sort of toss it over here to my right

[01:26:00]
what did you see for folks who are doing really well no president I get the bike and I get to tell you the great work that we're doing that and middle school and hopefully not go too off rail here the the overall aspect of the data that we're seeing is is we are growing out of better rate than we have over the last year's when you look at it it's not just like a pocket or one or two we are growing at rates that are faster and higher than before and it's not just a random bump or it just kind of happened it was a effort that we have put into play with your goals and workbook forth with the direction of from leadership to our

[01:27:00]
they have embraced more so than in the past use of high-quality instructional material the cni department has done a fantastic job and offering two full days of total professional development for our teachers every math teacher in the middle school has had an opportunity to learn from the very best of what it is that we are trying to implement and how that implementation is happening we have a unified computer base program of IXL that we are using for acceleration remediation that goes with that we have provided the professional development we will provide more in looking at the data today with their has been over 12 million on IXL where that is my middle school students with the highest usage here are using that in an opportunity to Target skills that they might not have had

[01:28:00]
and a teacher is learning how to access that material to better teach the student and to better support the student as they're going through is it perfect no but is it better than it's ever been with with this direction I'm going to say yes and I'm going to say that our principles are doing a fantastic job and I'm going to say that we as a unified group is growing here I mean that the math you know my simple simplest of the math is if we don't run out of gas our little rocket ship is going to meet the line that we want to reach we are there with it and I'm saying with the direction that we're doing it's not just you know you know two years ago two years ago were here to reach our goal and I think that is a part of what we're attempting to do we have the want we want to do it we have the wheel now to do

[01:29:00]
where we're trying to get to and I think that is something that we're we're losing sight of is that it is kind of like the New Year's resolution right we're going to do this you know I've lost 10 lbs I want to lose more but I'm I'm 10 lb lighter than I was on January 1st and it's because I've changed my adult Behavior our teachers are changing their adult Behavior our kids are changing their behavior our community is seeing the importance of it that's able to to go from so I hope that answers that it is not just Pockets I'm working with our 90 day 18 to look at the critical actions that we have in place to be able to say are we really like those critical actions they're lying to 90 plans that go to the Garden to go to but are we having that impact with it and then we'll be able to measure those and try to embrace it and share it with our principles

[01:30:00]
but we are trying to tighten things up right so I noticed that the what is working and what was not working we're copy and pasted into all three sections right like the they were all saying between 670 and I also noticed that kind of

[01:31:00]
it was working focuses on what is working is like what the administration is doing and maybe what's not working focuses more on the schools so my question is what strategies have you all developed as an Administration to kind of self-reflect on your understanding of what your role and your part what data what information you need to adapt in order to really change the or to stay on the trajectory that we are on but also to kind of address you know some of the questions that we have Madam president member Jackson thank you for that question I think what you just outlined has been our conversation over the last couple of months just reflecting a little bit if I may to the beginning of this journey we when we start our First Progress monitoring

[01:32:00]
you were given here's the instructions and this is the methodology that we use to present this work to the board and it was a very prescribed process step by step and we were wanting to do good by it it was a new process to us progress monitoring in this fashion was on you so that took us through the first several months and then we kind of got the hang of it and we kind of recognize that a very fundamental level we need to do a better job telling the story and we need to recognize it really resonated when we heard this is a conversation with the board to the community so that was very helpful because this presentation should be a conversation that we have with our community I mean recognizing that they're watching

[01:33:00]
and we don't need a PhD in education to understand the conversation we're having we shouldn't need to we should it should be a conversation that is dynamic in that way so a couple of things that we've kind of tossed around within the conversation is as we're looking at what's working well and what's not working well is I think it is fair to say that we have done due diligence within our group our goal teams to Define that work to talk to principals about that work to look at the data to see what the interpretation is to work with our supper team to really be best informed on what that looks like but I think under the direction of our incoming superintendent is how does the data help us tell that story so really looking at okay fine who are the top 10 schools who are the bottom schools and really

[01:34:00]
what are the celebrations what are the challenges and really through that process through that protocol teasing out what those what's going well are and helping our informing ourselves through that way and informing our methodology and letting the data tell the story in a more powerful in a more exciting way as we get more sophisticated with this process is something that I think we're embracing we're trying to see how to do there is Nuance we will recognize in the goals so really finding that protocol that will make sense for maybe go one and two and then maybe it will be different for both three maybe four because the goals are specific they should be specific so and then to Dr Bowman's Place Dr Bowman's point and then through that process maybe

[01:35:00]
complimenting it with a very scientific approach to the conversation around the data as he mentioned earlier and complimenting that process so these conversations I mean I think yesterday we had a conversation anticipation of go 3 which will be coming to you in about a month and I got to tell you it was one of the funnest progress monitoring strategy sessions I've been a part of in a long time because we're pushing ourselves to tell the story and we're pushing yourself to really align the work and also bring the story to life to our schools and our end users because we have been over the last several months sharing this exact work with our principals at the next principal meeting so there's that connection but I think we all recognize

[01:36:00]
play the need to tell that story and perhaps a way that connects more with our community Madam president Jackson the answer the question where it's where we seen from the school level how are we getting in there to hear that we have a Cadence of accountability that we use with our principal meetings and which they're able to share their their goals that they set for their their 40s and the important goals and I got the point that we had all of our principles together all of our middle school principals together broken up in different tables and they're sharing their work they're sharing what they're doing that is having an impact on the students

[01:37:00]
learning that is tied to go to so everyone is there and they're talking about this is what we're targeting this is how we're working this is how we're adding interventions this is how we were using advancement this is where we're looking at our scheduling for next year and and the great part about it is I'm there on my PSS Chris Sanchez who does remarkable job is there Shelly Henderson from special ed she's there and and we are listening to our principals and in what they're doing and and it's not as hovering over and you know making sure they're doing it but allowing the professionalism of where are they having best practices and where are we sharing those best practices and we give them time in a meeting structure to do that and it's balanced it's not just random ones to talk the most we have certain people who have opportunities to speak but we have that Cadence of accountability that we are targeting the work and importantly putting it in front of

[01:38:00]
as a reminder because you're going to have to speak next week means you have to have your stuff ready to go and then they own that because they don't want to show up and and be the one who doesn't have it and and I and I give a lot of credit to my to my support staff but also credit to our principles for their professionalism and they're leaving their cause in their schools thank you yes I I want to affirm my acknowledgment that I know that you guys have been working very very hard and we also have a process that we have to align to and so I think the discussion that has occurred tonight certainly has garnered more evidence and especially Mr Hughes with you saying we're growing at a better rate and are faster than ever before that's incredible information

[01:39:00]
for us to learn but it wasn't in the report and so when we have to accept a report whether you know whether it's on track whether the evidence is there I will just say right now I'm not totally comfortable accepting it I think it absolutely could this discussion could be summarized and sent to us but again we're we're learning and I'm thrilled because I know that there are people who are watching at home because I know how I know this because I get emails afterwards saying thank you so much but they also have questions so I think this was a fruitful discussion I would encourage well I'm not going to make a suggestion it was a fruitful discussion is some of that information was evidence but it needed to be in the report and if I may have a board president board member Jackson just so the team can have Clarity on how to make it more

[01:40:00]
clear as far as what Mr Hughes is saying so on slide 10 it is it would that be helpful to put something like that on all of the slides that have the gross so slight 10 says March 2024 progress monitoring interim gold 2.2 7th grade math and the progress that the team put out says mid-year math proficiency rates for targeted groups of students are nearly as high as and your rates from the past two years mid-year is 12.9% and your last year was 13 and your 2022 is 13.1 would that type of language on the other goals be helpful to show the progress superintendent I want to get to the last potential question from home and I know there's also additional technical

[01:41:00]
questions that need to be submitted from the board so I think if we if we submit those technical questions via email we can also submit to you or to board services to relate to the administration what what it is that we would need to be able to accept the report does that work but I do think I do think the graphs that are here are like fantastic and exactly what would we would need that's my point of view remember tomorrow do you have any additional questions just one I'm just really appreciative of how we're changing things up and you know as we're going back to Arkansas that we have to change our narrative and I'm glad they're very aware of that and I just appreciate everything they're doing and I know this is a new system and we're trying to also maintain to our roles but I appreciate everything they're doing and it's more of just a gratitude that all I want

[01:42:00]
thank you great thank you and I just want to confirm are there any more strategic questions from the board I guess I'd like clarification to be I'm going back to superintendent Dr blakey's question what we want from the presentation in the future it would help me to as well okay so would it be okay if we move ahead with the progress monitoring and then if it turns out that we don't accept the reporter table and then we shift to that

[01:43:00]
and the interpretation from the superintendent of system performance as well as evidence and what's missing is an interpretation from the I'll say Administration on why it's rated on track I think we received that in the conversation but it was not included in the report I think that's one thing I think the second is the graphs that compare year to year not cohort growth over time so beginning of year to beginning of year to beginning of year for sixth grade and that's what you had in the report and so I do think those line charts are what we need to see

[01:44:00]
and then to member Jackson's Point around evidence and plan the third element didn't seem to be in there either and so I think we just need what what Dr Gonzalez provided in his answer more narrative on why the strategies you've selected in terms of walk through the line period what evidence do you have to support the claim that those things are going to lead to increases in student outcomes documentation that evidence is a super I think that's what I just said yeah are there others other responses to questions I mean I think I think you encapsulated it I think the main thing is when you

[01:45:00]
hey we are growing at a faster rate than ever before why I mean I think I think you said it and we had this discussion here but if I looked at the report I don't know that I would be able to say why you are growing at a faster rate and why 6 7th and 8th grade might be different because right now it's just cut and paste like they're you're doing the same work supposedly at 6:00 7th and 8th grade but they've got to be different and I'm assuming that they're different how are they different and and so I think the question that I kept asking myself was okay but why and I didn't see concrete evidence that answers the why I think the last thing I'll just say is

[01:46:00]
they're not created yet but for what it's worth that's one of the dimensions is supposed to be on the report as well or is there any additional discussion on this report so I want to thank the administration for all of your work putting together this report your responses but more importantly all the work that you're doing in the district to improve mouth outcomes overall and I just want to respond to Dr Gonzalez's comment around this is a dialogue with our community and it's an opportunity to tell the story of the change that's going to happen and I think to really acknowledge your point around this is a shift this is a shift in the way of doing business this is a shift in the way of measuring how we do business it's a shift in adult Behavior

[01:47:00]
and we are all learning as we go and so I think learning is hard learning in public is even harder and so I just want to acknowledge that it doesn't feel good to be told you're not doing enough for this isn't on track or whatever or that are your questions aren't good or your questions are wrong in this way but just acknowledging that this is all part of continuous Improvement and we're all learning as we go and we need to be transparent about how we're learning and how we're improving because that's what our community demands of us and so I think is any one of us starts to feel defensive about we are not doing enough we're not asking the right types of questions or anything just to acknowledge that this is just continuous Improvement we're trying to get better for the sake of our students and so with that at this point I will entertain a motion on this monitoring report

[01:48:00]
remove to table the progress monitoring report for gold to interim goals 2.1 2.2 and 2.3 math proficiency I will second this is Janelle all right we have a motion to table for member Jackson and a second from Member astorga can we have a roll call vote please yes and so I'd like to ask board members please submit any remaining questions you have that will help you determine the answers to the criteria and if they're here so if there's a technical class technical question please submit it I'll work with me missing around a deadline but I'm going to say submitted as soon as possible so that the administration can respond

[01:49:00]
find and repost the materials that are needed so that we can approve and again we don't have to have another discussion if all of the material is provided and if the board feels that the criteria are met we could just approve without discussion so with that we will move to agenda item number 6 thank you again for your presentations agenda 6 its 6 is our consent agenda so I am seeking approval of the consent agenda is their emotion please I moved to approve the consent agenda on all 6.22 and 5 items this is Crystal I will second it thank you we have a motion to approve the consent agenda for member and a second from Member Romero Miss King can we have a roll call vote please Janelle store yes other than a yes yes

[01:50:00]
Crystal Tapia Romero Mingus yes Courtney Jackson yes Danielle Gonzales yes so the motion to approve the consent agenda carries next is agenda item 7 which is the president's report so I wanted to share with the board and with the public that we will be appointing to new ad hoc committees one at hoc committee is going to look at potential for performance-based financial incentives for incoming superintendent I want to say Dr blakey's contract does include language that says the board in the superintendent in the evaluation structure May adopt performance-based Financial incentives on the board to approve the incentives they will be considered as incorporated into the employment agreement so given that we've had conversations around the fact that system performance the superintendent evaluation should be tied to system performance and needs to be based on the goals and guardrails of rural we want to take the next step

[01:51:00]
of determining exactly what those measures are and how it's aligned to potential incentive benefits so I'm appointing an ad hoc committee to work with Dr Blakey on this the members of the south at Hot Topic committee my eyes are going too fast the members of this ad hoc committee are popular Romero and member of this and the first step of the committee will be to meet with Dr Blakey and our Associates to ensure any incentives do aligned with student outcomes and committee members will also be reviewing best practice examples potentially from other districts and then we'll present a draft recommendation to the full board for review this I think we'll be reviewed this will be reviewed in executive session because it relates specifically to the superintendent's contract and the deadline for this is August 1st

[01:52:00]
all right the second ad hoc committee will be focused on lifting up student voice it's a line to our guard rails around Community engagement but also to our commitment to hearing from and listening and valuing students very much in line with goal for as well in terms of giving them the self-efficacy to know that they're making a difference in our school system oh sorry let me add I need it back up the chair of the previous ad hoc committee will be member benefits and the chair of the second ad hoc committee on student engagement will be member of Oregon I will also serve on that committee and also want to know and thank our student interns to the board is working with four students who have begun to talk to staff as well as board members community members and other districts to get a better understanding of how to include students in decision-making and so this ad hoc committee is also going to really engage students in terms of how we figure out how to move forward with

[01:53:00]
because this is a bit of a bigger lift the deadline for providing a recommendation to the board is just the end of the calendar year so December 31st and we'll have some comprehensive recommendations around how to increase student agency and student voice in The District but also primarily with the board so these two ad hoc committees will complement our current Community engagement at hoc committee that we already have in place so this committee which is remembered by member Jackson and also is member Dominguez and membership work which right now is focused on setting goals for what community engagement looks like and Community engagement by different groups so that's why I'm excited that member of the student engagement committee and sit on the community engagement committee to be able to have that overlap as we set goals for student engagement we are

[01:54:00]
a reminder that according to our community engagement and Outreach calendar board members should be reaching out to community groups during March and April so February was Community engagement which is when we hosted an event and brought people in March and April or community outreach when we go out to organizations and talk to them and so we do have a tracker for this so we can track which organizations who's going out etcetera so if anyone needs that Dr Albright can support with any any support on that I want to know that we are planning an exciting event in partnership with the New Mexico United at the team's June 8th game to celebrate the end of the year also to celebrate our students and all of our Educators and to promote summer reading and connection with one so note that date June 8th and stay tuned for more information next on student outcomes focused governance just want to know that we

[01:55:00]
add a contract in place at the board approved that expired in February 2024 and so that contract has been extended with the Council of great City Schools through June 30th 2025 for $20,000 this extension is going to allow us to continue our intensive training including a two-day workshop set for board members and staff at the end of April so I had to ask board members you have that date on your calendar if you can please attend April 29th and 30th and we will also continue to see opportunities for board members to participate in one-on-one training as needed and then finally really exciting update I am happy to announce the large part due to the efforts of member Jackson APS will soon be a boating member of the is my favorite acronym in the whole world the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Council or or abcdc which is currently Carl called abcdc plus APS

[01:56:00]
APS has traditionally served in an advisory capacity only so we are adding us as a voting member who knows what the acronym is going to be after that ABC GCA I don't know maybe y'all can figure that out and that's member benavidez serving on that commission as well so the process for this is because it's a joint governing Council the city council is going to consider a resolution and vote on it the burning of the Hill County Commission will consider a resolution and vote on it and then our Board of Education will consider the same resolution and vote on that so we are expecting all of those steps to be completed within May so keep an eye out for that resolution to come before our board in May which would make us a member on that government commission and with that the next board meeting is Wednesday April 3rd 2024 at 5 p.m. at the Alice King educational complex at 6400 Uptown Boulevard and live stream to aps.com
