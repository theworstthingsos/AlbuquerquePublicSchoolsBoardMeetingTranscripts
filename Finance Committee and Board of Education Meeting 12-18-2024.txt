[00:22:00]
with the school's families neighborhoods and municipalities that they serve so I asked you to support the mission of Albuquerque Public Schools in educating and caring for our diverse student population supporting their families and partnering with the community with the promise of a better future for all please table this Vote or vote no to uphold the community expectation of partnership thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Rachel Bosch followed by Aaron Davis the one minute when she began speaking good evening my children entered North Valley schools by chance we enter through those who are not experiencing homelessness and to a school it was the first period

[00:23:00]
I'm at home teachers and administrators showed us a thousand kindness is in 1,000 ways from making sure we know about 3 days at local museums getting us art supplies to a counselor taking money from his own paycheck to buy us a tofurky and cooking it for us for Thanksgiving because he knew we were vegan and we didn't have access to a stove my children were known at their schools because they were at small neighborhood schools they would have been falling through the cracks at a 500 + magnet Bohemian like what's being proposed I worry about other children who knows their own will get lost in the shuffle of rightsizing I worry about teachers who want desperately to form meaning connections with their students being pushed past the bounds of compassion fatigue and career exhaustion and I worry about the future of APs schools if cultures are forced into extinctions I respect the board to include the communities that represents and its decisions and to vote now thank you

[00:24:00]
followed by James Salazar you have one minute items 6.263 and 6.4 as North Valley Community are high quality well-resourced neighborhood schools weapon we rely upon schools like Alvarado Elementary Alvarado is a high-performing neighborhood dual language school that has served the community for many decades we want clear dual language Pathways from elementary school through high school that are available to all student

[00:25:00]
not just those who happen to get in on the lottery we also want to continue the North Valleys agricultural Heritage this Vision has been supported by the village of Los Ranchos and is outlined in the mayor pro-tem recent letter to APS and the board research supports the neighborhood schools are the heart of the communities health and well-being I'm sorry can you grab it up and quick settings please for those reasons and many others we ask that you table this proposal so that we have the opportunity to integrate these Visions thank you thank you James Salazar followed by Ashley Marshall you have one minute one should begin speaking over my name is James Salazar I'm a parent of Coronado Elementary School I'm also a resident of the North Valley and of the Eldorado School District I come to you today to ask this board to approve specifically number

[00:26:00]
.4 which is the expansion of Coronado Elementary School will continue to seek options which have Community Support as many of you know Coronado is a highly successful program and has great potential to expand its success it is the duty of the district to explore how we can maximize Coronado's momentum so it can not only benefit the children who are currently enrolled but also may serve as a reference to success for the district as a whole today you have the opportunity to make a decision that does not silence those who wish to be heard while still committing to Coronado's future that said I also believe that is an unethical to impose dramatic changes on a community without their full input and understanding and I ask that you prioritize giving the Valley Community the opportunity to be fully heard and included so many approach this as a whole holistically I believe that Coronado can be an asset to the valley but in order for this to reach this full potential the community needs to be included in the process thank you thank you our next speaker is Ashley Marshall followed by Amy Ziegler you have one

[00:27:00]
I want you began speaking good morning good evening board members I speak again proposal Equitable high-quality education starts with supporting our schools not dismantling them closing in middle school and introducing a dual language magnet school that doesn't serve boundary students is counterproductive additionally claiming that boundary students have priority to attend Coronado which operates on a lottery system and would then be at capacity is misleading their families will be forced to navigate difficulties across the city which is Impractical and unfair the promise to work with you after the New Year offers little Comfort when the decision would already be made furthermore well Garfield is presented as an alternative option it is also on the chopping block leaving hundreds of families who will soon face the same issue being left without options I urge you to consider the future of these students who are watching you closely

[00:28:00]
against half-right sizing and the expansion of Coronado for the sake of the students whose Futures depend on Equitable education thank you thank you for next speaker is Amy Ziegler followed by Megan long you have one minute when she began speaking thank you thank you period we're all for which states the superintendent will not exclude parents Guardian students or Community voice and engagement in school and District Operations I asked the board if you feel that won District white survey with only $129 responses from the North Valley on November 8th meeting at Taft where families were told the school was closing and a community meeting put on by an elementary school PTA not APS is a holding this guard Road when North Valley Community is the village of Los Ranchos students

[00:29:00]
parents and teachers at topped in the surrounding School are all telling you they were deceived received no communication from APS and feel utterly unheard it is clear guardrail for was filled APS is already said they have made missed UPS in this process I asked you is our elected board to hold APS accountable and seek the communication research equitable distribution of resources and transparency all APS families communities and most importantly students deserve thank you thank you Megan long you have one minute of the board I respectfully ask you both know or table agenda items 6.2 6.3 and 6.4 I am in the mother of an APS student I acknowledge a privilege I have not only in having access to necessary resources to be here but also the time to engage in this discussion many parents in the North Valley cannot attend this evening due to a lack of communication and transparency from eps

[00:30:00]
I believe the way this board has conducted itself is a deliberate attempt to leave those families out of the conversation the educational and operational resources provided to children in the North Valley is at Best in Equitable when compared to that of Coronado students at worst it represents a complete disregard of marginalized children with this proposal it is evident that APS is proposed is supporting a school with the means and resources to the right well simultaneously restricting resources in the North Valley there's a no research indicating that the student transfer sees North Valley schools on will remain unaffected by this decision as a result this will further impact the resources and opportunities available to students the community you also made the point to make a land acknowledgment at the beginning of this meeting get our attention I'm sorry I have to stop over a minute can you please wrap up in a very quick sentence you also made a point to make Atlanta acknowledgment at the beginning of this meeting at our attempting to forcefully insert a school glorifying a conquistador

[00:31:00]
you're on mute so there you go you have one minute timer and we are in support of application Public Schools proposed right-sizing plan we believe this plan is a crucial step towards Insurance resources are allocate Lee our allocated efficiently equitably in a way that will benefit APS students and families with APS enrollment declining by over 20,000 students 2016 it's essential that we take the proactive approach to align our Resources with the current needs of our community expanding the Dual language program at Coronado to serve grades K through 8 will provide more opportunities for students to

[00:32:00]
access this in demand in high quality educational experience again representing the greater opportunity Chamber of Commerce we want to emphasize the financial responsibility of this plan continue to operate under enrolled school buildings such as Taft and Taylor is not sustainable thank you for your leadership and moving this plan forward we encourage the board to approve these necessary steps to right size or district and improve opportunities for all students thank you thank you our next speaker is in the room call inbox followed by Ben Roberts thank you everyone for being here what a beautiful group we all are I think Christmas is coming a little early the evolution of this process that I was thrust into almost 10 days ago has brought me closer to all the people on all the sides of this issue and I want to emphasize that this is a unifying moment that we can take advantage of and leverage to

[00:33:00]
everyone's future better we are not the North Valley against the South Valley anymore we are not against one another for people trying to come and make a better life we are standing up right now skiing for our children have a better future in a place that they call home that's a powerful message and we all are here because of that we asked the board to listen to us show flexibility show adaptation to allow for the experts of their Community to come together and collaborate to make this work forcing a vote when people have said no multiple times is tone deaf to the reality that we all are struggling to find the right Middle Ground forward thank you sir next speaker has been Roberts sure you have one minute once you begin speaking board members in superintendent Blakey thank you for your time I'm an APS parent and a resident of Los Ranchos and I respectfully ask you about know or

[00:34:00]
enable agenda item 6.2 and 6.3 attended meetings at both Alvarado and Los Ranchos Village and have seen it continued lack of care and communication which included lack of inclusion of religious leadership in this process and Taylor are within the village of boundaries and we heard last night at the meeting claims by APS staff of quote informal Communications over several years with the previous mayor sometimes outside of his role as mayor but there was no official Public Communication with the community about the right sizing plan until the presentation to Village leaders last night there's no place for informal background Communications when it comes to making decisions like this communication needs to be consistent clear and public and allow appropriate time for the community to respond I see may approach him right now in the audience tonight thank you sir for your time and for attending philosopher voted unanimously at last night's meeting to ask that APS board defer the decision on the current rights in plan for Taft until Community concerns are addressed and appropriate Community I would like to Echo this request please support us

[00:35:00]
don't know or table agenda items 6.2 and 6.3 thank you thank you sir our next speaker is JD Matthews although I don't know if you're here sir followed by Ana Garcia Mr Mathews your first and you'll have one minute once you begin speaking it's hard to put your daughter's future at Taft Middle School this process since November has been heartbreaking it's been heartbreaking to go from having such a positive start to our school year with a lot of hopes and dreams with a new French horn player and and artist that tapped in my daughter and to see that that glimmer fade fade from her and there's no denying that this process has been harmful to students

[00:36:00]
it is not improved student outcomes there's been missing information shared by the district over and over again we started this process with Taylor Construction being done in 6 months and starting this month to moving to one and a half years and now 2 1/2 years my daughter will never get to use those facilities that we see the nice pictures of and no one attacked will get to use those facilities who is currently at Taft it's outrageous Taft is under threat right now teachers are leaving and we're not going to have certified qualified teachers next semester because I have to stop you I'm sorry please finish my daughter couldn't be in the room she's in the Overflow please do not close Tap tonight thank you sir our next speaker is Ana Garcia followed by Megan Hendricks you'll have one minute one should begin speaking good evening I'm a proud parent of the Coronado student and I'm in favor of the three expansion I live on the west side and make the commitment to commute all the way to

[00:37:00]
because of the quality education they are providing there is currently no dual language middle school that is centrally located or accessible to many families that live throughout the city and Coronado's current area is unfortunately becoming more and more dangerous the North Valley Community has also been asking for dual language middle school and allowing the Taft feeder schools to have priority admittance to Coronado is a fair compromise it is also not financially responsible for APS to continue to operate schools who are very under enrolled and this expansion would be a much better use of District resources while providing a highly sought-after education to even more students Coronado is a nationally certified magnet school with demonstrated excellence in bilingual education and expanding the school would only ensure better Spanish fluency which would give students in these programs a more competitive advantage in our increasingly diverse Community thank you thank you speaker is Megan Hendrix

[00:38:00]
snowboard I will get that to him thank you you have one minute once you begin speaking of the board and of the community my name is Megan Hendricks and I'm a special education teacher at Alvarado Elementary School and I want to make clear that my role here tonight is to advocate for my students not for my own children thank you for the opportunity to speak again today I respectfully request about know or table to vote on agenda items 6.23 and 4 why don't know in equity if you live in a neighborhood you should be able to go to school there exclusion is not a value we want to teach our children and students our community schools in our neighborhood why don't know the extensive Financial investment and additional resources provided to Coronado Elementary School in Equitable and despite having resources other dual languages schools do not have and despite having the 8020 dueling language programming APS pretends to prefer Coronado has some of the worst Spanish proficiency scores according to

[00:39:00]
iStation testing in the entire District student outcomes must be prioritized schools with 50/50 programs with English tax included such as East San Jose and Alvarado Elementary School show significantly better Spanish proficiency scores across the board follow the data implement the programming that shows the best results and provide equity in resources to all APS schools thank you for next speaker is on June Madeline ball are you there you have one minute one should begin

[00:43:00]
in the interest of the communities that elected you we are asking you to stand up for students they are the ones most affected by this proposal we urge you to table this book for their sake so that we as a community can come together to create better Morris more sustainable schools and opportunities for them thank you thank you for next speaker is Janet Sayers although I have not seen her so I do not believe she is here so we'll move on our next speaker is has we used to fazi

[00:44:00]
understanding of the challenges a newcomer student has when I was 12 same happened to me when we moved to Kyrgyzstan and I was thrown in a sixth grade where I didn't know even the alphabet of the language where I had to study like books and I think the same thing is happening right now with the students newcomer students in Albuquerque and I am supporting the international Albuquerque International School and that's cool will give a hope for our new commercial for their future is not just an investment for their education for their future but as well as the future of our country and I support the location the Coronado location just it's not just a convenient location but it's also

I respectfully ask that you vote no or table agenda item 6.23 and 4 as a community member taxpayer and APS parent these last weeks have been exhausting frustrating and deeply disappointing two weeks ago we were shocked to learn of this proposal that deeply affects our communities schools and children a proposal that APS never communicated to constituents until days before the schedule the board to provoke APS has acted as a bully towards its own families and students as board members elected officials whose role it is to stand up for the concerns and interests of the community how could you consider passing such a damaging proposal to such a proposal now would be to condone the incredibly poor leadership and poor communication of APs to its students and families to pass such a proposal will lead to further fracturing among the community and further Mistress of APs as an organization it is clearly is clearly is not operating in a way that puts students first please table or vote on The Proposal thank you thank you sir

[01:07:00]
Eddie an eager to help partner with this project and create a vibrant hub for international students and their families access is key of course in the location at Coronado is accessible to these families who rely on public transportation rather than continuing the systemic inequities highlighting the Yazi Martinez lawsuits thank you for your leadership and establishing a school where we can all Thrive together is Barbara Peterson followed by Daniel Toya good evening board members and superintendent board member there are two issues tonight the educational needs of newcomer and Refugee students and so I am delighted to see that the Albuquerque International High School is finally coming forward what concerns me is that I hope that

[01:08:00]
separated from the issue of right sizing there is without a doubt many political and economic resource issues that's forcing a PS to look at right-sizing but if it's not done well it undermines the value of traditional neighborhood schools and what that brings to a community into neighborhood there are three schools that I can think of in the South area of the city Dolores Gonzales East San Jose Washington Middle School that have been leaders in dual language instruction that could have been open to many students and instead of magnet school was established the excluded the students in that neighborhood I'm sorry you've gone over a minute sorry

[01:09:00]
we could follow the model that was done with Longfellow with a commitment to the neighborhood but also investing resources so as a board when you listen to voices I think it's important to ask are we listening to the voices that of the part of our community that are in our goals and guard rails or are we just listening to the voices that already have the most economic and political power in the city thank you thank you our next speaker is Daniel Toya good evening I'm here to ask a board members to stop the retaliation of APs staff members on August 26th I filed a police report after being assaulted by a parent the police officer completely falsify the police department I went to HR and to his supervisors and spoke about it on September 4th and email was sent to Kelly Services lying about me saying that on September 4th board meeting that I was in

[01:10:00]
I am still being retaliated against Buy HR now Susie Raymore staff members are afraid to report incidents a child abuse at their school which I have reported several times send an email on September 4th to APS police which APS police lied to the parents saying it was never reported yet I have the emails and the police report I have emailed upper management one of them email me back saying it was inappropriate for them to get involved I am asking for you guys to listen to mandated reporters reporting child abuse or other staff members abusing them and take it seriously I'm asking you guys to pay attention to us for we are here for our students at substitute teachers teachers and asking for your help and you guys are ignoring us thank you sir our next speaker is

[01:11:00]
Larry Walker followed by Felipe Rodriguez some of them are still suffering intensely as others are determined to hold the institutions and individuals accountable to speaking out publicly or lawsuits or both the first medical providers quote this case is about a team of doctors who decided to perform a mutilating mimicry sex change experiment on a 13-year-old vulnerable girl struggling with complex mental health comorbidities who needed love care attention

[01:12:00]

[01:13:00]
I want to speak in support of 6.5 and one of the collectors of the New Mexico Dream Team or organization holds chapters that cross many APS schools or chapters are spaces tailored to address the common gaps between our schools and they need some undocumented students and students from mixed status families I believe that housing the international school at the Coronado Elementary School and building can unlock the potential of this school even further the New Mexico dream team's office is downtown on Gulf Street a few blocks away from from the Coronado building we host weekly activities are office that are complementary to our chapters from immigration legal clinics to leadership development training this makes her office is a Huber supporters can meet each other across many schools International High School students will greatly benefit from being close to to have such like this where they can make immigrants students from every corner of Albuquerque thank you very much for your time thank you sir

[01:23:00]
is there any discussion or questions on page thank you for coming and I did notice and I overlooked this the first time we've had a busy time to say the least and so I overlooked some things I noticed that a couple of members on your governing Council have been there for 2020 years but your school year Baseline data begins with 2818 and so I was just curious about so the school has been around for 20 years okay and so

[01:24:00]
another point of clarification on page on the page of that list the SAT school day grade 11 summary and I'll wait for him to get to that summary

[01:25:00]
we'll see what content they need to respond well yes it shows that in 2023 2024 your evidence-based reading proficiency score was 4.9 % and then the math score was 1.2 % but then the breakdown proficiency by subject and gender is at 100 I see a lot of 100% 90% since I'm just trying to understand the discrepancy Madam president and so that raises

[01:26:00]
these are SAT scores and so I'm looking for I guess I'm I'm conflicted because I know you've been a turnaround school and and I'm wondering is this the second time that we're in turn around I do see some progress being made our second time in turn around and we have made some changes such as leadership we've hired a transformational team to come in and outside organization to come in and kind of give us recommendations as to how we can increase in scores we've hired a

[01:27:00]
a data coaching team to come in and assist us with that stuff we now are doing data-driven decisions not saying that we haven't done in the past but I wasn't in the leader but now that I am the leader we are doing more of a group of an administrative team and so it's not one individual making the decision to put the garden of our doctor brother and his team as to how we can improve our students scores how we can improve the life of our students as they get older and go through our school our program and yes I am I want to be hopeful but I worry that you've been around for 20 years and yet you serve an important population right now probably the most vulnerable and I know that comes with its own challenges and I did notice that in the last year too

[01:28:00]
highlighted in the area of our 6-year graduates a lot of our students come to us two and three years behind it and so we tried to get them caught up and and get them graduated a lot of it I'm not going to say it's it's it's it's it's a very difficult path for them and us but we are dedicated not only are myself but my staff and and we have our parents our community involvement in in in in what happens in the middle we have parents here that you know I apologize him to sign up for two we had approximately about 15 to come we had a couple of

[01:29:00]
foods that were excited to come and again my apologies to them into yourself that I did not direct them with the correct instructions thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you have 35% of your children with disabilities with disabilities and as you're turning around your school and you're looking at how to make Improvement

[01:30:00]
can you give me a how you expect to do that with your kids with disabilities cuz I was looking at all to your compliance with some of your within your just the basic requirements with transition and some of those things but what are you doing going to do differently that hopefully it's going to turn these kids around as I stated we have hired a transformational to come on in and help us a data coach we are working with our staff now to not just our Ela subject to indoors but our entire staff we do have a special ed director that works extremely hard with each of our parents we have invited outside agencies to assist in how we can better assist

[01:31:00]
those those students we listen to the parents we listen to the students and we listen to the outside organizations that are coming in to help us Advance the students in their academics okay thanks thank you any additional questions and so my question is related to the number of students who rolled in college after in the fall after graduation and so for 2018 to 2019 there were 15 students out of 28 in 2019 and 2020 there was 11 students at 35 and in 2020 20214 out of 37 and I think that's remarkable that the students have enrolled in college so I'm curious have these students graduated and have you kept in touch with them and what are their stories so we do have a handful of graduated

[01:32:00]
add to my knowledge that I have come back we are starting this year more of an alumni organization that they could come back and speak we do invite a lot of our graduates to come back and speak to the current students that we have we had one student that went on and got her law degree and so she was she's kind of my highlight her and I used to I was an educated there prior to being the principal and administrator and her and I had our I guess the current says she she beat me up a couple of times but she came back to think me and to think our institution period

[01:33:00]
one is a manager of a T-Mobile store another one is beginning or wanting to do his get his construction license and so we he's come back to to ask for help in doing some of that so we are working with these students those are the kind of the highlighted ones that that I have worked with just in the last few months thank you thank you any additional questions I don't have a question for say Mr home but you did mention twice that you did have about 15 people that were here in support and they

[01:34:00]
I wanted to give them the opportunity to at least maybe stand in support if they're still in the room these are two of our parents and the rest because we didn't sign up period I just wanted to give them the opportunity but thank you so much and then just one quick question just to give you like a final opportunity on this you also did know that you were really pleased to be working with Dr Escobedo and as are we and so I just want to give you the opportunity to know what might be different about this this time with this new contract this new term that might be different than what you had before and if you are hopeful that you will be able to meet the the auctions that are required within this new contract yes ma'am I think the big difference is is the new head administrators willing to listen and take advice

[01:35:00]
it's I believe in the past that that may not have been the the path that was taken to from the individual prior to me but I'm open it's not about me it's not about the position it's about the students themselves and I come from the community I lived in the community I was brought up in the community so I care a lot about it and these are students that I can reflect back that I was one of these students somebody help me and I want to be that helping him and if I can follow up period yes

[01:36:00]
little marito yes Heather benavidez yes Crystal tell me a memo Sabina Dominguez yes Courtney Jackson yes yes yes emotion carries thank you for your presentation thank you we will now move on to agenda item 6.2 which is to consider approval to reassign North Valley attendance areas due to the repurposing of Taft Middle School into a dual language magnet K-8 school or presenters are Dr Gabriella dude on Blakey superintendent Gabe Hawkins Deputy superintendent of operations and Jay director of capital master plan as well as drunk on sale is Deputy superintendent for Learning and teaching I believe you have the four thank you madam president members of the board I also want to recognize the principal from Taft Middle School Crystal Avalos is also here in the

[01:37:00]
tonight we are requesting approval for boundary changes as part of an ongoing effort to align Resources with student needs and to improve our student outcomes specifically we propose repurposing Taft Middle School into a dual language K8 magnet school and adjusting boundaries so that students who would have attended Taft will instead attend Taylor Middle School which is a couple of miles away after extensive study we are recommending this proposal because it offers significant benefits to the Taft Taylor and Coronado communities the plan also calls for using the Coronado building as a newcomer right resource center as well as the International High School for background the right size initiative and APS began over a decade ago to address to cleaning enrollment its goals including improving student outcomes academic and financial viability reducing

[01:38:00]
overcrowding and offering families more educational options this process considers factors like enrollment Trends school facilities and academic performance with schools that are facing low enrollment being repurposed and those with high demand potentially expanding this is a process that has been followed for years as you recall last spring this board voted to repurpose duranes Elementary School and the year before we repurposed loose elementary school as in the case of both of these schools we plan to work with each task student and their individual families to ensure a smooth transition following the input from the community after the initial announcement I directed our staff to amend the plan to reflect the feedback that we received as a result we are offering three options for families in the Taft theater system 5th graders who are currently enrolled in the Dual language program can attend Coronado

[01:39:00]
dual language magnet which will eventually expand to a K8 we will update the procedural directive to include the transfer priority students can opt for a more traditional Middle School at Taylor Middle School which is expected to grow to a healthy 500 student population and families may also choose to transfer to Garfield Middle School which is a STEM Magnet in the North Valley where we are making additional investments in stem programming we do recognize the emotional attachment that many have to their schools and we are mindful of all of those concerns but we do believe that this consolidation is a comprehensive plan that will benefit student outcomes which remains our top priority we are here to answer any questions thank you Doctor Blakey so we will go ahead and move to discussion and questions and we'll start just and go through the line across and we'll come back through

[01:40:00]
we need to or if we have any follow-ups I'm going to go ahead and start with number tap your email thank you I do have a couple of questions that I want to add or ask regarding this particular item so gosh my questions are going to be more associated with the way the direction of the way the board has been headed recently and the question is more aligned or surrounded with talking about determining the academic programming models for the district and when we talked about this like whose job do we feel is it to determine to academic programming models for the district is this the superintendent or the board that is the superintendent job along with the administration we work closely with the office of innovation with the school principal and their instructional councils to make sure that the academic programming

[01:41:00]
the needs of the school thank you and to follow up with that like whose job also would it be to analyze building facilities determine appropriate use do you feel like is this the job of the superintendent or is this fall on the job of the board that is the job of the superintendent and the administration primarily working with the deputy superintendent of operations in our Capital master plan okay thank you and have you looked at making sure that the rightsizing is also included in the Strategic plan and also in the 90-day plan yes the right sizing is included in the Strategic plan it's all in the 90-day plan and it is in the updated what has happened so far in the past 90 days okay thank you I have one more do you want me to wait okay thank you looking at two when we developed the superintendent of evaluation the superintendent overalls evaluated on student outcomes

[01:42:00]
the question would be too are you making this proposal with the the lens of ensuring that you're always improving student outcomes yes 100% so you know the board has made it clear that the evaluation is based on student outcomes and we know I'm working very closely with the team that these are hard decisions and I have guided the team to make sure that we are making every decision in the best interest of students to improve student outcomes and knowing that some of our students are in learning environments that are not providing on that ability to really hit the student outcomes because of the viability of the academic programming has really led us to look for gaps and holes in our programming and where we can move forward thank you so much thank you thank you thank you remember the Gabriella superintendent in Europe

[01:43:00]
mistakes in regards to including and getting information on the feeder schools how from that from admitting to that what have you done from that time on till now to reach out to those schools or I can start with that and then I'll turn it over to Dr Gonzalez so I would say you know we have Consolidated three elementary schools and the difference with a middle school is that there are feeder schools so those fifth graders are not currently students in the school but would be coming to the school next year so when the team was working with the middle school and primarily talking to the sixth and seventh graders there was a misstep to catch the 5th graders of the incoming fifth graders primarily Alvarado Elementary School with you heard of the comments tonight from Alvarado that they are the only pure feeder

[01:44:00]
the Taft District in pure feeder means that 100% of the families in that zone do Arizona to go to Taft so the other elementary schools are what we call split feeders meaning some of them already go partly to Taft and partly to Taylor some of them go partly to Garfield and partly to have to and so I think in that we missed that by making sure that the 5th grade families were aware so coupled with that I think the important thing is in the past primarily when we talked about Uranus last year the board did want to make sure that families were communicated to prior to the decision last year and in the previous years we have worked with families individually after the decision of the boundaries and it really becomes kind of like a chicken and egg kind of thing as far as when the boundaries change and when you start

[01:45:00]
so because we moved the timeline earlier this year in an effort to try to talk to the families prior to the spring I think that that's where we missed the opportunity to reach out to 5th grade families so since then I will have Dr Gonzalez talk about what we've done in the information that we've gathered from those families Madame President member told members of the board superintendent a couple of things to share in response to your question is in terms of missteps one of the things that we did anticipating the the transfer window opens on an annual basis on January 1st is give these affected communities and students absolute priority what that translated into is we can see and has we learned this being the first

[01:46:00]
that we've brought through right sizing is it set a signal that the decision was made when the reality is we are working to respond and work on an individual basis with every single family along the lines of their transition to middle school education pending the approval other things that we've done in response to hearing the community is adjusted the plan is the superintendent as reference I like to go over a couple of ways in which we've done that first one was dual language we looked and we're very intentional and turning to the data to ensure that voice of community was facilitated within the adjustments to the planet

[01:47:00]
in the meetings that we had a Continuum or a continuation of dual language programming was voice repeatedly based on that priority enrollment priority transfer for any student within the North Valley currently enrolled in a dual language program would have the opportunity to automatically enroll at Coronado on the K8 another thing that we heard that are operation team can speak to more deeply is the notion of traffic and the traffic implications within the community we have worked with our transportation department within the constraints of what we're able to do and we looked at drop off pickup patterns

[01:48:00]
recognizing that investment was made this year along the lines of the campus specifically for drop off and pick up as well as potential super stops strategically throughout the city for current Coronado enrollment to be able to come the west side for example the South Valley maybe the different areas that they're coming from the city so that we need any concerns that traffic congestion would bring to that Community we've also recognized as I mentioned the data-driven piece is looking to the recent spring of 2024 voice of the community service and it was interesting that the area of town that took the survey on the highest concentration was in fact the North Valley and

[01:49:00]
when did they ask for more often than any other academic program was stem and we are we committed the engineering the future Grant at Mission Garfield and Valley High School to the tune of 8 million dollars with a continued investment and commitment to that stem education for our students in the North Valley that's what the community in the North Valley Hospital offer that Middle School option so now we have two options the Coronado dual language option and the stem option at Garfield Middle School and finally the traditional option at Taylor Middle School is important to point out that that option provide the robust program with the wraparound Services full time employees

[01:50:00]
at that school that they're able to invest in that Community teachers are teaching 234 trips that's tough on a teacher you have to prepare those many preps when you're in a smaller environment you also have fewer people to collaborate with to enhance your professional practice and to really grow as professionals the context and environment on the academic side is really something that we looked at as well as we adjust the plan to have those three Dynamic options for our students in the North Valley I'd like to turn it over to Mr Hawkins if he has anything else you'd like to add in relationship to the transportation and I think the real quick the way we got that information so all of the 5th grade families received a letter from their

[01:51:00]
the bowl that explains what was happening and with that had a survey that they could put input in which I think the board has been provided and So based on the input that we got from the families that completed the survey that's how we made the adjustments that I don't want to forget was in our meeting with the Alvarado Elementary School Community specifically there was a call to action on behalf of the district to invest in neighborhood schools and the conversation through the principal and the community was really looking at an agriculture component an agriculture theme in that school that elementary school and our team is working with that school to explore those options to really enhance their hopes and dreams and their desires in relationship

[01:52:00]
skip to the agriculture theme of the elementary school level so those conversations are in their infancy but that is another step we have taken based on the community feedback on the transportation piece so a couple of pieces when we're talking about traffic to immediately move forward with working with not only our team of experts but possibly looking at outside experts said can help us look at our on-site traffic plan is Dr Gonzalez mentioned we've added Middle School August of this year we added an additional drop off so really looking at the traffic looking at the number of students that are slightly to be there but also looking at the impact that that will have in the community and working with the community our we do have a meeting scheduled with our Blues team which is

[01:53:00]
are bus loading and unloading Zone team that is collaborative group that also works with our local law enforcement to look at different areas of traffic and safety our next meeting is scheduled with Los Ranchos the village of Los Ranchos and their team for January 7th so we will again if that's approved tonight we'll we'll jump on that immediately and continue working through that and then in attending last night's meeting Community Center I have a big concern and I know you guys have a proposal for right sizing but I also need to know how do you expect to build trust back to the community to its leaders to the children to the staff for everything

[01:54:00]
sing that they are going through right now because we're not creating collaboration we're creating chaos how do you expect to turn that around one thing is that I think the team and myself have learned is that people in general with the district there is a sense of not having trust and so in any situation and you bureaucracy so to say there's always a part where we have to continue to show trust by things like following through on the Dual language program following through on the traffic study the village of Los Ranchos we've been meeting now we've met with them several times they have had you know a lot of transition in their Administration as have we and on their Board of

[01:55:00]
Days Inn on our board so what we have to see is institutions to is that even the schools they've had transition in principles all of these schools most of the schools have had transition in principles over the past two to three years one year and so I think that through our actions of follow through is how we have to build trust that's one of the reasons that if this is passed that we want to put the procedural directive for transfers in right away will work on on making that because of the community members have said that we're saying that they get transfers but is that true so putting it in Paul in our administrative policy I think is important so that we can show that we are being responsive but I think that you know you build trust over developing relationships with people over time and recognizing that all of these institutions have had transition over the past couple of years even the institution

[01:56:00]
so a lot of knowledge has that somebody had that had a conversation that had a meeting to discuss has been lost along the way so I think we have to work better at how we can make sure that we maintain that consistency and that through our actions we show and build trust that we meet with individual families to talk about where their best placement will be that we put in policy how we're going to do this that we have the meeting that we've scheduled we've committed to meeting with the village quarterly to look at traffic as the school expands that we're looking at the traffic study that Mr with ginger is working on today is Contracting somebody who can come do that so I think that that has to be built over time recognizing that people have feelings of mistrust over the course of years prior to any of us stepping into these rules I just want to reiterate that student outcomes

[01:57:00]
is directly affected by Community engagement and we got to keep that a priority thank you thank you remember tell Maury tell her go ahead and turn to member astorga do you have any questions for the administration I do thank you sorry for not being able to be there in person everyone but my first question is why was the decision to close tasks and not Taylor sure I can answer this and maybe if I don't answer all of it I'm looking at Mr if you need a more technical answer so rewinding to I think it was 2022 or 2023 again a lot of movement has happened in those years there was an assessment done which includes 17 different factors that we look at to identify the schools for right-sizing so those 17 factors include enrollments Financial

[01:58:00]
sustainability and capital investment there's a series of indicators for those 17 Taylor did not come up on the list once it was run through the formula for right-sizing so Taft did come up based on those factors I don't know the individual factors for each school but there's essentially the team of the capital master plan runs every single School in the district through all 17 factors that comes up with a tear of schools and then they put in additional factors and they were in a second list Taylor did not show up on the tier 2 list or the tier list of the schools that were identified for right sizing and Taylor was put on to the last bond election for the remodel so you know once as all of you know once you have the bond election in schools are on there you can't move money from

[01:59:00]
High School to another and so Taylor was on the previous bond for construction Mr with ginger do you have anything to thank you for the board board member stalker yes I read to read what the superintendent just said I want more thing I would add is that when you study the areas around Taylor and Taft one Las variable is that the Taylor area has more chances in terms of long time coming after staying in the list

[02:00:00]
I just think it was important for Community to know what that process looked like because we have been getting concerns about how that switch is going to affect enrollment to Valley high school so I think it was important just to give that background so thank you for that my next question is in regards to the timeline I know that we have said trust is something that we have to build a community which I completely agree and I just wanted to know what is the timeline look like and how strict is your timeline for this decision because I know Community came out tonight to support a tabling of the decision to give more time for Community engagement so if you can just speak a little bit on that piece sure thank you for the question member of store the timeline so as you can

[02:01:00]
me from the agenda the right sizing plan is a comprehensive plan that involves several moving pieces so part of the timeline and again this is an early earlier timeline than we had last year when the board approved the consolidation of duranes elementary school and this is a few months a couple months earlier and there are several reasons for that one is there are multiple moving pieces and other schools that are impacted by the move they're all connected to each other as a comprehensive right-sizing plan and so that's one of the main reasons we want to make because this is a middle school that's another major reason why it's an earlier timeline the families need time to be able to register for courses and the budget process this year is starting earlier for schools than we've done

[02:02:00]
in the past so I think that's something the board is familiar with we're starting the budget process in January for schools and so knowing what the school what schools we have that are open and how to judge their enrollment is really important to do ahead of time the transfer window for parents opens January 2nd and so we need to make sure that parents are aware in the case that this does pass and if it does not pass that the Coronado parents particularly for 5th grade going to 6th grade don't have a school to go to so they would have to know before January 2nd to be able to apply for the transfer window so really in an effort to communicate earlier with families to give more leeway with planning for families I think the Taft Community has expressed that they do feel a sense of uneasiness over the past couple years they've heard

[02:03:00]
my school is closing as you may be aware of the first timeline was that they was going to close last year and so you know we recognize that we don't want to keep families in flux and so if there is a delay in being able to reach that January timeline then we would need to put all three recommendations on hold until probably this time next year thank you and my last question is just again with engagement kind of going back to board member tomorrow's question but I know you have a commitment to making sure that the family is and the community are engaged moving forward and you did mention that you were going to meet with Los Ranchos Community quarterly I was just wondering if you can explain the most process is a little bit more for me if there is the of those things are already in place or what your plan is moving forward to make sure that they are all informed

[02:04:00]
you're so we do have it's through the Blues team so the Planning and Zoning team of Los Ranchos as well as our Blues team have their first meeting scheduled for January 7th and then at that meeting will schedule the following meetings for quarterly to watch how the traffic is Flowing meanwhile we have worked with the principal of Alvarado Elementary School to assure her school is not on the right size list in any way but she has an interest in as Dr Gonzalez said expanding into agriculture work those programming models of school can happen at any time so that's not anything that is dependent on a timeline or right sizing it's something that the school can began working on and we will work with the principal on what the school precedes with that so at a school Community level working with

[02:05:00]
Alvarado and how they want to design their school is something that is ongoing and it can it can start at any time it's not up for board approval it's as board member Tapia Romero asked it is Administrative work through the superintendent that can happen at a school at any time and so that's how that's kind of how that is working for the ongoing meetings I think that what is a fair ask is how we continue to partner with the communities particularly through you know the principal's being you know what I have you know talked to the principal about being the owners the CEOs of their schools so to say and how we can work more to make sure that those principles feel confident leading the community work of the school and more importantly that we operate as a whole

[02:06:00]
yes family that when the principal the staff the school is working that is a PS working with the community at the community level of the school and I think you know I will acknowledge particularly with the fifth grade that we made missteps along the way but at the same time there are also communities that I applaud the team for working really closely with so we didn't get it 100% right but I you know in hearing on the work of the newcomer Refugee program and the International High School that's a community that I think has been very connected and has been talked to and feels like they've been part of Designing this school so I do think that we may have missed the mark in some ways but in other ways I think that the team has done outstanding Community work we just need to make it more on part of the process of how we do throughout the whole District president Gonzalez

[02:07:00]
members of the board superintendent Blakey just another practical response to the timing and this is going to be real issue speak I apologize but in terms of middle school starting their scheduling happens early in the spring semester which will factor into a comprehensive scheduling process which feeds number of classes number of electives number of teacher endorsements based on the course request so it's quite a comprehensive intricate multiple people working to ensure that students on General list special ed bilingual lead electives all are put into correct place in the fall and that work is set to start January 2nd with the transfer window

[02:08:00]
with our principals and assistant principals beginning course request early January and February and then moving into the building of their schedule which will lead to factoring the human capital which is resignations retirements what are they going to have to hire based on these requests so unlike an elementary school you have first grade second grade third grade fourth grade and you have a teacher cap in those grades Middle School from a schedule like point of view is much more complex and I just would like to add member of that to your earlier the theater to Valley High School is uninterrupted so those students to Valley High School through these three middle schools will continue without interruption in additionally in some

[02:09:00]
he says such as the case of Los Ranchos Elementary School it tightens the articulation which is essentially saying how kids go from elementary school to middle school together and the teachers work to make sure that the curriculum is aligned it is a split feeder right now so half the students from Los Ranchos go to Taylor have to go to half of them go to Taft this would allow the fifth grade class to all stay together to go to Taylor and then go to Valley so the Valley High School part of it Remains the Same throughout all of the boundary changes and you know with the team did talk about looking at offering a phase in approach meaning that it's just like we're facing in sixth grade we would face out the students at Taft Middle School is a three-year cycle right so you know I think back to Joanna's last year that's hard the kids the fourth graders at Joanna's had been at school

[02:10:00]
in that school for 5 years and then they were moved to his school for their last year this year the students so we've talked about the middle school students what would happen if we because we're really only talking about two grade levels its sixth grade and seventh grade on the 8th graders will be going to high school next year and we talked about keeping them at their school for next year at Taft because Coronado would have case 6 and so we could essentially face out in that sense but the team and looking at the academic value of that it would hollow out the curriculum so you would only have about 60 to 70 students in each grade level at the school and their ability to have robust education programming to have access we didn't feel was in the best interest of the students to have a school

[02:11:00]
they would essentially be so small and that many of the students had already selected that they would choose to go to Taylor so it could be even less students than what we would project thank you so much and I wanted just to end and give a comment because I wanted to thank you first of all as a superintendent and being able to do a little bit better on and we don't you don't see that all the time so I wanted to thank you and your team for that and for going out to the community and you know trying to bring solutions to the table and I know that right sizing isn't easy we've seen that from the past right-sizing that we have done so just thank you and your team for all that work and also thank you to all the community

[02:12:00]
making sure that their voices are implemented moving forward so thank you thank you remember I swear to God we will turn to remember Dominguez so I have a couple of questions that I wrote down in reference to what is Administration administrators are in charge of capital outlay decisions and instructional work but where is the role of parents in that because I do know that I mean I can't remember which document we had like a information though and I have to click through many links and read and it was

[02:13:00]
but I know that there is a role there's a parent advisory piece and where is that parent advisory when boundaries are being reconsidered and did we include that parent advisory piece are you talking about the parent advisory Council or the boundary process for administrative boundaries in did we get a did we get a an organizational chart this morning it's the administrative boundaries oh thank you very much

[02:14:00]
boundary changes there's administrative boundary changes and there's overall boundary changes the overall boundary changes are very specific in when we build a new school or when we go into an area with new housing that didn't have a school and in that case you are looking at a totally changing the feeders you know all the way from high school to elementary school that was in there and I know one policy the contingency in that case to not only the experts in the administrative people and the principles involved in the boundary committee and other agency components like in this case if we were building a new school from scratch

[02:15:00]
we would have somebody from the city of Los Ranchos would have somebody from Bernalillo County without somebody from the City of Albuquerque because these are these are major impacts but when we do a boundary change in terms of when in a developed area because demographics have changed we need to balance out the boundaries in that school in that area because one school has less kids and other schools have lessons administrative boundary change which we use to address the reasoning for the changes these changes are not supposed to make a change into the high schools that just actually supposed to balance things so that there's no disruption within schools and this

[02:16:00]
so I guess what I'm suggesting is that's a problem right because you get this up uproar is it it's it's it's it's you can see it you've seen it the last week and a half two weeks and so I would I know it's not my place but I would like to suggest based on what we have seen that that there's a role for parents and and of the affected schools to be represented in those decisions because if you if you bring people along you're more apps to build trust rather than the distrust that were facing right now and just for the record I feel like I feel like I need to say

[02:17:00]
in response to a comment during public comment that about terrible leadership you know I've served on the help me with the sea cat the Community Capital advisory committee or commission and I think it's very accurate one of the members community members a Mr Murphy pointed out when our superintendent who is then coo chief officer operations when she explained how right-sizing happens he accurately described it as a three-dimensional chess game so I don't take I

[02:18:00]
I want to get across to the community that this is a very complicated three-dimensional chess game where the missteps happened is in our contacting or the administration contacting the feeder schools and which leads to my next question but I just want to say when the superintendent takes responsibility for her missteps it's also incumbent on this board to take responsibility for our missteps as well we are tired of the hip and and so we have a community engagement at home committee we the veteran board members up here we should have we lost sight

[02:19:00]
our responsibility so while I understand that last year's bored handed over the responsibility for right-sizing and Community engagement as a board we did not relinquish our responsibility to the community I want to be really clear about that I also want to be very clear that I support the right sizing and repurposing efforts I understand that these have to happen I support the international school for high school for newcomers Highland High School I watched that Flagship program get demolished in

[02:20:00]
19 and 1998 and we have suffered since then so yes I am with you in understanding the need for that newcomer school and support for families and I support an inclusive dual language magnet for K through 5 and into middle school but I think it's important we are right sizing then we've got to look at our dual language programs and bring them together is the black of support for Community engagement I think that's where we got it so wrong here

[02:21:00]
and we need to build rebuild the trust now I think you can appreciate and I'm going to speak as a parent and a grandparent if you want my child to go to Taylor then convince me show me that I belong there and I really appreciate the Spanish speakers just because we haven't heard from the ell populations does not mean that they're okay with this because that was a child that had to translate for my mother this is a difficult

[02:22:00]
populations it looks very different for the Native American population at let me see and thank you for sending me the the the the the boundary or the theater that was outstanding that that helped I wish I had had this 6 months ago but you know we have a Native American population at 6:45

[02:23:00]
we have 70% Hispanics at Taft it's 88 percent and I'm using whatever is on dashboard I don't know if it's different now I suspect not but our El population is 24.8 at 10:00 I want to hear from those parents and I think I heard children with children with disabilities 27.88 35.6 at Taylor we've got to bring these two communities together and my question is why couldn't this have happened last January February March January I understand we were in the middle of a lot of a lot was going on but the right thing

[02:24:00]
schools and by the way was Los Ranchos is 63 percent feeding to Taft and Mission is 640 not reach out to communities I think there's a couple of things with that and Mr Hawkins didn't work here then right so but I think there are a couple things and I think that it's

[02:25:00]
and also that it's the communities primarily that are impacted by this because I think again this is a three-prong effort and so I'm from the question I think you're asking is the ale population of the of Taft not necessarily the Yale population of the newcomers is that your question my question is why why why not all this promised Outreach now we're going to talk to families Why didn't it happen why didn't we begin this conversation last March I think there's a couple of reasons one in last March there was a different superintendent and so I can't speak to the work of the previous superintendent and the direction at that time but I also know that

[02:26:00]
during that time there's also the duranes was being closed and the focus was on meeting with the duranes families that were impacted by the shift of school for this for this school year so a lot of the work in the spring was meeting with the duranes families and that in the past has been how right-sizing has worked with families it's it's typically been and it has gone well we've heard from families from it typically happens after the boundaries are changed so I think that there was indication to talk to families sooner this year but in that there was still the process that after the decision is made that's when the transition of the

[02:27:00]
principal from the school works with the students they have open houses even the principal today we were in a meeting with MacArthur and he talked about the work that they continue to do that's great about putting the schools together so I think it's a timing also that typically that family work of welcoming to a new school happens after the decision has been made to change the boundaries and I understand that that's been the process previously we also weren't you know we were in the midst of embracing and enacting all the changes around student comes Focus governance and and he or critical to that to our new governance model is

[02:28:00]
engagement especially when changes are going to impact gold one and two and guardrail for I think we really need to reconsider I don't know you know I'm throwing this out there how or at what point we engage families I don't think you can talk about a boundary change without talking to families about the implications the implications of that boundary change I also worried about what is the what are the consequences with the Los Ranchos elected officials I think it's important for us to have a good relationship

[02:29:00]
friendship with them and but but more than anything else I am concerned about having engagement with families explaining the implications from the ground up it has to happen that way I would like as a parent as a grandparent I would want to know and what I've heard from the community meetings is that what people are asking for is to honor culture to honor keeping a sense of community and to answering I know that's

[02:30:00]
did you want I know you all have worked hard but I also believe that sometimes we get so wrapped up in my new shoes that and I'm going to say this as a board member I think that happened to us we lost track we should have been asking for updates we were promised regular updates we didn't get those numbers and on the importance of community engagement thank you and just as a point of personal privilege I'd like to ask that you speak for yourself statements about what we didn't do but I'd appreciate if you could take ownership for your own actions that would help will go ahead and continue to move on to remember Jackson thank you I believe I have four questions I'm just

[02:31:00]
my first question is there was an indication during public comment that that maybe the village of Los Ranchos was not engaged so superintendent Blakey I'm wondering if you could kind of give a little bit more in-depth discussion on when the village of Los Ranchos was first engaged and kind of what some of the conversations that you've had not only you because I think you made an excellent point you've only been in this position since June so if you could also maybe July sorry if you could get some historical knowledge as well that you might be able to bring is to win this discussions with little Ranchos first occurred thank you for the question of Miss Jackson the first conversations was with the former mayor 2 years ago

[02:32:00]
and talking about what it look like to right size the district because so many schools were in the North Valley and so there were discussions at that time with the mayor that was about what it could look like during a right-sizing primarily at that time it was looking at Taft duranes and la Luz then the former then after that there was another mayor and he actually had been on our Capital advisory Council was on YouTube so he was involved in conversations on Taylor primarily and Taft because of the bond and

[02:33:00]
advocating for yes for our children is the pack that helps with the bond and so he was involved with that I as you stated I started July 1st I met with the current mayor pro-tem the week after I started in my position so it was about the second week of July and I met with him and the planning and zoning and talked about what was happening in at Taft that's when The Blue Team the current bus loading and unloading Zone and that was the work that they did this year in August to start to prepare for having more traffic and so I met with the mayor and other members of their Administration in November and at that time talked a little bit about how can we know

[02:34:00]
you know how can we better communicate with the village like what is the best Avenue how does that work obviously we have a lot of different jurisdictions in the city and in the area and we talked about like how could we how can they reach out to let us know when they're meetings are how can we reach out and how can we begin to bridge that they are going to be going through a transition of a mayor and we have asked our governments on to reach out to the mayor elect to set up regular meetings with the new mayor so thank you so much thank you I'm sorry just wanted to clarify that throughout 2022 I had monthly meetings with mayor Lopez in my role as the board member representing that district and so we would meet monthly and also visit and tour of the schools together so that was happening as well

[02:35:00]
and then also as soon as mayor Craig was elected we arranged for myself superintendent Blakey and mayor Craig to have lunch together and unfortunately we had that lunch was canceled due to his stroke and then ultimately his death so we weren't able to have that conversation with him about the right size but it was certainly planned as part of that transition from mayor Lopez to Mayor Craig thank you thank you for that context because I I what I what I hope is coming across is that there has been consistency with APS in trying to reach out to the Village of Los Ranchos but maybe there hasn't been maybe some historical knowledge has not been passed along on both sides from the mayor I don't know the connection of the mayor to the trustees all of the conversation so I think either the board members or the superintendent or

[02:36:00]
Health had was with the mayor okay thank you the next question I have and it was it was it's kind of address but I think there was one thing that was maybe left out that I hope you can elaborate on that there was some talk of delay and you did mention some things that could impact delay but what I think you also maybe didn't touch on that is to me is crucial is that if there is a delay in this decision it also means that the other decisions are delayed and I wonder if you could talk about not necessarily this one but how a delay here is going to make the other dominoes fall and impact the international school and impact the K through 8 dueling language program so if you could just expand on that just a little bit so part of right sizing is it's not

[02:37:00]
I'm seeing as particularly in one entity it really is seen comprehensively and so it it involves multiple stakeholders it involves multiple communities we don't have a lot of empty space or any empty space that is just sitting waiting to be have a school created coupled with that we also don't believe in shuttering schools and just boarding up Taft and so part of knowing what we're doing with the facility is part of knowing right sizing and so that's why these are all contingent upon each other for Coronado to expand to her tonight they are in a very tight facility they are they don't have a music room they don't have an art room they can't have one because of the space of where they

[02:38:00]
and so Coronado is at capacity and needs more room Coronado to expand to a K-8 school because they do not have their own boundary magnet school they don't have a natural feeder meaning that they don't feed to another school they would go back to their neighborhood school or submit a transfer to another school so there has been a lot of work on expanding or not to be K-8 school so they are kind of on the list of what we would say facility needs right so they need more space so that's why the proposal is to move or not Auto into the Taft building to create more space for them to be able to expand a coupled with that is the creation of the international school I believe very strongly that

[02:39:00]
is there a national schools should not be housed in the back of another school in Portables I believe that if you really look at our goals and our guard rails and our own my own stance on Equity that they should be in a state of the art facility and knowing that the international school could partner with organizations from the community who provide wraparound services that can be in the facility it's a very well I would say groundbreaking ideas that the team under the leadership of Antonio Baca has really been working on to see what it could look like to be a state of the art school for the international school so they need a space in order to do that and that's why Coronado was identified as a space so they are all contingent upon each other we can't open a 8

[02:40:00]
if we don't have in their current facility it's impossible the international doesn't have a facility and we don't have an empty facility available so if there was a delay then we would have to go back to right sizing and start kind of from scratch to identify need and spaces which would delay the opening of the international school for next year and it would delay being able to add sixth grade to Cornell they don't have the space at their current facility to add sixth grade to Coronado thank you the next question I have and I might work in a little bit of commentary but just a little bit as you have laid out this plan for us Dr Blakey the team and you have consistently said

[02:41:00]
dad the the right sizing that will be occurring is to kind of increase resources and programming for the students and some of the resources and programming that I could think of off the top of my head that would benefit both the Taft and the tailor students by a consolidation include a decrease in prep time for teachers a increase in collaboration time potential for more counselors more nurses potential for an increase in the addition of electives for the students possibly additional principles or Dean's of students depending on the size of the middle school and so my question is are there any other resources or programming that you think that I that I have missed that would benefit the students because again as you've said consistently

[02:42:00]
this is being done so that our students get the best resources and best programming and best educational opportunity that we can possibly give them so I want to give you the opportunity to let the public know let the community know why is this the best for our students from a programming perspective I can start and then turn it over to Dr Gonzales so Taft and Taylor are about you know 200 students an ideal Middle School size for really to look at guardrail too and how we look at resources equitably is really to be between 500 to 700 students that's ideal Middle School size for civil reasons and in addition to the things you said the middle schools are only gets a half

[02:43:00]
of an assistant principal due to their size they have to use their budget what's and that's obviously a very small budget because school budgets are driven by the size of the school so that the schools essentially pull everything they have together to pay for the other half of their assistant principal if they want to have a full assistant principal this would give them a full assistant principal off the bat they wouldn't have to use their own money they would have I believe two counselors they would have full they would have better stuff teaching so meaning that right now if you have 12 to 15 teachers you really are operating on a very small scale of things like Dr Gonzalez mention teachers are teaching multiple classes they don't have collaboration you know teachers need collaboration

[02:44:00]
if you don't have other teachers teaching 7th grade math you don't have anybody to talk to about your practice and looking at our special education services and looking at serving our English language Learners we need a larger school with more resources including human resources of the physical teachers there to be able to really serve our students equitably and the other thing that that middle schools particularly when they're at 500 to 700 students they are able to operate what we call teams or families which is the best practice for middle schools and we know creates a sense of belonging and what that essentially means is that the students and maybe some people may have gone to schools like this they share the teachers share the same

[02:45:00]
students for their content classes of English math social studies and Science and the all the teachers have the same students and it creates a family of students and so they can talk about students they can support them holistically they can have family meetings when you have 200 students teachers are teaching 6 7th 8th grade math they're not they aren't being they're not the kids are on teams in that way and the teachers aren't able to collaborate in what is the best practice for Middle School do you have anything to add I was my list in Dr Blakey covered most of it but I would just have just a few things one is the economy of scale is really an important piece to consider when you're looking at a comprehensive middle school and this Awards us the ability to have stuff from your assistant principal to your

[02:46:00]
social workers different ancillary staff that supports special education is really important to have a programmatic feed to these different pieces the other thing is the Ft that follows students is Consolidated in a way that the economy of scale can facilitate options for students in relationship to the Arts electives stem robotics different opportunities for middle school students to explore in your smaller middle schools their limited so you don't have the options the plethora of options that that magic number that were talking about is that 500 Middle School student population yields the other thing that I said is just because we have a larger Middle School

[02:47:00]
the consolidation of Captain Taylor does it mean that you have larger class sizes and that's an important piece to keep in mind because we are still Bound by our agreements with our teachers so we still maintain our class sizes but options the only other thing that I would mention to this conversation and reference to middle school education is when we look at the demographic data for the Taft Middle School attendance Middle School attendance Zone over the next five 10 years the enrollment in that area the student population in that area for Middle School will continue to decline therefore our ability to do what we're doing now will diminish even more over time so from a programmatic teaching and learning point of view that's concerning because we want to be able to offer a robust

[02:48:00]
broad middle school students at Walmart so my final question is there is there is it seems to be that there are some inconsistencies or some fear that has been that has developed over the course of the last couple of weeks right and it and it's natural right like this is this is what is happening to to our kids and I completely understand the natural reaction of being fearful of what might happen to your particular student and your particular School your family because the schools become quite a family but I think that there's been some inconsistencies that have that have lost them into into that fear so this

[02:49:00]
question is from my question is from the questions you've received so far are there any other inconsistencies that you have heard either tonight or in the past couple of weeks that you have not been asked but you feel very strongly needs to be addressed I think that one is the timeline which I think we've addressed tonight the what to do with Taft I think that one thing that really is important to understand and I think board member Tapia Romero pointed out at the beginning is that even myself my evaluation is dependent on student outcomes and I think it's needs to be understood that

[02:50:00]
we would never make a decision that we believed was going to lead to a road that is not connected to student outcomes and I do think it's a very hard decision but I think and I have I have family who have worked at Taft I understand the importance of the history of Taft and the personal connections to Taft but I also know that a hollowed out haft is not in the best interests of any of our students and that is what concerns me I know that we have students at a school that's doesn't have space and that concerns me they and I know that we have a population of newcomer

[02:51:00]
he that has been crying for support and need a space to be able to thrive and learn just like it all of our other students so I really see this as a comprehensive package that it's as I have admitted we have missed steps from not telling the elementary schools at an appropriate time but I also feel that we have a lot of time ahead of us to be able to work with families during the transition and I believe that a hollowed out staff or half half with low staff and you know 150 students is not viable if every Dr Gonzalez talked about we've looked at the demographics and the shift of the neighborhood if every student we have a high percent of students

[02:52:00]
from Alvarado that do not go to Taft that is true but even if every student in the Taft current boundary every single one didn't transfer out and went to Taft it would not have enough students to be viable so this isn't an issue of transfers out don't help but it's not sustainable with the current demographics and the projection that we see at Taft and it is a good educational opportunity for students and I think that the big hole we saw which I think the community for reiterating to us is that Los Ranchos and Alberto have a dual language strand at their school for 5th grade and they do not have a sixth grade dual language and that is a concern and so I think that by opening up sixth grade

[02:53:00]
at the Taft campus to allow for the Dual language students I think that that is needed because that's another hole that we have in our programming Valley does have dual language so for students to continue on our goal for goal for goal 3 they do need to be in that pathway to be able to go to Valley and graduate with the bilingual seal okay so I just want to acknowledge like others have done Dr Blakey and your team I it is it is a hard thing to admit when you've made a mistake and I really have to commend you on your transparency and your willingness to hold yourself accountable and to do it publicly that's very hard to do and it is it it's a welcome change

[02:54:00]
from what I have seen so I appreciate you admitting that I appreciate you admitting that that yeah we probably should have done a little bit better but you admitted it and I think what it could have been very easy to do was for you to shirk your duty and to say oh well okay throw my hands up in the air and and well guess we messed that one up and let's put our head back in the sand and move on you did not do that and so I appreciate you holding yourself accountable for that this this is really what to me is in the best interests of our students and this has been a two-year long discussion it really has and there are we have been prepared we were given the opportunity to have small group discussions with both of you we have the opportunity to ask questions

[02:55:00]
we we've we've been prepared I feel prepared I knew what was coming so I appreciate that as well and again I think that that is also a shift that is is new and so again I appreciate your leadership on that and I'll just end with that I do think that this is in the best interests of our students and I think this is what will benefit them the most so thank you thank you remember Jackson we are ready to move on to a member benefits I do however want to acknowledge that we are approaching the three-hour Mark and so remember benavidez I would want to propose that we take a short recess break but I want to know do you want to go first questions and then we do a break before me or break and then before you or I don't have to put it on you I can put it on the whole board do people need to take a break people might want to take a break and have reasons for that so I don't want to stand in the way of it okay we will be fully reinvigorated when we come back so we're going to do a short

[02:56:00]
best for a break and we'll be back in 5 minutes so that would be around 8:05

[03:05:00]
we can ask people to please take their seats and Mr Gonzalez resume Pandora

[03:06:00]
to review it so how does the establishment of the International High School fit in with the Taft right sizing effort and I agree that the school should be expanded into a state-of-the-art facility I want to say that and so the answer is it will go into the current Coronado facility is that correct yes okay my next question which is sort of an answered and I will review what I have written here when did the internal discussions about this right sizing effort began and when begin and when was the decision made and So based on answers from superintendent Blakey and president Gonzalez superintendent Blakey stated that she had been speaking with the Los Ranchos mayor as long as two years ago and president in Gonzales had been speaking with stakeholders I believe in Los Ranchos you can correct me if I'm wrong throughout 2022 so as early as 2022

[03:07:00]
when did the internal discussions begin do you all have a date is as you know the right sizing initiative started in 2013 the variables and the assessment Matrix was created about 2015 and so we have known for almost a decade the schools that address because of the various variables and romance investment capacity versus enrollment all those things and and we continue to run them through the variable so we've known for a long time but as a stupid

[03:08:00]
just a matter of okay he had the school that address that's close them they have to be a very kind of thoughtful and Technical and academic way of looking at what are the decisions and how do they reverberate down the whole district and how we do things longer thank you for that and so understanding that this has been in discussion for about a decade and understanding that there is a real need when would you say the decision for tax was made I would say that the decision first half was made in 2022 when did 2020 so I think in 2022 was when the decision for Taft was made the question

[03:09:00]
did you with the facilities so I think the decision that Taft was on the right sizing list and did need to be repurposed but the decision of what to do with it I think was solidified early this fall the idea of Coronado has gone through different iterations over the past year I think yes and even before and in the past we looked at options of putting in 3x classrooms but we bought when we came up with a design in the bed to put the next classrooms

[03:10:00]
it came in at 1,000 a square foot just because of how tight and hard the spot was and so given that we have school that need to be repurposed it wasn't an economically viable decision I think what solidified the comprehensive plan of the three schools because then the question becomes what to do with Coronado was in the fall I'm looking at Dr Gonzalez or maybe Mister Baca we received the grant for the international school so that gave us the green light to be able to move on the concept of the school that had been discussed but we had the financial support to be able to move forward on the international school and I believe that was in September September of this year and that was what kind of pushed it forward to then

[03:11:00]
have a meeting with the board to talk about what the whole plan would look like in small groups and begin the conversation of moving forward with the plan once we had the opportunity to open up the international school okay thank you do you mind if I continue absolutely go ahead and so this is I'm sort of going to call on my fellow new board members board members Oregon board member but do you because I do not recall during our onboarding when we were elected a year ago or immediately thereafter being informed of this effort we were informed of many different things and understandably we were in the middle of a superintendent search which took a lot of our time but do you remember at all being informed of this which is a huge effort it's a huge project no

[03:12:00]
I was aware because I had been involved in other Communications when do dinosaurs was closing and Community involvement that way so I was aware and different ways not on the onboarding so you're correct their oh okay so onboarding is specific but you were aware of this through other channels okay so I was not made aware of this until I was invited to a meeting on Zoom or that was going to be on zoom on October 31st I was not aware of this effort and that meeting was very well done I appreciate the effort that was put in by the administration to do this for us it was quite long but it was one meeting and after that I believe during the meeting and board member Dominguez and don't can refresh my recollection but I do believe we asked for materials to be sent to us so we can review them and I don't think that's happened and I searched

[03:13:00]
I don't recall receiving anything and it never came up again so imagine my surprise when I come to the meeting on December 4th and the community is here and thank goodness they are thank you for for letting us know because I did not know this was going to be on the agenda I didn't know that we were going to be voting on this so soon after having that meeting and I feel very uninformed as a board member and I will take accountability for that I need to ask more questions but not knowing that this was coming and finding in the whole year goes by and this is not a new a new idea it's a project that's been ongoing for many many years not knowing that this is going to happen learning about it on October 31st and then being blindsided to have to make a decision so quickly it makes

[03:14:00]
it feels very irresponsible and I'm curious as to how my fellow new board members feel about if they felt like they were informed and I'm glad that you felt fully informed board member Jackson because I sure don't and again thank you to the community for for letting us know that this was coming so if any of the new board members would like to dispute and what I've said and if you had access to this information good for you because I sure didn't President console can I just add to this a little bit more because she was leaning in and then you got it thank you the other thing that's very alarming and not knowing is that this process is also going to take place in my district and that was one thing I reiterated and knowing that when those Community meetings were going to start specially concerning Taylor 7

[03:15:00]
bar in James Monroe I was asked to be a prize and we were all asking to be a price of these Community meetings and it's alarming that I don't know when we're going to start on James Monroe and 7 bar and Taylor and I still don't know how do I inform my community do I have to wait for just says as we heard here for my community to come to me and tell me oh this is what's going on I think it's it's it's really hard to understand that we are forgetting let me rephrase this and this is one thing my mother has always told me to my out my work and advocating for children she has always said you will never reach the children

[03:16:00]
until you reach their parents and I believe that strongly and if we're not engaging the community and the adults and the stakeholders I don't know how we expect to change and fulfill these goals that we have set for these children as we move forward and as a board member who's been on here for a year but we are more informed because it's one of these things when you're surprised and you sit and you and you get feedback from the community members and you have no idea and I feel sort of bad to represent APS and not even know what's going on I like to be more informed and I would hope that as we move forward and as the community is strongly stating that we start listening

[03:17:00]
we need to start listening I've been involved in this district for almost 20 years and have been various issues that have come to the table and sat where those community members are sitting and offered up changes that need you to occur with other communities and those communities were never heard also so let's change this and I hope with not only the new board members here I hope that everyone here really understands this thing has to shift it's time to start getting real with people with their students and the message we're

[03:18:00]
I personally feel I don't think we're giving superintendent Blakey the credit she deserves for the communication that she was very intentional about in communicating with the board specifically in regards to her 90-day plan that she that she introduced to all of all seven of us when she became a superintendent when you dive into that 90-day plan it is very clear that it talks about what schools will be impacted by right sizing so to say that no one or the entire board was not informed that's not correct I believe it's important that we talk about the intentionality behind it that she did her best to communicate with that and I hate to be so blunt but just because you did it read it does not mean it wasn't there and it's very important that we ensure that Dr Blakey is communicating

[03:19:00]
is she supposed to the information also went out on previous agendas and and information that we were going to be voting on so I can't agree when we say that we were blindsided and we didn't know what was coming out for us to be voting on so I won't sit here silently and let everybody get thrown under the bus when we were fully vetted and given the information we needed to make the proper decisions here how you decided to interpret that is on you but Dr Blakey I'm going to look at you like I feel like you gave us all the information we needed to thank you for doing that thank you for ensuring that you will always do what's best for students and that student outcomes will always be at the top of your your priorities and knowing how many schools will be impacted here it's not just one I really feel like you made the best decision not an easy one but you did the best you could so thank you thank you remember Romero and

[03:20:00]
opportunity for the board to respond did you have other questions for the administration I want to be very clear about the fact that I did not say that the entire board was not informed I was speaking on behalf of being a new member and asking the other new members I also want to be clear that whether or not it's in a strategic plan which it is thank you this should have been an ongoing conversation the entire year there's a big difference and putting it in a plan and bringing it up at meetings letting us know this is happening giving us stages of the project communication is important obviously so I want to be real clear about that thank you for what you have done I do appreciate it and I'm not being insulting I don't mean to be disrespectful I hope it doesn't come off that way what I'm saying is as a new board member I don't feel like I was fully informed there was a lot of time for us

[03:21:00]
to have these conversations I am taking responsibility for the research I need to do on my own but am I supposed to pull things out of thin air and just start researching them I mean I'm going to from now on but I'm going to go down the list this might be happening I should research it this might be happening it's we don't have time for that we rely on people to inform us of the things we need to be informed of this is important thank you did you have any additional questions I do not think you thank you I also wanted to acknowledge that number to put a question on the table I think related to James Monroe which I'm not sure what that is related to is that something you wanted an answer from the administration the day they know what we're talking about okay so you know what we're talking about so can you respond to that absolutely Madam president board member

[03:22:00]
committee and kind of moving forward at looking at additional Northwest boundary adjustments as well as Southwest boundary adjustments and at this point those have not been brought forward to to the superintendent for approval yet thank you and to clarify when you say boundary adjustments can you just say more what that means is that Madame Madame chairman so that's just looking at at balancing some of our balancing our schools so looking at areas within our different regions of our city looking at capacity numbers and then looking at our actual numbers that we have a student attending but also students that are zoned for those schools and it's just looking at neighborhoods there's a whole process that goes along with that and looking at keeping neighborhoods together looking at Transportation as we move forward with that and so those will be continued discussions through the right sizing process and then taken through the process

[03:23:00]
thank you Dr Blake anything else on that one know it's James Monroe and 74 are not on the proposal that are in front of you it's not ready for that just correction I did receive from a Community member who asked me to vote for that so I don't know what the community knows yeah they're the communities talking about it so there's nothing on an agenda about seven bar or write thank you so we'll go ahead and continue I'm confused so I'm trying to remember the conversation at the end of October So currently 7 bar students are attending our schedule to attend which school Madam chairman board member

[03:24:00]
get to their schedule to continue to to stay with Taylor okay and about how many is about 25200 of them $200 and then they go back to Cibola High School so I just wanted to acknowledge her open meetings we don't have anything related to James Monroe on our agenda so I want to be careful about what we discussed I think we're trying to clarify the relationship between boundaries and right-sizing of buildings is there anything else related to that the cleanup of the Southwest and Northwest

[03:25:00]
countries are part of a bigger right-sizing picture and those are not ready for Community or board at this time they're still being worked on thank you so we will go ahead and move on remember benavidez you are done with your questions great thank you and so that leaves me and I just wanted to date for our government's manual the vice president will provide during board member discussions or debates when the president is actively engaged that's for beat someone go ahead and handle to vice president home worried to ensure order if needed and proceed with my questions and being the last person many of them have already been asked and answered so I hope it'll be pretty quick so I did have a question around if every single student in the boundary for Taft attended Taft would it still be viable and I think you answered that

[03:26:00]
also wanted to acknowledge that we've heard from Alvarado over the last month parents from Alvarado and how you're addressing their concerns I just want to summarize you've added a dual language pathway you've begun the process to begin a traffic study you have forgot the conversation around super stops you are beginning to Institute quarterly meetings with the village of Los Ranchos you are committed to extending and continuing to grow and invest in the stem program at Garfield Middle School you're allowing the Alberto Elementary School to look into an agricultural theme and okay so providing students with multiple opportunities for Middle School is there anything else in response to the feedback that we've heard from the community know I think that covers it I know Dr Gonzalez has talked to the principal about the work at Alvarado and

[03:27:00]
in addition families are also given priority to any Middle School to keep them in the pathway for Valley that's why we have opened up the three different options but they have priority transferred to any Middle School that they choose and the families that have so far filled out where they'd like to go the majority of them have requested Taylor but we do have families who have requested schools from outside and one clarification for it because all verado does have some transfer students that don't live in the boundary and at the last parent meeting that we had I think it was last week we did let them know that if they're a transfer for example from coach City to Alberto that they will be giving the transfer priority for being a feeder to test because they were at Taft as a fifth grader

[03:28:00]
and so we did want to clarify that as we clean up the procedural directive on transfers it does include families who have transferred into Alvarado who wish to transfer to Coronado for 6th Grade Garfield or Taylor so students who are currently in a dual language program at fifth grade can go into dual language for sixth grade even if they do not live in the current Taft yes if they attend elverado as a transfer but they do not live in the boundary they will have the same transfer rights as all the other students who are attending Alberto as a neighborhood school okay wish to pursue that thank you so stupid who are affected at Taft would receive a priority transfer to any Middle School in APS all right thank you so we heard

[03:29:00]
concerns related to the Village of Los Ranchos specifically or primarily related to Traffic also heard some statements that there have not been formal meetings only I think back door discussions with the village of Los Ranchos I wanted to I think Mr Hawkins probably for you understand more about the meetings that took place in July and maybe Dr Blakey as well where so if you could just sort of walk through I believe there was a meeting with the traffic administrator I don't know the name of the person's role in Los Ranchos about some of these concerns and the district responded immediately and changed something related to Taft can you walk us through sort of what happened there absolutely so Madam president and and I may ask you to help me out so is that as I was entering as I was coming on board here joining APS my understanding and talking to the team is our blue team so that that is our bus loading and unloading Zone safety

[03:30:00]
I've been had been meeting over over our current traffic pattern both on site as well as off site at Taft middle school and so if you look at the if you look here on at the photo on the South Side on the bottom end there was an additional drop off area that I believe is being used for for buses and that was added in August of 24 to address that I don't have specifics to what any more specifics as to what conversations were had during those meetings but I know that was a result of some prior meetings to thank you I'm just trying to situate myself so she is on thank you

[03:31:00]
there was a formal meeting with the village the traffic concerns were raised the district responded by adding a drop-off spot at Taft to redirect traffic from the village roads onto the campus that is my understanding okay thank you I also heard a claim that they're not has not been any Community engagement and I know often we resort to hyperbole in moments of high emotions so we know that it's not true that there has not been any Community engagement is that correct that's correct okay and you also mentioned was notified via a letter from Principal Lovato the former principal you said in 2021 January of 2023 23 and there was some comments around there not being advisors

[03:32:00]
superintendent Blakey since you came in you established I know there was a student advisory commission already you established a business advisory and then there was one more parent advisory committee there's a business advisory committee a student advisory committee a teacher advisory committee and a principal advisory committee okay so parent Student Business teacher and principal all to give you feedback okay also then related to guardrail one which states the superintendent will not allow the district to operate with inequitable distribution of school and Community wraparound services so if we think about distribution of resources distribution of services that could include staff Capitol Building etcetera do you think the proposed change violates the guard real No in fact it's the opposite because we're able to provide

[03:33:00]
more Equitable on distribution of resources if you recall the work of ERS that was I believe last year the I'm looking at your mouth because I know the finance company took a big load of this on when IRS did the report on the looking at how we budget a lot of their reference was to some of our schools that are too small and it's not allowing us to really distribute resources and wraparound services in an equitable way and so part of the work of rightsizing is addressing guardrail one by making sure that we're able to do that by the way that we're able to provide wraparound services to students when we were able to have more sustainable and viable schools okay thank you one thing that came up in the village of Los Ranchos board

[03:34:00]
meeting last night and is included in the letter from the village is related to the aps budget so there was a claim that APS budget is growing while student population is declining thus the district must have lots and lots of money to be able to run these schools so I'm wondering if you could just clarify for me and for the public how that actually works so there's a pot of money for students and operations there's separate money for facilities how much of the money is tied up so to speak can you give some clarity around this sort of question or contention around the district hiding how much money we actually do have available yes board president Gonzalez members of the board are budget is decided by the state and if you recall in the past four to five years we have had significant races in

[03:35:00]
and teachers and employees which is great and but in order to fund that the budget gets bigger but it goes to pay the salaries of the staff with the raises that are provided through the scg for our students based on our student enrollment so one of the reasons that you'll see an increase is because of the increase in salaries you also I wasn't privy to see the document that was handed out but it could have also had the SR funds so if you recall in the past four years we have had a large amount of efforts of federal funding and that if that money was included in the document you'll know from the work that we've done through the board in the budget that the SR funds look like

[03:36:00]
it has inflated the budget that this year when we present the budget I'm beginning in January you'll see that it looks like it drops significantly coupled with that we also have Capital dollars that is used on buildings which is separate and operational dollars the money that comes through the budget for operation can only be used on operational costs which is 90% salaries for staff the capital costs are what we can use for the facilities for upgrading facilities for maintaining facilities and those Capital dollars I think Mr wooden J can speak more to it but we have a 7 billion dollar deficit in our building and how much money we need to be able to meet the standard of what we would like to do with her or school buildings so the interesting thing about the money is that the

[03:37:00]
see actually the legislative finance committee and I believe 2022 under the previous superintendent did a review of the Albuquerque Public Schools budget and cited the need for right-sizing because of the amount of schools we had compared to the amount of students in the declining enrollment and so I think that that report from the legislative finance committee was also what Spirit the push of the board to move more quickly on right sizing because of what was seen by the Legislative finance committee reiterated by the study that year did you want to talk anymore about the amount of money needed for Capital dollars oh thank you thank you Lord president and members of the board briefly the

[03:38:00]
85 of the capital money comes from local property taxes which come in the form of school bombs and school Mill levies and we strive to keep the tax rate plan if you go look at our taxation capacity it looks like we are only we're only at like 60% capacity like we could go up in terms of 40% but you have to remember this 14 other entities within our district that are asking the same time the city the county CNM the drainage ditches and so by using the taxes will be unfair burden to attack us we tried that once before we were around me defeated and so we

[03:39:00]
how to make do with our current tax rate and and in the future and this is not part of this this construction inflation we really we have 14 + 16,000 sq ft of building environment on 1,200 square miles of which 40% is 60 years older and so we have to pick and choose and prioritize what we do but at the same time maintain equity and student achievement thank you thank you sticking with the there's not been Community engagement Community engagement hasn't been with every single number of the community I didn't want to acknowledge some of the meetings that have taken place so

[03:40:00]
remember Dominguez was saying that there hasn't been any Community engagement I went to my email and social media to try to find some dates and so some things that I found was February 8th there was a presentation to the North Valley neighborhood association that Dr Blakey gave in her capacity as chief operations officer it was February on April 16th there was a presentation that I gave to another neighborhood association on for excuse me but not you never mind on the 26th of April the near North Valley neighborhood association had their annual meeting and I gave a presentation to them responding to some of the questions that they had from the previous and then also on May 9th there was a community conversation that I hosted in the district as well and so all of that was made public and open and promoted through the neighborhood assoc

[03:41:00]
there has been a variety of conversation happening throughout the district again maybe not with every single member of the community but it's been happening why can't you just sell tapped so that is an option that we have looked at selling property is very complicated as you may be aware there's also a state law that if we dispose of any property in the district or we have it empty that it goes first to a charter school so it wouldn't be just you know it's not like selling your house where you just put it up for sale or give it to another entity any property from the district that we would dispose of those first two charter schools and that is a law that I believe passed last go ahead

[03:42:00]
superintendent yes it has to go through the State Board of Finance to be approved and it's a law that passed I think in 2020 I think 2019 or 2020 and this is because of the 50 or so charter schools in our in our district maybe only about a dozen or so in public building a question from the community that Taft is situated in the village of Los Angeles so why can't we just give the Taft building to the village and let them decide what to do with it it's similar to the same answer as before Mr do you want to explain more how our property Works yes so how many physically reside in the village

[03:43:00]
but the top attendance area is much larger than the village so it's not just a Los Ranchos issue it's a wider area issue and and the issue about selling property it's one of those things the Board of Education and previous boats to this data really good job in a firing land way ahead of time to put in schools and you continue to do that and over different periods and have worked here for over 20 years we've had institutions with that private entities and you have this school in a primary or why can't you do this or that with a school with Service Agency that's supposed to provide education and I do not think our primary

[03:44:00]
play immediate role is to kind of serve one entity and just turn over what is supposed what taxpayers used for educational purposes if it can be plowed into that thank you I think coupled with that too is we do have needs in different populations of growth such as Coronado and finding space for the international school and we are not in a place where we would have the ability to just build a new school and so I'm looking at how we reuse facilities to dispose of property when we know that we need it in other ways wouldn't be I think responsible on our side because there are facilities that we still need use for but we are not in a position where we would be able to build a brand new school

[03:45:00]
thank you so Coronado was a colonizer a conquistador arguably not a good person is their potential to change the name Coronado to something else and can you walk us through the process for a school name change I see the principal in the audience of Coronado but I won't make her answer the name change question but Mr I think could answer How We Do name changes for schools we have a board with a board and an administrative rule about how we do name changes they just the short of it is that they come from the community in conjunction with

[03:46:00]
Administration and then brought before the board of education for ratification and there's a whole process for going about that the only caveat is that you can't name it after a person who is still alive so to clarify just so I understand once it has been determined that the name will be changed it goes to the community for them to determine the to have input and help determine the name the school that Community actually generates the desire to change the name and then they go through the process that we have outlined in the procedural directive to decide on if they are going to change a name and what the name would change to and a few of her schools have looked at them so you referred to the Coronado principal so is there a

[03:47:00]
process already in motion to potentially change the name I'm sorry you have to come up to the mic just for the zoom I'm sorry it has to be the majority of the parents have to be in agreement and that didn't happen and then they have to survey the teacher so I believe I still have those surveys and also the majority of the teachers were not on board so again I will support

[03:48:00]
my community with our community wants and we started the process but they don't know thank you and so just as a follow-up considering now that the Coronado Community is expanding and growing both in terms of population and geographically is it possible to restart that process again to consider the views of the new community of course the PTA the parents and Community come to me that again and will continue to support him or support him again and I have to survive the teachers as well and believe that's a process and of course I would support him through that process okay thank you thank you for that so I just wanted to acknowledge and that's my question and so just wanted to provide a statement and just say that this process of right sizing has been one of the most complex and dynamic that I've had to deal with since I've been on the board in 2022 starting in 2022 and also just acknowledged that there is nothing

[03:49:00]
stop this passage that feels good there is nothing that is painless that said I think it's important to acknowledge that we as a district do have a shared set of commitments and they're on the wall here we have our goals and our guard rails and these are what serve as the North Star for how we as a board agreed that we will be making decisions to ensure that the future that we are supporting the district to create the future that our students deserve and so I also wanted to say that even though we are elected by single member districts we do commit his board members to serving the interests of the entire EPS community and given that in the fall of 2022 we did go out to the community and we did ask the community for their values and their Vision what they want our students to be able to know what they want our students to be able to do and we committed to upholding their values

[03:50:00]
the goals that we've set forth and so as we transition to a position of a new superintendent of a 7 billion budget deficit in facilities acknowledging that it was easy to adopt these priorities and it's a lot harder when it's time to protect them and so it's a tough decision that we have ahead of us I also want to acknowledge that I think the connection to the community has strengthened and there is still work to do over the last month and over the last three weeks really I've had dozens and dozens of conversations I've had copies I've had meetings I've participated in public meetings I participated in smaller meetings I've had these conversations in the school drop off line at the grocery store in the parking lot on social media all of my high school friends blowing up my phone because they all went to Taft

[03:51:00]
and so I just want to acknowledge that this is all so personal for me because it's my district it's where I grew up I graduated from North Valley it's it's interesting actually I got to Valley tonight when I was getting ready I opened up my jewelry box and I found my mom's class ring so I put it on from Valley High School class of 1969 and so I have a deep connection not just about to the entire North Valley Community hearing from my friends in Texas over the last couple of weeks I heard a lot of great memories of Taft and how personal task is to the community I had people sharing about how they learned the electric slide in the Taft cafeteria how they first learned to pair a ranch dressing and Pizza in the Taft cafeteria how we learned to play dodgeball in the area and how important this connection is do these people who are now adults

[03:52:00]
so again it is very personal but I also want to acknowledge that it's not fiscally responsible to keep two under enrolled schools 2 mi apart and we heard from the district that again even if every single child in the boundary that is currently attached were to enroll if we could magically make Taft the best magical Magnet School in the world they're still not enough students in that area the birth rate has declined the students don't exist and so it is with that contention that I think we really need to make these decisions with students at the center and I think it's become clear that this proposal actually provides opportunities for more students to gain Services more students now that they will combine Taft and Taylor will have access to counselors to nurses to social workers to behavioral specialist

[03:53:00]
a variety of different resources which upholds guardrail 1 as a result of this consolidation we also know that more students in Albuquerque will benefit from Dual language programming both because of the Coronado expansion and because of the decision to make that Coronado campus available to all students currently in dual language feeder programs and so that is a win for the North Valley and we also know that more students are going to have the opportunity to learn in higher quality facilities facilities that have updated HVAC which we know has been a priority of the community facilities that have updated security systems facilities that have updated technology spaces sidewalks all of those things that North Valley kids will be able to have and I also I think it's important to acknowledge I think there was a question about the relationship between the international school and the Taft consolidation and I think the proposal that's in front of us does give us an opportunity

[03:54:00]
need to hold true to our commitments around equity which is guardrail too by giving us an opportunity to address historic inequities we heard from our Refugee families about how they have been treated in our schools how they've experienced our schools and it's tragic and we have an opportunity to make that better for them I wish that we had more of an opportunity to hear from our immigrant and Refugee and newcomer families but we heard they were crowded out of the public comment but I just want to be really clear that we have failed serving them and I appreciate the leadership of the district to acknowledge that and to take a new stands and to make a hard decision to prioritize the needs of these students and families who are coming to America with a dream of

[03:55:00]
something better and so it's with that commitment to equity that commitment to my community that commitment to what's best for the most number of students that I think this proposal is the right decision and I just want to thank the community for speaking up I think the fact that the community feels safe and empowered to share their feedback so openly is truly a gift and I do value that commitment and the communication and it will continue and so that is all I have to say and so I will turn to see if there's any additional questions or emotion in a second to consider the issue on the table I will move to prove to reassign the North Valley attendance areas due to the repurposing of Taft Middle School into a dual language school this is board member Jackson

[03:56:00]
thank you have a motion for member Jackson is there a second this is board member toppy Romero second thank you are there any additional questions all right Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes on the conditions that we fulfill Community engagement and make sure that they're involved every step of the way and that we're doing what's right for for the students no no not violating yes get older

December 20th 12:30 on the December 20th agenda so thank you for your presentation we will move on now to discussion items we are on agenda item 7.1 which is a presentation on strategic initiatives for special education for this item or presenters are Dr Gabriella Blakey our superintendent doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent for leadership and learning Sherry jet Chief academic officer and TC Riser assistant superintendent for special education we you have the floor thank you madam president members of the board tonight marks the first in a series of regular updates that are designed to inform the board about our ongoing efforts to improve our student outcomes we are committed to keeping the board fully informed on how our strategic plan development sure that we're taking steps to meet the board schools while respecting the guardrails is being brought to life through targeted init

[04:05:00]
this presentation will focus on our special education efforts and the progress we are making to ensure that the Strategic plan is not just a document but it's a framework for Meaningful action Mr Gonzalez can you put up the presentation okay thank you and slide to please so before it is reviewed by the project management oversight committee what we call the pmoc is made up of District leaders and I have added school principals to meet monthly to oversee the implementation of the Strategic plan I began this pmoc so that we can make sure that the work of the Strategic plan is in reality in the schools and

[04:06:00]
what is why I have asked school principals to join us on this committee the role of the pmoc is to ensure that we stay on track to meet our goals that we are monitoring progress addressing any obstacles and ensuring alignment with our strategic priorities by providing this ongoing oversight and guidance the pmoc plays a key role in supporting the success of the plan and driving continuous Improvement across our schools as you know our goals and guardrails are the central of everything that we do for our students every day and all of our initiatives are aligned with these goals improving reading and math increasing post-secondary Readiness and developing the skills habits and mindsets for Life success every presentation that you see as part of the pmoc will demonstrate to you how we are advancing in these goals in addition to the goals and guardrails we will consistently refer

[04:07:00]
are strategic priorities mobilizing staff around a clear plan supporting rigorous culturally relevant instruction cultivating safe engaging learning environments and establishing clear systems for resources and support these priorities of our strategic plan guide all of our efforts and our initiatives as mentioned tonight's focus is on our special education which are essential to achieving our broader strategic goals the Special Education team has identified several key initiatives within the Strategic plan and we will focus on 3 tonight align and refine the special education department special education department process review organize and deliver and enhance Continuum of services these initiatives are designed to strengthen support and services for students with disabilities and aligned with the district's overall goals

[04:08:00]
I will turn this over to TC Riser who is our assistant superintendent for special education and she will walk you through these initiatives share an update on the progress and discuss the challenges we are working to address through this strategic plan thank you superintendent Blakey or president Gonzalez superintendent Blakey and members of the board tonight I will be presenting on three initiatives within the special education department strategic plan it is important to start with the simple question of what is the problem we are trying to solve we are focusing on solving the problem of low proficiency rates and reading and math for students with disabilities and significant significant achievement Gap that exists for this group of students we recognize the need for high expectations and accountability along with a clear plan of action and we recognize the need for students with disabilities to be engaged through

[04:09:00]
standards and to meet and we need to meet the individual needs of students so tonight we're going to review three strategic plan initiatives designed to help solve the problem of low proficiency rates for students with disabilities in the areas of reading and math we will cover restructuring the special education department improving the quality of services and clarifying our Support options this work is in close collaboration with Dr Gonzalez Deputy superintendent for leadership and learning and my direct supervisor Sherry Jackson the first strategic initiative I'm discussing is the lining and refining the special education department the purpose of this initiative is to address the overlaps and inefficiencies that were within the department initiative one refining the department of

[04:10:00]
expectations and priority for responsive and coordinated systems focusing on these priorities will align our department work or has the aligned our department work we've completed this task and so that we can prioritize the district goals the department has an updated organizational chart or an updated organizational structure with positions aligning to District goals and strategic priorities in Edition all members of the special education department leadership team serve on go teams and cross departmental teams this initiative was a priority to complete to ensure seamless execution in supporting the district goals this next slide shows you are strategic organizational chart the organizational structure three interpretation areas where resolution and compliance which focuses on resolution directly with

[04:11:00]
families before compliance along with compliance child find and preschool evaluation and teaching learning and programming the district goals and strategic priorities are defined for each area of responsibility the second strategic plan initiative is a process review of the special education department the review assess compliance program Effectiveness resource optimization and data-driven decision-making initiative to aligns with strategic priorities one and four also focusing on Department expectations and systems aligning these parties allows her Department to focus on the district goals the first task included was the completion of an external third party independent review of the special education department in this house was completed the review was part of the superintendent's 90-day plan and the recommendations from that plan for the Strategic plan for

[04:12:00]
apartment the focus on this next initiative is creating written guidance for compliance department is in the process of creating an IEP manual so that we have consistent processes and District guidelines for all schools the special education department leadership team is conducting audits of individual education plans and the audit Focus will focus on multiple compliance areas and will use that data to inform training that is trading and Improvement practices that are needed at our schools as part of the initiative School Staffing is regularly reviewed to ensure appropriate for allocated for students with disabilities and best practice and research supports that whenever possible students attend their neighborhood schools with their local peers this is a process we are currently working on

[04:13:00]
this last initiative I will cover tonight is organizing and delivering an enhanced Continuum of services the purpose of this initiative is to provide a framework for understanding the supports that are available for meeting the needs of students with disabilities for those individuals listening tonight who may not understand the technical side of the word I'm going to walk you through a visual of the Continuum of services is your little lesson so on your screen is the continuous services so the Continuum of services shows the supports available to students from the least restrictive setting on the left of the screen all the way to the most restrictive setting on the right of the visual the least restrictive environment for students is in the general education classroom so you see that we start on the left with general education so that's general education without individual education plans

[04:14:00]
the next level on the Continuum is all of the students instruction and and the instruction is usually like that by area like Ela math and social studies each separately but all of the instruction for an area of learning is completed in the general education classroom with accommodations on a modifications can you move over one in the Continuum still the student is sitting in a student with disabilities is sitting in a general classroom receiving all of their instructions for an area of instruction and they have a special ed teacher of trying to read my specialized instructions for the teacher pushing into that General classroom to provide support the next level of service is also in the general classroom so the majority of a student's instruction for any contact area would be in the general classroom but then the special ed teacher would would I'm sorry that's special at teacher would support the student with their specific goals

[04:15:00]
the next level on the Continuum of service is our self-contained classroom where the student is receiving all of their services all of their instruction for Content area in a specialized in the special ed classroom the next two boxes on the Continuum aren't typically found on a typical school campus but we have specialized schools we do have a few of those and The Homeschool or the hospital environment is the most restrictive setting so best practice and research support keeping students in the least restrictive environment which are found on the left so supporting students as much as possible in that classroom but always the decision is always based on a student's individuals needs okay so now let's move on to initiative three Initiative 3 aligns directly with our district goals for reading and math so special education students are positively impacted when they have more

[04:16:00]
access to grade level content and they're typically developing peers So based on the Continuum service I just reviewed placements in the least restrictive setting allows students provides provide some greater access to their grade level peers So within Initiative 3 I have personally provided training to all of our principals other school staff and District staff on the Continuum of services that training involves schools looking at data specific to their special education population and student placement and we will continue as a department to provide training so that stuff better understand the Continuum of services and the importance of utilizing the least restrictive environment to better support students We are continuing to provide training to all real groups for understanding Ida and the supports for students are curriculum assistance

[04:17:00]
are being trained on the Continuum of services and how to schedule to support the students IEP inclusive practices and strategies and supports to I'm sorry inclusive practices are strategies and to support all students in the General Ed classroom so all students not just students with disabilities so we currently have provided inclusive practice training to over 75 school teams those teams have included the school administrators General Ed and special ed teachers and we are focused on providing consistent consistency of language in all of the training that we're providing does final initiative is a collaborative effort between myself and Allison the executive director for Early Childhood so there's two kinds of preschool classrooms so this last initiative is All About Preschool we have two kinds of preschool classrooms and

[04:18:00]
turkey Public Schools so we have New Mexico Pre-K programs which are funded by the New Mexico Pre-K Grant through Early Childhood early care development and we have special education preschool classrooms which are for students with IEPs or individualized education plans for the student requires services and supports for more than 5 hours or 300 minutes a week so those are the two types of preschool classrooms the focus of our work for all of our preschool classrooms is to increase the inclusive opportunities between the programs to allow the students with disabilities to interact with age level peers we're working to expand some of our special education preschool programs to be full day programs are currently have day programs compared to New Mexico and we're doing that so that students can attend the same hours as their New Mexico pre-k program

[04:19:00]
we are planning some full day classrooms for the 2526 school year and that will and then we plan to increase those over the next few years in edition special education preschools are being looked at to be at the same School site so that they can interact together which is a priority and then we are also removing the designation of the names from our preschools they're just either going to be New Mexico preschool or a specialized preschool to ensure that our students are giving all opportunities to interact with without a specific program title for a 3450 and move to questions and we can start again on the road did you have questions

[04:20:00]
so my question is going to be surrounded your last statement regarding early childhood education and I guess wanting more of a specific timeline because there has been some challenges regarding getting full day Services when do we see that being implemented in all of the sites for that offer New Mexico Pre-K board member of Romero we are I'm presenting a plan along with Allison in January but we are we are looking at having full day about 15 to 16 this first year of our special ed preschool programs and then expanding that over time we can't we can't make too many full-time because if you don't have enough staff to cover them so okay and do you does APS still see the continued

[04:21:00]
friendship with community-based programs in terms of some Go part day and then they transfer to a community program yes we are still continuing all of our Community Based Services okay thank you thank you thank you yes remember don't worry too many questions on page 15 you talked about create a manual that were writing individualized education plans doesn't the state already have a manual created remembered our IEP manual is specific to the program that we use in which we ride our IEPs which is synergy so it'll be very specific to our the program that we use but what we're really focusing on is the compliance guidelines that the state has for auditing districts and we're ensuring that our manual and our training manual manual for our the teachers

[04:22:00]
what do IEPs can follow the guidelines of the state so we're using our state guidance as it is a Statewide template that you're using for IPC is that correct no man we're using Synergy okay look another question is you stated that you're doing training for principals teachers and what was the third group District staff where do parents come about with the procedural safeguards that's written underneath the IEPs that they get training where's that coming in each member tell me where we train parents through our advisory meetings we put out information about what they're looking for and we answer questions during prayer advisory and then our department also provides evening period how are you reaching out to those individuals when we have any kind of training we send out District wide messaging to

[04:23:00]
play families with students with a disability so that all families get notified and we're trying to offer both in person and virtual to support the needs that were that are requested we do have a request right now for how IEP goals are written specifics about the IEP and so we're addressing those in 2025 cuz I just want to make mention that based on idea and the requirements for procedural safeguards and make sure that those are being followed out for parents and that they are getting those needs met especially when they attend an IEP that that if they don't understand the process that they get those needs meant yes ma'am we are training on that as well that is covered in the IEP that's part of what we train our staff to do but we follow up with specific training that is requested from families whether we hear it directly from a family member or we hear it from a school or we hear it from

[04:24:00]
a support agency from the community so we always follow up with this request okay now page 22 when you talk about inclusive practices I know that there's been issues with inclusiveness and and taking kids and I know I brought this question about to the previous superintendent when we were looking at buying those groups for history and social studies of kids with disabilities back into General Ed and so I have an issue with inclusive practices only because inclusive is not the word used under federal law so how are you going to sustain and use those practices to help support students in Wendy's kids go to General at I have a real issue right now with how we're going to push that through because I know there's a need to requirement basis that you have to fulfill and so I need to find out how with this particular term being used what does that look like

[04:25:00]
remember to Morita the the training that we're doing on inclusive practices really is for our general education staff okay it's providing supports and strategies for all students for Ells for our second language for our special ed students for students that are struggling that are in sat it's really just how we work with all students in the classroom so inclusive practices is really just kind of an overall term for supports and strategies for supporting students in the classroom so that training is primarily for General Ed okay but I'm still hearing that with some IEPs that were looking at pushing some of these kids and exiting out of special education to put them into General Ed Show and using the term inclusive or including them back into General it so I'm just wanting to clarify that because that's what I'm hearing so our staff have been trained on the Continuum of services and so

[04:26:00]
when you look at the Continuum of services there are different placements based on the continuity of services that a team should consider so State guidance clearly says that you should have a conversation about what goals will are you working towards for the student in that General a classroom or why can they not be successful like trying to make have a student be successful and then if the student can't be successful what are we doing to help them like get back into a less restrictive so we're really having to go back to those very basic questions to ensure that we are doing best practices when we're having conversations about the least restrictive environment and how students are placed in classes period

[04:27:00]
United president member Tom burrito superintendent Blakey if I may I think one of the things that I recognized in your question is that words matter and the word inclusion brings an implication and were recognized that and as we roll out professional development using terms like least restrictive environment to really bring forth through the law what it is the term intends to be not what we think or what is become through words like conclusion so I think the point I'm trying to make is that as we roll out and prepare for our professional development in the new year with our principals our head teachers our sponsor teachers are general education teachers and so on are parents is really on being cognizant of the terminology in which we use and also the king

[04:28:00]
Continuum of services when we look at each of those steps I think it would also needs to be made mention is that it does take an IEP team it takes before we initially look at you know the first step and go into the second it takes evaluations to make sure that those are backups to why we're moving these kids out and then it's also going to take the that the team recognizes that goals are being met for each and every one of those students it's just not an Exit Plan it's just not going to make sure that we're pushing them out and that's why within the Continuum of services you know addressing those particulars because I don't want it just to look like that we're moving them from one step to the next that and and so I think within this Continuum of service and like you said falling ID and the law and at least restrictive environment that it doesn't matter it's not outside of that box and so that's the thing I'm trying to state is that what

[04:29:00]
inclusion we're going to include them we're going to put them in there you know and so I really want to make sure that how we use that word is not misunderstood because under the law it doesn't it's not listed it's only listed under lre absolutely agree okay thank you for your presentation it was really great my question the same category as board members and inclusivity and what that means but you responded well to that so my next thing is how are we making sure that students who are being included in General Ed are feeling like they are being successful with him and making sure that there's

[04:30:00]
you know mindset and habits are being developed in the general editing and not being left out remember a story that is a great question so when as a district when we look at our goal for data for sense of belonging for our students with disabilities our students with disabilities score lower across the district than every other group and this idea that we're going to slow down and make sure that we have conversations about each individual child how they're doing and what their individualized needs are training on the Continuum Services a really talking about the data that schools need hopefully will align with them having more students in the general classroom and that leading to our students with disabilities having a greater sense of belonging within their school and within their

[04:31:00]
thank you thank you thank you thank you so much for providing it I'm glad that these efforts are being worked on and I'm hoping that if there is another right sizing effort we can have a presentation like this as well be very helpful for everybody involved thanks thank you I had a question I pulled up the sapper internal visualization on special education which shows the aps has in the last school year about 24% students with disabilities I'm just curious if you

[04:32:00]
you can speak to the issue of over identification in part because it also breaks out the different types of Eligibility and specific learning disability is the highest at like 60% it doesn't show me by racial and ethnic group on the internal visualization but I would be interested in that but that's neither here nor there I'm interested if you could just speak to this issue of identification and how you might be addressing that you talked to sort of you talked a little bit about the overall training with general education teachers but can you get a little on that piece president Gonzalez yes thank you great question we are currently 26% students with disabilities so it's a little higher we are Equitable across our groups with the exception of Native American beings

[04:33:00]
slightly higher than the population within the district all of the others are Equitable with their groups one of the reasons that we chose the inclusive practices was really to work on strategies to support students in the general classroom because that's where over-identification starts and so that's kind of the the focus working directly with the chief academic officer and teaching and learning on the general add side to look at those processes and how we focus on supporting students in the general classroom before we move them to testing and really focusing on that first instruction period identification is happening in terms of specific buildings specific processes specific areas eligibility
