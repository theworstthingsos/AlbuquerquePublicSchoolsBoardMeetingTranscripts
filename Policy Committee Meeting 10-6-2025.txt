[00:04:00] which I will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agendas specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum isn't a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants or rather Mr Gonzalez will call participants to speak in the order of the signed up online gas will stay in Virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers and forgive me Mr Gonzalez how many did you say we had we have six signed up okay it's a fewer than 2 2. 0
[00:05:00] you'll have one minute but in this case 2 Minutes tonight we have six speakers once your time is up you will be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message you may email email us your comments at bored Ed one word at 8:00 p.m. at this time Mr Gonzalez will introduce the speakers
[00:06:00] okay I don't see my timer starting okay there it is there it is yes I'm Lisa Marie I am the director of Digital Arts and Technology Academy and APS charter school and I wanted to speak on item number 5 today I saw the proposed policy and feel as though the Charter School Division at APS has has really built a strong relationship with the charter schools in APS and works to ensure that that the schools get better we all do we all know that public education requires a great deal from the leaders and from the Educators nowadays especially dealing with all the different aspects that are put on public schools and I just wanted to ensure you that
[00:07:00] as a charter school leader we complete a number of different programs and a number of different reports not only to APS but to the state we create an eggplant every year which is reviewed by the state we do a 90-day plan every year which is reviewed by APS and we have site visits both in the fall and in the spring which thanks to Joseph Escobedo and his team covers academics covers special education and also covers our finances and they are a great resource for us so I understand your need for transparency and and believe we can strengthen relationships between Charters and APS and I invite any and all board members to to come and meet with our admins staffs students and discuss what we do and why we do it because it's a it's a job for all of us and it's
[00:08:00] it's never easy the more we work together the better we can be thank you thank you or next speaker is Jaime Gonzalez good evening good evening member of the committee my name is Jaime Gonzalez and I'm with public charter schools of New Mexico I want to first thank you all for allowing me to speak and commend the chair for prioritizing the goals and guard rails as they provide strong direction for APS schools and keep the focus on student outcomes my comment is about doing this the right way through process that state law lays out for Charter Schools under New Mexico statute 22 - 8 BB Dash 9 the charter contract negotiated between APS and each school is the soul operational agreement to finding accountability
[00:09:00] 6.804 also requires authorizers to maintain an arm's length relationship and avoid involvement in Daily management the charter contract is where APS and each School are meant to align through mutual agreement so what I would urge from this committee tonight is to ensure that this policy speaks back to that contract which I do think is missing from current draft language so that alignment occurs lawfully and collaboratively through renewals and negotiation thank you thank you our next speaker is Deb Henwood good afternoon my apologies good afternoon my name is Deborah Hemsworth and I am the leader of monsters Rio Grande charter school and
[00:10:00] appreciate you allowing us this opportunity to speak as on my other two peers have said we are committed to providing student facing Services through an Innovative high-quality education which allows Equitable access for all the charter renewal process and site visits as they stand are rigorous and cover all of the things that you are requesting in this new policy through existing requirements from ped and your team which is led by dot or documentary processes and evidence we have evidence of access and outcomes for all students through transparent data which is what you are asking for all charter schools have goals and guard rails that meet all students social emotional academic and cultural needs and this is documented and is evident in existing authorizes oversights
[00:11:00] and so your proposed new policies appear to contradict some of the things that are already in place and we urge that you allow Dr Escobedo and his team to oversee the charter schools which are doing unbelievably good job for all of the students in Albuquerque which we are all part of we are not separate thank you for your time thank you ma'am our next speaker is Jim Nettles unmute let me just continue the reason why for my wishing
[00:12:00] speak is because based upon the last policy meeting I believe this committee noticed the push back and the reason that I Believe Miss Jackson brought up my name was because I said something that was very important for this committee to listen to and that's the New Mexico State law and I see here in the minutes of this meeting I don't detect that the elevators gone to the top floor what an authorizer is required to do in contract is conduct himself fairly and honestly with a partner in education not an adversary
[00:13:00] okay and I'm sorry Charter Schools feel that we are not being treated in light of that and I would say that we need to have a further conversation how we can write the ship you see we have students that come to us because parents elect to come to us we're like a like a store if we're failing they don't come to us APS you must realize that the reason that you are in difficulty is people are running away from you you need to answer the question why and this agenda here is not to that end thank you sir
[00:14:00] and we have one more speaker it is odd I believe it's news is that correct sir how are you there sorry I was having trouble unmuting can you hear me thank you so much good afternoon members of the APS school board policy committee my name is Todd now and I'm the head of school of New Mexico international school at 8:00 p.m. authorized Charter School in on Montgomery and I'm joining you today or is the committee to reject the proposed revisions to policy Casey my concerns are largely around the language that extends APS Authority Beyond its statutory role as an authorizer requiring Charter governance teams to align missions and instructional practices within the district's card rails
[00:15:00] frankly that represents governance overreach not the oversight that is intended by our legislator legislature and the adoption of the passing of the charter school out specifically the ACT establishes performance-based accountability not operational control in this proposal risks undermining both the autonomy and frankly The Innovation that the legislature intended for our Charter Schools if there's something that anyone should be able to tell that's worked with the charter school World here in New Mexico it's that are Independence and are autonomy are the things that allow us to do the amazing things that we do we're flexible and we provide services that frankly aren't provided by public school districts so I'm asking the board to table this policy and instead pursue
[00:16:00] collaboration through clear contract-based accountability and to be honest I'll be a presenting to you in about a month asking for you to renew my charger for our school I'm concerned with this language that's being presented with us right now and whether that was the right move to seek reauthorization with APS thank you for thank you thank you and thank you for to all the presenters for coming out and sharing your comments and your feedback
[00:17:00] I do listen I do listen and so I want to I'll move on to to our discussion item which is the first to read of the board policy Casey charter schools and let me get to the action report I want to read it for me the board approved the recommendation of revisions to board policy Casey charter schools at the August 6th 2025 Board of Education meeting this discussion will be a first read of the charter school policy the policy chair I have provided
[00:18:00] the side by side comparison of the current board policy Casey charter schools and proposed revisions the document provided by the chair is to assist in the facilitation of a board discussion and decision-making by highlighting key changes including statutory Authority references Administration has updated statutory references and administration positions to the current policy I also want to provide some some background the proposed revisions in this draft are informed entirely by the public education commission's authorizer guidelines and the authorizer self-evaluation the P E C emphasizes at least to my reading a commitment
[00:19:00] particularly in serving at risk students along with a focus on student outcomes and Innovation at least two of those things are cited tonight equity for at-risk students is a central concern as not all APS authorized Charter Schools consistently demonstrate compliance with this commitment student now comes also warned close examination on the surface outcome data may appear unfavorable for some Charter Schools especially those serving higher numbers of students however under aps's current reporting model the authorizer which is us the board of education is not provided with key contextual information
[00:20:00] such as evidence of innovative instructional practices that may positively influence achievement but are not reflected in the traditional performance measures and so until APS in the authorizer the board have Clarity and mostly the board until we have Clarity regarding one and always the budgetary impact on at-risk students and their academic outcomes and two the role of instructional Innovation and its effect on all Charter students but particularly those identified as at risk the district should refrain from expanding Charter authorizations beyond beyond the existing portfolio the priority should
[00:21:00] play be to fulfill our current authorizing responsibilities with rigor transparency and Fidelity this is the intent of the policy revision at present the existing document functions more as a procedural outline then as a true policy the proposed revision establishes a coherent policy framework that references and aligns with the pecs published standards the New Mexico authorizers principal standards and the authorizers self-evaluation jointly developed by APS the police and charter schools in doing so this policy grounds our authorizing work in the standards commitments and Equity principles adopted in 2021 and reinforces our Collective accountability to them
[00:22:00] I felt the need to to frame the discussion with that background which was not captured in the report and so with that let's proceed to a discussion a fruitful one I hope I will open it up to board members I have a clarifying questions I just wanted to clarify that your goal is to not authorize any more Charter Schools but to focus on those schools that are already authorized by APS correct thank you and then my second clarification is
[00:23:00] the revisions that you submitted that I read first of all thank you for all that context that you gave us and making sure that you stated where the information came from are we are you planning to add the language to the current policy or a completely revised it to the new language well I mean that's the point of the discussion is to get more feedback and have the discussion and whatever helpful feedback I get and I did get some helpful feedback tonight to help clarify but like I said the current Casey policy is more of a it's really not high level language it's more procedural it in my view and so I was looking
[00:24:00] four a an umbrella statement about vision and Mission and not missions that that goes hand-in-hand with the contract so again and nothing says that we have to adopt anything on the second read or in this first read it's for me it's ultimately about getting it right and the PEC set some principles as guidelines we should we should honor them because APS the charter schools and the pecan came up with those guidelines and also portions of the self-evaluation I I found helpful so that's a long-winded way of saying you know this is about encouraging conversation
[00:25:00] add collaboration with helpful feedback thank you for that and I'm open to start sharing my feedback if other board members are okay with that so there's a couple of things that I wanted to know here just in my opinion I don't feel that it's wrong for us to have charter schools at least the organization process right show us that they are meeting that is our goal of the district what I'm concerned about is if the language is too broad and we just stay the goals in the future if the goals change and a charter school is not able to meet the goals or it's not accessible for them and the policy is not amended to the goals in that time frame that can hurt realization that can hurt the charter school without authorization
[00:26:00] I'm concerned about is if it's too broad and we just say the goals the second thing is when we're talking about charter schools and Student Success or student achievement this is going to be hard for me to to approve when Charter Schools don't always use the same measurements as APS so we have to come to an agreement of what is the standard looking like based on what measurement and the other part to that is what resources are we giving Charter Schools as the authorizer in order to fulfill that success so these are some questions that I think I need to to see where this is going to go from because I as is I don't think that I would approve or vote Yes on this without knowing that we're getting Charter Schools the support they need in order to prove to provide the measurements or success or however we want to call it
[00:27:00] that they're doing their job and yeah and you you stated it to remember Dominguez before is a lot of the charter schools serve our underserved students right so a lot of the students go to the Charter Schools already will look proficiency so if we're not providing those schools of resources the students are getting out of school adequate education and all of that stuff then I foresee a lot of problems happening and a lot of schools closing based on reauthorization of this model so those are some concerns obviously this is a discussion so I'm open to hearing how we figure this out but those are just some concerns I have by just reading what was written before I forget I'd like to clarify some things there that you pointed out so with regard and and Dr Blakey please you know correct me if I'm wrong
[00:28:00] but in terms of providing resources to Charters to have to impact Student Success my understanding is that Charters like APS are funded through enrollment and and so I don't know about unless you give me something specific in terms of the resources giving Charters resources that's that needs clarification of the resources that I could just easily think of is stopper Synergy if we're not on the same systems then we're not able to
[00:29:00] communicate or understand each other and I know there's a few charter schools in my district who are wanting to be on Synergy or the same systems as a PS because it makes it easier not only for discussions but also for reporting so that they don't have to translate their their their their their I can't think right now you know what I'm saying you yes that is correct that the charter schools are funded for pupil and the Synergy is actually being adopted by the state and so all schools and school districts will be using Synergy that will be funded by the state as the new student information system so that should help with that I think it's also just it's just important to note that the charter schools really do need to be autonomous
[00:30:00] so it's kind of difficult as far as the resource question because it should be specific to the resources needed for the autonomy of the school so it's you know really important that Charter Schools do not operate as traditional schools in the system and so they're not like under the performance framework where we would say they get a community school coordinator or a Student Success Advocate like the autonomy of a charter school we're just the author of the word is the authorizer not the manager of the school and so it's really important that those the resources is difficult because they are funded people and the resources really should be a site base decision from the charter school because they are autonomous thank you is that helpful or
[00:31:00] yeah that is helpful and it just makes me think a little bit more about this discussion so thank you so you know it just struck me that it would be helpful to me to go through the side by side that our policy analyst provided because then that way we can identify what what wording is problematic or needs more clarification so if we could please do that and we'll begin with that
[00:32:00] paragraph that says APS is committed to Equitable access to high-quality education for all students including those identified in Martinez yassi APS may require charter schools to demonstrate how Innovative rigorous high-quality instructional practices assessments and resource allocation Advanced board approved student outcome goals and District guard rails for the sake of reiterating clarifying our goals are about really basic skills right they are about reading proficiency math proficiency
[00:33:00] post secondary opportunities and SEL and while I appreciate what board member of store said that the goals may not apply in 5 years you know the Mississippi Miracle took 15 years to accomplish so I don't see our goals I mean they could change but I think these are the basics that all schools strive for even when I hear the presentation To Us by Charter Schools even before we had the goals in the guard rails so I would I would say that our goals are are pretty it's hard to
[00:34:00] argue with whether or not you're going to have people or students read do math and be prepared for post-secondary opportunities and and SEL perhaps if you can point to guardrail that is not already covered by Charter Schools maybe I'm thinking maybe although I think all charter schools have a commitment to that do any guardrails stand out to you as being overly restrictive not at the moment no
[00:35:00] board member Jackson so my concern about the language that you just read is that this is terminology that should be placed into a contractual relationship it's part of the negotiation it is not something that should be placed in board policy so I think this is the a lot of the language that has been inserted into this policy is language that needs to be discussed between the two parties and not as an override of board policy or as an override with board policy board member benavidez
[00:36:00] thank you to Dominguez I was wondering if you remember Jackson would go into a little more detail about how this should this is more of a contractual conversation I'm genuinely curious yeah I mean I've I'm ready so Charters what I'm concerned about is that this new language tries to mandate requirements that aren't high level governance expectations I believe a lot of this language is operational it's language that needs to be in the contract and in some cases is duplicative of what is already being handled by our charter school office I'm concerned that we're trying to use board policy and turn it into a procedural operations manual instead of keeping the
[00:37:00] word policy at a high level for example of some of the things that were mentioned in public comment is that the current Charter contracts and like the annual review procedures those already requires site visits fiscal and academic reporting and compliance checks and all of those are clearly defined in state law I'm concerned that we are codifying operational details that don't clarify our governance specifically you asked about the contract language I believe that this language attempts to compel actions and mandate criteria that belongs to those contracts that require an arms Lake arms length relationship we as a board
[00:38:00] not allowed to unilaterally change the terms or pile on new compliance requirements through policy after the facts and I think that's what we're doing that we're trying to create a policy after the fact after contracts have already been made between charter schools and now we're trying to Overlay policy on top of that I believe that by doing that we are unlawfully interfering in the independence of the school operations thank you and have we had an analysis of the proposed language and what is duplicative is anybody aware no to my knowledge it hasn't gone through legal review
[00:39:00] play frankly I don't know at what point maybe Dr Blakey can clarify that for us at what point does a policy go to Legal review I Believe Miss Martinez is on sorry the first read and prior to the 30-day posting and I and I actually can kind of address your question about the duplication of procedure is that what you were asking about yes thank you yeah of course that is proposed is duplicative of the procedure that the district
[00:40:00] leadership would you please Point those out I mean I found I found one maybe two but and I hate to pass the ball but I know doctor asked about is on as well so I'm going to ask him to help me out as I take this through the through the read so if we go to let's start with the governance alignment and collaboration and please talk to ask about please feel free to jump in if I if I am reporting this incorrectly because I'm not the charter expert I will admit that right now I believe that the language that's included with the next three paragraph So starts with
[00:41:00] cabinets alignment collaboration the mission of all and the values set forth May encroach on the Charter's right to individual governance and instructional planning let me jump over to okay the charter moving over to the Charter teams must provide evidence I'm sorry the charters have to provide evidence of Equitable access in their annual reviews Drisco are those details included yes so the charter school must provide evidence and
[00:42:00] and I think you know just for the board to know are our schools are very aware of our goals we give them very you know updates as we get them so we have adjusted all of our work to meet the goals of the districts you know this work some of the bullet points we actually do is just like to bring your attention to the
[00:43:00] before the bullet points I think we're overlooking a very important and critical piece of the the new language under governance alignment and collaboration the new language says APS requires a charter governance teams that is the governance councils CEOs principles meet with the aps governance team the Board of Education and superintendent on a quarterly and or regular basis and these meetings would ensure that they would ensure everything you you lay down but specifically in the second language I have referenced in the bullets
[00:44:00] are include the New Mexico Charter School authorizing statement of purpose and the values set forth in the New Mexico values for Quality Charter School authorizing so I'm referencing documents that you all came up with in 2021 in the name of ensuring a more thorough understanding for the board again this is so that we can feel good about providing the authorization right now contracts appear before us once a year and that's that's not that's not a thorough
[00:45:00] standing and so that's my point here is how do we get this done in a in a methodical way whereby weak as an authorizer can feel we are doing right by our fiscal and administrative Authority or I don't know if administrative is the right word but authorizer Authority once a year is not is not a often enough 10 schools all at once and does not provide the board the aps board with an opportunity to be thorough and to ask questions and in particular where I'm concerned is
[00:46:00] at-risk students how you know right now what what comes before us are PSAT scores how is that Innovative it's not but I do know based on chance meetings with directors of charter schools that they do so much more but we never see that we never see the innovation in the presentation and so what I'm hoping is that again in that very first paragraph under governance alignment and collaboration that and I've said this for 2 years now I would love to have the office of innovation
[00:47:00] provide a face-to-face meeting with governance councils so that we have boards talking to boards it seems to me that that's the proper that's the proper level of communication to to begin collaborative efforts to come up with this and I didn't just create this I went back to the law I went back to the website on Charter School authorization and you all came up with the principles 3:20 and the PEC
[00:48:00] I took that document and came up with this so I was trying really hard not to overstep so which is why I'm asking for specifics here specific passages but before you get into those bullet points where I Do by the way reference p e c documents I want to point out that quarterly and or regular basis meetings are critical for APS for the aps governance team to fully understand each particular Charter that comes before us
[00:49:00] board members or committee members Madam chair and superintendent so I can show you on the screen or I can help but we did meet today and I was so I want to just save her heroin and what we do and we're not different I think it's disgusting from your policy lenses
[00:50:00] for example one of the things that we would recommend is that you are directing the superintendent and thus directing our team to do these governance to governance meetings as an example so one of the things and we can kind of share with you some of the that written information and Miss partition on my screen I'm ready to go would you like me to sure so I recommended model of who is the author so for example we're stating in here the aps Board of Education as charter school authorizer which you are designated and statute
[00:51:00] used in Charter School authorizing so that's an example of what would happen so you notice the the details of what you're wanting in the governance to governance meetings now becomes a requirement later in the policy as one of the things that you're requiring us to do quarterly and so the accountability of this I think falls into your governance when did when as you know I left town on I printed everything I could on Wednesday so when did this documentary
[00:52:00] artwork of our team to bring for discussion this is just discussion that will bring it forward it lied to aligning again not money changes to your policy proposal but aligning it to the governance model to make sure that we're getting to the same point of what your request is that is fine with the government's model of the board and taking into account I just needed to know when I thought I was supposed to have this already but but you're telling me is to make sure that the board doesn't get in the Weeds on the day-to-day you know nuts and bolts Management on the charter schools but instead uses their governance authority to say the Lord's going to tell the superintendent the superintendent
[00:53:00] to do the things that you were asking to be done okay so I'm not I can't I'm not seen a little bit sheriff in this section that I've just highlighted originally read APS may require charter schools to demonstrate how Innovative rigorous high quality instruction programs etc etc we propose or recommend for it to say the aps Board of Education as the charter school authorizer directs the superintendent Charter charter school team as agents of the board to require that Charter Schools demonstrate how Innovative right to come to the same end but articulated I see and that is also repeated
[00:54:00] down on the following bullet points the charter let me see Charter Schools must provide is now the charter school team must provide evidence so any of the data or information that you're asking for will instead come not directly from the charters to the board but through the charter school team to the board that can even include a review of how well our Charters meet the goals and the guard rails which is not something that we can directly impose or direct Charters to do but instead you could ask the charter school team to say okay how close are the charters to what we expect as a board via the goals in the guard rails correct which we I mean you guys already do that right I mean you provide us with SAT scores you provide us with
[00:55:00] what science math scores am I think what we're learning from these conversations is that you're asking for more of the data that we have that is not contractual so for example you know what are those Innovative approaches identify one or two of those things and having that as a discussion quarterly so we can tear apart some of the details maybe offline if you want or or here but the point is is that we're trying to respond to your request and just knowing that a lot of the data as we discussed a couple weeks ago when we looked at data it's a lot of the new ones and how do we unload our knowledge and our information that we do you know that's what we do but I did with you know our schools today
[00:56:00] we probably met West 20th of the 30 L just in various formats so knowing what their challenges are and their goals you know can help us and and knowing what you're wanting is information we can repackage some of that information in a quarterly way and learn from that I think and could be actually very Innovative conversation around it so I want to go back to your comment about that you are not contractual or innovation is not contractual is that correct I mean I thought I thought the contract was based on the mission of the school and that the mission necessarily has to be
[00:57:00] Innovation so we can talk about the details so the example that you're giving is that all schools are being held accountable for standards based assessments right which is the SAT data you're asking for additional assessments that show the progress of the school we are innovatively working with many of our schools to calculate those things in different ways we are looking at Short cycling and are priority status we're looking at those details of what they're doing almost under basis and so we can give you more of that information that is not contractually with their obligated to be held accountable for because it is they standards assessment
[00:58:00] as an example one school last year had multiple indicators for their reading assessment performance as an example I guess I'm I'm I'm getting stuck on the contract the mission which is what I heard earlier was what we should focus on am I correct I mean the contract on the mission are unique to each I know that so I just learned that there is a standard contract however the PC website talks about the importance of innovation so where where does the aps
[00:59:00] I'm attract account for Innovation and if if children are leaving APS traditional schools looking for non-traditional approaches then then shouldn't we be looking at those as well I mean somebody at the last month's meeting said something about and I agree that that Charters were designed to be a lab for Innovation to to share ideas innovative ideas and assessments with traditional schools so I'm just trying to get at that at that Nexus because that's what makes charters
[01:00:00] unique the uniqueness you can see in each of them being required to have two mission-specific goals so when you get the renewal schools those missions specific goal should be unique to that what you're asking is an Innovative practices with measurable data and impact and I think that's the place that we can really grow to and so what they're doing and Reporting out I think it's a very Innovative governance conversation as an example 20 years ago the Gates Foundation gave a lot of money to Chicago public schools to have this very conversation it didn't take hold because he was always learning from that
[01:01:00] you know it was a requirement that the charter schools had to share their best practices and they were they created all these conferences and it just didn't take hold I think we have a space to be able to do something maybe differently with what you're talking about previously and I am right here in the document previously
[01:02:00] why are annual performance reports tied to board goals we could modify that language to say the charter school team will provide annual performance reports and the charter team can also coordinate governance to governance convenience on the boards behalf on the next block down previously read APS will ensure transparency by conducting site visits and so on we can modify that to say the charter school team will ensure transparency by meeting the police as their previously written and that's the extent of the staff recommendation chair is just to say you know bringing bringing these proposals within the governance framework board superintendent to the Charter team I guess I'm confused by that because
[01:03:00] the concern is how how do we know how can we work it so that the aps board feels like it has enough information not once a year all at once but I am hearing quarterly meetings would be possible is that under under these revisions is that correct that's correct sure okay I just want to be cognizant of people's time to do this so I don't know if the intent is to be individually
[01:04:00] to do that to Liaison that work with the charters and he can give us you know essentially a report that shows this is what he's done in the work with the charters but certainly not assume that it means that the board in the superintendent would do site visits on all 30 schools quarterly which would be I don't see anything do that so I think it is delegating to staff to complete these visits and then report to the board how the progress in the visits to the charters are going so where yes I don't I don't nobody has time to go to site visits I mean board members don't have that kind of time nor I'm looking for more of a systems right
[01:05:00] where there's a presentation to all board to the entire board yes board member Astoria thank you committee chair I I just keep going back to the comment that board member Jackson made about a lot of the language here being procedural instead of policy and I am looking at the information that was given to me by the charter school team including the principles and standards so you can't see my mother the principals in standards for Quality Charter School authorizing paperwork and it says here on number four on going over and evaluation pretty much everything that you are asking for it also says a quality authorizer conducts contract oversight that that competently evaluates
[01:06:00] compliance Insurance legally entitled autonomy protects against rights and forms intervention and many more things that include what you're saying also the site visits communicates regularly with schools as needed including both the school leaders and governing boards and provides timely notice of contract violations or performance deficiencies so this language is here which I believe I would also like to have more information on Charter Schools just not the annual you know more quarterly would be great but looking at this I'm wondering if you know it is policy wording and it's it's more procedural right yes and I think what happened is I tried to melt there was an original document it was very simple I'm looking for it it was
[01:07:00] it was maybe four simple paragraphs that was all policy but I was trying to marry the policy and then the procedural wording that is so called policy right now and an inevitably what happens is yes procedures however I will say that I think it's important to keep quarterly that's a procedure but I think it's important to keep that language in there I understand the other the cascading the Cascade to Administration
[01:08:00] implementation I have one more question if I may yes so I'm also reviewed this charter school work study packet that was given to the board I don't know if that's just a little remembers giving us this but there is actually a recommendation from the team for the board to update our procedural directive I'm not sure if this was ever done if you can you know let me know but it says that they would like for the board to update our procedural directions to say that the charter school official make it recommendation regarding the renewal application of the charter school to the Board of Education during the first applicable applicable board meeting in November of each year right now it currently says 90 days which would give us more time for review on assuming so unfortunately
[01:09:00] so unfortunately it was to make sure that we were in compliance because a couple of years ago several board members raised concern kind of this kind of conversation about the lack of performance of a couple of our charter schools and they wanted more time to have discussions on the shorter term or more requirements for the school so what we did in line with legal counsel is to move up period so that we don't get out of compliance with State Statute because the deadline for turning in the renewal is October 1st and by January 1st we have to have the process complete with your approval or denial
[01:10:00] so that doesn't give us a lot of wiggle room when there's concerned so that's what we were trying to do and that was taken care of in the previous procedural directive and in actuality of how where how we're executing that so that has been taken care of thank you and just quickly with my last comment right now would we be able to or Dominguez would it be beneficial for us to potentially look at that procedural directive language to give us more time as you're asking like those quarterly check-ins or do you want to keep do you think this is the spot for it that you want to keep it in I mean the current policies so lengthy and it's it's all procedures I'm just trying to yell I mean we can revisit the procedural
[01:11:00] practice but I guess I'm I'd rather not be I'd rather hear from Dr Escobedo how they they refine that what gets removed what gets kept and why the rationale as long as again what's the policy that we create and what's the critical procedure for me it's the quarterly check-ins but beyond the quarterly I think you know I'm looking at the New Mexico values for Quality Charter School authorizing document right now the equity is number one Insurance have Equitable access to Quality schools portfolios to reflect the demographic makeup of the entire
[01:12:00] District Equitable resources and opportunities but then the second one is celebrating success and authorizes in New Mexico raise awareness of schools that achieve academic growth by sharing best practices between schools and authorizers I'm more concerned about I want to see Innovative what Innovative practices how are we getting how are we measuring what kids know at a particular school I mean we're all going to have 10 right 10 is there a way to include I mean the SAT scores are
[01:13:00] don't tell us much but I think having an opportunity to hear about how schools measure what students know and how they're measuring their success is critical for us does that make sense and board member Jackson thank you so just a couple of comments and then a question as it stands this this Charter School revision that were looking at
[01:14:00] including the proposed revisions from Dr Escovedo and Miss Martinez I think are still reading as a procedural directive instead of a policy and so I I hear what you're saying about the quarterly you know kind of quarterly check-ins and wanting to have maybe a little bit more information instead of the end of the year you know big shebang but I think what I'm hearing is that is something that Doctor Escobedo is already doing it just may be isn't codified within the procedure and so I think probably in order to fall in line with our governance structure and specifically as it relates to your request for kind of more regular updates that we continue to work through the
[01:15:00] process that we have or maybe Dr Escobedo and in conjunction with Dr Blakey update the procedural directive because remember we don't update procedural directives that's that's the superintendent's responsibility we only do policy and so I I I I I I I think what I'm understanding from all of this conversation is that doctor Escobedo and his team are doing a lot of the things that are requested through these revisions we just maybe aren't getting as many updates as we collectively as a board feel comfortable with and so and if I'm correct in that please please correct me but a suggestion I would maybe have is procedural directive needs to be updated we asked Dr Blakey to update us more frequently and that kind of addresses those
[01:16:00] concerns one thing that I'm just quickly confused about and hopefully somebody can answer this I'm looking at the Casey Charter Schools policy on the website and it is not the same as the what says the current Casey policy in this document so I'm wondering if see how that language I don't see the language that says Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Education I don't see any of that language that's on the left so
[01:17:00] it could be that the language on the left that it has been updated since and that just hasn't been updated online I think that might be a question for me remember Jackson but this is the document that chair Dominguez shared with us okay so then it's pretty it's easy to would you like me to bring this document down and share the posted language what is the correct policy is the correct policy the one that's online or is the correct policy language the one that's in the document the current policy is what's posted to the site now OK Google in the table on the left side it says Albuquerque Public Schools Board of Ed
[01:18:00] supports legislation that strengthens and funds approaches to governance that keep Student Success at the center of decision-making in New Mexico and on the website it says in the first paragraph the Board of Education May approve the establishment of a charter school within the Albuquerque Public Schools district Albuquerque Public Schools will renew applications for locally authorized charter schools and the Board of Education reserve the right to deny an application for a charter school the board of reserves the right to suspend or revoke the charter of a locally authorized charter school and there's one more sentence after that and another short paragraph right so to meet that does not read like a high level I don't see a vision or a vision or statement of
[01:19:00] I I think I I came up with I looked for a policy that this line I didn't create this language it appeared somewhere on the website and we know how how inefficient our websites can be they pull up old language but regardless I'm going to go back to the intent none of that reads as a policy our current language does not read as a policy so I think when we talked about Equity when we talked about Innovation accountability and transparency those sorts of words those sorts of
[01:20:00] communicate a value a vision for how we are going to behave as authorizers and those are the very words that the PEC website latches onto yes I understand I'm confused like if where the where the language that says current Casey policy came from like are we because it seems like now we're not actually comparing proposed language against what the current policy is because the current policy in this document is not not accurate so I just wondering like where do you know
[01:21:00] what is current language Casey charter school policy but if I go back and do let's see again website to navigate from the procedural directive then maybe inadvertently what you're actually
[01:22:00] I'm asking for is that the procedural directive is updated with that language but that the policy language remains because while it's not well it's not sexy it's still compliant it's still really relevant I don't think it's a what I'm suggesting is it's even that language is not a statement of vision and like what is the strategy that we that 8 p.m. cease Charter Schools as serving what Vision are they are they serving and I think a big piece of it is equity in line with what the PEC
[01:23:00] expects of us and so I'm going to go back to the importance of stating the purpose of charter schools for Albuquerque Public Schools and for the board as authorizers the current wording is I will argue that even what his been shared with us tonight it's not a policy and so this continues to be the challenge before us
[01:24:00] and what I'm also seeing is that doctor Escobedo and his team has worked through some suggestions I want to acknowledge the work that was done on the work that you did creating this revised policy which I feel now was taking more from the procedural directive after actually reviewing with the policy is which is very Broad and high level and I also want to acknowledge the work that Miss Martinez restaurant which I think are helpful but overall I think the
[01:25:00] proposed revised policy and the revisions to the revised policy are overly prescribed and if we all recall at our last policy meeting we were supposed to provide a strategy to guide the Board of Education in approving Charter Schools moving forward and just provide a strategy and to me that's not necessarily changing the policy it's providing guidelines for the board which is going to change on January 1st based on what happens during the election is going to provide a guideline for the board then you make up the board in moving forward approving Charter Schools evaluating Charter Schools whatever the case may be and I think that that's something that's worth a conversation and more work but it goes hand-in-hand with the personal responsibility of board members to do research and ask the right questions during the process and I think that that can get better with a strategy ends a guideline for board members
[01:26:00] during the process but I think it would be helpful to provide that and I don't know that what we're talking about right now is going to be fruitful because what was provided is more the procedural directive and I also want to acknowledge that we are elected by community members who feel very strongly about this issue and I think that we need to tread very cautiously based on all of the information we received in all of the input which is been a lot and I'm grateful for that and so if we could just kind of go back to what our directive was at the last policy meeting and I reached out to every single person who sent me an email and kind of gave a breakdown of what
[01:27:00] changing a policy looks like how long it's supposed to take first three second read etcetera and I also explained that we were given a directive to create a strategy to guide the board and approving and so I don't want to mislead the community and what our work is here tonight and so if anybody you know has any input regarding creating a strategy and maybe how we can move forward to do that I think that would be a more fruitful conversation as opposed to actually voting on proposed revisions to something that what doesn't even really include language from the policy it's more the procedural directive I'm sorry that's a very long-winded way of saying what I said but that's my input thank you that's that's great because that gives us all of us homework about some you know I'd love for all of you to submit your ideas on a strategy for moving forward and
[01:28:00] remember Jackson I will a board member Benavides brings up a good point and I was going to ask her so board member Astoria and I were the we were kind of tasked with creating the onboarding procedure for new board members and I'm wondering if you think it would be helpful if we made the maybe the charter school discussion a little bit more robust within that I know that's in the ad hoc committee but a little bit more robust in that onboarding section kind of giving like the fact that there are some there's confusion about how this moves forward I think that would be a fantastic idea and I hope that board member store we both came out at the same time and so you know we have kind of obviously the same time line and experience
[01:29:00] I hope that you would agree with me but I think that making that more robust and giving more information would be always getting more information is going to be helpful you know we need more information than less to do this job okay so we will add that to I would like to weigh in on that I would like to see each of us Supply come up with what you think the strategy should be regarding charter schools and only after we have each provided some have weighed in then I mean I'm boarding assumes that we have something in place we don't have anything in place and
[01:30:00] so I I really hesitate to to give two people rather than a committee of thought partners that responsibility I think it falls to all of us to come up with you know go out and talk to your Community Partners and and come up with the strategy or guidelines that should govern our authorization I want this to be more than a rubber stamping because I was not it was not offering up board members Oregon I was merely suggesting that we create space within the onboarding process
[01:31:00] has more robust discussion about Charter authorization correct but I think we all need to provide your ad hoc your onboarding ad hoc committee with with the guidelines so board member benavidez well I think we have a perfect opportunity to do that I know it's kind of crunch time and and we're getting down to the wire but I think I appreciate board member Jackson's offering to put that or include that in a more robust way in onboarding which is absolutely necessary but I also think we have a fantastic opportunity to provide our ideas for a strategy so that we don't find ourselves feeling like we're roasting something what I'm going to go back to my point that I said I may be at the last meeting of the meeting before we should not feel like we're representing things and if we ever do it's our responsibility is board members to
[01:32:00] what what what what what do Charter Schools what do they serve in our district and I think they do serve a roll
[01:33:00] but the finding it and giving it and making sure that we're articulating what the PEC is telling us what that there was a meeting in 2021 and there was an agreement there were agreements how do we translate those agreements into strategy is what is before us so okay I think we're in agreement let me go back to this text so that was the first one more defining this better and I agree I think I tried to marry procedures and it didn't work
[01:34:00] so we're now going to hear a status update from the policy analyst and that is item 5.2 thank you madam chair board members and Dr Blakey we within the policy committee you currently have three different discussions and play as we head into the end of the calendar year you've got coming up three different policies one for a discussion on tribal consultation the charter school policy that occurred this evening and the capital fiscal master plan policy language that still under development so I wanted to just give you a quick quick quick rundown of where every policy is currently and what its next step is and when you should expect to see it in this committee next so I will start with the k
[01:35:00] play we just read through policy Casey in committee and the next steps are for the policy committee to explore further strategies for the board of the boards Charter School approval process and to begin to think about how to fortify and bolster the onboarding discussions and I have I captured that accurately is that where we'd like to take the next step for Casey I think so okay great so then the next steps share we hadn't we have considered that we would take this step when you and I spoke last so this is going to be further work for the committee and how would you like for them to proceed because when we have more specific language we can bring it back to the committee for a second read not well it's not a second read its technology
[01:36:00] you know drafting getting clarity about again the our charge was to come up with a strategy so then that would Place The Next Step as new language in the first read in this committee and so that generally means that you need draft Language by a certain date so take take notes everyone so policy analyst what is going to be our deadline to get you the the deadline date and share that with each of you individually I apologize that I don't know the answer to
[01:37:00] that's a that's a Jennifer Newman situation I will move on to IH 9 the tribal consultation policy that policy language the proposed language is currently under legal review by Walsh Gallegos once the legal review is complete revisions can be posted to the website for 30 days so that we can gather public feedback that will place the next committee read on either 11:30 or 12:30 contingent upon the date of completion of the legal review and the subsequent public posting the last item is the I'm calling it the capital policy because we don't have a formal length for it but the capital policy language is currently under development I know the chairs been working on that so that will place the next steps for a first read projected on 113 from there it'll follow the normal process of legal review and
[01:38:00] what's the legal review is complete revisions will be posted for 30 days so that we can gather public feedback that will place the next committee read either in January or February of 2026 I'm thinking more February because you're early meetings in January are new business for the newly elected members and I so I don't know if they'll be a policy committee meeting on that in January and that's everything I have do you all have any questions for me it seems board member Jackson does yes ma'am sorry I was trying to lower my hand but not turn my audio on and I just have a quick question about the the tribal consultation policy I know that there was a tribal consultation today and I'm just curious if there was any feedback how it went if the
[01:39:00] on the policy was discussed just curious as to feedback I'm actually not familiar with that I think Dr blakey's got her Mike ready to go yes sure Dominguez and board member Jackson I was not in the board session president Gonzalez was the only board member that was there so she did do the tribal consultation with them and I believe she will give information on what they discussed during that in the Atlanta and during that time when I met with him they did Express that they were upset that the board members were not in attendance but we didn't and they were a little concerned about the policy so we did get that feedback from Administration
[01:40:00] that's what they told you know what that's the feedback they gave to me but as far as the board tribal consultation session I wasn't in that session present Gonzalez was and I believe she'll send something out to everybody with what was discussed so can I sorry man I follow up so Miss Martinez can you say again you said that it was the tribal consultation was currently being reviewed is that what and when was it supposed to come again well whenever the legal review is complete they'll notify us that they're finished at that point that the legal review is cleared will be able to post it for 30 days for public comment so we don't I don't know the date because it depends on its it's contingent upon whenever the legal review is complete
[01:41:00] okay and do we did we have a procedure for when we were going to present it to the tribes there's no procedure for that yet okay okay okay okay I'm glad that I can explain the background to all of you when I was first told that that aps's aps's legal counsel would look at
[01:42:00] the tribal consultation policy that has been worked up to date I had some concerns because no one that we have contracted with really has the the legal expertise in Tribal Law that would make my standard and so I reached out to Preston Sanchez who is the lead lawyer on Yazi and asked for for a legal expert on tribal consultation and he immediately gave me Casey Duma as a as the person to go to the the legal scholar on this topic
[01:43:00] and it was particularly heartening because Casey was a student at Highland High School and he has a very interesting story about what inspired him to go into law Tribal Law in particular at any rate he did look at the language and this is what he told me you are correct that the first step before you invite the tribes in is all of you have to make a the board of education's across the state and this is what our assistance Secretary of Indian education
[01:44:00] in July the first step is getting boards to recognize that there is a law that demands that we have Tribal consultation that is the first step the second step is engaging the tribes tribal leaders in the case of Las Cruces and Albuquerque to get Urban indigenous leaders along with tribal leaders to some degree parent committee the Indian parent committee engaged in laying out the procedures for how that was going to happen so even though we call it tribal consultation at the moment it really isn't a true tribal consultation that we're doing
[01:45:00] best we've got going right now but I want to be clear that the first step according to Casey Duma who is a Tribal Law expert is developing the policy the high level policy language that says this is the law and we are committing ourselves to it and then preferably a statement of values so that's I don't think that any of that was communicated today and I want I made the statement at the last the premiering with the policy analyst and executive director Manzano that if we presented
[01:46:00] the fact that there was a nebulous draft of a policy out there on tribal consultation we would Inspire distrust and what was reported back to me was exactly that however this is new and so explaining to try that this is the first step I would have preferred to have a legal expert in the law and preferably a Native American present that information to the the tribes today tribal leaders for the very reasons that the trustful this is something new and even though he has already tried to explain it there are
[01:47:00] 4 L that articulated a very strong understanding of what the legal ramifications are so it doesn't surprise me that some leaders were upset and so any other questions or comments if not I'm I think I just gave my chair report and I'm going to move on to item number 7 unless policy analyst Martinez I don't have I don't think I'm supposed to report anything else out I don't remember
[01:48:00] let me check our agenda real quick Madam chair I think the only thing left is the report on the upcoming November 3rd policy committee meeting right so I'm just going to announce that the next week that we talked about legal advice that was not legal advice that we had officially gone for regarding that policy so I just want to be sure that the committee knows that that is advice from somebody use spoke to off record but not actual legal advice that the district received on behalf of the board and I do yes thank you for pointing that out so I just want to recap
[01:49:00] that when I did voice concern about yes our our own legal counsel not having the background and so I reached out to somebody who I wanted to ensure that I that I is policy chair had some reassurances that that I was on the right track that this policy was on the right track that was pro bono that was in it for yes just for clarification we do use attorneys that we have currently under our procurement of the RFP okay so and so and so with that I'm going to announce that the next policy committee meeting is
[01:50:00] Monday November 3rd 2025 at 5:15 virtually you can watch on the aps Board of Education YouTube channel and with that I hope you have a lovely rest of your evening good night thank you
