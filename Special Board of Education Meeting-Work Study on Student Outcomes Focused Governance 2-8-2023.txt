and so here we are on to our special issues and in a work-study session on student outcomes focused governance this is going to be a discussion we have Ashley pause with the Council of great City schools here in person with us thank you so much for for joining us and she's going to lead us through the work study today and our session on where we are and the things that we need to do next so Ashley go ahead and take the floor hi so happy to see all of you Danielle the first time that we've actually been

[00:02:00]
what you all have courageously adopted and you've been implementing for the past several months this work is based on a body of research that suggests that boards that focus on student outcomes are boards that actually move the needle for student outcomes you have taken the commitment to change your behavior to become more aligned with that research to change your behavior so that they are creating the conditions that are most focused on student accounts for that you should be applauded thank you so much for taking for going on this journey and letting me be a part of it so tonight or today we're going to see how you've done so far we're going to look at the first three months of implementation that you're bored has undergone this will be October November and December I was going to be really hard to not look at what's happened over the last

[00:03:00]
but these are just looking at the months of October November and December but this will going through this exercise will give you the tools that you need will teach you how to do this moving forward so that you can you don't have to have me here every single time that you do this before we get started you have any questions about the process or what what we're going to do tonight so we're going in your package you have several pages that look like this these are the students focused governance rubric we're going to get through this very first part really quick and then we're going to go through the entire document line by line or I should say paragraph by paragraph it's not it may seem like it's a really

[00:04:00]
it shouldn't be but I want you to be able to ask me questions about some of the behaviors that that are identified on this document some of the steps that are coming along the way and we're going to use this conversation from tonight to identify what the next steps are for your board what the priorities are for the next things that you do and how long we want to pay those out so the very first thing that we're going to do is we're going to grade yourself this will be really fast because the very first question on every page is actually let me let me explain to this first so on this page you have four columns they're red yellow green and blue these are aligned with what research says are the

[00:05:00]
behaviors that are most synonymous with school districts and school boards that move the needle for kids that are actually improving student outcomes the blue line or the blue column is where these are the the highest correlation of these are these are the things that most of the boards that are doing are really focused on student outcomes they're really moving the needle for their kids moving over in each column you have a different set so in order to get at the top of each column there's a there's a number if you meet all of the things and the yellow column then you get to give yourself the score at the top of the list same with the blue or same with the blue if you answer yes if you answer

[00:06:00]
yes any of the questions in the red then the score is 0 so in December remember that's between October and December the first question is has the board adopted goals or it should actually be is this true so the statement is the board has not adopted goals that's the same question on each one the answer is going to be no because you'll still in the process of creating them so for October through December you're going to have a 0 I want to just get this out really out of the way really quick because that's not the truth anymore so know that in December it was never the plan for y'all to have fully implemented goals and guard rails you know that this was going to take a little bit longer than the first quarter so your score for the first evaluation

[00:07:00]
I've never met a board that actually adopts all of their goals all of their guard rails has their interim goals interim guard rails and does any of the things that are assigned on here within the first three months do you have any questions about that piece so far so I mean I just have a question so you have to say yes to everything so where is zero for October to December so I'm looking and going well the first part looks like we are definitely not there but then when I read the second part we can't answer yes to all of those why can't we give ourselves like you know 6 out of 10 know I just think that seems fair that you would be able to that you you shouldn't get maybe all 10 but you should at least get some so I just would like to know why you can't get some of the place so that's actually

[00:08:00]
great question because it's these Collective actions are are required these are the collective actions of a board so if you're not doing one of these things then you're still pretty far off so for example on this first page so the under the on the red and the First Column and this is the vision and go so this page is very specific to to your goals to the board representing the vision of the community so you've sought to understand the vision of the community and then you've adopted goals that are aligned with the vision of the community there are a couple of things that are very specific to those behaviors the board has to should have adopted goals the goals have to be smart the board has to have adopted in collaboration with the superintendent so if the superintendent wasn't involved then

[00:09:00]
grounded in the reality for students in the district if the the board has adopted no fewer than one and no more than five goals if you have a whole bunch of goals if you have more than five goals then you have you're looking at way too many things remember our first our first time together we use the analogy of a tank of gas or a gallon of gas and so if you're putting a gallon of gas in one one pickup truck you're going to get whatever that mile per gallon if you're Distributing that gallon of gas among five pickup trucks then it's going to only get you as far as those five pickup trucks will take you that far if you're starting to expand beyond that you're going to be lucky if you're pick up truck

[00:10:00]
so that's so that's why you need to have fewer than five you need to the fewer goals the more focus and this is also a line with research research says that goals that have or boards that have and it's actually not even specific to school boards it's any kind of organization having more than five goals you are so if you have one goal your most likely to meet one goal if you have three goals you're going to meet somewhere between one and three goals or you're going to your most likely to meet three goals if you have five goals your most likely to meet one if you have more than five you're unlikely to meet me so that's that's the whole that's the whole reasoning is that all of these things have to happen in combination to so that you start to approach focus of being

[00:11:00]
there's a page that has additional reading all of those links and you should have a digital copy as well so that those links are lie but that is all of the research this is based on OK Google December knowing that we were still we were not there yet that's okay I think it the first time we heard it as a group you know we're nowhere near it was painful because we thought we were maybe better than some of those things but I think now just knowing the structure of what where we are all being gold Direct

[00:12:00]
an indictment against the board or the work that we're doing it's just the reality of of where we are in this particular framework very much true and remember this is a continuous Improvement framework you're not supposed to be perfect right off the bat this is it takes time your goals are five years because it's going to take five years to implement them it's going to take five years to see really true tangible results to get where you want to be so this is not a quick process it's not going to happen overnight but you all are moving at a at a speed that is very healthy and the goals that you've adopted have the most part very healthy as well and so I think that there is a likelihood that you will be much farther along the next time we have this conversation

[00:13:00]
our meeting doesn't end with that we're going to start with me a little bit longer so first we identify where we at where is zero that's fine where can we be that's the next question where can we be by the end of this quarter this quarter will be January February and March so we're through the first month we've got the quarter about a third of the way done so by the end of this quarter where do you think you can be now this this document total it adds up to 100 points your agreement with the council is that you that you will get to 80 points over the course of our time together so you're not expected to be at 100 you're not expected to be 80 but you may you may want to choose to be a little bit farther along by the time we have this conversation

[00:14:00]
no no no no no no no no no no no idea by May 2024 and I want to hear from you what is your priority to do next where do you think you can be by the end of the next quarter where would you like to be the quarter after that where would you like to be the quarter after that and the first the way that we have that conversation the way that you identify those things is by interrogating what what the behaviors are that are in these documents so let's if it's okay with you if you have no further questions which you are allowed to have though we'll start looking at this page by Page

[00:15:00]
I have a question go ahead Josefina so we're did you just take us to the first quarter yes ma'am and we were going through October November and December so this quarter was just a zero because we still had completed any of these items so communication and collaboration did not have goals all the communication collaboration and gold is that correct so every on every single page unity and Trust communication and collaboration monitoring an accountability vision and values and guardrails and vision and goals the very first the very first state

[00:16:00]
that's on in the red column for all of those is the board has not adopted goals so if you answer yes to any of the items that are in the red column then you do not get to move on to the next column you get you get assigned a 0 so we're at zero on all the pages okay so that's what I'm asking is if we wait in on a 04 Vision in Gold's values and guardrails then that automatically is an empty set for the rest of the categories yes and it's not because it's not because it's the statement on just those two that's the first statement on every single on under every single category okay that's fine

[00:17:00]
so ready to move on to the second quarter or the next item okay so let's talk about what is to come so under on the red column under vision and goals the first statement the board has not adopted goals y'all have adopted goals so that is no longer true for you in the second quarter the next statement the board has not consistently demonstrated the ability to distinguish between inputs outputs and outcomes what do you think oh and by the way I'm only going to tell you the answer for the first question between inputs and outputs and outcomes and I guess for me is just consistently

[00:18:00]
play demonstrated the ability to me it means that I'm thinking about the student outcomes Focus governance training is that our peace or are laying or our governance piece really lies in that outputs and outcomes peace the outcomes the outcomes not even the outputs okay so I think we tend to still want to be in the room in the lane of saying what inputs and what outputs we want I think we're still there do you think like when it says demonstrated the ability to distinguish between we know what an input and output is called Barbara I was just thinking you know it seems like you really in the realm of the super

[00:19:00]
those that are very closely linked to what the interim goals are and so it seems to me like until we give the superintendent the opportunity to develop those we might we might be clear about them that I'm not sure we're really clear about them is that is that a true statement I think I think that is true so there's a difference between demonstrating the knowledge and letting go of the reins I have I believe that each of you have demonstrated the knowledge of the difference between inputs outputs and outcomes there may be a little bit of confusion every now and then but that's normal I still even get mixed up every now and then so the key thing is that you've all demonstrated the pretty clear understanding I think we've demonstrated that we know we have

[00:20:00]
but how it plays out I think in just our governance is still not quite there that's what I feel that's that's how I feel that's how I was reading it like we know it we have the knowledge now what is what to say we put into play absolutely not but we do we know it and that's how I was reading and defining that statement yeah okay I think that's accurate okay if that's the way the definition is is a to Simply to know that I would say yes not hosted opportunities to listen to the vision of the community during the previous 36 months period for your community and for you to hear from them so you would no longer you would no longer fit perfectly into the Red Sox we go to the yellow

[00:21:00]
so in order to get the 10:00 the you need to answer yes to all of all of these statements so the first statement the board has adopted in collaboration with the superintendent goals the board has adopted only smart goals that include a specific measure population starting point ending point is starting date and an ending date yes yes I've got a question on this one so so you have you have adopted goals they are they all have the intention to be smart and I've been clear your you know on the ones where you got from from from from from Exit 23 to why and 28 that's that is acceptable because those Baseline still need to be established that's not anything that you have control over that that's the

[00:22:00]
desert those are things at the state has to figure out question is on your so on the 3rd I know that the first two unquestionably yes they're smart the second one has a measure been established if you'll find how that will be measured the third one the third one that's the secondary Readiness and this is a question I don't know the answer well it's it's based on classroom numbers of students in those specific subgroups enrolled in those areas and then we'll have to measure at the end completers how many actually finished so that's where the measurements so you know how that was going to be measured I'll call that smart for the fourth one have you all established how that will be measured

[00:23:00]
leaning at this point towards trying to use panorama in a sort of a beginning of your end of your type of thing I'm running into some some issues of what it measures as far as I think as far as do not comes but that's what we're working on right now so this as long as that one is still kind of a question mark and the reason I bring this up is because that was based on so you borrowed from another District some gold language that they had or some of the methodology that they use that District actually just in the last two weeks has established that they are no longer going to use that goal because it can't be measured as a student

[00:24:00]
and they are switching it to a gargoyle because it is and it was specifically around the piano using the Panorama measurement they found that it was going to be more impactful and look at the things that they wanted to look at when they were looking at the adult outcomes and so I'm not here to say that it can't be done those these are things that you all have to have to determine but as long until that measure is established that's going to be a that's not that doesn't count the other question I have when I was looking at them and I don't know if it was just an edit that needed to be made I saw 2023 to 2028 but then I saw a 2023 to 2029 I think

[00:25:00]
the adult behaviors are definitely tied to the guard rails because those are the expectations that we have for superintendent the adults basically what they will not do or what they shall do I guess I hate the shell not kind of a hard one but so the conversation around students having things like the life skills that we talked about were self-efficacy I can't remember all of them

[00:26:00]
I don't have the I don't have them sitting right in front of me but because so that particular School District that you were speaking of felt that those were not they were too dependent on what the adults were doing in order for them to be able to get to that I guess I'm struggling with that one a little bit so the measure so Panorama is a is a survey so the survey of students and teachers it asks what so it asks about the conditions Panorama does measure both student.com and adult comes it's but it's a matter of what like specifically what the things are that are being asked so in here and I just pulled it up so you got perseverance self-regulation self-efficacy and social awareness those are all very clearly student outcomes the question is

[00:27:00]
where it came up in that District was how to pull those out and just look at those student outcomes and was that so it wasn't just can that be done but the data quality of that of that information so there are certain things that need to be done to validate that data to have data integrity and they the administration and the board leadership there had a conversation about what what they would rather do what they would they prefer to expend more time because it had been two years and they still weren't able to monitor the school they still weren't able to measure it so that was two years that went by that they were not able to that goal was still kind of out there kind of like floating around

[00:28:00]
the board wasn't able to monitor progress toward it wasn't being implemented I mean it was that they were still working to implement it or Implement strategies to improve that area but they weren't able to measure it in a way that gave the quality that the students of that District deserved so they asked the question do is this something you want to continue to monitor as a student outcome or is what you truly intend to monitor what the adults are doing what the conditions are that the adults are creating because all of that is is very clearly measurable and even the student outcomes so you can still monitor student outcomes under a guardrail you can't monitor adult outcomes because these are

[00:29:00]
and it actually does it so you can have it so it doesn't have to be under under the yellow column it doesn't require that it be a student outcome-focused you can get your 10 points what you can't what it doesn't allow you to do is go into the green column where you get 25 poyntz because the very first question is all goals pertain to desired student outcomes you have us all quiet so you don't have to have an answer for it right now it's something that you can chew on and that we can continue to have I look around and your District so then you're it's not just about the tool that's being used to

[00:30:00]
and the and the Integrity of the data that the total produces specific to student outcomes it's also the Integrity of the implementation of activities though too with regard to whatever professional development or training that we have to support that particular set of outcomes so that would assume that there's like some consistency across the district everybody's receiving the same things that everyone can implement it with the same Fidelity yeah and and that's the thing is that under under the guard rails those things can be monitored those things are part of what the guard rolls look at you're looking at professional development how different different things are implemented you're looking

[00:31:00]
able to look at more of the adult outfits or the adult outcomes okay so it's not something and that's not that's not the conversation that's on the agenda tonight but it is something that definitely needs to be a consideration moving forward so it's just something we probably just need to monitor to see where and how it's going okay how do you guys feel about that this side on the right side here so I guess I was a little bit confused were you saying that Panorama wasn't sufficient enough to measure what we were requesting that was that was the response from that District okay and I'm not saying I I don't know I'm not a that is not my realm okay that is not my realm it is something that you will have to sew your depending on your Administration to tell you whether or not this works

[00:32:00]
can we have yet to identify an Administration who is able to figure out how to measure how to take the the student outputs from Panorama and measure them with the level of data Integrity that is required to to be authentic in that presentation fair enough okay all right next question the board has adopted no fewer than one and no more than five goals allow for greater focus more for Less you've only got four right now so you're you're very healthy on that the superintendent has adopted and collaboration with the board one to three interim goals to progress monitor each goal and each interim goal is smart the plan is to have that by March 1st it sounds like that's going to happen the conversations that I've had with your administrative team I actually

[00:33:00]
had the privilege to spend the last two days with them and we did we did a lot of really great work around that so I'm excited to see what they bring forward status of each interim goal is able to be updated multiple times during the year that will be one of the one of the questions that you all have to ask when you're looking at those and the board publicly posted the goals for public comment prior to adoption you definitely did that so if all of those things are true by March 1st then you get your 10 points all right the next column this gives you the ability to go up to 25 poyntz first question the boards goals all pertain to desired student outcomes we just had this conversation so we don't have to have it again in addition to the goal ending points the board has adopted annual targets goal ending points for each

[00:34:00]
the superintendent has provided interim goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending date so your goal is going to be for 5 years each year you need to know what the those annual targets will be and those annual targets will be how you how you have those accountability conversations you have any questions about that one no I just don't know if we'll have that by Heart by the end of March I don't see that happening right probably not probably not we will buy March 1st we'll have the interim goals and guardrails on that last week and I feel we'll make that deadline

[00:35:00]
I also have the Strategic plan stuff and somewhere near I'm doing some other presentations to you so end of March no strategic planning know I'm hoping but I say but specifically you're not expected to have to have all of these right away and that has never been the plan you made it really clear that the expectation was May 23rd and that I think that will come I think you're not going to have it right in May but it'll be shortly after this is about setting clear expectations so knowing this is what we can do by March and this is what we can do for the next time we can move up will be

[00:36:00]
by the end of June and the next quarter so I'll be April May and June June or maybe and it may even be before then before then it may be a couple weeks after then but it's all about just being clear with expectations and and understanding the plan the goals to be in green hopefully by the end of June so my expectation is probably by the end of the summer I can't remember what the timeline was because I know so in you're not going to have it in May because this is going to take them a little bit of time to validate the data and all of that from from that administration of that exam but it could be you know maybe in July what we did if you recall we had this conversation

[00:37:00]
never made a 6-week turnaround ever so this but they swear this is the year and it is online it does strike me that it should be much faster and much easier to turn around but they do have to validate the data make sure that there was no irregularities that does take time but I would anticipate if they make their 6 weeks probably that would get us to data sometime in mid to late June so we would need some time to give you the goals from the numbers in from there but that'll give us the trend line data and we'll be we'll have some numbers at least have some numbers to start with just a reminder to two of the it's kind of a mess up there right now because they definitely are experiencing a huge turnover and

[00:38:00]
getting themselves reorganized so you know who and how they're going to get all the state of validated and presented and prepared and on time I think it's going to be we're going to be definitely at the at the mercy of of their organizational structure that's unfortunately true and their data group is under some serious revisions of revising and the person that was their left so they've got people feel pretty good about so if they stay and they can hire some people and we may be okay but there is definitely a lot of turmoil at the State offices right now because he said this is a chronic this is a decade old

[00:39:00]
last year giving me quite incredulous look and we told you that we might have it by October and you going but it's on the computer no I just remember it but we it is true that there's a lot of you they have to do with it so we can't control that the board members use the term deliberate when talking about this work and I think it would it is definitely advisable to to think about that and you know if my coaching to you would be if you get it in 6 weeks that would be great that would be amazing this is definitely something that you should be deliberate about it's very important and

[00:40:00]
that you're talking about just do it right you just might take I mean in some stuff out of our control anyway and so that means it's not going to be us that puts us maybe behind somebody else hate to point the finger but I guess just my question just for process so it's delayed you know we're still working out on our Focus you know we've got we've got some goals we've got some targets where we want to go we don't know how we're going to get there we don't know what we're measuring just quite yet but we at least have it stated and we're getting ready for the new school year you know the quarter after that which July August September so we're still being we're still able to leave I guess with the conversation around our interim goals and so those

[00:41:00]
structure what some of those inputs and outputs might be so it doesn't it doesn't keep us from that it's just how we're measuring it and how we're making sure that we're being really I agree very deliberate so that we're measuring the right thing and that we're communicating the right thing yeah and I don't think that you're not going to see any progress okay it's just this one this one very specific category so you're going to have lots of other things to do between now okay the next question goals pertain to student outputs or student outcomes not inputs or adults so your goals have to be in an outcome goals your interim goals also have to be student student outcome or student

[00:42:00]
I'm very specific to what students know or are able to do next the board included student parent staff and community members in the Goldman process you already done that period so not all of your interims have to be the full length of your goal and this is on purpose they're part of the plan their measuring the plan as you're going going along the path to get where you want to be so this allows you to look at new things to to realize progress sooner than your goals are going in your goals are going to see them these are your lead measures so you're going to you want to look at different things throughout

[00:43:00]
the course of that 5 years and then finally in the green column the goals and interim goals will challenge the organization and require change in adult behaviors give an example of that from another District like something I mean for I just think about a lot of the adult behaviors that just go on and like every District like how to really change that like tell me what that might specifically look like yeah so and this is this is really like the key thing around having being very clear on what your targets are going to be and having a very good understanding of what your Baseline is if your base line so if you don't know what your base line is then you can't you don't you can't know what your targets going to be so if you set for

[00:44:00]
set a minimum of 10-point growth over 5 years it's really smart that you said this is our minimum expectation it doesn't mean that's your maximum expectation so if it comes back and and it shows that the so the growth over from last year to this year is 5 Points then you can reasonably expect that that should be your Baseline of growth for if all things remain static in the district that you should have a 5-point growth over every year because I've never seen that kind of growth and in a year so I don't want to I don't want you to think that 5 Points is is going to happen but that should be your minimum expectation so if all things remain static in the district if no adult Behavior has changed if you're not challenging the district that that should be the very least of what you expect

[00:45:00]
so that it would be 5 years * 5 that's 25 so that 25 Point growth would be the the bare minimum now if you're going to challenge the district if you're going to expect students to expect adult behaviors to change then that growth needs to be higher than 25% you may know your actual gold behaviors focusing on very specific hard to hard to move the needle for groups of students focusing on very specific hard to move the needle for where you where your District may have found a challenge in the past they haven't changed those adult behaviors where they have they continue doing the same thing over and over again

[00:46:00]
but it's really it's really in the numbers it's really setting setting expectations high enough that adult behaviors are going to have to change but they still have to be attainable your goals still have to be smart so they they have to be attainable but they do have to challenge the district all right so if all of those things are true then your did you get 25 poyntz when do you do you think that it would be realistic to to meet that by September I would honestly hope so but a lot of this stuff is going to be dependent on the superintendent and his staff so I

[00:47:00]
it sounds reasonable again I'll have to go back and sit down with the staff but we're already making big steps towards this we're getting things in line some this will be dependent on strategic plan and getting some of those elements in place it's a 5-year plan right so what we get done by September will get done by September and if we can get you 25 points and we'll get you 25 points well if it's a problem will be those monthly updates where we talked and I have the opportunity to share hey we don't we're doing okay we're meeting these timeline and these are probably I don't know as far as progress monitoring if that's questions we could start incorporating into some of this as we get further down the line you know here's what we've done here's the progress we've made so you have a sense if we get from whatever reason we're not going to make the deadline you'll know

[00:48:00]
so I want to be clear on these on these on this page some of these things do rely on the superintendent but the majority of this is there are things that you're going to rely on the district to be able to get that information to do some of those things that are really on the state doing those

[00:49:00]
but at the end of the day the expectation is the boards you all are the ones that they need to work with the administration and if they if they come back and say you know the state didn't send us all of our data or the state sent us half of Santa fe's data or another District's data and we it's going to take us longer to sort it all out the Board needs to these are things that you all have to work with them on and understanding that these things do come up They do change and it's all about how you how you're working together the your relationship and the way that you're accepting all of that as well I mean I just kind of you're saying that really is on the board

[00:50:00]
but I'm kind of seeing it differently and I'm thinking a lot about is on the administration if you could just clear it up what are what are the specific what are the specific elements here that are going to rely on the administration and this is how the conversation is supposed to go by the way what are what are the specific elements of this that rely on the administration if I may go ahead Josefina right now I'm thinking and so how do we help so I'm asking myself well how do I help navigate

[00:51:00]
tracking this nut is the data related to Panorama and I spoke to a social worker who does a lot of work the state and National level and she challenged us or me she said don't accept that data has to be quantitative people work with that angle and so I guess we asked the superintendent how how is the day to team you know that be the question

[00:52:00]
and again it's how much in the weeds do we how do we frame the questions comma and how often we frame the question to the superintendent I guess is what I'm trying to take away from your instruction your coaching the target within the next you know the following quarter is fine but I also know that there's going to be progress made in lots of these areas because of the question that I asked initially is like we're still communicating those goals we're still communicating these terms are still doing some work so for me I'm not so concerned about when do we get

[00:53:00]
what's keeping us from being fully aligned in that particular green area and then just knowing as a board you know how much of that is out of our control and out of our locus of control for us as a board and also for the for the district if it's in the control of the district then we have something that we need to be worried about but if it's out of our locus of control how do we manage and how do we just work through that and communicate that I think with the constituents we serve but also with the superintendent and just getting that back and forth so I like setting the Target that that would be met within the next you know following quarter but knowing that it's it's also started just Discerning that issue of what's in our locus of control yeah and so this is this is where the rubber

[00:54:00]
on the road in sold going back to the mindset that Integrity is my access to goals I feel I think to our standard standard for integrity remember this is not moral Integrity this is not a matter of judgment this is not about blame this is about literal structural Integrity what have I allowed other people to expect to what degree have I allowed them to expect it and by when I have allowed them to expect it that's this conversation what are the expectations that you are allowing for the community that you represent and so it's not when is it as important as when am I allowing them to expect it to happen by so this is absolutely not about checking a box it's not about getting points it's fine

[00:55:00]
to the Jack in the Box and it's fun to get the points but it's more important to do the work and to be clear about the expectations that you're allowing other people to have so and that's why I say really hesitant to say to say like let's go with 6 weeks after the test is administered saying September gives you a lot of buffer it gives you a lot of room to be able to anticipate delays to anticipate the state not doing their part to anticipate changes in administration not administration department or whatever like creating that buffer to be to do it right that's the

[00:56:00]
do you think that so do you think that

[00:57:00]
and I definitely think that we need to set expectations and and this is the exact same conversation we had when we were studying the board inflammation implementation timeline we said can we do it I don't know maybe we can and we said and we kept pushing it back and pushing it back and we said no we are going to set this timeline if we can meet the timeline like this is what we should expect if we have to make adjustments we make adjustments but let's set a time line and so yes absolutely think I've got January March under orange and I've got July September green and I have highlighted and I rented it down in two places our job our responsibility is to challenge the organization so let's challenge the organization we have a responsibility to improve student outcomes and it's going to require a challenge of the organization and a change of the adult behaviors so

[00:58:00]
but we don't have let's do this and I believe that's where we're going I think it was just the clarification of like how we're setting the targets and literally trying to work on a calendar myself yeah and that's the thing is that I so I don't want to put you in the position to have to readjust I want you to be able to set expectations and then hold them and then do what you said that you were going to do but that starts by saying that starts by setting realistic expectations that's why I'm saying that that's why I think September is probably like September is realistic June probably isn't it oh no I don't think the date will be out by June but I

[00:59:00]
I don't have any problem saying September and it may be sooner than that it's usually in August right so by the end of September that gives you an additional 4 week buffer do we get an extra point if we do it before September stations in a way that leads them to express ownership of the adopted goals what about who wants to read the second paragraph I'll read it all of the interim goals are predictive of their respective goals and our influenceable by the

[01:00:00]
superintendent and the superintendent's team predictive suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between the interim goal and the goal influenceable suggests that the superintendent and through them the staff has authority over roughly 80% of the inputs the interim goal is measuring there's a lot in there so the question is is is is this influenceable by the superintendent and predictive of the overall goal if you look at if you look at the interim measures are they going to tell you how you're making progress when you when you see the interims that y'all have to make that decision is this predictive and is is the influenceable and so if it's not then you're not going to get off the interim goals or you're not going to adopt them anyway but you're going to fly

[01:01:00]
and you're going to ask the superintendent to go back to the drawing board I will say that after the conversations I had with your staff over the last two days I have full faith that that's going to be the case so one of one of the reasons why I think this is really important and I'm looking at tips for Effective monitoring and one of them is no got you governance and if we don't pay attention to what's realistic and that doesn't mean we let go of urgency it doesn't mean we let go of commitment and and what needs to be done but if we don't pay attention to what the real environment is and what possibilities are if we decide to set a goal here when we know it is highly unlikely that will be able to meet it then it's just setting it up for

[01:02:00]
monitoring and accountability but yes as of right now it sounds like you got two under the blue already at the point that you see your interims which should be the beginning of March so what about the third one who would like to read the third one sure the board on a root cause analysis comprehensive student needs assessment and or similar research-based tool to inform identification of and prioritization of potential goals so this is the this is the information that the superintendent looked at when he said these are these are your high lever areas of focus this is why I was so adamant that those

[01:03:00]
because you have to take those into consideration so it sounds like as soon as you get the green you're going to have the blue so you're actually not going to get 25 poyntz in September you should get 35 points in September and that's because of the work that y'all did in advance you know one thing that that makes me think of is that achieving those goals if our insurance and the administration is ineffectively working towards the goal but the other thing this is what's an hour left as a board is if we accurately identified with the root causes of the superintendent off in a wrong direction so that no matter how

[01:04:00]
because the basic root cause is not been accurately identified and that's on us as a board to make sure that we're paying attention to that yeah and you and when the when you base your goals off of what the superintendent said are those are are those priorities are those High leverage areas of focus that you did you did that you because that information was provided by your I don't know y'all call them your data your data guys like Dr Bowman and Chris West yeah they did a lot of work on this beforehand so the reason why I bring this up is that

[01:05:00]
they are incredibly good it looking at what they can look at but I think it's one of the reasons why some of us felt so strongly about putting in a social emotional goal is that that speaks to root cause and if we don't address that we are setting we're setting up the superintendent to spin wheels no matter how hard and effectively they were in those areas and sapper at this point doesn't have I mean I think that goes back to our discussion about can we have a social emotional or not and what why that's problematic but I think it does speak to you knowing where we are with our students and our district why it's so important to have that social emotional component because we could end up spinning wheels and not getting where we want to be and I think our monitoring

[01:06:00]
can we get to that part in terms of we're actually monitoring and asking the right questions to that it's going to help us to either readjust or hopefully learn some of the things that because what we haven't done I think is a district is actually have that conversation about the inputs and outputs what what is actually and looking at the data in terms of reflecting on the data as a result of those inputs and outputs that's the part that we need to look at I mean there's lots of inputs and outputs that are going on but we're not looking at it reflectively around the data what is the data telling us so I'm excited about that so for this part I just feel like our vision and goals is where we've had the strongest work where we're obviously heading towards mastering and we're going to be able to master this probably even by September at least because we've done all of the work in this area yeah okay yeah and and I think so

[01:07:00]
one of the things that I like to point out this is you have done the majority of the work in this area because this is the area that is most aligned with improving student outcomes this is this is the work that is most aligned with words that move the needle for kids and that's that's why this is this is the area that has the that you get the highest number of points it's not about getting points it's about actually changing the behaviors let's talk about values and guardrails as you know your guards are how you protect the values of your community and inside of your guard rails this is where you as a board say these are the things that we do not want you to do and in pursuit of those goals board member Peterson this is exactly like directly from what you just said

[01:08:00]
goals are the most important thing guardrails are also very very very very very very very very very very very very important that is this is where you look at what the adults are doing and where you get to dig deeper into some of these root causes because a lot of in education a lot of this is about what the adults are doing and a lot of those root causes the things that are really doing so let's talk about it in the red and the so we've already established in December the board had not adopted goals the next one is the board has not hosted opportunities to listen to the values of the community during the previous 36 months period

[01:09:00]
first one who would like to read that first paragraph the board has adopted in collaboration with the superintendent guardrails based on the communities values and that do not hinder pursuit of the goals each guardrail describes a single operational action or class of actions the superintendent may not use or allow in pursuit of the goals so you'll have identified your guard rails you have it on them yet but you're going to do that really soon and should be done by the end of March the next one period

[01:10:00]
I've got five guardrails so you're you're on track with that one remember Miller Eragon the superintendent has adopted in collaboration with the board 1 to 3 in room guard rails for each guardrail and each interim guard rail is smart so your guard rails are going to be very are very clearly the superintendent will not that's the guardrail the reason that they that they use that shall not will not language this is something that I think was was really impactful for the staff members I was with yesterday when my kids finally got big enough to go outside and ride their bikes around the neighborhood I told him two things don't ride your bicycle on the sidewalk it's Danger

[01:11:00]
you can get hurt to don't ride your bicycle out of the neighborhood I didn't tell them go ride up and down Adams Street I didn't tell them to go ride their bicycle around the park I said don't do these two things that's because I wanted them to have that freedom that flexibility to explore to be kids to to live their lives but I also want them to be safe so I told him not to do that's why we use that shall not will not language we want our superintendent to be we want him to have that flexibility we want him to be able to select input we want him to be able to develop a strategy for how the educational plan for the district is going to be implemented but there are also some things that the community has said are values that need to be protected we're going to protect those values by saying don't do this

[01:12:00]
is able to be updated multiple times during each school year so just like the interim goals they're going to be you're going to look at the multiple times during the year finally the board publicly posted the guard rails for public comment

[01:13:00]
by the end of March I think so the guardrails have a little there they have a little bit less weight because they're not have to be the most important but guard rails are also very very very very very very very very very very very important so then we go so in the green we go up to 10% has provided internal ending points for each year leading up to the ending date so just like your goals just like your interim goals the interim guard rolls should also have those annual targets cuz you're going to look you're

[01:14:00]
now look at them because they're going to be evaluated as part of the superintendent's evaluation every every year the next one all interim guard rails pertain to outputs or outcomes not inputs so I want to point out here that these are not student outcomes they're not student outfits these can be any outcomes any Outlets because their guard rails next the board included students parents and community members in the world development process the next the board has considered adoption of one or more theories of action to drive the school systems overall strategic direction if there is a permanent superintendent that person was included in the theory consideration process so this is a new this is something we haven't really spent much time talking

[01:15:00]
we haven't spent any time talking about it outside of our two days together and I think even then we just barely touched on it one of the reasons is you already have a theory of action established but one of the things that you all need to have a conversation about is is this is the theory of action that is currently in place still applicable with these goals and these guard rails the theory of action generally so it's it's a guard rail it's a it's a very high level guard rail that talks about the level of autonomy that individual schools will have how the how the district will be will be managed so generally they're afraid and if we do this if we do this if we do this then this will happen

[01:16:00]
what questions do you have about the theory of action right now I mean have you done that I don't have the insurance company so I think once we get those set then we can dive into the series of action and then I think you need this I mean strategic Direction I'm thinking strategic plan so we don't have that yet can we cannot be done without yes so generally the theory of action the theory of action is is a management tool but it's one that the board gets to help have a gets to have a have a say in and that's why it's important that the superintendent

[01:17:00]
and we actually had a lot of conversation with your staff yesterday about the theory of action and it's been really at the at the end of the day the question is how much autonomy are we going to give to individual or individual campuses and a lot of it has to so a lot of that decision and I feel and I don't know for a fact but I think some of the conversation was that they've been talking about a tuned with this because that actually is going to help inform the development of their strategic plan but generally When developing a theory of action and deciding how much autonomy is going to be distributed throughout the district which baseball on the guard rails you'll have identified one of them is very specific to District district aligned curriculum instructions or materials that

[01:18:00]
that would indicate less autonomy generally when you have greater need with your with improving student outcomes or when you have had a long period of time across many and low student outcomes across many campuses where it's kind of district-wide the district chooses to have less autonomy I cannot tell and I genuinely have no opinion one way or the other it has to be something that you all decide but I can help facilitate that but really I think that based on the conversation that that your staff LED yesterday it sounds like they have some pretty clear directions

[01:19:00]
we're trying to do is make sure the two systems align and trying to figure out where elements of like initiatives and priorities that we develop as part of the Strategic plan how they align to the goals and guard rails that are being established and that's it's more difficult than it sounds sometimes so that's what we're trying to do is make sure that the two systems run in hand in hand so we run ignoring into the goals of guardrails and they weave into in some way into this strategic initiatives helping us to develop so it sounds like the goals in the guard rails right at this point in time where timely because you're in the process of the Strategic plan is setting up those theories of action here

[01:20:00]
because it helps to find some of the house and and what we can do again looking at it as a 5-year process but yeah it's we couldn't without the goals we would have been stuck OK Google is it something that you feel like we need to have a workshop on do you feel like it can be a conversation during a board meeting how in depth would you do we need to do a training around it what level of Engagement would you like in our partnership on that end

[01:21:00]
I don't think I don't know when a training just on theory of action would be a good use of time I also think that attuned in their strategic planning process has the right skills and competencies to support the development that based on our unique context I agree I agree so in the context of your implementation timeline I'm just going to have adopts a theory of action not received training or anything like that okay next all board guard rails last from 3 to 5 years old last from 1 to 3 years just like the intervals finally the guard rails and from guard rails and theories of action

[01:22:00]
challenge the organization and require change in adult behaviors I think by the based on the guard rails okay so going back to the previous question and then narrowing almost I won't jump to Blue but okay I think we could definitely need that I think it aligns with a tune with the work that they're doing as well and that and that puts your goals your goals and your

[01:23:00]
community members in a way that leads to them to express ownership of the adopted guardrails and if applicable theories of action and even with the with the having a tune help with that they have been deeply engaging with your various groups across the community so yeah stakeholder group for sure all right next next all of the interim guardrails are predictive of their respective guard rails and our influenceable by the superintendent and the superintendent's team predictive suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between guardrail and the

[01:24:00]
influenceable suggests that the superintendent and threw them the staff has authority over roughly 80% of whatever the interim guardrail is measuring finally in addition to the guard rails on the superintendent's Authority the board has adopted one to five guard rails on its own behavior and evaluates itself against them at least quarterly yes yes

[01:25:00]
prevent us from getting involved in inputs and outputs I imagine it should be one of the things that does what do you think this is always my favorite song how would you like to have this conversation I think it's like having to go back and thinking about the

[01:26:00]
the training behind that too or the coaching behind that what does that mean yeah because I think our today was very in the you know way up here but to really be thinking about our own behaviors in our guard rails we probably need to do a whole different session just with ourselves yeah who is the Genesis of transformation and who is the adult that has to change first Court we really haven't had that conversation

[01:27:00]
oh my gosh we have to pick guard rails for ourselves we have to sell police it's it's never a difficult conversation sometimes uncomfortable but it's usually pretty easy to pick the the big ones for boards you'll know you'll know and so don't let it don't let it scare you okay if it was if it was that scary I would have introduced it a lot differently why do you think the sooner the better particularly because we're going to be getting into the progress monitoring so once we do have our garden grills and goals adopted it would be great to be thinking about our own behavior more

[01:28:00]
so the question is how soon and how how do you want to have that conversation and and you don't have to decide tonight well it needs to happen fairly soon but I guess my question back to you is our boards have they traditionally taken care of that in a regular board meeting a special board meeting what have you seen traditionally how that's handled I've seen it handled a lot of different ways okay it's not uncommon for words to say period because you need to pick what what is what is pertinent to you it is so Danielle mentioned the monitoring conversation that is usually a really good place to start and identifying okay these are the things that we are currently doing as a

[01:29:00]
remember this is not is individuals you don't have individual Authority the only one of you who has any individual Authority is the board president and those are very specific responsibilities that are outlined by policy otherwise you will act as a board a body corporate and so your word guard rolls are what will our board not do you can make your bored guard real specific to individual board members individual board members will not show up on campus individual board members will not act in active or speak on behalf of the board without prior authorization individual board members will not individual board members will not violate the conflict of interest policy

[01:30:00]
schedule a board member like you can do some things about individual board members you can also have things about the board and very specific to the monitoring conversation it's it's not uncommon to have a guardrail that says you know board members will not ask questions that we're not previously submitted in writing at least by a given deadlines and usually five days before the board meeting so that way all of the questions can be asked and they can be answered and those answers go to everybody and they get posted online that is a lot more transparent than actually asking them in this meeting that I think I think the analytics they talked about yesterday was has like an average of 35 352

[01:31:00]
and that was that was part of the conversation that was part of the conversation so when we do so I do recommend in this next section I will recommend that we that we do a progress monitoring Workshop where we actually go through how to ask questions how to how your questions should be oriented you shouldn't be picking picking inputs you're monitoring shouldn't be saying we'll go to this go go fix it this way go go go go make your plan the US should be what's the plan how is this happening what did you learn from that that previous data but getting your getting your questions oriented and that continuous Improvement so that's usually a really great context to have that self-accountability conversation so in just since we have

[01:32:00]
what's the interest of the board in terms of that setting our guard rails in terms of a conversation when you say as soon as possible what does that mean so I'll pop up I think a lot of that stuff that like some of the stuff that you just mentioned is already in our policies so it feels like some of that is just we just need to pull pull what's important to us out to create guard rails which potentially is just like homework before we get to a meeting but I mean I'm thinking you know sometime in March probably like after we set the guard rails and when we have we have the March meetings a lot of those things we already started

[01:33:00]
pause the updates that we could make particularly to our board code of conduct and conflict of interest policies and so I think it would depend on the capacity of the staff but bringing those particular policies to an upcoming policy meeting for discussion would put us on the right path for those included in that calendar that we would we've talked about them I don't know if they're on the calendar because that would probably be the only for the rest of the year for policy yeah I know and and she was talking to Legal because legal is the department responsible for that so I think it was largely around the coordination but I don't know whether they're actually on the calendar or not I don't know Johanna knows no I don't believe that I don't remember it but I that's a lot sorry

[01:34:00]
Taylor board meeting scheduled for March right now is the first and the 15th is just the regular board meetings but we've already got a full agenda on the 1st because we're going to be adopting that's that's for this work that we're doing with the guard rails and the interns and all that so that was definitely not a good date on the 15th another regular board meeting but we could also just do it as a another special in between I don't even know what we have coming up in terms of when the right size and committee or the policy Committee in one in March are you scheduled and the policy committee March 6th March 6th but that's on a an accountant item with some items that were already potentially they have that discussed and it was really a question of when legal would be able to okay do it so I don't know the answer to that okay but I am

[01:35:00]
I think we had talked with Ashley about this being a part of the policy diet and which we weren't going to get to till later so we kind of put it aside with full intention of getting to it but I think if I recall it was the summer right which is why we haven't we don't have it on the agenda you know on the schedule yet okay we're going to go over it in one of our one of the next sections so I'm just trying to like get us past that one particular piece so that we because you asked the question when are we going to get this scheduled I know the sport they want to date so I'm trying to find a date that would work and if your suggestion is like we could do it as soon as possible it seems like we can or is it something that we should wait and do in conjunction with something else and so so based on what I've heard so far it sounds like Mark is going to be pretty heavy with Golden Girls and turn guardrails

[01:36:00]
okay and so I think the April would be a really good time to to pinpoint having that conversation and start practice monitoring okay and what that will look like is you're not going to have your targets yet you're not going to have your numbers so what what that does is allows you all the opportunity to have very low stakes conversations about what the plan is about what the what what's next and starting to reorient your questions so but saying that we should also just go ahead and develop our own guard rails then in that sort of low stakes yeah so that's okay we can do a progress monitoring conversation and this is just the board's progress monitoring just the things that the board is going to look at

[01:37:00]
the superintendent has like a whole other side of progress monitoring for the management the kpis that he's looking at the progress measures but these are just the things that the board is looking at so well I mean in the in the intention thus far has been and what we've been doing intentionally is having an sosg placeholder on our regular board agenda anyway so that we're always focused on this particular governance and the things that we need to do so we could build that in in the April even in the first April meeting the regular board meeting so it could be part of that conversation that includes our guard rails as well as the other pieces around a practicing practice monitoring if we needed to do that okay we can also do some like one-on-one or small group sessions okay we do some pre-work before that is okay that's okay we're not in a meeting for 6 hours does that help

[01:38:00]
okay just want to make sure so let's go on to monitoring and accountability so I'm just going to I'm just going to read through the red really quick the board has not adopted goals the board does not schedule each goal to be monitored at least four times per year the board does not schedule each guard rail to be monitored at least once per year the board has not adopted a monitoring calendar the board does not track its use of time in board authorized public meetings the board has not consistently demonstrated the ability to distinguish between customer service issues and owner service issues

[01:39:00]
and the school system has not achieved any of its interim goals during the previous 12-month period yeah were there before y'all get there it's going to be at least a year that is intentional because you're going to have to practice before you get like practicing monitoring practicing asking the questions this takes the pressure off of you to feel like it has to be rushed through cuz this is the area that is the most the most important for the long term don't feel like establishing is super important it is but this is the most important thing that the board is going to do over

[01:40:00]
that 5 month period so getting it getting it right is something that we want you to be very deliberate about doing so we won't get out of zero until a year from now yeah not unless we have one of Hermione hourglass necklaces no pressure and it also gives us a little bit of time to begin tracking your time and your meetings which I have some I do have some recommendations on how to do that because the board has to do it and I heard I heard a rumor that you have a board secretary that wants to do more work so I think I think that could be a very particular job for the executive committee and start putting some real

[01:41:00]
that's going to come I think that one will actually come a lot sooner the board doesn't schedule each guard rail to be monitored at least once per year the board does not schedule each gold to be monitored at least four times per year so that's that's part of the the goals in the guards already they have to be goals have to be looked at least once or at least once per quarter and the guard rails have to be looked at least once per year at least that doesn't mean only but at least in our recommendation is that each interim is scheduled to happen at least once per year in a public meeting but that they are all reported to the board

[01:42:00]
send an email and your staff got some training on how to do that yesterday so I'm really excited for y'all to be able to see that too and two of the points you're getting done right now period I am trying to develop a calendar here and I'm just doing it for a visual for myself so I could see where we were headed yeah okay so the next let's go let's let's think forward so the board invest no less of its 10% of its total board authorized public meeting minutes monitoring its goals next the Super Bowls and monitoring calendar development processes

[01:43:00]
superintendent creates the monitoring calendar but then the board works with the superintendent to adopt monitoring calendar today is going to make it very clear when you're going to look at them in a public meeting when you're going to have those discussions why might this be important I'm hoping for like continuity one stop at accountability accountability is going to know what you're going to talk about your staff

[01:44:00]
going to know when they need to be at a board meeting to talk about what things it's going to be very clear to everyone across the system the board the community your staff when you're going to talk about what subjects for Jackson I think that gets to your idea of wanting to have like this calendar of like when specific things are happening so that could help us there for sure next the board has received monitoring reports in accordance with its monitoring calendar and then finally the superintendent is evaluated only on performance regarding the boards guard rails and interim goals and guard rails the board considers the superintendent performance to be indistinguishable from school system performance

[01:45:00]
I have faith that he will but it's it's holding its holding ourselves in the superintendent accountable to the things that we set as our goals and our guard rails and the things that were most important to the community in terms of what we heard is the vision and values and it's it's based on that particular piece of moving the needle and getting to the place that we want to get to yeah what does this do for your superintendent you know I mean he knows what to expect so it's not too shocking his expectations are clear and they are grounded and what is happening for students all of the subjectivity is out the window and I think it it removes the boards area to Define what they think is appropriate and not and it takes away even our personal opinion and it makes it more unbiased and factual

[01:46:00]
but it also means that the collaborative piece is really vital that again and not get set up as a gotcha governance but it really gets set up and in developed based on on real need and reality it also means that every single one of these monitoring conversations that you have is not just a monitoring conversation with the with the community so that the community can hear so that it look like every single one of these is an accountability conversation with the superintendent into your point where remember Peter said it's not about gotcha governance it's about understanding what the plan is understanding what the expectations are being clear about what they expectations are if you're not on track that doesn't mean you go find a new superintendent if you're not on track that means

[01:47:00]
can the superintendent Lee what his strategy is to get back on track this is this is making the main thing the main thing all the time I mean we just we know where we're going like he'll know where we're going and we all will so I think it's always helpful to know where you want to be so you know that you're not going to get these 10 points for at least a year how much look how soon do you think you can get this year do you think a year is reasonable

[01:48:00]
does that mean we have to monitor at least four times a year so we know when we have to at least do it for a year before we even move out of the red to begin with so we obviously need more than a year right so it's like through next school year yeah it would it would be May 24th and the reason the reason this one is set so long is because I'm shaking your head why not open because it's going to be at least that summer yeah I don't think that goes back to when do you receive the results from pad right at least on the main goals you'll have we can set that stuff but I don't know that we'll have I don't know how that works in terms of the timing of the evaluation either but evaluation doesn't have to happen in that in that time frame it just has to be clear that that's that's the tool that you're using

[01:49:00]
and you all will know that well before then or you can know that well before then it's not just looking at the graduation piece period

[01:50:00]
Pasadena she's talking about so the orange column or the yellow column under monitoring and accountability she's saying that it would probably be closer to September of 24th on when y'all receive the results okay just thank you when I get a chance thank you thank you all right so that that gives us a pretty pretty hard to mine or a pretty a pretty clear

[01:51:00]
no less than 25% of its total board authorized public meetings monitoring goals so remember over this entire time frame you're going to be progress monitoring you're going to be creating the conditions you're going to be changing your board operating procedures you're going to be changing the way that you your own behaviors as a board it is so in my experience and I believe that you will definitely be able to get 25% within that that same time frame no more than two goals or monitor per month and I want to be this is specifically in a board meeting but it doesn't mean that you only get reports in the board meeting

[01:52:00]
that you just only talked about them in Port readings or you're only going to talk about two goals in each board meeting next every goal is monitored at least four times per year regard rail is monitored at least once per year and then the board has been provided copies of but unless required by law did not vote to approve or disapprove the superintendent's plan for implementing the board's goals and work to ensure that the plan included both and implementation timeline and implementation instruments so what this is this is a very specifically talking about what you all call your strategic plan and my question for you is does New Mexico state law require the board to adopt a strategic plan I think we have to produce an academic

[01:53:00]
so it's the superintendent's job to be the Strategic leader of the district that means that they create the Strategic plan now they need to in those monitoring reports tell you what the plan is to get on track but that doesn't mean you adopt the entire strategic plan and then last the most recent value the most recent annual superintendent evaluation took place no more than 12 months ago so in a year that will be the case and I'm pretty sure that y'all are already on that time line so okay so do you think it's realistic if you're going to get to Yellow and September 24th do you think it's realistic to get to Green in September 24th

[01:54:00]
and then finally let's look at Blue the board invest no less than 50% of its total board authorized public meeting minutes each month into effectively monitoring its goals this is half the time and your bored authorized public meetings and that's that's the point that's the point of of Sophie that's the whole point of this framework is it helps you helps you get to that place we're going to do it because we're going to make crystal is the same amount of time is the 10% in the First Column of next only discussed and or acted on during public meetings the board mod

[01:55:00]
why is it gold guard rails and monitoring calendar no more than once during the span of the boards adopted goals unless they are met sooner so if you meet your goals sooner and you can adopt a new goal but you're not going to you're not going to make adjustments to them more than once and I'm not and I'm not going to ping you on the little language that have to get made because of wording or whatever that's we're talking about substantial adjustments to the language to the meaning and then a longer period allows for more focused shorter allows for Less the school system has achieved at least half of its interim goals during the previous 12 months period so that means that you're actually seeing progress toward at least half of your interims

[01:56:00]
if the board approves an annual budget it only does so after determining that the board's goals are the first priority for resource allocation word yeah so you have to you have to adopt the budget that's part of the law but it's this you don't get to check this box until you've ensured that your goals and aligned with the budget and to be clearer this year with your goals and it was last year because it's going to be more like it was the previous year and that's that's the

[01:57:00]
vacation all right and finally the majority of the boards monitoring sessions During the period were rated effective or highly effective secretary Jackson and we haven't we actually haven't started yet because you have an adopted them yet and you haven't started progress monitoring but once you receive that progress monitoring training and all of these things are in place then we actually have a rubric and we'll share it with you you're not expected to just know we don't believe in stealth expectations but will be rating the quality of your goal

[01:58:00]
quality of your progress monitoring so it's just a little like extra level of accountability to help you and to Bright and it's not it's not as like I got you it's not as a like you're getting graded you're getting in trouble it's more of a matter of feedback providing feedback providing that continuous Improvement opportunity will it be live oh no don't ask that question so do you think that you get you're going to get yellow you're going to get green do you think you could get to Blue by the September 24th

[01:59:00]
I mean can we do that with the way we're going to do the budgeting cuz I know and I think superintendent can answer that a little bit better cuz I know this first year which will be the 24th of right we're not going to quite be there until the 25th right well I think for the full shift that you wanted was a three-year process of 265 we started that conversation last summer but you know new people in positions and turnover period

[02:00:00]
turn it up to get things moving in that direction so we our goal you asked the other last time and how much will be this this time we're really hoping we can talk about you know some of the things you specifically asked for what kind of programs were heard what kind of impact did it have we think we'll be able to answer those questions a little bit more easily this time will be able to talk to the principles about noting these goals and how did you look at your school budgets and look talk to my district people and say in your District budget how did this align so we can have at least that that entry level my experience of working with her you know about Finance like she's incredible she was a really really good higher and I'm pleased with my interactions with her and just her ability to adapt and move towards this new direction that

[02:01:00]
ran and I don't sense any type of pushback or questioning like she's motivated and thrilled so no I don't think there's any lack of effort or or desire to style me that anyway but the reality is it's really really hard to read to align resources and to move those resources without having significant impacts in departments and in school so that's where this process takes time it's one thing to start putting things in place which I think is what she's doing I agree but I just want to it's you notice a difference so when you have someone's buying and you have hers because you could sense it when there's other people that are just questioning the entire process all the way through but she's fabulous 100%

[02:02:00]
it's less about them getting it fully aligned and more about the board asking the question and and ensuring that alignment is happening and that you are more aligned each year then the year before so the goal is more alignment like you and understanding like and I think that at least my observation of conversations with superintendent to Elder and with your Finance team they have been very clear about it's going to take some time so it's not about it being perfect it's about that growth happening that the alignment becoming more

[02:03:00]
so I'm just going to I think the question is is like meeting Mastery and I'm thinking about the the 50% at the top is where where is where I think you want I think I think to meet Mastery and to to really hit all of these pieces I think we should hit Mastery probably by the end of the year and and just say that that's where we're going to go and then what will do is we're measuring that Mastery from the we should we definitely need to hit 25% much earlier than September in my mind but but I think we will but then fully to that Mastery I think by the end of the year is what where I was thinking I was thinking like December 24th December 2323

[02:04:00]
you guys bump this up to 24 yeah because we can't do this we can't do read for at least okay but we could start implementing some of these other pieces yeah I think we can hit Blue by September 24th and you were ready by December 23rd yeah I'm sorry I was looking at it I was looking at the calendar in a different way so never mind you're right I think we can hit it I think we can hit it by 24 for sure and really you know getting this is like yeah this is this is if you can get to this then you are you're doing what you what you have told your community that you want to do so I was thinking last time we were talking about September 23rd and I'm still carrying over a 23 but that was my bad so yeah so just just on these first three that gives you 15 and

[02:05:00]
5 is 50 points and this one puts you at 30 so even if you just do these things over that period Then you have met your 80% obligation to the to the counselor that's okay so are we saying September 2024 or December of 2024 number 2024 Josefina I was I was stuck on a right now so yeah we're skipping I was I was ready to do it this year so so I'm just going to say cuz I attended a PTA meeting and there are lots of questions about how this filters down and you know I couldn't give them any answers of course but I could listen and and the

[02:06:00]
what does this mean for like if we can't prove that 4-H is having a direct impact on math and English or language proficiency our fear is that it'll be Genesis and you know I don't know how this filters down in terms of budgets and and let me clarify 4

[02:07:00]
in terms of you know the how the budget will be realigned and what the implications are at the classroom level so your I mean the reality is is that that's not that's not something that is entirely within your control what is in your control is setting the expectations we know what happens in the boardroom can be seen in the classroom and so the most likely thing to happen is if you if you don't do this work is that that jettison can't have is more likely to happen that is if this is getting this is the boards behaviors with what is effective if the board is doing what they're what they're supposed to be doing then what happens in the classroom

[02:08:00]
you can have a reasonable expectation that it will be cascaded through the district because all of that has to happen in order for the student outcomes to really change so you know it is hard to have these conversations with people at the campus level because they want you to be the ones to to make all the decisions they want you all to save the day they want you all to you reality is the board has a very specific group of work that you have to do and as of right now you are not creating the conditions for those realities to exist in the classroom but by setting a five year plan by saying we are we are setting a plan we are setting a destination where we want this District to go and we're giving you five years to get there then it is more likely that all of these

[02:09:00]
playgrounds all of these things are that are being implemented throughout the district are going to be given more time as well the grace that you extend is going to be the grace of the superintendent extends and so on and so forth nice okay thank you thank you okay let's move on to communication and collaboration the board did not receive the final version of materials to be voted on at least three calendar days before the board authorized public meeting during which the materials would be considered there were more than six board authorized public meetings in a single month during the previous 12 months period any

[02:10:00]
King of the board lasted more than 8 hours during the previous 12 months period when I was on my board we had a 14 hour meeting so oh yeah it was tough what time did you start notice I have a different job now okay and the board does not use a consent agenda the board has not hosted opportunities to listen to the vision of values of the community during the previous 36 months period how does this one fit for you all or how do you all fit within this one

[02:11:00]
I think so it doesn't mean we're out of yellow but I think we're in yellow I haven't had a 6 hour it says 8 hours so we can okay okay okay okay okay okay so we can pass that and so what about the committee meetings that's that's one that I have a question on how many how many comedian meetings are y'all having in addition to your so you got two regularly scheduled board meetings and then how many committee meetings are you having we just have and then we have cancer when we get the stuff and then we can ask the questions

[02:12:00]
get them done and we're done we don't have we have to have the audit so that one's required by Statute so we do have an audit committee but that's not every month either it's just governed by when they say we have to yeah and that's kind of the that's kind of the question is like how how often does it mean and how often does it have to meet and even does it have to be a standing committee because there's often a lot of misinterpretation around that and I don't know what the laws I know that the laws are a little bit different and New Mexico audit of Finance are the ones that are required yeah and so and we will talk about this a lot more in-depth but there is there is evidence that committees that are giving a very specific purpose a very specific set of deliverables and a very specific deadlines are far

[02:13:00]
effective than standing committees that meet just for the sake of meeting and that's what we've done with for example with the redistricting or right-sizing I shouldn't say redistricting right sizing it's a very deliberate committee very structured it's only on that topic and it will be done so okay let's let's move on to the next one and then we can talk about this little bit more so moving into the yellow all consent eligible items were placed on the consent agenda and all but a few were voted on using a consent agenda we've gotten better at that yeah so this is getting back to the that to the idea that how we use our time tells the community what are values are what are the things that are the most important for us the way that we spend our time is is our priorities and so when multiple things are multiple conversations then

[02:14:00]
it creates a lot of confusion about what is what is the most important thing okay going next the board tracks its use of time and board authorized public meetings categorizing every minute used as one of the following one goal setting this is reviewing discussing and or selecting goals to go monitoring reviewing discussing and or approving or not approving called monitoring reports guardrail setting reviewing discussing and or selecting guard rails guardrail monitoring reviewing discussing and or not approving guardrail monitoring reports leadership evaluation board self-evaluation board time use evaluation and superintendent evaluation voting that's debating and voting on any item these are

[02:15:00]
monitoring so if you're voting on goals you're voting on guardrails those are going to be under adopting or if you're adopting monitoring reports those are going to be like voting on those things is going to be part of that monitoring but everything else is going to fall under that's very specific voting Community engagement this is two-way communication between the board and community members this does not count public comment because public comment is not two-way engagement two-way communication and then other that's everything else all other ways that you spend your time be clear that doesn't mean you don't get to spend your time doing things that are not that are not bored work it's just that you have to spend 50% of your time or the goal is to get to 50% of your time so that leaves other 50

[02:16:00]
the guardrail monitoring or goal monitoring I mean it seems like an odd thing I mean we can accept it just like you know you accept a committee report or not but it's not I mean it strikes me that that's where we have feedback and conversation that's where the collaboration between us and the superintendent have that opportunity for dialogue for collaboration for problem solving it seems it just seems like an odd thing that we would vote on it so the first of all this is why you want why the goal is to spend 50% of your time

[02:17:00]
I'm having those conversations because they are the most critical conversations that you have as a board but the conversation isn't the only part you get these monitoring reports and you have to prove these monitoring reports so the conversation is really really important but at the end of the day you also have to prove the report because that that is your acceptance of the report that is saying we've been given the information that we need to move forward so if the monitoring report is insufficient then you're not going to prove the monitor report you're going to say thank you for all of your efforts please come back next month we're not going to let him get to that point and your and it's and it really is and you're giving some very clear guidelines on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know it has the all the trademarks of

[02:18:00]
honor to report it has to be clear about what the goal or the guardrail like what is the main goal of the main guardrail what is the progress that's been made for that what is the interim goal or the interim guardrail that that report is is talking about and what is the progress on that are you on track or are you off track if you're off track what is the plan to get there and this is something that I think might be a particular interest to some of you it also has to have all of the all of the data disaggregated by student group so even the reports that are on the goals in the interim goals that have very that are very specific to your highest need groups you're still going to look at the data for all of your students so it's not that you're never going to look at that information it's still valuable and it's still something that you have to pay very close attention to it so I want I want to be clear that you are going to look at that

[02:19:00]
but it has to have those at the very basic granular level it has to have that and also it shouldn't be more than one to five pages so it should be a minimum of one they're usually two but it shouldn't be any more than five because we don't want y'all to get inundated with information we want you to get clear and concise information that you understand we part of your job is to get out of the weeds then it's part of the monitoring reports job to not give you a bunch of information that you're going to ask more questions about and need more clarification about I had a when I was getting my Master's Degree I had a teacher she was actually my strategy teacher and she said any idiot can write a 10-page report about business strategy it takes a really special person to write one page about what the strategy of a business is and that's the that's the

[02:20:00]
it's going to take a little bit of time because you have to start monitoring for real I mean don't we kind of have to go back to the previous one I'm looking at

[02:21:00]
previous one with monitoring and accountability I mean actually know you don't know I thought you were talking about the red the red color it's just like do we have to this can just be it doesn't have to have anything to do with that part okay answer my question so you're not going to start really tracking your time until you start until you have until you have your like first monitoring your uncle's this could include the the monitoring toward the plan those practice sessions that you're going to have I would caution you to not not set that as the expectation I would say maybe the end of next year at the earliest so December 23rd at the very soon as that gives you two full quarters to get really good at monitoring and to

[02:22:00]
December 23rd to to hit Master to get to the red or yellow sorry go ahead Josefina you know me I want to do things I would say may of 2024 calendar with Fidelity and you're going to be tracking your time it doesn't it doesn't have anything to do with the amount of time that you spend on each one it's just that you're tracking it

[02:23:00]
on our way in that regard I think with consent items but I start coming down you know down the list and that's a whole other I think it's just us tracking our time in those things that we're committing that by December 23rd using the consent the consent agenda with the deli but that we're all so tracking our time by the end of December that we just are also doing that with Fidelity and then the other question I have is or we need clarification when we talked about the board has not adopted goals while I mean we just finished talking about our own goals

[02:24:00]
are we talking about the district goals and guardrails or are we talking about our so these are just the goals so this question isn't asking about smart goals it's not asking about any of that it's just do you have goals so just I think this one is very very clear like something that you'll be able to get to in a reasonable amount of time going this is also where we may see some Divergence between what's yellow and green what y'all are able to achieve in that time frame you know one thing that we don't have I'm not sure that we have a format that we figure it out for the community engagement if we do that

[02:25:00]
what is the question of we've never had a two-way unless there's a formal presenter I mean that's that's the exception and sometimes they are community members most of the time their staff yeah so this would be very much like going so going back out into the community like you did this fall but making that a regular habit where you go out and pairs you're going to have another opportunity to do this and let's see what is when is your next for to run for school board August so you want to have your next one at the very latest by July and that's and that will be used to run again if you're going to run again you shouldn't be you should be part of it because you want to avoid any kind of Optics

[02:26:00]
the idea is to go out into the community and talk about soon outcomes Focus governance and to do a training on student outcomes focused governance for people before they ever sign up to run for the school board and it has been transformative for the school districts that are doing this and I can send you some information some really good examples of boards that have done this and even where it's just creating the expectation of what you're getting and getting yourself into when you put your name on the ballot what your signing up to do I have never put my name on the ballot if I was getting into your future

[02:27:00]
who could be on the board it's fair to let them know what they're signing up for its it should be the expectation all right can we just go back still cuz I still just it's still not clear in my head so when we go back to the monitoring and accountability it says that we've adopted him on the train calendar that we're receiving monitoring reports in accordance with the calendar and we said we wouldn't probably do that till maybe September of 24th the use of time but on their we have you know gold monitoring guard rail monitoring so if we're saying on the previous page with monitoring that we're not going to do this until September or have to do it until that time we made do it obviously before that time so but then we're saying we can do this by December 2023

[02:28:00]
so can you just explain to me some of these we can do I understand some of them we can do but so just because you're not going to hit these get the points on this on this one doesn't mean you don't start doing the work like you're not going to wait until you're not going to wait until September 24th to adopt your monitoring calendar that should be coming up pretty soon generally the as soon as you know what the interims are and it may take a little bit longer to because the district has to know so they they need to actually look at them and say okay when do we get this data when do we get this data and they need to do some alignment just on the dates there and make sure it's calendared out but the way I understand it they have a lot of that information so I would think that you should you should definitely have a monitoring calendar by the end of the school year if not sooner

[02:29:00]
with the caveat that I'm not your superintendent and I can't put words in his mouth but based on the conversation that was had I think that that is realistic and it really does it doesn't take a lot like all of the strategy conversation like they don't need to do all of the strategic planning to know that they just need to know what the terms are when when those snapshots are taken and then when they can share that information back with the board after or how soon after that snapshot is taking that they can share it back with the board and a lot of them are going to be pretty soon like so if like for the reading goal example if one of the interims was I ready or iStation but this is like one of those technology like things that the kids do on the iPads all of that is automatically uploaded like that is captured

[02:30:00]
that can pretty much be reported like they can they can do the analysis of that pretty soon and report it out fairly quickly after but there are other things like your benchmarks or your like do you have short cycle assessments that are given like twice a year or the math test those are given during very specific times of the year and then maybe not necessarily immediately available so it takes a little bit of time and Analysis to do that so they have to think about that kind of stuff but they should know or at least have an idea of what that'll look like would you like to do is it helpful

[02:31:00]
all right ready to go on to the green okay there are no more than four board authorized public meetings per month and none last more than 3 hours of a board authorized public meeting your board authorized public meetings are going to be any meeting that is called by the board or committee called by the board so it's not going to count your executive session executive sessions are taking out of that time depending on if it is if it's required by law public comment won't be included in that time if it's not required but you still have it then then we

[02:32:00]
do include it but if it's not then orbit is required then we take it out so those are two things an hour so your board authorized so your committee meetings all of your committees are authorized by the board those are meetings that so even if it's a meeting call by the committee called by the board chair the committee exists to advance the work of the board so as many times as the committee meets those are those are minutes counted for board authorized public meetings the things that are not counted are going to be like legally required hearing like if you have a budget hearing or a student discipline hearing or grievance hearing those are going to be taking off executive sessions are taking off anything like if you have to go to a city council meeting that and a question

[02:33:00]
play board members are going to the city council meeting anyway generally that something that your Administration should do but if for whatever reason that's their meeting not yours so those kinds of things would not be board authorized public meetings but the things that the board that the board or delegates of the board are doing that the board controls are board authorized public meetings going to be hard to get down to just two for us but I mean but then I mean if we are mandated to have a Finance in an audit so you take those off because we don't have any control over that is that and you mean so those are for both of those do they meet there are they Committees of a hole and they meet right before the board so I'll need

[02:34:00]
get a little bit of clarification on that because it's not that is not a common situation but I think that that may that may be counted as one meeting or something special required yeah it's a we do all the the whole host the meeting great chair who gets this like all the stuff when we get questions and then we just have Boom the consent but we do it in a special yeah so and then the audit basically we have to meet like Court I think its quarterly right so we have to do that and any other one we usually just do it like right attached to the finance cuz it'll take like five minutes yeah so but it's still I mean you would still go with that if we have audit which we usually have audit and then we'll have finance and then we'll have a special we could have three are those going to be counted as three even though we do them

[02:35:00]
I don't have an exact answer for you I think that they can be counted as one and because they're legally required to happen I just I need to get a little bit of clarification from somebody above my pay grade for something that we can talk about that and it is it is such an uncommon situation that I think we can probably figure that out okay yeah because this isn't the point of this work is not to it's not to like hold you back from doing anything so we'll be clear about that all right the next the board schedule is no more than five topics for discussion during any one Ford authorized public meeting so this isn't mean you're consent calendar this doesn't mean like there are things but what are you talking about what are you discussing in the meetings so

[02:36:00]
if you're going to have a report if you're going to have a budget report if you're going to be monitoring three of your interim guardrails then that's four things if you're going to do three guardrails and and an interim and a goal or an interim goal then that's five things so you can't do any more than that so it's a matter of again going back to how are you spending your time what are the priorities that you're that you're telling the community you have the board limits adoption of board policies regarding school system operations to matters that are one required by law or two and appropriate exercise of the boards oversight Authority as defined by the boards adopted goals and or guard rails existing policies that do not meet one of these criteria have been removed from the board's policy manual though the superintendent May retain

[02:37:00]
as administrative policy or regulation so this is the point of the whole policy diet you have goal policies you have guardrail policies you have governing policies that are required by law and then everything else gets delegated to the superintendent a really good example of this in a district that has that has done a really great job is Des Moines Iowa Des Moines Public Schools there are an early adopter of sosg so they just they actually just completely so they've gone through one entire cycle and they completed their policy diet they went from 1,000 page policy manual to a 20-page policy manual and when they now when they go back and re-evaluate their policies which they just did it took it took like three months for them to go through and

[02:38:00]
do the entire policy diet but then they came back and when they had to reevaluate it cuz you should do it over the term of the length of a board members time in office so for them it was 4 years they were able to evaluate all of their policies in one board meeting the majority of those policies that they have are specific to the board like board operating procedures to the boards regularly scheduled meeting agenda during the meeting and during the three business days before the meeting unless the state of emergency was required declared so that means that

[02:39:00]
and anything pulled from the consent agenda gets pulled at least 3 days before not during the meeting and that's that's the best practice that's the way that it really should be because then you're setting very clear expectations for the community these are the things that we're going to discuss and you're also setting clear expectations for your staff about these are the things that we're going to discuss so if it's on the consent calendar then you know if there's a if there's not a discussion about Finance or whatever they don't need to be here you're only like the people who are here in the room are the people who have to be and you're not spending all that money on having all of these additional staff here and you're not burning your staff out which I think they were really

[02:40:00]
did lots of times the question will generate a new question because there's information that we just didn't know and when we get that information and so how do Within These time frames how are districts finding ways of doing that follow-up question yeah so generally are our coaching is to that the board should have their agenda 2 weeks in advance it takes time to get there it takes some time to get there that can't be expected I hope so the so the agenda the board should get the agenda at least two weeks in advance that means that the board has has a full week to submit

[02:41:00]
and then all of those questions are submitted a week in advance then all of those questions and answers are sent to all of the board members so everyone has the same information and then you can ask any follow-up questions that you have and then on the 7th 72 our window here so 72 hours is the Friday before everything gets posted on the website and its static at that point everything that is on the consent calendar stays on the consent calendar everything that is a discussion items a discussion item you still have the discussion but you can ask all those questions and you can even about the consent items you can ask all the questions that you want in that time frame so you're being fair to your staff you're creating creating realistic expectations for your staff you're giving them time to do their jobs and then your posting it for

[02:42:00]
I want to say it took us like 4 or 5 months to get there cuz it took a lot of really really like deliberate work to get there and we had to create the conditions for that to happen and so it wasn't like right away five months it was at the point where enough of the conditions have been created for the for the superintendents to start working on with his staff and with the word president that was really clear really I need your questions we need your questions and it did take a little bit of babysitting special for me cuz I'm special

[02:43:00]
I don't have to call the rules but it's it's it takes work and that's that's the point is it takes time to get there but it is possible if my board could have gotten there that I believe it is possible for anybody because I think that's like the only thing we did so is it helpful right so even though we might not going to but we still according to the Rules of Order and it's Robert's Rules

[02:44:00]
did you know that but I like to get to know my 100 Roberts doesn't go away but if it if it does happen it just doesn't like your bored just isn't in compliance with that and it should just be like me who would want to pull it because the Rules of Order say so and then I punish everybody else then cuz they don't get points either yeah then you have to deal with them no be nice all right what do you think is possible yellow is December of 23 what is possible for green that has all the

[02:45:00]
so it seems like we could get through that at the end of the by the end of the school year I say school years I'm living in school years by met of 24 and so I would like to go through the policy diet process with you all the summer even if it doesn't mean all of the policies get eliminated or or shut eliminated the heavy lifting or the the easiest ones and then the rest can take place but at least starting to do the work show up until now we've played a pretty major role in discussing the procedural directive part and so I'm wondering if other districts have really let go of the procedural directive and just left

[02:46:00]
really and truly for the superintendent yeah so I'm going to be very direct on this one I don't know another District that adopts procedural directives that is not right it is very very clearly the job of the superintendent it's the they're called administrative regulations in most districts are in a lot of districts procedural directors is not it's not the first time I've heard that term but it is very clear that those are so the board adopts policy and then the superintendent says this is how I'm going to implement the policy that's what the procedural directives are and so it's this is how the superintendent is selecting inputs and that's again that job belongs to superintendent

[02:47:00]
I don't know but it also freezes up our time when I'm thinking about conversations we we end up going down to Rabbit Hole sometimes on a procedural directive that we don't need to and it's a long conversation that we don't need to have so and it takes away from that 50% that we should be trying to achieve and I honestly haven't watched any of your policy committee meetings so I don't I mean I have them I just haven't had the time to go through and observe them and get coaching on them but that's that is one of the things that I have gotten questions about and it is like unquestionably that belongs to the superintendent and any any conversation about the procedural directives is it gets into really murky water when you start to get in it

[02:48:00]
you can really get close to like you can ask questions about what is the plan what is this but the line is very very thin of what is the Ward's role and what is the superintendent's role and the board and seeking understanding and giving direction and even asking a question of well when are you going to do this or when are you going to put this into a procedural directive that can be perceived as telling the superintendent what to do so the intention I mean the overarching vision is what's in the policy that is what we have I'm just curious from the superintendent point of view do you say this is making your life easier or more difficult you say this year old directive entirely to you

[02:49:00]
easier okay it's just different but it would give you more time in your meetings to focus on other things I was thinking about the last six years that I've been on this we have spent way too much time on that so it's just it's always been done and so we think we keep doing it I always kind of wondered well this is nothing to do with us the policy does but since we've always done it and that's that's the way that a lot of things happen and education to create is transformation you have to you have to create a space for that transformation to occur and you can't do that when it's full of the status quo when it's always been done the way that the way that things just are and I mean that's not one of our duties

[02:50:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:51:00]
three topics for discussion during any board authorized public meeting the board has adopted few enough policies that the board as a whole is able to review every policy at least once during every length of time equal to the board members term of office the board received the final version of materials to be voted on at least seven calendar days before the board authorized public meeting and during which the materials would be considered the board used a process that included students parents staff and community members in a way that led to that led them to express ownership of the adopted goals and guardrails December of 24th September 24th

[02:52:00]
authorized public meetings that last no more than 2 hours cuz that would assume that we could do even finances part of just a regular board meeting which would be awesome but I think we could I think we're almost there and not have to do it as part of a separate meeting or special it could be part of the regular meeting because it's all consent on there and the way the way a lot of words will do this is they'll actually change the structure of their board meeting which does Take Years they'll have a business meeting one day and then a workshop the next so like a work meeting or work session the next meeting of the month so only one meeting thank you for us you're good thank you all of all of the work stuff all the work sessions so

[02:53:00]
concessions all of that happens in a in one meeting and then the business your consent calendar your monitoring reports all of that can happen in another one or other way around consent calendar and one and then your monitoring reports and discussions and other it's well I wonder if we could get it by September 24th because the court responding side is the monitoring it kind of goes along with what our monitoring calendar looks like and we said we could do that by September 24th so I'm curious did your board accomplish that no no no but but

[02:54:00]
so we basically got to on this one to know more than four and honestly like it's hard it takes a lot of work to get there it does take a lot of work to get to this blue on this one and that's why it's it's only five like five additional points because it is it is kind of a stretch it is possible I have seen it Des Moines is one of those boards if you don't have any interaction with her she's one of my colleagues at the great City school she actually used to be the board president in Des Moines and she leads this work now for the council because she was an Exemplar and getting it she knows how to get it done so it is possible

[02:55:00]
edit it is more possible if everything else Falls in line it is usually the last thing that falls into place for boards so it'd be really interested in hearing how they accomplish the last item the process that included students parents staff I mean the other thing we have to have an answer to and I know you're going to get it is it no more than two bored authorized not authorized by Statute or whatever yeah so that would make a difference anyhow I said set a goal of like December 24th I mean and it's like I don't know that it will be met but it's not bad to have a goal yeah and see if it's possible but it makes me feel better when you

[02:56:00]
say things like it's a tough one to master in a tough one to go to it's no it's no harm in setting a goal towards it and then just sort of restructuring like we didn't meet it but here's here's how close we are so I would say December of 24th okay how about I don't know that's me just saying it right so let's say that's a stretch goal the other thing is here or next year but yeah we're giving time for our goals we have till 2028 I mean I'm just going we don't have anywhere near I mean this is like

[02:57:00]
and you have to create the conditions for all of these things to become true so if you don't do your work he can't do his work and the people who work for him can't do their work and so it's less likely to completely meet all of your goals of all of these things aren't done it's not impossible but I and this is why I'm trying to give you like a very I'm trying to set very clear expectations be very realistic and not saying something I have absolute Faith they can get done period they're going to take work

[02:58:00]
they're not easy this work is not easy it is going to be difficult I also have the utmost faith that this group of humans can make it happen thank you for having such thing as you have a question and then we're going to do an introduction to progress monitoring we're not going to get we probably won't get to the progress monitoring okay if we happen to get through this really fast it's just trying to get sort of like to process I need a I need a ladies so can we take just five minutes right now or 5 or 10:00 yep okay

[02:59:00]
and we'll get through the we'll get through these last few pretty fast okay and then I can't do it anymore

I appreciate that you take breaks did you say somewhere closer this time I'm at the Embassy Suites on Las Palmas Way I Live down that way where are you Embassy Suites

[03:12:00]
okay we're good all right so we are back and we will resume our conversation I think we're moving on to the next section right on unity and trustee and trust it sounds like we're getting into the fun work oh God okay going back to the red section goals in the board has not stopped not adopted policies that establish word operating procedures any board member voted on an item on which they had a conflict of interest as defined by law during the previous three months period so to be clear this is what the law says not what policy says that's a different that's a different down the road a little bit board member formed by the super

[03:13:00]
or staff without approval of the superintendent and a majority of the board and I can the first where are you and then I can where are you on this one and then we can or I can talk about any of them and then go on and then you can identify well I think we have we have policies that established are operating procedure they're not slimmed down but we have those it's mostly I haven't met a board that doesn't have them but I hear that they do exist and I'm pretty sure nobody has broken the law and we're serving on committee that we agreed on I mean that we brought before us and said will serve on these committees

[03:14:00]
there are they're always going to be so it's common it's not always it's common for board members to serve on committees and for that they shouldn't necessarily be on and then the superintendent just says okay yeah it's a there's a power differential differential and it's hard for the for the superintendent say I'd really prefer if you don't serve on this it's really a kind of Crossing boundary so I will give you some examples of so and then the next I think the it's either the next one or the one after that so board member should not serve on administrative committees

[03:15:00]
so these are committees that select input so if the committee is deciding you know like I don't know what's a common one what's one that I've served on in the past I will give you a great example of my own behavior that needed to change so what I was on the on the school board we actually established a committee and that was a racial Equity committee and so we pulled in all a bunch of people from the community and required that the district have have staff members there and that several of us board members were on the committee and we all talked about things that for the racial Equity policy that was going to be created and it was to make sure that the policy that we were adopting

[03:16:00]
honored multiple perspectives the Fort Worth is a big a big city with a lot of different people in it it takes a lot of people different types of people to make the world spent we wanted to make sure that as many of those perspectives were heard and so we ensure that that was the case by making sure that board members serve on that committee that committee so up until the point where that committee made a recommendation to the board about what that policy needed to look like we were in compliant because we were getting advice about what the board was supposed to do we didn't stop the committee after the board adopted the policy we continue to have that committee because it was well attended lots of people were engaged and they wanted to continue the work what should have happened is that the administration could have decided

[03:17:00]
to to continue the committee as an administrative committee were they get community feedback where they get that Community voice and where they hear that and then it becomes them getting an advisory committee for the district and things that the district does that's not the way it worked what happened is board members continue to serve on that committee the community continue to serve on the committee and we no longer told the board gave the board advice on what needed to happen we started to tell the staff what input they need to pick and that was inappropriate and I did that for like three years that was inappropriate and the part that was inappropriate about it was that the committee transitioned in an advisory capacity to the staff and by Ward members being on that committee

[03:18:00]
we were we made it difficult for the staff members to say no to the committee we made it difficult for them to say you know what this isn't aligned with our strategy for improving student outcomes this isn't aligned with the things that we that we have to do to be accountable for our jobs we were taking that accountability out of the hands of the administration out of the hands of the people who are doing the work and even though we were all very I like to think that we didn't cause any damage we did create a very uncomfortable situation for those staff members for our director of equity and excellence and we like dominated the conversation for the most part it was board members telling staff how to do their jobs when you when board members start to tell the staff how to do their job

[03:19:00]
you're taking away their accountability even if even though like one of so actually you know I served on a presidential committee like the big president the US president that that worked on the stuff I was really active with the Council of great City schools and and Equity matters I considered myself an expert I had another colleague who was a juvenile juvenile probation officer who had received a plethora of training around restorative practices and equity in the in the criminal justice system for juveniles and all the different things and he was a certified facilitator for courageous conver

[03:20:00]
public education Equity initiatives even though we had that expertise it was still not appropriate for us to be because we were not the people in the district who were being held accountable for making those decisions and by us taking those decisions out of their hands and making it more difficult for them to say this is this is the work that we support this is the work that I'm using my professional judgment to implement then we took away our own ability to hold them to hold the district accountable to hold the superintendent accountable for the things that we've valued so it would have been better if we had allowed the either allowed the committee to Sunset and let the administration decide how they wanted to move forward or to just stopped off and so

[03:21:00]
that's the reason that this that this exists it's not about taking something away from the board it's about maintaining that line of accountability so I think I might have an example for APS and so I sit on the calendar committee and that very much feels like more of an administrative decision and I have already felt like sitting and you sat there too like you feel like well should I wait in because ultimately it's the board that's going to approve the calendar but then you have all of the administration that is disgusting the calendar and so it just really feels like an uncomfortable position to be in so I think maybe that is not a place superintendent where a board member should be sitting on that committee this is what's going on and I feel

[03:22:00]
once we get to the board and so it didn't feel like so I really tried not to say much because my decision later or not at the time no

[03:23:00]
I hereby resign from the calendar committee and when you give that example it makes me think of others so there is the calendar committee you've got curriculum and instruction like the internal curriculum selection committee you've got the shack that's the school school health advisory committee you've got the Athletics committee the student code of conduct committee those are all things that the board has a vote in the board is all they are already have a voice in it and so by board members being on those committees it makes it really really difficult for that like pre-work the for the decisions to be made and then brought forward to the board and it also prevents the board from having really deliberate conversations about those things when they do come up or to be able to ask questions

[03:24:00]
it just it circumvents the entire accountability and decision-making process so I have a question too cuz now I feel like once we get in these topics it reads all these other questions and just for the sake of us being completely open and transparent with each other the one that comes to mind for me and I guess maybe I'm still a little scared from our incident last year was when we had to table the the CBA I was trying to think of the acronym and and knowing too like if you're receiving an actual contribution from the union and you're voting on their agreement how does that tie into like conflict of interest with that that's more of a conflict of interest issues and a committee but do board members

[03:25:00]
members in those negotiations okay so that's that's a that's a little bit different and I guess it's not a negotiations but it's more in the direct contact with president when I'll just speak for myself I've never even met her I've never had a single conversation a text zero and and to know that that's not always the relationship across or you know even when we talked about contributions yet we make a decision on their agreement does that go into it being a conflict of interest because again now that I'm reading through I'm just it's Sparks so without having a knowledge of the conflict of interest laws for the state of New Mexico so in Texas there are conflict of interest laws but there are really loose so conflict of interest is it's not necessarily when there's a friendship or when there's a

[03:26:00]
and an exchange of money and so very specifically an exchange of financial benefit for personal gain that does not so that usually doesn't include Financial like campaign contributions some states do require it Texas isn't one but I don't know enough about the New Mexico's conflict of interest policy but if it is so going into the next section that does we can actually have this conversation a little bit more but just for the rat like for what the state law requires that would not be part of the legal conflict of interest so no breaking the law like the actual law unless there is some kind of unless the state of New Mexico has a law that is very specific about campaign contributions which I would be surprised if they do because they don't

[03:27:00]
disclosure and since I feel like this is very much targeted very much targeted comma I think the the issue is so then if you receive a contribution from the developers Organization for the Chamber of Commerce should that exclude you from being able to vote on Capitol issues so I mean I think that the issue is that everyone on this board comes with certain perspectives and certain just experienced is and and ties and so as long as there are any kind of political contribution if we don't go to public financing which is something that some states have done to address this it is always going to come up yeah so

[03:28:00]
let's let's finish with the red section and then and then continue this conversation cuz I do want to create space for this conversation to happen cuz I think it needs to happen but let's let's discuss the let's finish the red and then we can we can go and get into it with with the yellow because I've got some pretty clear Direction on this so where you staying on the red where you at right now since I just resigned from the calendar committee we're good we're getting there so I think that this can really get cleaned up when you all do the committee diet process and this is usually a pretty easy thing to slash and burn it's usually a lot easier to get rid of these committees than it is the ones that are like really beholden to us so have you looked at

[03:29:00]
all the Committees were serving on now to know if they may or may not be necessary so I've saved I have downloaded that list I just haven't because you'll just voted on that like last month right yeah so I just haven't I haven't gone through and and actually looked at it deep enough to provide coaching around it but also with the understanding that we're probably going to go through this pretty soon and the coaching will come but I can I can't expect that process for you so do you think we could take this get out of the red by the end of the year oh yeah okay so let's let's call this one June cuz that's the end of the next quarter of the meeting

[03:30:00]
and Danielle to resign from Shack go ahead go ahead Josefina so I have a question about you know I'm still we got rid of the capital Outlets a lot of questions about some very important work that was done by the previous fourth president of buildings and environments on children's learning

[03:31:00]
and I'm not saying that that was the focus of the committee always but but we are dealing with yeah so how do we align the the the the the goal or the goals that we have with that aspect of running the district but to another Point Barbara and I both I serve as an alternative to cancel for APS to be on there but I don't know how to square it with what we're talking about period

[03:32:00]
there are intergovernmental bodies of elected officials so when we are on there when is the ABC Community School partnership that there's a joint Powers agreement and within the bylaws in bylaws that we've accepted it is made up of electives along with other people same thing with the middle Rio Grande Council of governments the Albuquerque I always get the only County plus APS partnership where it's selected yeah that are on that I mean I see those is really different because it is elected those are different so if it if it is a committee that is made up of elected officials so it's like you're County Commissioners your city council member school board members Hospital trustees whatever whoever

[03:33:00]
your elected officials for your local municipality you should have representation on those it's just important to have guidelines around that so understanding that when you go there you're going there with a shared with it as as the representative of the board of the board so you're speaking on behalf of the board not as an individual and the board has the board should probably adopt some kind of like like a shared Mission around that work but probably be good to have some kind of report what we do is with Mr Cog is we are texting back and forth with the administrative folks that are responsible so we're not speaking out of just personal whatever's it's always in relationship to the information that

[03:34:00]
the the capital folks are sending to us yeah so and that's the thing is making sure that the voice that you go with is very like it's reflective of the vision of values of the community you reflect making sure that it is reflective of the vision of the board as a whole and that it's not it's not going to be in opposition with anything that you all do so I would and we will so when we do the committee diet we can talk about this in a lot more detail and we can have some conversations even one on one so that I can get a little bit more context around them and provide some better coaching but but the idea is always going to so always start with the question who who is the most who's presents is going to be the most beneficial for students on this committee who is required to be on this committee

[03:35:00]
so if it's specific to elected officials it should be it should be elected officials if it's something like your if you don't know if your city has like an Arts Council of Albuquerque or something like that usually it's going to be your like it should it's more appropriate to be your to have your director of Fine Arts or assistant I don't whatever your title is for that human in your system they're the ones that are going to be able to go and speak most intelligently most informed about the work that the district is doing so they are probably the better person to be on there for kids and they're probably going to be so difficult conversations in there but I just not having as much contacts right now I can't say it like these are all the communities that you should reorganize but just thinking like using those is kind of your guiding

[03:36:00]
all right let's move to Yellow attendance at all regularly scheduled board meetings was over 80% during the previous 3 month period so that's making sure that you're here that you're that you are showing up to do the work that you've allowed the people who elected you to be here to expect to the degree that you have allowed them to expect it the board has adopted a policy or procedure requiring that information provided by the superintendent to one board member is provided to all board members this is insurance that you were all informed about matters that go before you the Board review is all policies governing board operating procedures at least once during every link of time equal to a board members term of office you'll notice this one is in the yellow where is

[03:37:00]
previous one had those later in the green in the blue are very specific policies that govern how you operate as a board and so it's if you're if you're going to really Embrace this unity and Trust then that this is something that you'll really need to do is focus on reviewing those board operating procedures to make sure that they still work for you and the board has adopted an ethics and conflict of interest statement and all board members have signed to the statement during their current term of office now this is going back to the conversation we just started and I can speak very well not this one because I have been through this one so when you're bored so you got your state like what state law says you have to do

[03:38:00]
and be more specific about what the expectations are that you have for each other around conflicts of interest this could pertain to campaign contributions it could pertain to family relationships usually the state has like a third or fourth degree of Consignment Duty I can never say that word relationship you can be even more specific than that if you want or maybe it's state requires first or second you can go beyond that to 344 do you are you going to vote on your niece's salary are you going to vote on your contract where your brother-in-law is is the vendor what do you what are the expectations that you have for each other to be clear whatever the expectations are for one of you everybody has to follow so if you say

[03:39:00]
we're not going to anybody who who has received a campaign contribution from any vendor or anyone who does work with the district then nobody receives campaign contributions from somebody that does work with the district you may also choose to set a limit on that anyone who is a vendor or has a relationship like a business relationship with the district maybe it's a dollar amount so I've seen I was part of a board that adopted a conflict of interest statement that required any gifts over the amount of $50

[03:40:00]
clear that what the expectation is for one person has to be the expectation for all people and that you be very clear about what the expectations around the degree of conflict I I am the person who believes that no no like there should not be any kind of financial relationship campaign contribution of any dollar amount I'm usually out of that it's a matter of what you as a board agree on and you have to have a very deliberate conversation about it and it has to be grounded and what is going to lead to the best decisions for kids and what's going to lead to how you can be objective and these things so you know it is very common for board members to get

[03:41:00]
campaign contributions from their teachers unions it's very common for board members to get campaign contributions from Realtors from construction Builders from developers all of these things have happened they've been around public education they've been around school boards for as long as school boards have been elected if I'm not here to tell you what is appropriate I'm here to tell you that you have to figure out what works for you and whatever you figure it out put it on paper and make it very clear and everybody about to it whether you vote for it or not whatever the majority is is the world that's a difficult one in a large districts as I'm sure you know like you would have to ask everybody well have you ever had or do you have a contract or may you have a contract with APS and nuts that's a hard one yeah so you have you already

[03:42:00]
have to have a so anybody who gives a contribution has to give you a disclosure that says I'm you know I'm a US citizen and I you know I'm 18 years or older and all of those things that it can be as a matter of adding a box to those disclosures because there are things that your campaign creates but it's a matter of doing it and you have the responsibility to do it if you choose not to do it and you still have a violation and then you're accepting the consequences of that and that's speaking of consequences that's the other thing if you're going to have a really stringent conflict of interest policy what is the consequence if that is violated you're not breaking the law you're breaking policy you're violating policy but you're not breaking the law so

[03:43:00]
what does that mean you get censored if you get censured what does that mean does that mean that you just get a slap on the wrist I got centered as a board member is it on video oh yes it's very public I made sure it was a very public process I did not violate a conflict of interest by the way but it means you get a slap on the wrist and then you just go on your Merry way or does it mean that you lose committee assignments does it mean that you lose privileges that are like there are some some districts in a district that had a very very rigorous policy that says they lose all privileges that they are not allowed by law

[03:44:00]
so basically you get to come to the board meeting and vote you get reimbursed for stuff that you like your mileage but you don't get to do travel you don't get to serve on committees and all of that stuff lasts until the board either you get reelected or the board votes to remove your censure so again what works for your bored and what are if you're going to have if you're going to have a very rigorous policy what are the consequences I just want to add you know some of us I mean APS is what the third are we the third largest employer third or fourth and so and I signed this or wrote to send last year when I came

[03:45:00]
where is that conflict of interest does that mean that I can't vote on the negotiated agreement because I have teachers in my family or administrators to be a very deliberate conversation and you do need to ask all of those questions so it's important that when the conversation comes that you plant that you let let everyone know that it's coming and that they have the opportunity to plan for those conversations and they have the opportunity to develop those questions because you have a lot of unintended consequences

[03:46:00]
and here's what I think those conversations are important because ultimately as a board we want to be able to respect differing opinions but for me I'll just wait for myself I want to be able to know I can trust everybody like that's high on my list and I'm okay if people think differently if they have a whole different like that's the beauty of all this for me I just want to know that what the person I'm dealing with is the person I can trust I can take it at face value I can trust your word I don't have to feel like anything's happening undermined behind the scenes and I think because of the role that we hold like we should be able to carry ourselves with the utmost integrity and ensure that we're just doing the right thing you know and trust is a big one for me

[03:47:00]
I think that's just how I've always operated I hate to be lied to you know and my kids will tell you like that's game over you know but for us as a board I love that we think differently I love that we have different backgrounds and experiences and the ability to voice our our minds like we have no problem sharing but I want to know that we can trust and I think once we have that fully established because I don't think we're there quite yet and that's always done with time my goodness like will move mountains like our district can be absolutely phenomenal but we have to make sure our foundation as 7 board members is solid in this conversation it may be worth it to establish

[03:48:00]
whether it be a board operating policy or self guardrail board guard rail around what happens when there is conflict do you do mediation do you do you as a board come together and have a conversation about it because this is this is what it all boils down to can we if you can't come together and make decisions in a respectful way then it that is going to undermine all of this work and I and really it doesn't this isn't a conversation about political ideology this is a conversation about supporting the teachers union not supporting the teachers union supporting you know Economic Development not supporting Economic Development this is this is a conversation about just very basic human dignity and the way that because you cannot operate as an effective

[03:49:00]
if you are not just able to come to the come to the Dias and have conversations about what is the best interest for kids if if you can't speak with cander so this is I'm going to stop being Mom and yeah but it's real I just want to add that so I went to college with Ellen Bernstein she and I were in college together took the same horses together I met her when I was 18 years old and we were both in the education department together so I've known for a very very very very very long time we share a common friend so I mean we just have this dear dear friend that

[03:50:00]
we both loved very much and have helped through a really incredible crisis so when I think of Ellen I don't necessarily think of her as the president of the teachers union I'm not afraid to have a conversation with Ellen about the teachers union because I think I also want to know you know where things are we have differed and I think it's healthy it's a healthy conversation and that's important I don't believe I have a conflict of interest because I've known Ellen for that long or that we've had these conversations and banter I will say about where things are I was also married to a teacher who was a member of the Union it was a staunch supporter of the union and so his his voice resonates in my head a lot and so when I'm thinking about things I'm also thinking about

[03:51:00]
got it from the standpoint of family members who are members of the union and what it means to them and how important it is so I don't believe there is a conflict of interest when I think of the union or when I'm thinking about the CBA or when I'm cuz I I I have sat on this diet and I've had a conversation right here in the Dias where I disagreed with Ellen on some issues and she knows that but it's a very healthy conversation and I believe that we have to have a very healthy relationship with the Union in order to be productive and so I just want to state that firmly because I feel like the conversation here went straight to the teachers union and I don't want that to be I don't want that to be the intention and to somehow feel that there's a conflict simply because I also have happened to have had a relationship with her for quite some time

[03:52:00]
and that's all I will say there but there is a lot of things that I can I can politely disagree with her with she can politely disagree with me but it's a healthy conversation and it's helped me tremendously I think as a board member to also understand the importance of the union and the significance of of the other things that we need to do on the administration side and really also I feel that my role as as an elected as a to serve and to also represent individuals who happen to be members of the Union I mean they just happened to be members of the union we need them there are teachers that are staff and so I will I will always continue to have that relationship I have a very healthy relationship also with all of our trade unions because that just happened to be my work when I was with the Department of Workforce Solutions and the trade unions are

[03:53:00]
you are incredible groups of people my father was a long time Union wrap himself so I've had conversations with union bosses too on things around education that I agree and I disagree with them on around how apprenticeship can be started or pre-apprenticeship and their relationship with us in schools and as an elected or as a person who was running for office I accepted campaign I accepted campaign contributions from the unions because I knew that they supported a platform that I was I was sharing as part of my peace with the community that I serve I have on this board I actually refused myself from membership on the Mr Cog and I said that I would not be part of Mr Cog because when I was with Workforce Solutions we had a contract with them and I felt that it was just you know there wasn't a

[03:54:00]
conflict with me being on the board but I just didn't even want that perception so so I also like to believe that every individual on this board comes from it from that perspective of a sense of integrity and knowing where that line is drawn and where it gets confusing and I know myself really well and know my Integrity that I would definitely recuse myself if I felt that there was a conflict of interest but I think it's important to just know the groups that were working with whether they're real estate entities or contractors or developers it's really important to know all of those and some of us have better relationships with other groups that been different groups and I don't think it means anything to print we don't promise anything when we run for office anyway but they also have the right to select and to support a candidate that they think is going to be the best candidate for whatever situation that you're running for

[03:55:00]
I think that where we're all going and I know we're in Orange but what we're all kind of talking about is what showing up in the green and so this what where this is going to have to be a conversation that we have as a board and I think that a lot of the language that we're going to have to discuss and potentially put into a conflict of interest statement because the one that we have right now is generic it's completely generic I think it's what the state law requires yeah I mean it's it's so if we want to get our points Peggy we want to get I mean these are very specific sentences I'm very specific paragraphs about what you know Council of great City Schools is looking for a when we discussed student outcome Focus governance and this is language that potentially

[03:56:00]
to be added to our conflict of interest statement so and you know it's we've all accepted campaign contributions and we would all expect that if there was a conflict that we would recuse herself so and then again that's that's in here so maybe that's I don't think we're here yet I don't think we can put a date on it but but the green is is what needs to be included in our in our conflict of interest statement you know the other thing is we are elected by communities and I will speak for myself I have never hidden the fact that I was a teacher for 35 years and I belong to the union for every single one of those years why because I feel like it protected

[03:57:00]
my ability is a teacher to serve the children I taught that it was the best Advocate that there was for working for public schools and I will never back off of that I have friends of 35 years that I talked to and snow I never hit any of that it's straightforward my contributions are right there on the Secretary of State website do I collude do I share information that we have agreed is confidential have I done anything any of those I can say with the totally clear conscience that I have not now if we're going to do this then it means if you are private Daycare owner does it mean that you should stay out of the conversation about

[03:58:00]
preschools and what our role is yes and or do we have something to learn from that child care and what good child care looks like and what we want excuse me I did not know I did not interrupt you know why I bring up the union is because they specifically lied about me they specifically threatened me they specifically slandered me so that maybe that's why I bring up your organization so I want to be clear when I asked these questions were the root cause comes from the board we have been slandered and attacked by many people in many ways and so I can just say all we can do

[03:59:00]
who is represent our beliefs and our conscience the best way we can and we could challenge each other it could become a very easy political how do we how does the maturity censor minority yes so let's take a breath here for just a second because I want to take us back to our mindset and I know that this is been something that has been bubbling up and so it definitely don't want to like squash the dialogue but it is getting a little bit personal so we wanted to get step away from that that said when we talked about the work that you all have to do as a board we are very very specific that I am the Genesis transformation not there

[04:00:00]
I am the Genesis of transformation and this isn't some fluffy like I know it's a little a little bit but it does it doesn't exist just because we like to feel good it's literally for this reason when so in the in the belief that I am the Genesis of transformation I have to start with the assumption that everyone around me is acting inside of their integrity everyone around me is doing what they're supposed to do and when I perceive that someone is out of their integrity or when I perceive that there is not Integrity happening somewhere in the realm of my vicinity I have to make the assumption that the not Integrity starts with me that

[04:01:00]
I'm not saying that that's always going to be the case I'm saying that should be what the Assumption starts with we talked about I think it was Reagan who said trust but verify you have to trust trust that everybody's doing what they're supposed to be doing and then verify that that's the truth if you can't verify then then have a conversation about it you're all here for the same reason we are all here for the same reason this none of us would be here if the community of Albuquerque if the families of Albuquerque weren't sending their kids to school to be educated if they aren't sending their kids to school to get a baseline education so that they can be successful after they graduate the only way that you can that you're going to be able to

[04:02:00]
forward is if you're having these conversations through this so I want to be really careful about pointing fingers about you know everyone here has been burned at some point in their life at some point of their service it is an inevitable part of serving in an elected office you're going to have people that point the finger you're going to have people who don't like you you're going to have people who make accusations all of that is part of the game you have to move forward anyway and if I didn't believe that you all could do that or if I thought that this conversation was one that was going to end what you were going to end to this work then I wouldn't be here today I'll be back in Fort Worth with my kids

[04:03:00]
on that note when can we get to yellow orange orange Review

[04:04:00]
the first one so it's literally I think we're there I agree with you on that stuff

[04:05:00]
we're all asking spots I will tell you that anytime a question if it comes in here like in a meeting like this and you were to say I need information on this and we collect it Johanna has been told and this is Brenda's always you know everybody got it so the only time I would say its individual is when maybe you call me I have a very specific issue with it's a crosswalk something like that yeah and I don't know that's right now I asked him a question about one of my schools or a constituent question that you know needs to

[04:06:00]
come from him being able to get it to the person and I know I'm really good at that like going to go to him so I don't know I think that would be really difficult to do what I tend to do on that is to say here here's a question I don't expect a response back and let them take care of it this like everything is if the board is going to continue to ask individual questions about individuals and all of that which is is common you just need to have some kind of procedure around it so I know some board some superintendents who will actually keep a list of all of the questions that board members asked like Courtney asked me about what's happening in the bathroom first of all why are you asking him that question exactly tell those people to call

[04:07:00]
create some kind of process for people to to be able to ask those questions without having to go to the board that's really really inefficient but board members like to act like to answer those questions cuz then they get to do a favor and then you bought favor and you get to be the hero and all of that stuff but is that is that really helping the person at the end of the day be like get there and question answered most efficiently is it building the relationship on the school on the at the school you know if you've got a bigger issue around well that school is not answering questions at the family has been having a process for their questions to be answered is actually going to help solve that problem if it becomes clear that all of these questions are coming to your area superintendent because

[04:08:00]
why are all these people calling me with these questions why aren't you answering them an accountability conversation happens there but it says some superintendents will say like here's a list of questions that I've been asked today or here's a list of questions that I was asked by board members this week and here are the answers to all of those questions is that the way that the board wants to superintendent in their time one question second question is is that the process that you want to keep in place or do you have a better should you adopt a process that any questions to the superintendent email or like what I don't and I don't know the answer it's you have to figure out what works for you so I think I think

[04:09:00]
had the right approach that when we get questions we send the question to the superintendent but don't necessarily expect an answer that it's just because we hear things you know things come to us people ask us things and it's part of what whether we like it or not it's part of the role that we end up with it's not our responsibility to answer those questions to the constituent and most of the time occasionally I think there may be a difference and then it probably has something that fears into policy that should come to everyone that's on the board but most of the time it's it's employee your school specific it's not ours to handle it goes to the superintendent and he has no responsibilities to reply to us and so some so a lot of districts

[04:10:00]
actually adopt some kind of process let's talk as a as a popular one where it's it's a little table on the website that says have a question about your school ask us and then they click on it and they asked the question and it goes to somebody in the administration and they are able to respond to that person and direct them to the best person to answer that question this is something that I think Atlanta public schools has done a really really good job at this and it's part of training the community to go and use it a big a big one I don't know if you'll have it like a district 504 coordinator I filled it a lot of questions about special education services and my kids teacher isn't isn't responding

[04:11:00]
heading to their 504 plan and they're not getting the accommodations that they need and I need I need you to talk I need to talk to the superintendent now that the school district has a 504 coordinator and part of their job is to answer those questions and that person is actually really really good and she will she will call those people back and say tell me what's going on and then she'll call the principal and say this is happening at your school and it never has to go to a board member and never has to go to the superintendent but she is the person who actually gets to hold them accountable and she because she holds all the like anything related to special education and she makes sure everybody is doing what they're supposed to do is it relates to that and if she gets too many calls about one school then they have a bigger accountability convers

[04:12:00]
and that's the way the System supposed to work is if something's not working there's somebody who handles it and that's the first person to go to so you'll have to figure out what works for you but you know I just have this really like just a standard language is like thank you for your question I've redirected it to the person that's most responsible for taking care of this in the district you know and if you and you know but I highly recommend that you start first with your school principal and all I say thank you bye or your teacher yeah yeah so I can have this conversation and figure it out September December

[04:13:00]
by June what days are we is June yeah when are we doing our policy diet I would like to start this summer so so yeah we're starting this summer and and it seems to me that this is going to be part of that right it doesn't have to wait until the policy diet and if some of these things are roadblocks and they probably should happen sooner rather than later April April

[04:14:00]
but I was using the floor tiles the April to June 10th but do you think we had something else in April that we were going to do that was kind of timely with policy discussion was I know so it would go with our ourself guard rails and then we could do this ethics and conflicts interest statement which is the one that's holding us up okay and do we have to use I mean I'm surprised that this language is in the s o f g so I think before then I think what would be real but I would highly recommend is that we get some individual coaching so Ashley is available for this

[04:15:00]
several examples or things that were looking at so we're not just starting cold and it's not just a cold conversation but it's got some suggested pieces that we do but I would highly recommend that every board member engage in some sort of one-on-one conversation and I'd be willing to enter into conversation you know with another board member of that would be helpful to to sort of like walk through things that I think that might be a good one to is to to go and bears and you know potentially just to sort of like sort of think about your questions and stuff before we get into the meeting at the conflict of interest right that's one and then adopting a policy requiring about the superintendent sharing with all board members

[04:16:00]
I think that would be part of our guard rails too because I think we've got to come up with our board guard rails so I think it's kind of an all-encompassing in that conversation yep sounds like a really good holistic robust conversation around how y'all are working together what are your expectations for each other so if that is the case then does that mean you can get to Green by April too I think that's to be determined I don't think we can say I think there are people I think they're board members that have very much their mindset of what they want to have come out of this and whether that's healthy for our community for our school district for us as a functioning board

[04:17:00]
needs to be seen and I think that's an open conversation I mean I personally I'm looking at the third one in green and how difficult that would have even been for me and how many times I would probably have had to recuse myself when I think about how many contributions I got and it would be I mean I would be accusing myself a lot so I want you to look at the top of these rows and I don't point this out for this part of the conversation until now for this reason these are only one three and five points it's important to know what the best practices are right it's also important to understand that some things are going to be really hard for some boards and this is a process

[04:18:00]
and I mean we just have a lot of people I mean we need everybody we just you know our contractors and Architects and yeah so try your best it's important to understand that it's hard but also drive to the best okay let's look at Blue just to go during the most recent self-evaluation all board members here to all policies governing board operating procedures during the previous evaluation period all board members and the superintendent agreed during the most recent self-evaluation that none of the board members have given operational advice or instructions all board members have memorized all of the boards

[04:19:00]
Kohl's and the current status of each that was always the hardest for me the board conducted a quarterly self-evaluation during the previous three month period or annually if the most recent score was 80 or higher and unanimously voted to adopt the results well we have to wait till we have like a whole cycle these conversations need to happen they're never going to be this long again unless we just need to completely restart but this is this entire process should be a matter of 30 minutes tops moving forward and tops all right let's look at the final section and I will point this out this is another one three and five

[04:20:00]
the board has not conducted a self-evaluation during the previous 12-month period the board has conducted a self-evaluation during the previous 12 months period but it did not vote to adopt the results the board has not participated in a governance team training or Retreat were all members of the governance team were present during the previous 12 months period I just want to make one point of clarification here when you all did it not everybody was present but the board member who wasn't present made she and I met together and over several sessions together and she did make up all of that time so you do get credit for that time and reports monthly the percentage of board authorized public meetings

[04:21:00]
time invested in monitoring the board's goals and interim goals we're going to start tracking time when we when we start monitoring progress even when we start practicing monitoring progress we're going to start practicing tracking time my recommendation is that I work with the board secretary and that become an official role like job of the board secretary and I have and it's not a super complicated thing and we actually have a platform it's a website that you can that will have have a way for her to do that pretty efficiently the board tracks the estimated annual cost of Staff time invested in governance during its annual self-evaluation this includes the time of any staff members invested in preparing for attending and debriefing after meetings this includes all board authorized public

[04:22:00]
as well as all closed sessions and hearings are going to find out how much money you're costing the district will be long meetings I mean especially this last year it has been huge I wouldn't be this is 3 years it would not be out of the norm if y'all are spending $100,000 per month is the lack of time that they have for other things that they need to be doing period what else could they be doing

[04:23:00]
and not even not even what else could they be doing in that time for the district what could be they be doing with their time with their families and not and how could that use of their time be more beneficial for your students you talk a lot about the social and emotional health for students it has to start with your staff if you want them to show up and and provide these this care for students you have to provide it for them to the word we have a way to track it the board has provided time during regularly scheduled board authorized public meetings to recognize the accomplishments of its students and staff regarding Pro

[04:24:00]
best word goal goals and interim goals notices goals and interim goals what what is happening for students what student outcomes all of those recognitions are happening but they're very specific to how people are who are the people that are moving the needle for kids what kids are most moving the needle and finally the most recent board self-evaluation took place no more than 12 months ago using this instrument or research aligned instrument it doesn't have to be this instrument but it should be researched online shopping

[04:25:00]
I'm biased but there's a reason why I do this work full time now okay so for orange yellow orange I was wondering would that be aligned the communication and collaboration and approaching the student outcome Focus where we said December 23rd we would be approaching all that it seems like we could be approaching all of this as well I think so too you guys agree how many points have I given away Crystal have a clarification

[04:26:00]
if if that very last evaluation Point requires having done it 12 months before where does that put us you're doing it right now is that right does this count I was that was my next question

[04:27:00]
approaching for that because it would aligned with the communication and collaboration where it was the consent eligible the goal setting all of those pieces it seems like it's aligned somewhat with that unless I'm missing something it actually looks like you might have this as soon as you start time tracking okay so April yeah ok

[04:28:00]
are you doing the budget because Budget Inn April May and June are budget that's not a good time December on Instagram The Continuous Improvement piece it just requires progress on these specific items I think she's speaking to three so okay so that's not monitoring progress it is like recognizing people who are who are doing the work towards getting there and December makes more sense crossword

[04:29:00]
regarding progress towards goals and interim goals so yeah I think I don't know how much will have by then because this is so I want to be clear this this isn't this doesn't mean that you're actually looking like looking at what they're like what what your what your number is are the like if like students who do really well on the PSAT in December or November like a celebration for them or things like things that are specific to getting like moving the needle towards your goals not you don't have to look at the Hard numbers if you do that's great but leading their CTE or completing their dual credit yeah

[04:30:00]
the most recent board annual self-evaluation took place no more than 45 days before the most recent superintendent evaluation if you are getting ready to do that you're within the within the 45 days the board is hosted and the board members have letter at least one training session on student outcomes Focus governance during the previous 12 months period my recommendation is that before the next start so that way you're with the with potential candidates the board has continuously updated the status and targets of all goals guard rails interim goals guard

[04:31:00]
Boston publicly displays them in the room in which the board most frequently holds regularly scheduled board meetings so you already have this you're already showing your progress towards getting there that's the right now it's yeah right now it's a little progress towards getting there just the process but as you get those numbers and you'll post what your goals are and then is they that I like those targets the most recent self-evaluation and voted to adopt the results so that is like in the you have done the self-evaluation for the most recent order and you have to adopt the results

[04:32:00]
one of the student outcomes Focus governance training sessions during the previous 12 I like that that's awesome I hear you got a pretty awesome group of students that are like rocking it yes prior to being selected all newly elected board members received training on student outcomes Focus governance from fellow board members on their board or from a certified student outcomes Focus governance coach so that means that when we do this at the end of the year before they start filing then I'll be there I'll be right there beside you to help make sure that this gets done and that's my that's why I say let's do it let's do it before so that way you're kind of killing two birds with one stone and then finally the board conducted the most recently recent quarterly self-evaluation or annually if the most recent score was 80 or higher and unanimously adopted to adopt

[04:33:00]
so in all others you voted to adopt them but this one means that you have unanimous agreement that you are at least at 80% any questions we're going to put all this together and in a timeline for your implementation time line would you like to have that so you would adopt it on so I deleted it on the consent calendar would you like to do that at your next meeting or would you like to have a little bit of

[04:34:00]
time to talk about it between now and the next meeting and so put it on the consent calendar for meeting after next so I was thinking would it would it be appropriate just for it cuz we're sort of using the March 1st for a lot of things on sosg so if we could also have this as part of it just as consent but we have it all clarified we could get the timeline together I'll work with Joanne and you together so we can put Chuck out all the dates that we said and time wise that we would meet I think that's after after this conversation I was thinking this meeting calendar but I but that was before this conversation after this conversation I really think that it would be yeah because one of the things that we do have is we just have like a we have a Google doc that is just capturing some information and so questions can go in there it's like this isn't clear I need more information here and then that way that would give Joanna and I time to like confer with you

[04:35:00]
and this is just the timeline on when you're going to have the discussions this isn't having the discussion exactly it's just adopting the final calendar that takes us all the way to the agreement that we had with Council a great City schools and our Consulting the agreement that we have under the contract that we have with them so that we can fulfill that yeah that's what I understand yep okay yeah I think you and I are on the same page I think so too I really really really really really really appreciate you ladies and and the man and the man thank you for your participation tonight and your energy and we appreciate you back all right so the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday February 15th 2023 at 5 p.m. in the John Melanie Community boardroom of the
