vitamins to consider adoption of the November 6th 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda as a reminder for the aps Board of Education governance manual a board member can request that an item be removed from the consent agenda before the meeting agenda is posted but not during the meeting is there a motion in a second for approval of the agenda of the November 6th board meeting agenda this is Crystal I moved for approval of November 6th 2024 Board of Education meeting agenda and I'll second this is board member benavidez thank you we have a motion Romero and a second from Member benavidez and we have a roll call vote please and now let's go yes Ronaldo yes other benefits of America Jacksonville of the minutes from the special Board of Education meeting on October 23rd 2024 is there emotion and the second I'll move for approval for the minutes from the

[00:03:00]
National Board of Education meeting on October 23rd 2024 can we have a roll call vote please don't go you please share the instructions for public forum Welcome to our public forum guess when you signed up to speak you were asked to review rules and expectations which are presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that are agenda specified in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called

[00:04:00]
online guess we'll stay in a virtual waiting room until it's their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum if there are 22 or fewer speakers you will each have two minutes to speak otherwise you will have one minute tonight we have seven speakers once your time is up you'll be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message you may email board Ed at aps.edu in addition for those of you here tonight it representative from our service center is here to assist you Mr Gonzalez please introduce the speakers thank you board member historica our first speaker is Catherine Stern's followed by Mary Walker Herrera you have two minutes once you begin speaking hello board members thank you for allowing me to speak with you tonight my name is Catherine's I'm an employee with APS but I'm here today as a parent and a concerned citizen about the safety of the students on the high school campuses in APS on September 26th my daughter's car was stolen from the Eldorado parking lot it was not stolen by a four

[00:05:00]
you didn't say it was stolen by a stranger who drove onto campus with an accomplice entered the school on foot went into two buildings went into a classroom and stole my daughter's backpack they then drove slowly around the parking lot until they found her car and then they drove off campus and all of this happened around 2:00 p.m. on a school day and at no point was she stopped or questioned the safety precautions that we think are in place at the high schools did not happen that day a security guard did not stop her entering the campus a security guard did not stop her leaving the campus so I would like that address but I would also like to ask you as a board to make it a policy that when something like this happens when there is a breach of security on a campus that the community be informed by the principal the principal at El Dorado has not informed the general population of El Dorado that this happened he's not told the students that this happened he's not told the parents that this happened I think if he did at the time someone could have come forward and said

[00:06:00]
something that they saw but also I would like to help him implement the security measures that aren't being implemented and I think if the community is fully aware of what's going on we'd be more able to do that you as a board and the superintendent have talked a lot this year about how the three of us are working together the parents the schools and the school board but that can't happen if there's not communication happening so I would like for you to make it a board policy that families being formed when breaches of security happen on campuses with an APS thank you thank you man our next speaker is Mary Walker Herrera and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president and school board members and APS superintendent thank you for being here tonight and for the opportunity to speak and for listening I'm an EA and special education in a severe needs classroom in an APS Elementary School my name is

[00:07:00]
Mary Walker Herrera question is there the same driving force in each of us to know who we are and be happy in her book detrans by Mary Margaret olohan that is exactly what she discusses what does detrans mean the word describes a person who has attempted to use surgery or hormonal intervention to change their biology because they believe or want to believe or have been told that they were born in the wrong body and that nothing will make them happy and content until they have rectified that mistake is it possible to think of these people so young lost afraid so heavily burdened without longing to drive their tears and tell them that they need not name themselves in order to live happy and fulfilled lives quote from the author I truly believe that reading and understanding these real lived stories of detransitioners makes it impossible to advocate for such destructive practices particularly for children

[00:08:00]
and that is why I wrote this book unquote every transitioner has a unique story but many of the same fact patterns often though not always include an unhappy childhood or an adolescent's fraud with abuse or loneliness gender dysphoria at a young age discomfort in their own body struggles to make friends signs that they were on the autism spectrum often without the confirmation of a medical diagnosis adults in their lives often on the internet and lgbtq circles and chat rooms who push them towards transition hormones and eventually surgeries and almost always the same driving force the desperate desire to know who they are and to be happy thank you for your time and attention to this evening or next speaker is Alyssa Anaya you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening board members Madam president and Dr

[00:09:00]
my name is Elisa andaya I'm an employee and also a mother and of a high school student goes to Cibola High School I just want to Second what Catherine Stearns said that I feel like we need full disclosure on any kind of security breaches on September 20th there was a shelter in place at Cibola and the information that the families were given was vague at best and researching online what happened that day the the things I read were all the way from it was nothing to there was a shelter in place but they lifted the shelter in place to draw out the criminal that they were looking for and from the from the school it was it was very vague and I feel like we need to have more the families need to have more details information on what is happening when security issues are happening at our high schools thank you

[00:10:00]
Benjamin our next speaker is I believe it's zolom or Zoe lamb Zoe lamb though you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking thank you my name is Zoe lamb and I am a senior at La Cueva high school and the vice president of the democratic party of New Mexico for high schoolers and I'm speaking today on a crucial issue for many of our students future the current submission deadline for grades of the first semester as a child of APs Educators I have witnessed firsthand the dedication and hard work that goes into preparing students for their future however one of the biggest factors that allows students to lose their engagement is not being able to submit or senior year grades as a senior right now I want to submit my grades and I believe that the other students in APS deserve the right to show their fullest application and their best opportunity so that we can compete with other students on a national level

[00:11:00]
I understand that these decisions take time however I have emailed and called offices for months now and I have yet to receive a response at such a critical time like this it is more important now than ever that we give APS students in all students in general the ability to display the best version of themselves currently the deadline is January 20th which is just around five days before the majority of college applications are due and I'm asking you to move back the deadline so it can be before January 15th so that seniors can submit their senior applications so for the future of New Mexico and for the future of APs students I hope that you can consider my proposal and I hope you understand how important this issue is for our students thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Miss Janet Sayers you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:12:00]
good evening board president and Madame superintendent and members of the board I checked the aps policy on the 2-hour delay and asynchronous learning just before I left because we're supposed to have our breakfast treats tomorrow morning so we're either going to have a whole lot of food and nobody there to eat it or we'll just see or else it'll not be snowing at Del Norte but it's snowing at Sea and West Mesa Volcano Vista and so for those of you that have to make that call by 5:30 tomorrow morning whoever you are John otherwise you're very welcome board members to come and be part of our breakfast treats at 8:00 I did want to mention last Saturday Del Norte had the honor of hosting the Duke City

[00:13:00]
drill meet and all 13 high schools were there the ROTC programs there were schools from all over New Mexico Farmington I met some parents from actually that had driven down from Utah and there was a school from actually Arizona that came but you know looking over here at the life skill of of perseverance and self-regulation I saw students that were so proud to be in in drill teams you know the Precision the practice the the effort of coming together and and doing something that really showed commitments and so it was a great experience and there were hundreds of kids it was a beautiful day in fact it was like 80 something degrees and so here we are now in the snow so I just want to give that good report and lastly

[00:14:00]
if you are craving food from Sadie's next Tuesday we've had a over a 10-year partnership with Sadie's and we raise money by you just coming and eating at Sadie's at Academy and and San Mateo and telling them that you're there on behalf of Del Norte so thank you for your time your energy your commitment to the students of Albuquerque thank you and our last speaker is Jesse weakie you'll have two minutes when you begin speaking now good evening my name is Jessie and I am home I work as a community organizer one of my valuable youth members is a senior at La Quinta high school and brought to my attention that is affecting her High School seniors District white the Common App which I'm sure you are all familiar with and most other college applications or do January 15th as it stands are high school teachers are not required to

[00:15:00]
putting our students at a severe disadvantage in order for our students to compete at a national level it is important that this oversight does not go unaddressed as decisions such as these effectively limit the trajectory of our young community members I respectfully ask that you address the discrepancy and a timely manner and consider moving the great submission deadline up by one week so that our brightest students don't have their wings clipped before they're able to show the world with they can do additionally I asked that these deadlines are considered before the school calendar is created for next year thank you for your time and consideration thank you man board members that completes public forum I'd like to thank our public forum guests for sharing with us tonight our next item is to consider approval of the consent agenda which includes item 5.1 and item 5.2 is there a motion in a second I move for approval to accept items 5.1 and 5.2 on the consent agenda

[00:16:00]
can we have a roll call vote please yes our next item is a presentation on the results from the 2024 New Mexico measures of Student Success and achievement our presenters are Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey superintendent doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent for leadership and learning and Thomas C West executive director for the office of accountability in reporting and Miss Sherry Chief academic officer thank you madam president members of the board tonight we will be sharing the results from the 2024 New Mexico measures of Student Success and achievement assessment for grades three through eight this assessment is required by the

[00:17:00]
every student succeeds act and measures Proficiency in English language arts and Mathematics this past spring over 30,000 students of our students were assessed in ela and math overall 38.7 percent of students demonstrate Proficiency in ela last school year and 24.2% were proficient in math both proficiency rates were slightly lower than the your previous notable progress was seen among African-American and economically disadvantaged students with the improvements in both subjects however some groups including Native American students and Pacific Islanders students showed declines in math proficiency these results are used by all schools to shape their 24/25 APS 90 Day plans that are submitted to the state and I turn the meeting over to Dr Gonzalez Mr West who will lead the presentation

[00:18:00]
good evening Madam president members of the board and superintendent Dr Blakey has been shared tonight we are pleased to share with you the most recent summative assessment data from the spring of 2024 administration of mimosa I am pleased to be joined tonight by Chris West our executive director of The Office of accountability and Reporting and our chief academic Mr West leads a team of Highly capable professionals who support the work of teaching and learning on a daily basis and I'm grateful for his team and for the work that he did to prepare for tonight's as you will see tonight there is much work to be done in improving students in the area of the English language arts and Mathematics we must do better with this said we do have a plan and this is good news this planner strategy is the information we share with you monthly in our progress monitoring conversation

[00:19:00]
in addition to this moving forward we will begin presenting monthly updates to the board regarding the work of the Strategic plan I believe these presentations begin next month will Mr West is going to be the main presenter this evening I would like to provide a high-level observation to begin the conversation first tonight you will see how our students did overall based on grade level self-reported race and ethnicity and federal Equity program for example special education L economically disadvantaged you will also get a preview of how we fared based on text types strategies and strands in other words you will hear how we do when it comes to standards and skills this information informs us as we move forward and supporting principals and teachers it also informs the work of our district departments as they support schools based on our newly rolled out

[00:20:00]
secondly in the data we have identified schools that are making games schools like Bellaire Elementary who had double-digit gains in English language arts and John Baker and Dennis Travis Elementary who had double-digit gains in mathematics we can and have learned a great deal from these schools and we must tell their story of improve student outcomes for others to learn from we have promising practices these schools like the Top Model are that can and must be replicated third we know that school we know the schools that are struggling the most are performance framework that we rolled out just recently as I mentioned provides us a framework to better support the schools with increased and targeted support coaching and resources finally data can be a powerful tool

[00:21:00]
play the guide artwork forward we must use it to build our strategy and we must be willing to listen to what it is telling us we are committed to this work and I am confident in the team that is doing this work on a daily basis and with this I would like to turn it over to Mr West to dive into the presentation thank you I'm good evening for president Gonzalez and board members as well as superintendent like he so we're going to we're going to get into the details tonight so I want to just make sure that you know that there's so much time at the end for questions but if you see terms that you don't know just don't be intimidated by them because one of the things that are getting into this information with my colleague here and other members of our staff we've really got into picking apart these tests and understanding what what's in them but it's a lot because there is a science behind them so I just want to let you know that please don't be intimidated by anything you see because we can figure it out together so I will try to do

[00:22:00]
all right so what am I going to talk about tonight so I'm going to start off with doing the who what when where why and how of the New Mexico measures of Student Success and achievement which I'll be referring to his house is the Masa or nmms today which I have a hard time saying and then I'm going to move into the results and here specifically we're going to look at those English language arts and Mathematics proficiency rates overall by grade level by school we talked about how we're going to show you the top 10 of our bottom 10 in those as well as our favorite self-reported race and ethnicity categories in there I would say special attention to our groups in the Martinez Yazzie decision as well as African American students and then what I'm calling is our federal Equity programs but you may also know that is being special education English Learners in our economically disadvantaged students would they get into the details a little bit so that's where we talked about text types and strategies and that's inside of reading and then if

[00:23:00]
do you have a a slant or interest in math like I do we're going to get into those domains and the different domains are tested all right so let's get into the detail part so why do we do this so part of that so if you guys know or you're learning tonight that we do the New Mexico so that's how we are able to get funds from the federal government and meet the accountability requirements of it so in that we do testing grade 3 to 8 and English language arts as well as math and then every state is allowed to choose a great for high school so in our state we chose 11th grade and for that we chose the SAT I won't be going over the SAT results but I do just want to make sure that you know why we do what we do and then I've also included iStation because that is in there that's actually something we do as part of State Statute and that's why we do it for reading grade

[00:24:00]
play kindergarten to 2nd grade so who takes like I said all students in grades 3 to 8 take the test so we do to make sure that happens there are accommodations that are allowed So based on students individual education plans their IEPs there are accommodations that are available in the testing platform they're also things that go along with the testing platform including Texas beach and other uses of headphones and other Technologies so that students to have the ability to demonstrate what they know and can do so what time assessment is it so this is a Criterion reference assessment and why am I bringing this up because I want you to understand that when we talked about iStation ice and I ready as well as nmsa and ASR assessment sat there are different in each little ways right so this was a criteria reference assessment and by that big my definition but I'll try to not read it

[00:25:00]
there's a predetermined standard so with the NM mssa when the state contracted out to the company that we use called cognia so part of that was setting what does it mean for a student to be proficient so in every grade in English language arts and math it was determined what it means to be proficient by looking at items that the students can perform well in and basically saying well where does a student that does can do these items and these standards is that profession or is this profession or just proficient so there they that's how they said that Criterion or that that Cup point we do administer the test in the regular classroom settings so because all of our students are one-to-one in terms of their Chromebooks that they have they take the test on the same device that they have every day in their lives which has been a great thing for us so we don't have that well now you have to take it on something that you're not used to which is been really good for us the testers ministered usually in April and May that date will vary depending on when we find out

[00:26:00]
and why is the test administrator to say so in the main reason we focus on its so we have a measure of knowing how and what students can do but also to make sure that this is what's used for the equitable distribution of federal funds so when you hear about our New Mexico this is designations MRI CSI TSI Spotlight and traditional it's a lot of it's coming from this test and this is how they know who to give them my funds to in terms of helping those schools improve I do also have here the breakdown for the amount of time each portion takes so that you can see that there are multiple sections the students don't do these all in one day but there are multiple sections and so I have the times there you can see that English language arts there's a reading session and then there's a writing a language uses section you can see each one of those is a little over an hour and 15 minutes and then you can see the mathematics there's a calculator section and then a non-calculator section

[00:27:00]
all right this is probably the most intimidating slide that you will see tonight followed by the next most attending but I again so one of the things that we're really working on is making sure that we all understand what the assessment measure and how we can use them to support our instruction so part of that is we really been getting into These Blueprints is it called an operational test blue brand and what it is with a standardized test like this it's letting you know on the broad sense what types of questions are the students going to be asked and how are they then going to be related to the standards so with the internet this is a standard space assessment so this is showing you how the standards break down by grade level subject but also so when you get into the standards you'll see the starts off in English language arts you'll see that starting off with two different text types and why I want to show you that is because we're going to

[00:28:00]
show you what that information looks like how our students were performing those two text types and actually a good hint I got this morning was that there's literary text or you could consider that nonfiction and then sorry sorry sorry sorry fiction so those are in our early grades so that's where our stories or poems and then as you move on to 3 6 6

[00:29:00]
open the by grade level so in grade 3 4 and 5 we do test in the domain so in math the standards are broken into domains and the NFA the five domains that are covered here you see its operations and algebraic thinking numbers and operations in base 10 number operations and fractions measurement and data and geometry so what you'll see is and I go to the next when we go to 68 it changes right because the idea here with the math standards of their building so they're getting more complex that's also true in our English language arts center so when they did the comment for they wanted to make sure that the students were building towards the complex has to be necessary to them in a career or in college so there's always that idea that building upon the previous grade level so you see we move on to grade six and seven that's where we start seeing things like ratios and proportional relationships of the number system which I can Define for you if I can find it later if you'd like expressions and equations geometry and

[00:30:00]
play music improbability and the one thing that you'll see is that an 8th grade they get something called functions which that domain is not tested at 6 and 7th grade so again you can just see there's the foundational skills that are being developed in k25 but then when you get to 67 and 8th grade it in my opinion it really matches it up the complexity does the pace does increase with the idea that the foundations were late in the early grades and then that we're moving on to getting ready for the high school grades where they get the standards are going to get a little bit more complex because they're going to be more applied to things that we want children to be able to do and demonstrate their ability to do in their careers and if they do to go on to college all right so you made it through the technical part at least the first part now we're going to go into the actual results the way that each one of these graphs is set up you'll always see a lighter gray color there it'll always be on the left and that's I wanted to make sure that you could see

[00:31:00]
play all the years of data we have so because the nmms to say was first administered in the 2021 2022 school year that's our first data point that we have coming out of that pandemic so you always will have that but then in terms of our goals for goal one and go to you'll have that light blue in the darker blue it looks like it is which are two previous years and that's where we get into our conversations around the goals for tonight I'm just going to be focusing on those two years so whenever you hear me talk about A Change Is Gonna Be comparing 23 2024 to 20222 2020 but it is there for your reference point so that you have the complete data and again you many of you are seeing these data points in the third grade cut and you see in the 8th grade cut so the difference here is that I'm going to be showing you overall so that is going to be different you're going to see friends that are different than you saw when you looked at specific grade level and specific subjects so that's Dr Blakey said you'd see that we did decrease slightly

[00:32:00]
in English language arts compared to last year and then we also did have a decrease there and Mathematics so those are the two highlights there like I said you have also seen some of that in the goal to presentation the next slide here's what we start getting into the different breakdowns that we have as a plug on the aps dashboard does have it so that you can break it down many different ways and I know that they also provided you guys excuse me with the board with the ability to do some of the Cross cutting of categories and they can do that again if you'd like to see that the state of that way here we go into grade level so here you can see that we have great and this is showing for all of English language arts so the thing I point out here so in grades 45 and 6 they did perform higher this past year than the year before and then we did have grades 378 to perform lower and you'll see a lot of this when we look at these grade levels because remember they are snapshots in time so it's not

[00:33:00]
it's not uncommon to see these variations where you'll see one grade is up hungry is down but it's as they're going through their educational careers with the idea that we're trying to make sure that we're finding improve ways to write instruction that's teaching the center to all students but you will see variation across time here we go on to math and again we can see here so here are our biggest citizen Grace for performed higher this year or see me 2003 201st year but we did see the decreases in all of our other groups so that's great to eight and you might tell me that but just so you know there is a very little difference there so one thing I didn't want to point out so 23.6 to 23.7 so the one thing about this I should live with this so we were required to test 95% of

[00:34:00]
call school test coordinators they're people that have a teaching low but they do this in addition to their task but we monitor these rates to get that 95% and we want all students why because we want to have a data point so we use these data points with our mlss work with our IP it's again to have one more data point to see because see whether that data point is agreeing with or disagreeing with other data points that the teachers have assessing collected on the students throughout the year so why am I telling you that because this is not sample data so if you see any difference here it is statistically significant because it's a census because we test all kids so if we were only

[00:35:00]
sing a sample of kids then we would have to run tests right we have to see whether that is recurring because of the kids that we sampled and whether that can be represented but any of these numbers that you see they are it is a difference but again doesn't mean that magnitude doesn't matter so when I said that there was a decrease excuse me an increase in grade 4 it was 0.1% points so you could say that that was a slight but I just want to point out that that will help you as we go through these lights so the next thing we're doing is we're breaking it down by our students and I always say self-reported racing ethnicity just with the understanding their that that's that occurs when students register so this is a category that their guardian or whoever signed them up that's what they chose and that's how we get our Martinez Jazzy categories of African-American and Native American which are provided to you there as well as our other so there's seven races and ethnicity categories that we do report to the federal government as well as the state and they're provided to you there

[00:36:00]
so an English language arts are African-American Native American and Pacific Islanders all performed higher this previous year than in 2223 while our Asian Hispanic and are white or Caucasian students and students who reported two or more races performed slightly lower the go on to math we can see her that are Native American students performed higher in 2023 than in 2022 while our other students in the other race and ethnicity groups did perform lower I'm going to take a break from a bar charts I'm not supposed to use these words as the assessment guy or the data guy but I just think some pretty impressive greens and I will back that it was data but we do see double digit games occurring like we said in Bel Air

[00:37:00]
I'm as well as Jimmy's elementary school so these are looking at for this is their grades 3 to 5 for their nmsa results the English language arts and then we do provide the rest of the schools that are on top 10 in Mathis also score so what I'm saying is that if you compare the two percentage points to 2% for the years they had they grew more than 10% points which is very impressive we wanted to make sure that those are highlighted for you but then I also want to talk about this when you hear us talk about our priority and emerging schools this is a schools that tend to make it to these lists and so here this is the the inverse of what I showed you so these are students is the schools that had the largest decreases when we rank all the schools so

[00:38:00]
16 169 percentage points as well as San Antonio Lowell and Mountain View Mountain Vista Eugene Field now I'm going to show you the same thing but for Math and you can see here we have MacArthur Madison Wisconsin look at the overall percentages so how they're doing I'm just thinking it's important to take into context where they started and where they're going to but also when we do work with the schools with their 90-day plan these are the focuses that they looking at all of our elementary schools are required to focus on on English language arts as well as mathematics so these are where they're focusing on

[00:39:00]
change is an adult behavior that they believe can address on the root causes to while these students are having these outcomes all right let's just get back to bar chart world so now we're going to look at our our student groups so again I do want to bring your attention to our Martinez Jazzy decisions language arts so this is the greatest so very broad but we are seeing increases in our students with disabilities if you were to compare 200324 to the year prior as well as our students that we consider economically disadvantaged and then you do see that we did have a decrease in our performance of our English language Learners and again those are students that are currently receiving services that account in those groups so for each of those Shooters next look at

[00:40:00]
same same table but now we're moving it to Mathis programs that are receiving services to help make sure that they have access to grade level content so we're looking at math so we we do see that are at students that we consider economically the advantage we do see an increase their in their performance in math however we did experience a slight decrease in our students with disabilities

[00:41:00]
and then a decrease in Illinois I talked about how the focus changes so this is actually something that a principal pointed out to me so you'll see that we tend to do better and literary text and Grace 3 to 5:00 then we do an informational text because

[00:42:00]
it doesn't mean that we don't need to do both but I thought that was a fair statement and you can see I did have it in the green box there I did want to point out two areas where we did see improvements and so when you see that key ideas and details and you see craft and structure that's getting into the next level down where then we start getting into the standards so right before you get to the standard where it's a different letter combinations like rl3 rl5 this is that level of so this is letting us know that we're seeing improvements and whatever we're doing in those areas but all the the inverse in the areas where we didn't see the increases places where we can look and see what's going on and that's where we do go into that item level in that Center level analysis next I'm showing so here's a thing so here's the change it there's some interesting things going on here here we're going to six

[00:43:00]
383 right so that's where the focus is Shifting it flipped it being more on information on text and interesting thing you can see there is that we're actually maintaining and actually growing in literary text there and that's in our comprehension strategies and crafts and structure but then you can also see that we went down in literary texting grade 68 in some of the categories but then that one should be a Redbox on a green box and then we did go up in the analysis interpretation so this key ID is in details again why are we showing you this data because I hope is that if we have resources where you can learn more so you can really get into it but I will at least one to show you places where we can look because we don't we able to assess the strategies that we're using and what we need to do without focusing right so this is helping us focus our attention and then the

[00:44:00]
best part of the reading standards that are assessed are writing and language and here because they have less categories that they cover or less standards you can see here we have three and five on the left on which you can see that we are down and all of the writing and language of the means there and then you can see grade 6 and 8 we did have seen some progress in writing specifically in the areas of text types and purposes but we are also down and you will see that some of them there are some big big decreases that happen that were really looking into to figure out what's going on there but they're there in those tables all right now let's go to mass so much again we talking about those domains that are tested which getting more complex as we move on to the higher grades so here we have

[00:45:00]
Play 3 to 5 and we did perform lowering in each of the domains this year than we did the previous school year now we're moving on and looking at grade 6 to 8 and there's that number ratios and proportional relationships are covered in sixth grade only and that functions are only covering 8th grade but the number system expressions and equations and geometry are all covered across all of the greats and here you can see that we did see improvements in grade six and seven there and that really ratios and proportional relationships as well as slight improvements and statistics and probability but we did see decreases in the number system geometry as well as a functions which is the only testing in grade 8 which of course is very

[00:46:00]
Pacific to Article 2 we did it so that's all I have in terms of lots of information for you I know but we do stand for any questions that you have thank you Dr West Dr Blakey Dr Gonzalez for the presentation the depths of the exploitation and also just the thoroughness that you responded to the Advance questions with which I know we're all so pretty technical in nature there were some that were less technical as well but really appreciate that and just want to acknowledge that this is something new we're trying this is different from traditional progress monitoring but wanted to give an opportunity for the full board to really dig into the Statewide assessment results but also for the public everyone who's listening to have an opportunity to dig into some of this information as well so we don't have a specific format for questions for

[00:47:00]
this is not progress monitoring but if you want to open it up to the floor open the floor up to the full board to be able to ask questions of any nature and just knowing that it's it's to improve our understanding and so as we think about the type of questions that we ask we want to ask questions that improve our understanding and that will help us do our job when it comes to monitoring and oversight certainly there are questions of things that we are just curious about and we can ask those things but I want to just be mindful too of the time that those questions may take and if those might be better for another purposes as well so with that I'm going to go ahead and just go through the numbers of the districts to get us started so we'll start with district one and member astorga do you have questions related to the presentation I'm sure someone will come to me but you did a great job with the presentation and I actually did learn a lot from it so I appreciate it and I think that I do have a better understanding when even just looking at the data from the gold presentation so thank you for that

[00:48:00]
great thank you remember tomorrow yes specifically to children with disabilities and I know that when we see those scores and having them as low as they are how are we connecting that with IEPs and making sure those whether it's through goal setting whether it's to accommodations modifications and especially if we're doing a test online I don't know how many of the children that are test taking are we implementing that and other ways for some of these kids that can't take it through the computer and then also addressing some of those needs when it comes to the accessibility on the test taking to what is in those IEPs for president

[00:49:00]
can we do so in in the in the world of the assessment talk that we have these we have Universal tools and and I will say and at least the 10 years that I've seen they've expanded a lot so they've tried to make the technology just better for everybody in terms of making sure that things are more accessible without the need for an additional accommodation that another child wouldn't get and one of the things that's nice about that is it does make it so that regardless of whether the child has an IP or not they are given more access to the materials to demonstrate what they know and can do however they do have lots of different things available to them and the goal there and this is actually does come from our our New Mexico assessment Bureau but the goal there as well as every state is supposed to be doing this is to make sure if they receive accommodations in their IP and instruction they should also receive those on this assessment and that can be things such as extended time actually the team is like the best at knowing everything so they actually

[00:50:00]
do you have a note that I'm more than happy to provide after the meeting or however best to do that but there's there's so many different things so I would love for you to be able to see what's available because I will tell you that I knew that we did our best to ensure that the student is experiencing the test the same way that they're experiencing construction but it's actually pretty impressive when you see the full amount of things that are available to them hope that helps so I will also say we do have something called it's called the dynamic learning Maps or dlm so in allowable and federal law less than 1% of students that and this is kind of like the legal terminology I don't think it's the best terminology but they say severely have severe cognitive disabilities that they are allowed there's a separate test that they take and that we do administer and actually we do work closely with our special education colleagues and they those children have a different experience and those tests are actually set to make sure that they're able to show that there's learning occurring that is

[00:51:00]
related and relevant to their IEPs so that that is something that also goes on as well in our district in specifically to 3rd and maybe 5th grade are we also making sure the goals Within These IEPs are relevant to the literacy and to the math goals remember to we do make sure that when we do our assessments and Mr West was referring to the alternate assessment that some of our students take for students that take the same exams as everyone else is the same test as everyone else the the goals in the IP should particularly pertain to the area of disability and needs so and then we're using the data from the different assessments to help drive those goals as well as we're seeing gains or changes in their performance thank you any other questions

[00:52:00]
so I had a couple of questions so one is as a parent I know that you also receive a report from the PED from the secretary with your individual child's report so I'm curious what you APS leadership would recommend parents do with that word president Gonzalez superintendent Blakey and members of the board thank you for the question traditionally we when those reports come in and I'm thinking of looking at my daughter's own report we tried to do that in the context of a parent teacher conference and so that apparent to isn't familiar with looking at test results education is an expert who can help explain that information to them think that's probably our best approach is to really lean on the expertise of our teachers and their understanding of the data in order

[00:53:00]
standard operating procedures maybe not quite there are some of it depends on the timing of the reports coming in I do believe in yes in this round we did have the reports available I cannot speak to what every school did with the reports but that is definitely what's encouraged and supported okay my next question is just sort of about the terminology of learning loss so we know learning loss happened across the board in the United States in math and reading and multiple grades as a result of the pandemic what do we know looking at our data about how Albuquerque Public Schools May compare to other similar systems and or how student demographic groups that we serve May compare

[00:54:00]
is there a pure demographic groups in other places obviously there's the tuna but thinking too just in terms of like rate of decline or rate of recovery do we know much about that comparison with other groups other states for president Gonzalez so we actually we did participate in work with our colleagues of curriculum Associates I will ask for that information of the great City Schools we do participate in a monthly call with curriculum associates they bring together all the assessment directors from around all the districts so I do know that there's a report out there A lot of times when you if you seen the we're not part of the NWA report but I know curriculum Associates did one so when they talk about the large urban districts access like we're in there but let me see if I can provide more detail information through that through that relationship that we have to do that through the consolation School

[00:55:00]
I do have two more questions but we'll go ahead and keep moving on to District 4 which is member benavidez thank you so much and thank you all for being here this evening and for that very comprehensive and interesting presentation so I noticed that Matheson Park on Zia Elementary are on both list the largest one year decrease in ela and math proficiency and so I'm curious what additional support to resources are being provided to the teachers and to the students to try to counteract this and have you noticed any patterns or commonalities among the schools in the students in these schools and if so how are they being addressed pepper benavidez I'm sorry but I lost the student group that you mentioned at the very beginning of your question so can you repeat it so I noticed that Mathison Park Elementary are all on the largest one year decreases for ELA

[00:56:00]
I was curious about that Gonzalez I think a couple things to point out there is this information is broken down with some of our schools that are making the most gains as well as the schools that are struggling so we're learning on both sides so that we are able to support our schools that are struggling with promising practices that some of our schools are yielding that are making the games in terms of the schools that you are referencing specifically we can look into those schools with a deeper dive and get back to you with specific analysis is a couple of things to that is new this year in looking at the status so one is the performance framework that we use

[00:57:00]
so these data are used as part of our performance framework and where we tear the schools for more support so you'll see in a lot of the guard rails specifically we talked about the priority and emerging schools so the schools are schools that there's several indicators we look at but that puts them in that category that then they are receiving different Services which you'll really see for the budget for next year of how we're doing this because we just got these scores for this year after so I think that's one of the big things and the other thing that they talked about briefly was the 90-day plans and so through Chris West's office he has basically coaches that are assigned to the schools that work with the schools on their 90 Day plans so these schools that are really showing like struggle and where they're not getting their growth through their 90-day plan or addressing specifically

[00:58:00]
data and looking at it through the correlation with i-Ready and iStation board member benavidez if I could just add I think in relation to the use of the performance framework as well as the 90-day plan as the tool to drive forward are improvement from the teaching and learning side we are created what we're calling unified support teams and so really it's taking expertise from across our departments going to the school and helping them look at that data to identify those trends that you're interested in and to then work with the principal to very clearly identify what are the right supports so rather than saying here are all the supports which we know is not sustainable for a school for a school leader it becomes too much we can really drill down and offered the school exactly what they need so we just started doing those last month I believe is the

[00:59:00]
what is come forward to us and I've already gotten a really good response from principles in terms of grateful for the targeted supports thank you so I'm going to dig a little bit deeper on the question that President Gonzalez mentioned about the conversations we have with families so if a person if a family is not making it to conferences and they're not accessible to get received the information what systems do we have in place that they are being communicated with especially with the significant decline that we seen in some of these schools and how do we ensure their getting the resources that they need to make improvements yes I can do that thank you for the question board member Tapia Romero a few things come to mind cuz I agree the parent teacher conferences at the end all be all when it comes to parent communication

[01:00:00]
are teachers are tasked with being really clear in their communication terms of student progress and working with families in order to communicate that and that you know that's teacher and parent however they build that relationship that's how that communication would take place so whether it's a phone call an email and in person visit that's definitely part of the teacher's responsibility along the same lines just in looking at the overall progress of students beyond the message test we have our standard space progress report and so that's specific to Elementary and then of course in our secondary we use the report card right so this is a more those particular reports I think are happening at a more regular interval than you know my child was a fourth grader last year and I'm just now finding out how she did as a fourth grader and like well it doesn't really do me a lot of good but the work that I did with

[01:01:00]
the school when she was in 4th grade that's what really was able to inform the supports in my understanding of her progress so those are the two things that come to mind you have something you like to add Dr Gonzalez just briefly rememberer in addition to that work I would also say that we are intentionally looking at parent conferences in general so how are they still meeting the utility today that they met 10 years ago was attending is there a difference between elementary middle and high in terms of attendance and really looking at it we've had that conversation very recently as we as you know been looking at the calendar for the next couple of years and we've included parent conference time on the calendar but that's prompted us to really look at are we hitting the more in relationship to parent conferences and if we're not how can we work with our teachers and from their expertise

[01:02:00]
to be able to see how we can evolve that process not give away the time but maybe use it differently as we strive to hit the mark in relationship to parent and family communication one more thing I would add is I understand that the internet needs a certain demographic and maybe not another but we are working and are making strides and looking at the data specifically regarding usage to parentvue and also aligning our systems around parent Communication online for different interactions parents have with the district from making a student transfer request from school a to school B to checking Gradebook making sure that Gradebook is updated so that it's a real tool for our parents to interact with so it's a

[01:03:00]
Hop Shop and we're not having the confusion or the parent Whiplash if you will from going to this system to that system and just knowing that this is where I go when I want to have day-to-day communication with my students teacher in relationship to their progress and one more question I have to so have we noticed if there's a relationship with the declining rates with chronic absenteeism we've actually seen Improvement in attention so I would say it overall know it doesn't mean that they're right not be a students that might be having more chronic missing school more than they used to of course that would be related to not learning as much not having

[01:04:00]
can you learn as much but overall where our district is actually improving in attendance so I would say no okay thank you you're welcome thank you so I have a couple questions but the first one is take off on board member do they take what test do they take or are they leaving so it's been changing so there's been some new guidance from PD around this as a result of a federal so I'm going to do my best to tell you what I know

[01:05:00]
but so it's actually based on the number of years that you've been in the United States but also it depends on what you come in with as a kindergartener or as a first grader so there we do have a waiver process but as they get older the waiver process goes away so the idea there is that we do offer and we get the results so we do have language arts that's offered to students who have been in the United States less time they do get to take it the only language that is provided by the New Mexico public education department in Spanish so those students are able to take a Spanish test if that's the test of their own language but there is based on Federal Department of Education there's a time limit to how long we're allowed to do that and why is that because the money that we received through title 3 for English Learners the goal that program is to make sure that they can actually English so the federal government does have strict guidelines a lot of how long were allowed

[01:06:00]
to have them taken a different language did your elaborate or just a little bit because you know how many years they're allowed I'm going to make sure I get the right information

[01:07:00]
being taken to task for that so we'll just sharing that observation because it was helpful for me so my next question is what is a cut score and when comparing cut scores for the national assessment for educational progress the nape assessment and state scores what critical difference is do you see especially with regards to the New Mexico measures of namassa say it all up completely test so when we stopped doing the parking period

[01:08:00]
interstates though there pretty much all states I think there's a few that you still use Smart Balance I think it's California we don't have a state comparable test anymore in the United States because everybody has chosen to do their own the name the national assessment for educational progress is the only test that is administered in to everyone with the national sample that they can make judgments about whether students are learning more or learning less than they used to it's important point out that that's that test is not standards are lying so our test is measuring the common core standards which have been augmented slightly just a little bit for the New Mexico to be called in the New Mexico standards but it is a line to those standards so right now the only test that we take that we have comparable data for is our I already assessment just because this is the number of kids who take that assessment country but that's that's that's where we are now

[01:09:00]
I'm smarter balanced and park we are all on our own standards now so why okay I guess I'm confused because so many in the conversation in the public nape comes up all the time and so I'm just trying to figure out how how how how how is that information useful is very useful for us because it doesn't change so all of our ages period

[01:10:00]
Urban District assessment so because of our relationship with the Council of great City schools in Albuquerque is a number of districts they did we decided to oversample so in that we actually get data that is comparable for us so what we were able to do there and see how we do comparing Council of the great City school districts so we do have that data so that releases coming out I'm not sure now based on the changes in that occurred last night but it's supposed to come out in in the in January like in early as possible but those are those are decisions that are made on the governing board as well as with the federal government so the reason why so sorry that was a long answer but the reason why you hear about this because this comparable over time yes so I think you did mention there I think for me if this helpful

[01:11:00]
standard setting so when they had those New Mexico Educators sit down and say okay here's the student that this is what how they perform on these questions this is the questions they got right these are the questions they got wrong do you feel that the student is proficient do you feel the student is Advanced that they pick the score that's basically relates to what the that happened in that standard setting so it'll be similar if if you were to create assessment for your course and you decided Well I'm going to give two points for these questions and I think that if they get 8 out of 10 I'm just going to pick one I think they covered the material so it's actually done in some other way and what they do is they use that standard setting and then we take it and then now they watch it every year and see well now that we're in our third year how does it look and then you'll see like I think we talked about before with gold one with iStation and actually I already

[01:12:00]
believe it's doing it next year I think they renew once in a while and by that they will not necessarily change the customer but they'll see how does this look in terms of all the students taking it or 90% of kids getting this right you're getting it wrong but the customer is very like I would just take it to just like the test that you create in the classroom where they basically say yep I feel that the student has mastered the material or is proficient in the grade three English language arts standards or the grade 8 math standards I hope that helps a little bit late

[01:13:00]
cooking the scores to meet pressures I'll just leave it in the car and so it seems that am I mistaken it seems that having that kind of variability then makes Nate probably more important maybe guidance is the main part of it so because there was you know several years ago when Common Core and park rolled out it was with the premise of that will give a national test you know that it would all be Parker smarter balanced so now you know we can

[01:14:00]
purpose of the NASA and using knape and i-Ready Ice Station are all for different purposes so I don't think one could replace the other and I think it's important to use various data because Nate is giving us like a high level idea of where our students are with random samples and nationally we can use it it's not something that you would then give students like the parents to say this is how your student did that's not the purpose of it whereas the mouse is used for this is how your student did last year to the standards and then I'm ready to station is showing here's how your students progressing throughout the year and so they're all used for different purposes so the cut score itself for is it 80% Mr West that students have to

[01:15:00]
be proficient to be like I don't know that we've been given that information at this point when we did the goal one presentation we did talk about if I purchase so they do they do two things one so they say like this test and doing well on this test if it was a correlation of one it would be a perfect correlation so 100% so with irony and iStation there is a strong correlation and that a student that is doing well on one assessment will do well on the other assessment the difference is how does it look in terms of the distribution right so they're like what we what iStation told us with just not merely what they told us

[01:16:00]
334 English language arts it was 80th but you had to be at the 80th percentile on their test to be proficient on the nmms to say in Reading one important thing to point out there is something that we've actually learned a lot because of the work across our teams is that they measure different things so iStation measures from Cheryl games here is that it's based on the skills the skills are necessary to read so I should call the Scarborough Road so there they're looking at the steals that are necessary to be able to read when you take the grade three and MSA you have to be able to read and you have to be able to write so they're different standards that are not obsessed on Ice Station that are covered by Eminem say however I already used on standards so I already is highly correlated with the state assessment because it's measuring the standards that teachers are expected to cover during the year I don't know the

[01:17:00]
but that's that's the difference between them but yeah so the more that more than happy to share the linking studies you want to see but they but I will tell you like I can't tell you what the other states and things are in terms of their Cuts were because everybody's at a different place now and a lot of times they hold that stuff it's hard to get that information it's not only you know thank you it's important we want to make sure that we're using these tests to help kids and I am biased because I oversee the assessment team but Frank tell her senior director of assessment he was a principal and he was also a classroom teacher and he wants to make sure that the information that we're getting from asking students to do something is providing information for the teacher and for the student and for the parent that they can have a conversation and I think that's important thing about this

[01:18:00]
what is the season as a tool not as something that were made to do because the thing is and we always talked about this and actually Brian the rent is our director of overseas our school Convoy support team is the 90-day plan process he has a very good thing that he says where I'm pregnant but he's going to he says that if I give an assessment and only three of my 10 students can do the task then I need to teach it differently and I think that that is a really great way of thinking about assessment it's not meant to make the students dressed it is stressful it's not it's supposed to be there as a tool to say this is what I can do based on this assessment but I might be able to show that I can do differently or better on something else but it's just supposed to be as one of our tools not only tool thank you thank you thank you thank you very much I love when you come before Christmas

[01:19:00]
mainly because you reassure me that all of this data that we are looking at I I can see how it's being layered right like this is this is the raw data it's being layered into the presentations that Miss Jet and Dr Gonzalez give to us and so and I am reassured that this is really being looked at with a Keen Eye and with you you said it perfectly so that as we're using this tool we know what we're doing right by our kids and so I really appreciate that I also just have to to point out I the expertise that you this panel in front of us brings superintendent Blakey and I even I'm probably going to embarrass her but I got to point out our board president sitting on the governing Council for Nate I'm

[01:20:00]
I hope that people who are listening understand the passion and the expertise that is within Albuquerque Public Schools right now so thank you for that and I ask a specific question because you're in front of me and I love it when you're here when I look at the the the the I don't know what page it was the students with disabilities scores both for English language arts and Mathematics their low to start right they're they're just low to start and knowing that our goals are you know five years I have to wonder because of data analysis that is our goal at 10% increase for students with disabilities as well is there

[01:21:00]
some sort of statistical factor that goes into it is having you guys in front of us what what does good look like like how will you know when you started to make Progressive I'm very lucky to have people who love coming to work because it matters so thank you for saying that so when we were in it we want to see upward growth one thing that we all don't like to see those little numbers so when you see 10% that's not good so the idea there is that actually so in the night I can talk about the 90-day plan process so in that part of that is they have to look at each of the student groups and if you hear about our schools

[01:22:00]
what are labeled on MRI or CSI they actually have more requirements in their 98 plan then school that's labeled traditional or Spotlight thank you so the idea there is that but regardless we don't we were doing that regardless of designation is they also set goals for the students and the student group so the schools they might have a goal will they do have a goal for third grade but they also have a Google Assistant disabilities in third grade so the idea there is that whenever we look at data they're making sure that that's a priority so you're asking so we want to see improvements so as long as is 0.3 percentage points is that is that something that we should be proud of know but it's a start and the idea there is we want to see keep going up and if we do see a decrease that's kind of we want to make sure that we keep seeing that upward Trend because I did did point out when you do what happens when you break this data down further and you get to the teacher level or the grade level in a school you will see a line

[01:23:00]
yes but what we want to make sure is that we're seeing the slope that we're going up over time so we do get concerned and I think it was only one of our answers to one of the questions that if we do see two years of the decrease that is a concern for us and that is something that we pay very close attention to when we are doing the night a planning process because if it's happening two years in a road those are different students which means that there's something going on versus you know that that class of that that was they were different that year or something like there's something going on there that is not a pattern so that's when we really like that's where the intensity and that kind of level of certain going right that's where that happens because even though they're low we want to make sure we're still making progress so in terms of the world of the data as long as we're seeing upward Trends that's what we want to see in terms of how large that trend is it's going to it's going to vary depending on the school our schools that are very low we want to see lots of growth having their because we and when you see 10

[01:24:00]
emerging schools so those schools they are a focus of of all of our now of the district offices to make sure that that's not okay and how can we help them so my point they're doing is we see a little thing if it's going up that's good but if we see something that's going the wrong direction for two years that's where we really were kind of the alarm bells and if I may just add to that number Jackson in relationship to the accountability piece is we have with the new school year rolled out and I mentioned this in a previous meeting the principal leadership tool which is common District wide with a common set of expectations for our principals It Is complemented by principal scorecard with this data is specific by the school on that scorecard specific to the school

[01:25:00]
each school has a Target based on the different groups this is all built by Mr West office all of that is built specifically for the individual school and based on the performance framework that has been rolled out the number of coaching visits by the principal supervisor is dictated so if you are a priority and emerging school you're going to have more support and coaching on that score card looking at this data over time by these groups so that we're able to support and wrap ourselves around the schools that may be struggling whereas if you're a school that is you know not in those areas you're going to have more autonomy and less support in terms of those coaching businesses so I really think that the momentum that that process is yielding and the intentionality and the laser focus

[01:26:00]
unaccountability it's the same conversation on regardless of who the principal supervisor is and its strategic in the sense of the number of support visits that are schools get as well as the amount of departmental support that are schools receive from our teaching and learning department and the Departments underneath the chief academic office did you want to add for presenting Gonzalez Dr Gonzalez I did when I make sure that we got the departments in there and how the associates are supporting the work of the assistance good job team member Jackson anymore so I had a question maybe for Dr Blakey but maybe for the full team so oftentimes

[01:27:00]
find test scores are released its a big media event or it can be a big media event with a press conference and a big press release and opportunity to shine light and also showing that Spotlight on areas of improvement so I'm just curious if you had to write the headline about these scores what would be the one thing or maybe the two things the main headline and then the sub headline that you would want our public in Albuquerque to know about Albuquerque Public Schools performance on the Masa that's a good question I'm looking at Mr Cassell's because he's going to like call me aside after this meeting and say that would be the worst I hope that your texting furiously I I actually think the bass on my vantage point of looking at the scores a headline would be that the district is prioritizing the right places to look at growth

[01:28:00]
students because I feel like what this data is showing us is that the goals that have been established are where we need to focus our work and so it kind of verifies to me that what the community told us they wanted us to work on and what we see in these data are connected I know that's a really long headline and it's not as like fancy he probably has a really cool like acronym for it but I do think it would say that APS is focusing on the right areas because you know if you were to pull this up and we were doing really well in some areas that we want we're saying we're focusing on it would show that there's a disconnect anyone else any other questions from board members one remember to worry too this is for tisci as we look at parent engagement and parent engagement specifically for those parents have children with disability looks a lot different

[01:29:00]
what's the new incoming director in looking at the how do you expect to increase this parent engagement whether it's through one helping parents understand the IEP process to looking at data because that's a big result Within These IEPs and then three is really understanding the 13 Kate of a disability and how those parents reflect on that if you could just give me a little bit about your your intake on that remember Tom worry we actually discussed this today our leadership meeting and our we have a plan that we've laid out with meetings every month where we talk about different issues we put out a survey to parents to actually support them with questions that they have we're having kind of an open house in December for parents so we're trying to plan all of those things one of the other things that we've done is really trying to meet the needs of parents

[01:30:00]
set if a parent wants an in-person IEP or virtual IP we need that to ensure that they are present to have conversations around their students progress their goals what we're seeing in the data to help us drive those goals in the IEPs and internally we're doing some audits of our APS to put together some training that we where we see that we have some deficits so that we can help grow our internal step and supporting our parents with those different areas where also we have a meeting with the office on Friday so we are teaming with them to make sure that when our parents do have difficulties we're actually out to them and asking them to support our parents to serve parents feel like they have a support at the table to have this conversation and then what do you do with the question at the end of an IEP that states they do not know their procedural safeguards in the school district or somebody will be sent out to help them understand that process when we when we

[01:31:00]
get to that question the person that I can explain those rights to the parent is always named for the parent and then we do have our different offices in the building owner working on putting up some QR codes on the website for parents to be able to send in questions directly to myself or executive director of resolution to support parents so we have some things that we're putting in place but there's always a person named that can answer that question and we should always have copies of those at the table period thank you very much thank you so much my last question is I think sort of a combination of my first question and remember top of yours question just about here and awareness public awareness how is it that parents know about school performance overall so if I receive my child's report from the state and I talked about it in the parent teacher conference I'm going to have a sense of how my individual child is doing I might talk to parents I might be so inclined to visit the

[01:32:00]
how do you know about how your school is performing overall is that shared like my principles or the district visiting Gonzalez I'm going to begin an answer and then the team can fill in the holes that I may leave out but we've actually been talking a lot about this very Point recently in regards to the most anticipated release of updated New Mexico Vista designations for the state of New Mexico which are set to come out within weeks so how do we communicate that at a school level and where do parents go to know how their students their school is performing and you alluded to part of the answer that I would start with and that is I believe Albuquerque Public Schools is a model for school districts throughout the nation Point Franklin

[01:33:00]
regards to our transparency with data and the availability of data on the sapper site so parents should be encouraged and we are absolutely happy to assist parents in navigating the data literacy there's a lot of data there but sometimes having some help you understand what are these numbers mean I mean we just had a presentation regarding Mimosa scores and no one's in here there's details and I would continue my answer to parents don't be afraid to go to your school and have a conversation and really ask for help many of our schools have family Liaisons have Community coordinators have special education teachers have Dynamic receptionists and everybody in between that can sit down and find the right person on campus to have

[01:34:00]
conversation the next part of my answer would be on really looking at interim assessment data and how does the conversation for your individual child evolved throughout the scope of a school year so that comes out several times a year and how can we have those conversations not just in parent conferences but really throughout the school year as my final part of this answer would be keep updated and holds accountable and making sure that parent view is updated because that is a dynamic resource for ongoing day-to-day week to week updates for how your student is doing so those are a few answers in relationship to how your school is doing and moving down to how your individual student is doing I don't know if my colleagues have anything to add to that thank you Doctor Gonzalez thank you for the

[01:35:00]
question on President Gonzalez I you know I think parent engagement is an area where we come often a little short we struggle to sometimes figure out what are the best ways to engage families if you're a parent like me or president Gonzalez and yes you know where to find all those resources I know one of the most valuable things I see schools do from the principal's office is to share how they did when those results come out through their parent newsletter their you know their weekly communication and the I think the most to me the most helpful bar graph that they use is how the school formed how the district formed how the state performed so I think that is just kind of a critical way to give families contacts because they sort of need that comparison in order to understand we also every time we we engage with our families it is an opportunity for us to talk about

[01:36:00]
call student performance and we regularly hear that and we coach schools to do that so for an example all of our Title 1 schools are required to have a parent night where they actually do go over this very specific data with the families and help them dig into it and that's just not a model for that one title one night though that's any time that we're engaging like I said with the families we want to open that opportunity to make the world of school accessible and understandable we try to stay away you know for the Public's benefit from our education ease I thought you did a good job tonight or west of doing that thank you but we have to remember to do that like we are the experts in the work we know it really well like we're professionals how do you make that accessible to families and I think that's an ongoing conversation that we need to continue to

[01:37:00]
we are having those conversations on a regular basis if I could also just make one plug if you ever have any information on the team that we still have our ask separate a s k s a p r at APS iedu there's also a phone number I don't know if they want me to give it up but it is on our website for parents can put data questions with let's talk it's really nice because they will get directed very quickly to either somebody we love answering questions about data the I think if you heard me speak a couple years ago you may have known that I used to answer those emails at night because it's it's very rewarding to be able to have that tangible part where you actually can help somebody but I do know that the teams take let's talk as well as at her email address very seriously but I as the person that

[01:38:00]
love isn't responsible for data anybody has trouble getting information about their student let us know and we'll make sure that we help them in general we should let families know to use ask supper or let's talk but we as board members should continue to use let's talk for all of our requests I think there was someone leaning in here yeah so can I just push back a little bit and and I think I've said this before it's a blessing and a curse that you have parents that are board members and because we can give you real-time data right assessment and what I'm kind of hearing I think these are all the tools are there right sappers their parent view is there it's all there but what I'm not hearing is how are we as a district going to be proactive with getting that information out I received an email on my

[01:39:00]
that was it right and like board member Gonzalez I'm the parent who maybe has the higher level of knowledge simply because I get to sit in front of you guys right what about those parents at schools that have single digit proficiencies like what what obligation do we have as a district and as a board to alert those families to what their proficiency data looks like and taking it a step further what obligation do we have or should we have to be much more proactive with having those conversations I mean I know it's in I know I got the data I know it's on parent view I know I can go to South Park but don't we have an obligation to have a deeper conversation even

[01:40:00]
with a conferences I haven't been to a student conference in years because the direction we get is unless your child is failing we really don't want to see you so I haven't sat in front of teachers in a while to go over what the namassa score is it was my obligation to look at it which yes parents have the obligation absolutely to know what their children are doing absolutely I'm not trying to Turf that but I'm wondering where that partnership really actually needs to be a little bit increase and I'm not expecting an answer right now but I would push back I it needs to be a little bit more proactive remember Jackson I think we have a profound responsibility to do exactly what you want and I think part of the answer was the Symposium we have right before

[01:41:00]
for this meeting were we really broke apart and brought to life we attempted to the work of guardrail one which is our wraparound services in our Community Partnerships and really looking to see how we do the root cause analysis by school triangulating data number of parents coming to parent conferences which parents are coming which ones are which barriers were having in terms of connection with parents and then based on that root cause analysis using the Community Schools methodology or framework to build a plan and partners to really assist the teacher in those connections on us and really to think differently and to think outside the box to make connections with these parents that perhaps aren't at the parent teacher

[01:42:00]
conference table or at the open house meetings or at the fall festivals where this information is shared at the macro level by school book perhaps equally as important if not more important the individual child that they said to us every day so I can tell you that it was I was very pleased to see some of the outside of the box strategies that were really displayed by number of schools this morning to do some of what you're alluding to but how do we take that learn from it and scale it up with other schools to learn what those strategies are I think that part of it is how do you know what I think something that the team is really working on is how do we systematized some of these procedures because we have pockets of some homework diners that they will go over this is what the scores are or this is how to read it and

[01:43:00]
but we don't have anything but every school is doing because from the district level family is often aren't as like interested in the district scores as much as they are their school and their student and you can't give the school data without having the student data available yet because it frustrates parents if they say well that's great that's how the school what does but I want to know how my child is doing and we have to get better as a state on getting the reliable data because it the time we get it is different every year the back and forth of whether the data is correct or not correct is different every year are Mr West is being very humble but their team comes through all of the data for all of these students for errors and then gives it back to public education department

[01:44:00]
so it's hard to be consistent about it when the data is actually relatively hard to get consistently and reliably I read a nice station is a little bit more reliable so I think that's why schools and teachers share that data more often and it's the students that they currently have so you know if you get the Masa scores particularly 9th grade is really hard to get to parents because you don't take it in high school so they they will never get the report but in 8th grade they take it and then in October we can get the student report we have to find where all of the 8th graders are at that point because they're at the high school they're not at their school anymore and the same happens with 5th graders so when we get the individual student reports those students are all dispersed at that time so that it's

[01:45:00]
there's some system issues in the individual reports that are really difficult that we have to get better at how we work as agencies together to get that reliable And Timely and be able to find where all the students are particularly our fifth and 8th grade students and I mean students that transfer to other you know that's often hard to find but it's the 5th and 8th grade students for the horse thank you anymore questions I want to make sure that I understood did I hear you say that all Title One schools are required to have a parent night around the New Mexico results

[01:46:00]
on the New Mexico Masa so it gets hard so how do you do those apparently married they have is school data so that that parent night it's not necessarily the individual data that they're passing out at that time it's going over where the schools is that so I don't know if you have seen the reports or if you got a report yourself as a child in school but they the state level they don't they don't really provide much information so they'll tell you they will tell you like my sister is very proud of our needs to my niece and I just got to see her Maryland assessment scores

[01:47:00]
will tell you their percentile or their placement but it doesn't really provide any actual information so like for instance I was really glad that you guys didn't ask me to tell you about standards level data for student groups because we don't get that information anymore so with the park assessment I could tell you all kinds of things about students but with their current state contract with the vendor we don't get Sanders level data at the student level anymore so it's so but I want to but I want to put a deposit on that to let you know that with our before I already assessments that we get we have a brand new one at the high school level so if you do have high school students this will be our brand new is called Horizon assessment it is not only does it cover broad damage and standards but it also shows students what they got right and what they got wrong as well as a teacher will be doing that there's no this year which is brand new but what I'm trying to say there is that our local assessments that we do give us tons of information and the reports that they provide whether they are

[01:48:00]
and they will give you that very very detailed level in terms of where the student is where do they know what they don't know when we do our standardized tests from the state it's not just a New Mexico thing but they don't really provide much information so I guess I would say I would just encourage people have opportunity to talk to their teachers about those assessments that they do in their classrooms because there's a lot of information that they can talk about thank you that's encouraging great thank you again thank you to the team for the presentation and the responses and I think most importantly just all the work that you're doing on behalf of our kids with that we will move on to the president's report so in response to the public forum comments tonight I just want to say that all the public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do want each speaker to know that you were heard and that we're working with the administration on resolutions

[01:49:00]
play some of the issues that we heard tonight were related specifically to campus safety and public awareness of campus safety issues the timeline for grade submission for seniors and other safety issues I want to provide an update as well as to the ad hoc committees actually just committees overall so the policy committee met on Monday and agreed with the recommendations made by the policy diet ad hoc committee policies recommended for archive will be added to the December 4th consent agenda the policy committee requested also that the policy diet at hoc committee made up of members Jackson and benavidez be reinstated to review those policies that need modification and to make recommendations for what those modification should be so we will reappoint congratulations member Dominguez and member Jackson this ad hoc committee I'm sorry benavidez I was looking at you we will reinstate this committee with a new deadline the policy committee also considered proposed revisions to section 4-H
