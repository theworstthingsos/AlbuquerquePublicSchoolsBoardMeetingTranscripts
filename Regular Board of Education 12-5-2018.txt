[00:18:00]
use self-motivated in a self-starter she looked at the waist refuse and recycling schedules and Pickups at every school and every site as well as Administration sites the scheduling is a very complicated process so we need she need to study it and discover some sights that were not processing as much refuse as others and scheduling this is hard because of the times they have to do it this very small window where we're not disrupting classes in neighbors and stuff she also recognized during the summer that we reduce our ways that many sites and could benefit from creating new schedules at each site during the summer time only in during certain days of the week it was all so complicated process and well beyond her responsibilities and but she took it on as a challenge and was extremely successful because of her hard work and determination the district reduced actual race cars in the first two months by over 100,000 in operational costs

[00:19:00]

[00:20:00]
what does

[00:21:00]
executive director of student family and community supports thank you president Pearcy members of the board superintendent reading tonight I have the honor of recognizing several exceptional Community Partners a while back the student family community supports division which by the way is when we talked about the best departments were just above meno so just have to kind of get it in perspective there we were approached by feed New Mexico and America praise regarding Distributing turkey dinners to families for Thanksgiving holiday so when I got contacted what did I do I turned it over to Elizabeth Calhoun who is the manager of our special projects and volunteer programs but she couldn't be here tonight but I told her I would embarrass her even if she wasn't here so she did the Layman's work of trying to help coordinate this effort the groups

[00:22:00]
and that I mentioned work directly with Sandy Kemp our executive director of APs food and nutrition to purchase prepare and package and deliver turkey dinners and it sounds you know okay so it's food nutrition they do that all the time this was 2000 turkey dinners and each of those turkey dinners feeds a family of four so it wasn't just something that we just did on top of oh yeah we can deliver a few turkey dinners know this was a lot of coordination work and and I think at some point we probably need to recognize Sandy's department for all the work that they did in this but tonight we're recognizing Our Community Partners for their work so these pre-cooked so this is an interesting concept because we think it giving turkey's giving out those frozen turkeys know these are precooked turkey meals and it's a full meal

[00:23:00]
that's designed specifically for families who are homeless or living in a facility that does not have a kitchen or microwave and so they can actually be prepared without having a microwave or having a kitchen and so and again 2000 meals serving a family of four each of those meals so the meals included everything that you would think of in your turkey in your turkey dinners so everything from the from the potatoes to the turkey and I can't even tell you even though it's part of the assembly line that got to put like about five of them together so the group work directly with the staff at Title One homeless project to select the schools that would that would then I identify the students that would need the meals so on November 16th and 20th 2000 packaged meals were delivered to 57 pre-selected elementary middle and high school

[00:24:00]
Google an Charter Schools across the district so as I call your name with the following people please join me at the podium Brian alirez and Denise Reykjavik from American praise America praise Holly Slade and Daniel are again from feed New Mexico kids and Matt Perillo and Nathan heisig from Calvary Chapel these are the people that went out and collected all of the money and it wasn't just that something that was sort of left out not only do they collect all the money but they organized and I don't even know the number of volunteers that went to all of those schools on those days to help distribute those meals to the kids so we had volunteers we had the money and they were they said they told me when we first met oh this is Brian telling me this we're going to try to do 2000 but we're not sure

[00:25:00]
I'm going to hit it and he came and he said we did it we have enough we can do 2000 meals and we are just thrilled with this partnership not as much as APS is thrilled with this partnership so help me and recognizing these wonderful individuals for the family and friends of these great people we can recognize you again thank you for all that you do and please go through Google

[00:26:00]

[00:27:00]

[00:28:00]
OK Google

[00:29:00]
thank you

[00:30:00]
I'd like to thank the board of education for allowing me to speak early in the regular agenda and I also asked the board since they seem to be in a very good mood I asked them if they would allow me to sit with them on the dice as so that I would be able to see the expression from the speakers and that that was very important to me and and their I am I wanted to see it over here actually over by the stairs but they put me in the middle I want to thank everyone who has reached out in recent weeks to engage in the critical discussion about cultural sensitivity

[00:31:00]
I was very important and I thank you for that the fact that you have taken the time to be here tonight to write to call to be heard it speaks volumes it speaks volumes of your commitment to our students and that hardens all of us I really truly appreciate that we have heard your concerns your suggestions and are taking steps to ensure that cultural sensitivity in our classrooms on our campuses within our departments and throughout the school Community takes place Albuquerque Public Schools values diversity and honors are rich history of inclusion are diversity makes us strong it makes us unique and it's something that we celebrate and embrace and cherish each day

[00:32:00]
in thousands of classrooms across the district frankly the the success of our children depends on great part in great part on our ability to honor them as individuals and to meet their unique needs I want to offer a heartfelt apology on behalf of APS and on my behalf for any pain caused by the events that transpired at civil law High School last month I have personally reached out to the students and families directly affected by this situation as you've probably heard the people of teacher no longer works for APS however that's not the end of it in light of this event it is clear to him that we need to revisit strategies to help create a more

[00:33:00]
answering and accepting environment for all it breaks my heart it it truly it truly saddens me so much to think that these students that any any of our students may feel disrespected or unappreciated or unaccepted as a child who grew up many many years ago I know that feeling and there's no worse feeling that to to feel that you're not part of the group you're different you're less than whatever it is so that should never ever happen and that is not who we in APS are our job is to create a learning space where all students feel free to explore and to express

[00:34:00]
are not who someone else wants them to be a PS wants to do right by our students we live and die by that every single night every day when we're writing lesson plans everyone we're doing talking to communities that is the key component of our life's work and I will be the first to say that we're not perfect so when things go wrong hearing from you the stakeholders is exactly what we need it's not easy it wasn't easy to hear to hear your concerns and and what you felt but that's exactly what we needed to hear and that's what exactly what you needed to tell us and we have heard and we want to do better we need your wisdom we need your advice we need your guidance we don't have all the answers

[00:35:00]
when we design the aps academic master plan at the start of my journey as your superintendent one of our initial commitments was to educate the whole child in a way that removes barriers to learning Embraces individuality and connects to the students community in that realm we have implemented such initiatives as Native American studies and Leadership the bilingual Seal program the Native American government and economics classes offered for to high school students native language programs and the summer cultural enrichment program those are just a drop in the bucket of the kinds of things that we know we need to be able to move forward with but I'm telling you this because we have been trying we've been working but obviously we have so much more to do and again we need to do it together

[00:36:00]
still there is clearly more work to do and we are up to the task we're ready and especially if you're willing to back us and support us and help us in an effort to learn and grow as an organization we're seeking the assistance of local State national experts in in the areas of cultural competency training we all start seeking public input to make sure that training is that it's relevant and appropriate to very difficult things to do it's an easy thing to have a video up there and everybody watches it and then we can we can just say okay done but that's not the way we work we want to do it right and with your help we can let us let us see this as an opportunity to join together to strengthen our resolve and commitment to creating imagine this creating

[00:37:00]
a public school district where all students feel welcome accepted and above all safe this effort is just starting and I look forward to working with those in our community who have come forward offering help including many of you who are here tonight thank you so much information

[00:41:00]
complete solidarity with the letter is due to APS by the ACLU of New Mexico and all communities call for your attention to hear the voice of Native American families thank you Native American Studies classes with greatly enhance aps's ability to successfully serve the native student population benefit non-native students by giving them the opportunity to learn about their peers about Native American Social cultural and political history and about current policies impacting Native American students in the district develop all students critical thinking and Consciousness in regards to issues of race and discrimination and allowed APS the ability to genuinely demonstrate the value of diversity in the district moreover we support the implementation and growth of all antidepressants we thank you for your attention to this letter and we appreciate the action you have taken thus far however we can continue to be appalled by the harm caused by not only the teacher

[00:42:00]
play aps's failure to adequately ensure the safety and care for the young women involved immediately this was not an isolated incident of racism you are recently educated by the Native American community Through letters and public demonstrations of support for the young resilient Native American women who face sweat no student should ever face way to Advocate that our hair bodies language and land our sacred under no circumstances are native children to be harmed as we have been throughout Colonial and US History we will be sharing this letter thing publicly thank you for your time Native Studies good evening and I am Navajo Zuni and Hamas

[00:43:00]
connect to a clinic this is a traditional way of introducing myself in order to create relations of me being an aunt or grandmother a sister a daughter to people come here before you to explain that my tire is a reflection of what my mother taught me we were coral and turquoise so that the holy people will recognize us as an apple Tribal member an apple medicine man told me that our real name is not just dinner it is certainly not Navajo Navajo I was taught in childhood Memphis Tennessee

[00:44:00]
thank you and I have given you a document you can follow you'll get sued if you discontinues thank you I am a survivor of APs I graduated from San Diego High School in 2007 I can see that nothing has changed my sister currently attend a high school and has filed a complaint against herpes English teacher she is the date again and is constantly undermining she recently told me one of her teachers said Miss Myers told the principal told other staff members that one person's action should not be punished all of them and she does not want to do cultural sensitivity training how can we trust a principal who has no values

[00:45:00]
who tells us things but says another people like her are the problem people like her is what causes the systemic problems in APS what needs to happen now is cultural sensitivity training for all APS employees Native American history curriculum and literature Native American Heritage Month also needs to be recognized as well as Pueblo feast days ahead to the native Community who has come out and supported all of us the next four speakers

[00:46:00]
president Piercy members of the board superintendent reading before you say that you had an anti-racism training on August 30th I believe 2016 in response to the Volcano Vista situation with math class students in the classrooms where president Piercy ignored Channel 13 when he said no comment I'd have to say sorry superintendent you got to do a better job and board members you have to do a better job in training teachers 11 years and no no change with teachers being trained superintendent was trained what numbers were trained but teachers are not

[00:47:00]
and you are disrespecting students like we saw during the when it exploded and president Piercy said no more comments from students I didn't say that you had an agenda and I understand that but thank you I would like to go on the record of my daughter Mackenzie suffered a traumatic brain injury in October

[00:48:00]
16 and has since required of 504 plan this Easton was instrumental in helping her to acclimate back into school and also an offering help to her to enable her to succeed it sends me that my child supported her teacher exercising her rights as others have done on the other side and has received threats in and out of school as a result excuse me excuse me this is not for anybody else says their time okay you cannot make comments from the audience here we will ask you to be removed if you do that that is not fair you understand not fair not fair I'm telling you please thank you

[00:49:00]
we shouldn't have to have a 17 year old be scared to go to school because she supported her teacher instead of the other girl and she does know the other girl and I purposely not said anything negative about her because she's a child but I can think of negative things to say about the other side and I'm not going to I'm just here to support Miss Easton how do you know my husband's not Native American do you know that you don't I'm from Oklahoma the majority of my friends are Native American it is nothing to do with that is how many people are going to miss out on her education I mean I'm not saying she didn't make a mistake I'm saying she was the best teacher and if you were to look at the scores of the actors are much better well if she said ok Google

[00:50:00]
can't even let other people speak you just have to speak on top of them all I came to do was say my opinion you say yours I say mine that's how it works you don't get to talk go ahead OK Google in my own experience as a student and as a parent with both experienced racism in our schools this is not unknown thing this happened recently in about education came forward and personally hand delivered to the board around a rapid response protocol to racism

[00:51:00]
send not much has been said about that it's been completely ignored that kind of silence is deafening and it's also shows that the board has come and the aps is completed with racism I do not heartfelt really believe that that's not always the case we've had been able to also trained some of the board members and the superintendent on anti-racism we offered those services for the most part free of charge even though they should have been we should have been compensated for those kind of things the board should make that investment to ensure that all people and that APS are trained on anti-racism and that we are not complacent at all with racism thank you my name is Alejandra Tierney and I'm a 17 year old senior a high school but you might remember me as the one of the leaders of March for our lives when I trespassed on your property as a student so because you were taking NRA money I'm here today because this is a student I am outraged that to my indigenous peers assaulted by an individual in this school

[00:52:00]
Play Drake that the board and trusted to provide an equitable education I'm outraged not only because it took over 30 days for the teacher to resign and you didn't fire her I'm outraged because the board members in this room chose to remain silent rather than punish the teacher who's racially charged assault were in question I'm outraged because while the families and friends of those impacted this very Podium and poured their emotions out this board remained mostly silent and we're almost dismissive in the ways that they offered no support to those who have been affected putting in cultural classes like Latin American studies and the bilingual seal aren't huge steps they're the bare minimum what is this what are the steps to cultural sensitivity and most importantly anti-racism that superintendent mentioned before thank you for speakers

[00:53:00]
Justine Teva Julie hinceman Demetrious Johnson and Nicole Martin you guys are talking about you you guys you got don't forget that it took over a month to to get this lady to be fired and don't forget that the only reason that you guys fired her was because of the media that you guys have to put up with this was only at this was only for

[00:54:00]
comfort of you guys it wasn't about the student it was never about the students it was never about about being inclusive or handling anti-racism it was only because of the media crap National crap sorry that you guys got don't forget that what's today it's December 5th and we're barely hearing an apology from the superintendent right now today in December this happened in October good evening and thank you for the opportunity to speak I am a member of open and I'm here to speak to you about also about inclusion for children with disabilities I am also asking for more mandatory training for cultural sensitivity as well as special education

[00:55:00]
specifically to the principles and new principals so they can better support and understand their teachers I was going to read an email that I received for my son but I do not have enough time but this email was a call from a teacher because she had reached out to her principal as well as to her head special ed teacher trying to get more support for the classroom the principal he did not understand they need more training obviously not just in special education center

[00:56:00]
hello I'm Demetrious Johnson and I'm the older brother and Mackenzie Johnson who was called the bloody Indian at Seabrook high school I'm really upset I am really I'm really done with this last meeting I was really I could not believe the disrespect that was shown to my my sister her peers and all of us in the room for for limiting our time to 1 minute I commented last last meeting about the one minute I think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's bullshit that we keep having to hear these time limits these structures that were not made for us this apology that was given to us more than a whole month it took for this apology to happen and even you say superintendent reading that you want you want APS to be a place that makes the first districts in the nation to make to make

[00:57:00]
why why why why why why why stop there you could be the first district you could be the first district in America in the United States to have a curriculum sit around indigenous people's Instagram

[00:58:00]
people are treated amongst are white peers is disgusting seeing it not only are the free education level but also when we have to go through these white institutions of college just to get a freaking piece of paper to say we know what we're talking about and then we have to go and create Grassroots organizations to teach these kids what should already be taught in schools is beyond disrespectful is disgusting and we're ready for a change and we're going to bring it to you the next four speaker

[00:59:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:00:00]
get there this is where we at so everybody's got to take their medicine just like we have over 5,414.92 cents 1492 what may you we've done it I'm sure you can too my name is Shannon Johnson of yours I'm actually talking as a mother right now I would like to make a note to all of you and hear me now I am worried about my daughter's safety at school because just as of yesterday you know she's still has peers and teachers giving her snide remarks so I need protection for my daughter now that her name and picture is out in the National level I would like for

[01:01:00]
pair to have protection from your APS internal Police Department that did your own investigation as well so if they can conduct that I'm sure they can make protection for have protection for my daughter and Indigenous students at Siegel High School as well thank you for hearing me out hello my name is Benjamin Avenue in American studies at UNM I've been teaching 200300 classes at UNM for over five years so I'm here today because of my outrage at the racist incidents that she will Mom and as a historian I want to highlight that racism and colonialism are foundational to the United States and to us Society so these are not contradictions that can be papered over with

[01:02:00]
appeals to diversity and inclusion so I just asked the board to take all of these demands from community members very seriously for addressing racism and colonialism these are just the bare minimum just the beginning and overall it's going to take a profound social transformation both within APS and Society at large to really address incidents like these and prevent them from happening thank you Google

[01:03:00]
is there for years centuries we accepted your people from across the oceans with our Open Hearts and open minds and and believe that we all can live in Freedom do we all can live equally I can believe in each other and we all believe in one great Creator and and to have this happen to our students is a it's not Native American history even your own people are being discriminated against I see homeless kids on the streets angles Society

[01:04:00]
the next for Lonnie tiedemann Noel Begay Lori burrup and Tina Turner educator I had this recent event it really breaks my heart I think all kids should feel safe going to school and their teachers should make them feel

[01:05:00]
you're welcome and appreciated and so this event has definitely showed me what kind of teacher I don't want to be but thank you for the opportunity to speak I would also like to ask the board what changes you plan on making to the school budget to address more special education training and cultural sensitivity training for the 2019 - 2020 school year hello hello OK Google

[01:06:00]
happy discussion but it is unnecessary discussion first I would like to say I'm sorry for what happened to those native women in that school I'm even more tired of saying I'm sorry for these occurrences happening in the first place I'm a graduate from steeple high school and I can only imagine the repercussions the young ladies are currently facing it's very disheartening and I can say that I have been there I've lost friends due to bursting bubbles about people's favorite teachers it came down to my father who worked for APD to come in to play to speak with was the principal because I was threatened with a gun and a teacher did nothing this isn't the first time that this is ever going to happen this won't be our last time fighting for Injustice and he just

[01:07:00]
Miss Easton at least apologizes because as long as it doesn't help thank you thank you thank you I'm in the minority tonight in Boise and I first want to say that I am sorry to the girls who are offended by Misty and but in my heart and everyone who really knows Missy knows that she never meant that to be racist she was acting out a historical character

[01:08:00]
on Halloween she made a mistake but I know that her and I know that her intentions were to be racist and I know that if she had the opportunity that she would apologize to these girls for making her feel that way Miss Easton isn't just the type of teacher that shows up to collect a paycheck she cares deeply about her students no matter their ethnicity and she goes out of their way her way to help them however she can she's the reason why she does have been so high my son who graduated last year his only regret was never having her as a teacher because she brought that level to a totally higher level and the honors bank which is consistently on recognized as being a fabulous teacher who is meant so much to them so the kids that will never have the opportunity thank you

[01:09:00]
good evening my name is Tina farrenkopf I'm a member of the passport quality tribe from the state of Maine I'm also the executive director of the national Indian youth Council here in Albuquerque one of the things that we do is run a Workforce Development training program so the incidents here that we're discussing have been really dismaying for our organization as we trained people and to enter the workforce and these are the future work force we urge them to stay in school but if they're not feeling safe and protected in the schools how can we stand behind those words there are our future and if they're not feeling safe at school but not if it's coming from their peers but their teachers to reiterate the others

[01:10:00]
India on cultural sensitivity incompetency and we address the issues of racism and we strengthen policies to ensure that occurs thank you Google the right thing to do is to give us more time to give us a dialogue but it is not in the policy but it is so obvious to me

[01:11:00]
that right now it's more important is a quick lesson in what white privilege is while I have no doubts that this teacher is a good teacher based off of these test scores of these parents are bringing in what they need to understand is that while they get the good test scores they get the the higher grades we have to do with dropping out even Beyond this to insinuate the aps succeeding in any way is a falsehood your graduation statistics are falsehoods and fraudulent the 60 70 is even beyond that my God states that only 60% to graduating seniors can even pass the GED meaning that almost half of your students are not leaving high schools with the high school education this is a systemic problem this isn't just indigenous students that have to deal with this it is every student that has to deal with your families and it's not until that we start recognizing and Indigenous as intelligence that our systems have been about 21%

[01:12:00]
thank you actually came tonight to speak in support of the bond issue and that I'm happy to increase my dollar 30 cents a day that I'm spending on my property tax to whatever it's going to be a dollar fifty cents a day so I'll be supporting the

[01:13:00]
coming from a background in city government and seeing how City Council meetings are run where they've actually set aside some special meetings so that people could be able to speak longer than 1 minute on a topic but I just want to say there's no excuse for people being rude and shouting and interrupting and so perhaps some of the rules that the city council uses where they actually stopped meetings and vacate the room until people are in order so I thank you for your service and your willingness to listen and just thank you

[01:14:00]
Luna and Zuni here in New Mexico and I wanted to at least come and represent the City of Albuquerque Commission on Indian Affairs and indicate to you as an appointment member of that commission that were aboard by the situation that occurred up at Cibola High School we wanted to stand with our students and I'm talking all students here and just registered Our concern over this as a former executive at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center here in Albuquerque one of the things that we engaged in and ironically one of the people that was engaged in it was one of the graduates in developing a curriculum of funeral for teachers and for students in New Mexico and Native American history I'll be glad to help pull that in and talk more about that at another time other organizations such as the Americans for Indian opportunity

[01:15:00]
something like Indians 101 if that would be helpful but I would just thank you for your time Barbara hi my name is Barbara Burnside and she's a survivor of the boarding school system I was attending a training in San Diego California for the White House the effects of

[01:16:00]
when I heard about this I was so shocked and speechless that shit like this is still happening today that happened to my grandma and 99 years ago why is it still happening today and the only way we can make a change and we can go forward and really have some progress is if we start acknowledging the truth the very first welfare system the next four speakers Virginia Virginia

my name is shraddha Patel and I'm a member of the South Asian community and I work for the New Mexico Asian Family Center we stand and support of all students and Stan and solidarity of racial Equity training throughout APS APS is a long history of racist incidents that go unaddressed what happened to these indigenous students is not an isolated incident and it is devastating that it's only when indigenous and people of color raise their voices and expand their energy fighting instead of healing that we get a response institutional change needs to be made especially when not every incident gets addressed the board has the power to implement policy decisions as a rapid response Crisis Intervention why don't like similar to when there's a death bringing in counselors and offering support to students to address racism you can't be proactive anymore but you can react you have that option and grieving is not always the death of a person when Mary Easton cut off that students braid she killed a part of her of her history so we're asking you

[01:18:00]
how to react and to implement a policy to support our students and create a safer environment thank you I have the privilege of teaching at Barcelona Elementary School to some Stellar students with an awesome staff and a fantastic and administrator Kathy Trejo on November 28th are 3rd grade classes went on a field trip to the Albuquerque Museum to see the Hispanic Cultural artifacts as we were viewing the artifacts the students were approached by several couples that asked them if they were from a private school the students said no they just attend a regular APS public school and not long after that they approached the teacher who are one of the teachers and the couple things because

[01:19:00]
is the students were asking such great questions they were so well-behaved and I just wanted to let you know that in the South Valley we are working really hard to meet all the students needs and our community recognizes it so thank you special education and I have been gone for the last month and so I was appalled to hear the situation that happened one of the girls is enrolled in an SS one class there's not been a teacher in that classroom since the beginning of the school year there's a social worker part-time

[01:20:00]
for teachers administrators across the board it's an injustice to our children and when they get labeled like this young girls that's able to did and the kids in the classroom are using racial slurs they're not being stopped my granddaughter has been labeled the bed mental girl and that's how she's known so imagine that there needs to be additional training and resources allocated to these to the schools more importantly there needs to be a teacher and he to acknowledge that and they need to support their thank you hey my name is Melissa so I want to acknowledge that we are on Sunday period

[01:21:00]
predominantly white high school as well and it's been subjected to some of the same derogatory remarks that some of these kids have experience and so I definitely see it as like a systemic problem this is not the first time the first instance were a student felt you know targeted by this teacher as well as you know other teachers in this school as we've heard you know people are coming out with testimonies and so it definitely is a problem and I hope you are listening to people today I don't think training alone is going to help a lot of times training is just an image to portray that you are actually that you were doing something when you're actually not so it's going to go beyond the training and we want to see you know and actions and employees treating you know students you know what just have an equitable education system and I also want to

[01:22:00]
also encourage a curriculum to accurately are our last four speakers Cody I can't see I can't Shawna maybe I can't read the handwriting Christine means debt and Cheryl Linda Bennett's hello my name is outrageous

[01:23:00]
or rather I don't think I felt I think APS failed me whenever I didn't graduate whenever I got drunk in the 8th grade and no one ever talked about it closed meetings you know within the school to deal with it whenever a few weeks later whenever I got caught with some grass yeah nothing so I understand and I'm sorry and I want them to continue whenever like someone with white privilege right now

[01:24:00]
thank you Cody thank you Cody hi good evening Google I think one of the first request as a parent that I would have that has a negative effect on Native American students is for the district to band The used to wearing of Native American costumes and all APS Schools District 1

[01:25:00]
the negative side effects that have happened to our children to children when they see themselves mocked used as caricatures uses costumes for other students entertainment for other students fund is psychologically damaging this is not just a native issue this is a student safety issue APS has to make it clear has to make it very clear that this behavior is unacceptable apathy and an action condones with his teacher chose to do that day she made a choice she is an educated person educated by the current system she chose to do this was an assault on a student and a minor if this happened anywhere else there would have been criminal charges involved

[01:26:00]
what time is Deborah Cadet and I'm a Community member here in Albuquerque and I'm here tonight to address the board to underline something that I heard at the meeting last week which is a call a demand for indigenous studies at APS it should be required in APS high schools I mean one reason for that is what the students said last week is that a lot of the teachers either were trained you know educated themselves at APS or at another public high school and didn't learn and they can't teach what they don't know when she is Real History the settler Colonial context that were all in I ended up with a few different degrees I've got a degree in chemistry one thing that really concerns me about what we're facing in New Mexico is poisoning our water with fracking and they are trying to Deep Well inject it so we don't have it anymore do we understand the

[01:27:00]
populations that are weak and we're being preyed upon by the corporations we don't understand science and we don't understand the settler Colonial contacts that were in and we don't understand that have to go to school every day knowing

[01:28:00]
do they have long hair and they'll still get picked on you know I've been to APS I've been to a bunch of different high schools throughout New Mexico Gallup Shiprock I'm from Shiprock I am Navajo but we we were taught never to touch other people's hair and for that lady to come after the teacher a grown woman to come at a student with this with the scissor is unacceptable and it is it is unethical behavior and it is just dishonoring and every language that you can imagine so honor our people our native students because they already come from 500 years Plus thank you for your input that concludes

[01:29:00]
thank you we're going to special issues if people want to leave will give you a time to leave or if you want to stay around that's fine we have the introduction to framework for Career and Technical education that's a discussion item percentage of Dr Madeline Marvel's CTE coordinator

[01:30:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:31:00]
good evening thank you

[01:32:00]
Dr Piercy members of the board superintendent reading thank you for allowing me time to present you with a proposed framework for Career and Technical education for Albuquerque Public Schools I'm joined by Dr Cheryl Williams director of APs CTE who's available to answer specific questions you may have and do we have the PowerPoint there we go so go two of our academic master plan addresses College and Career Readiness and our CTE Department plays a crucial role in meeting that need for our students tonight I will briefly outline four goals that will align District resources and provide expanded advisement and educational opportunities for all students we have a number of very strong programs in our high schools as you can see by our recognitions tonight and we would like to continue to

[01:33:00]
support and grow these programs well we don't have every pathway in every High School in APS most of our pathways are available in each of our learning zones for our students and we're quite proud of that so the support for our students begins at the students homeschool most students first experience with a CTE course begins at their home high school as a way to explore possible interest or aptitude for some students this is the beginning of a pathway that culminates and certification a college major or a career and for others it's just a way to test the water and to see where they're interested and abilities lie many of our current programs of study terminate in certifications as you can see and we'd like to increase these opportunities for students to

[01:34:00]
change certifications and possible stacked credentials that could be used to enter the workplace in high-paying jobs following graduation there's some additional certifications we have so many certifications we couldn't even fit them on one side and pretty proud of also so what's the port for our schools looks like supporting our schools and means insurance and Pathways we promote are supported by data that says well paying jobs available in those fields so that we're aligning are College and Career Education to the actual needs of the marketplace and preparing students for jobs that exist in our community's making sure that our administrative counselors and other teachers are aware of the benefits of Career and Technical education for all of our students so that we can encourage students to explore these courses earlier in their High School careers

[01:35:00]
we must also begin exposing students earlier in their to Career exploration and research so that they can make truly informed decisions about the path that we will that they will select for their Futures so we would like to propose that students at every grade begin researching and exploring information about potential careers for our second goal because of because one of the benefits of CTE is the ability to teach and reinforce the kind of soft skills that are students will need in the workplace our goal number two is embedding the common Career Technical core practices in all CTE courses these career-ready practices apply to all programs of study the career ready practices include 12 states that address the knowledge skills and dispositions that are important to becoming career ready these are kind of a CTE

[01:36:00]
version of the 21st century skills and would be applicable to all students not just students enrolled in CT courses college-bound students as well these practices are already being taught through CTE what we're recommending is making this teaching explicit so that students can readily identify the skills and mindsets that they are required so as they leave education in our schools they can identify that they have not only mastered content in some areas but they have also mastered the skills that will make them successful employees and citizens increase

[01:37:00]
direction through specially designed facilities and business Partnerships this is what we're proposing is an expansion that would build on current areas of success to really solidify Pathways for students so the proposal involves a couple of what I'm calling for lack of a better term text centers Texas are at the heart of many state and District reform around Career and Technical education they allow districts to really maximize efficient use of specialized equipment so that state-of-the-art equipment can be used they maximize human capital finding highly qualified CTE teachers who are up to date and all the latest industry skills is there are valuable and rare resource and it's important for us to really maximize access to that resource so that

[01:38:00]
call students are able to to access that CEC currently functions as a sort of Hub by leveraging transportation to provide Equitable access for all students and specialized programs and has been a successful model in the district for 40 years what were proposing is an expansion of a model that's already been successful to APS and broadening the range of programs that students have access to this would also create a central point of contact for business partners wishing to support a pathway through work-based learning opportunities so we're proposing an additional Tech Hub in Northern or Western location in the city that would be served by the same network of buses that we use for CEC and would house an additional series of Pathways that students could access

[01:39:00]
and would like I said be a contact point for industry for mentorship mentorships and internships in those areas so CeCe would continue to support the strong programs that it has for both of these Tech hubs we would leverage flexible scheduling to allow upper class students to take their core classes at their home high school and pursuit of pursue certifications and dual Credit Central location so that they could be both completely students at their home high schools and have sequences of upper level classes in CTE that would let them stack certifications with dual credit classes online to the pathway so the final four is about aligning all of those resources that we have for students to make these choices It's the final piece of tying everything together

[01:40:00]
is there to assure that students are College and Career ready one of the big changes that we have is no longer is education college or career now it's College and Career essentially we want to prepare all students for all options for their lives as we know students will need additional training After High School for most of them whether it be a vocational program or trade school or college education and all of our students even those entering four-year college programs will need those workplace Readiness skills that will allow them to be productive employees so aligning all of these together rather than siloing them in separate areas is important so we would create a College and Career Readiness Department that would align the work of CTE with college prep in Ovid

[01:41:00]
displacement with through the College Board and dual credit course work so that a student could essentially mix and match a program of studies to meet their individual needs and all of those areas would be more closely aligned most of the resources we need are already available in the district what we really need is to tie them together in a thoughtful way and communicate clearly they're availability so that pathway would start with students helping to build a pathway starting to understand what their career options were and begin exploring at their homeschool we would give them those career skills and 21st century skills that they need to be successful in the workplace we would create an expansion of opportunities and Pathways for them to access and then we would coordinate all of those resources together and make them more transparent

[01:42:00]
so that students could more fully realize how they can put the pieces together to make a College and Career plan for themselves and with that Dr Williamson I stand for questions great thank you very much in terms of numbers of students who are Exploring Careers who are getting certificates and who have actually become placed in these various Pathways that you've described whether it's mechanics or nursing I know that with

[01:43:00]
play CEC in the nursing program we have some idea what I've been told every time I've gone down there is that a number of the students actually go on to get their nurse practitioner degree but they have a jump start on nursing so I'm just wondering do we have is this is this information kept in some way that we can get an idea to glean of the 80 something thousand students and the numbers eligible how many are actually in these programs and how many are moving on so I can defer to Dr Williams but we do keep data on student enrollment participation certification programs and certificates if you're asking about employment after graduation to that pathway Cheryl do you have data on that I'm asking about both good evening we do have a

[01:44:00]
follow up program through the ped and the Workforce Solutions Center and they go after the students through their ID numbers because we do not keep track of social security numbers and so we have gotten some of that data we utilize that data within our call Perkins program when we have to report to the feds how many of our students take two or more sequence of courses rigorous courses that concentrated in for example automotive technology or construction technology computer aided drafting which is the cat classes and our pre-engineering classes and so we know of the students that go on to UNM and we know of the students that goes on to CNM through the Workforce Solutions we're able to track the students that go out into the world of work

[01:45:00]
okay I just I would love to hear a presentation that has some of those details by quadrant or by school if possible including CEC thank you are there comments board member Peterson so I'm curious for the tech lab North Carolina has been purchased but I have met with Genji to discuss that is an option what what additional resources do we need to come up with to make this happen so in the near term I will be putting together a proposal for our budget steering

[01:46:00]
video requesting a senior director position to coordinate all the work of that College and Career Readiness Department in Edition I'd like a district level coordinator for internships and mentorships cuz I'd like to get busy right away on that and I'm going to ask for a 0.2 allocation for each high school so that each High School can house on site an internship mentorship coordinator align to whatever Pathways they have at their school I wonder if they can possibly be wrapped into a legislative support in regards to the legislature and you ask what else resources that we may be able to do I am suggesting that APS put into the legislative request not simply

[01:47:00]
each individual legislature that represents the schools within the district but at a larger level to be aware of the fact that if you if you create such a situation and such an environment to move forward for career Readiness in the world of work we need to have state-of-the-art equipment that is available and ready within the services to provide to the students therefore at the point in time where the state is saying there's a massive funding and related to money within state government and one time Capital outlay funding is available at this time I suggest that a PS legislative branch get together and make sure that state of the art equipment is being requested for such a time as this keeping in mind that I just want to say that in our discussion we've been told that Rio Rancho Public Schools is now about to

[01:48:00]
vocational CTE high school and the reason I know that is because I've been promoting the possibility of having a hub in regards regionally for tech center and to have that tech center we do need that because our students in APS are winning in the state we're winning regionally but when we go nationally we're coming in 3rd we're coming in 4th and 5th when we can be coming in first because at times we do not have the state-of-the-art equipment available to them to practice on and to have best practices that would take them to the level that they need to go so it sounds like I'm just trying to think what this will look like it seems like the portion should just be insufficient funding in the SEC but

[01:49:00]
give me specific funding for facilities that we should be working towards I think it's I think it's two full so I think there's FTE funding in terms of getting some immediate coordination planning and increasing the opportunities for mentorships internships which I think is a real valid need in all of our schools but down the road is if we start to develop a tech Hub that involves multiple kinds of capital spending and planning and legislative requests and capital requests and such briefly what more can we should be doing to develop the partnership with other other so we already have many of those relationships Cheryl and her teachers have a pretty extensive list

[01:50:00]
relationships but as we look to develop new relationships one of the things that I think Tech hubs could function as is single points of contact for those Pathways so that when business Community wanted to make a connection they knew where to go because part of the challenge with APS is knowing who to call or where to go or how to even offer your help so I think that we could advertise those as points of contact for those Pathways thank you Google the additional work we have going on with CTE across the state I want to go in terms of the data and the connection

[01:51:00]
and I think what you're looking at is the number of students outside of those that maybe are not always supported through the Carl Perkins funding that are also getting those related certificates and what's happening to them in terms of employment passed that Dr Williams is correct because we do have the data at Workforce Solutions in terms of students we know we have employment data because we have to report that to the Department of Labor so but it's absolutely correct we collect data according to like Social Security numbers not by the student ID numbers so there is a tremendous amount of data that's available but somehow how we connect that day so that it could become richer and a way to really sort of emphasize or really highlight the impact that APS is having on employment post those secondary credentials or the other credentials that were getting for students when

[01:52:00]
play choose not to go to UNM or they're not going out to CNM but they've earned a credential of some sort while they were at APS so there might be some strategies that I think we need to think about how that could look but I know it also needs to be a partnership with ped because ped is also part of the the issue there because of the the combining of information you've got FERPA and you've got protected information here and how we how we balance that but I think it can be done I think there's an opportunity there I just want to say that I'm excited to see that it's an integrated curriculum and you're talking about building soft skills at a much earlier age and starting to introduce the concept of skills that we need for work as we're getting you know as we're going because every student needs that we're hearing from the business industry that it's the soft skills side of it that is not coming I'm just even thinking about like the conversation tonight the whole issue or just even cultural humility

[01:53:00]
some of my questions that I had were predominantly around the the development of this plan and to me you know it looks like there was a lot of work done internally like what is APS going to do with APS and I was curious about the strategy around really engaging with the business partners and the business community so that it's you know that they're also helping to inform so that we can be flexible as the school district as the business industry is you know it was changing because we might be preparing now for jobs that we know are available now but we also know that there are jobs that are going to occur that

[01:54:00]
but we have to be at at that partnership level with the business industry so that we can make sure that we're Adept and we're flexible and we're always moving along so even though we're moving towards like a tech Hub you know but that Tech Hub has to be flexible it has to be responsive to the needs of the business community so that we can make sure that we're also preparing students for what the business industry is asking us so are there plans in this to include or have some sort of like advisory committee that includes a business industry Partners to to help us really develop our work so I'll let I'll let Dr Williams talk about we have business advisories currently for each of our Pathways not let her talk a little bit about that great question and the reason is great because I currently have in place plans to have a discussion with the business partners that we currently have

[01:55:00]
and based on the program of studies are the pathways that we currently have in Albuquerque Public Schools and we have quite a few major business partners some that are in our advisory teams that work with our students that are going towards UNM and some that are in our advisory teams with our students that are going to CNM but overall we have a major group of a business partners that are looking for students who are leaving the public school system and want to be able to go ready to work and to provide those skills and so my belief is if the board was to collectively work with me in that round robin situation where we have our business partners as teams with each one of you and your Zone superintendents hearing from them what their needs are for their

[01:56:00]
businesses and what they think that we as APS should be able to provide to our students to enable them to be able to be Workforce ready and So the plan is already set and I will give further information on that thanks the other question I had was talked about the 12 Kerr ready practices and those how are those going to be evaluated and so I think is we're looking at our framework I'm really curious about how students are moving through this framework the feedback that you're getting and you know the kind of preparedness that they're actually knowing where they are whether they're on track or they're not on track what are some of the feedback that they're getting so that they can move through the pieces of knowing that they're making their making

[01:57:00]
progress the other thing I just wanted to mention to is I agree 100% with the internship and the mentorship piece and making sure that that's existing at each high school because what we do know is that an internship mentorship placement for students in terms of work is a huge resiliency factor for those young people that have an opportunity to enter into any kind of meaningful work experience or internship experience it's going to prepare them just 100 full to make that decision about their career or their college pathway so but I know it takes a lot of energy and work to do that because and hopefully that this person is not hung up in a classroom but really is in the community that can actually be beating the pavement building those relationships with the business industry so that we have those Partnerships where students can have a meaningful placement and a mentorship and then finally the only thing that I want to add to is

[01:58:00]
really strong programs and how can we be a consultant and advisor in that piece is we're moving along because there are tremendous amount of resources and it's a marrying of the incredible investment that's made in our state through us

[01:59:00]
Joel already and whether it's money that's coming through our agency or even through our VR agencies because they also have money to prepare students with disabilities and we need to make sure that we're you know we're taking advantage of those opportunities and one of the things that I'm charged with at this level at the state level is to make sure those Partnerships exist so that we're actually using the money and we're using it well and that we're actually preparing young people in a much more coherent way so thank you if I have that question it'll come back to me let me see if I keep forgetting that we have a person on these are you still there absolutely

[02:00:00]
good morning in the back of reminders she's waiting to see if you've got that question I think however I'm really it's really good to hear that there is a business advisory on each one of the pathways so that was exciting to hear about I'm I'm interested to know though if there are and I'm sorry if I didn't hear this but I was listening really well I'm interested to know if the economic development groups are part of that business Advisory Group that's a shame in addition to that I was going to ask the folks to expand just a little bit more on the internet I was also curious in the presentation you talked about there's a number of new certifications and I was just wondering if we could hear about a couple of those

[02:01:00]
their businesses within the economic Forum that participates one of those in is Sandia base another is pnm and another is Intel yes they are all in that but they do participate individually with our teachers and our schools for example Sandia Labs participate with the pathways that we do have a Quaver pnm participates very well with the pathways that we have at Albuquerque High School and that's just an example of some of the individualized businesses that are part of the economic forum and you had a second and third question and I don't remember the second one

[02:02:00]
mentorship through the City of Albuquerque at most of the high schools APS used to in the past have a strong mentorship internship program a few years when it was leaving the funding was cut therefore there was not when Yolanda Garcia retired they didn't become a coordinator that would coordinate that activity however many of our teachers in the Career Technical education Area Teachers their classes in the morning and then some of them in the afternoon starting 11:30 their students are out in the internship mentorship program and those teachers work collectively with the business

[02:03:00]
when is The Advisory teams on the growth of employability skills for those students so it does exist it does not exist in every High School in the third question I would hope that our Economic Development groups are Economic Development Partners I hope that we are a pitch I hope that APS and our public schools are part of their own businesses into our state and our community and one last final thing is my own personal experience early in life I worked on a 9-month certificate programs that I was interested in is how many kids go on to achieve additional education or higher education and it was the being comfortable with attending CNM

[02:04:00]
2.9 month certificate degree program on Commercial Printing that I was able to fill comfortable enough to go on and work on my bachelor's degree in communication and journalism so I think it can be a pathway and it can open doors for students who may not be comfortable with higher education at that time in their life so I do appreciate having this pathway for for our students as well thank you remember Patterson Road

[02:05:00]
and bring a parent in to talk about what they do for a living just having those conversations about what what jobs are even out there is a really good way for kids to start current reading materials are more centered on non-fiction texts so there's not fiction text available to students that exposes them to different kinds of queries but just having that having that exposure so that students aren't aware of only the careers that are that exist in their own families exposure starting Avid Pathways in elementary schools and so we're starting to do that pilot programs in

[02:06:00]
I'm Zone 2 right now oh wonderful thank you and I was going to go to the elementary school kids their play is like their work so if you kind of look at that that's it's easy to figure out how to how to work that in an elementary level Middle School have no idea but so I think it's important to try to get those kind of Pathways started earlier areas of concern has been that aptitude identification identifies a large number of minority and female students for stem careers that they don't sell identify as an interest so one of the things that I would like to do is start giving some aptitude testing in the Middle School to identify student

[02:07:00]
as for areas that they may not have self-identified as areas of strength and do you do that is that done for the high school Pathways I mean is there an aptitude test that they do at the high school level not comprehensively there are work keys and other various tests that are used sporadically but we haven't we don't have a my opinion is we don't have a good and comprehensive system for having students explore their app to kids and their interests and then more importantly tying that information to what do you do about that what courses do you take in high school what dual credit courses do you take what careers do you utilize those skills and how might you explore those through an internship or mentorship

[02:08:00]
what time are there like this is just not this is just not for me and we know that's happened to lots of people that we that we know another thing that I would like to know is these different Pathways I as as member Garcia I would like to know what schools they're at so I would like to know what's that Volcano Vista you know I don't we can certainly you know I mean we're talking about Learning Zone three I know a lot of these are out of my I mean I know that they're out of my district and so I would just like to know what's their information technology has marketing fundamentals of marketing

[02:09:00]
it has a culinary arts Pro start at Cibola for example and it it at Volcano Vista they have a massive great automotive shop but they don't have a teacher right that's what yeah but the house have audio and film at at Volcano Vista and they have culinary arts program at Volcano Vista they have marketing and they have journalism they have quite a few things that would be a good thing just to have to be able to provide you with that information along with what certifications that would be wonderful and then I know you were talking about the tech centers and you know having everything centralized so when you're talking about you know businesses obviously aren't centralized

[02:10:00]
what what would that look like at the tech centers in terms of the the business relationship to the tech center I don't so potentially some of the learning would happen as part of a workplace situation so potentially students would be bused from a tech center to a work site to do learning potentially business partners could come to a tech center and do an informational night for students on careers and and things like that I think it could be a very flexible arrangement I think some of the some of the learning depending on the level of the facilities could happen on site with business members co-teaching with a licensed teacher here they could happen off-site at a business location some of those models running start for careers was done through the city that had several of those models

[02:11:00]
who are courses were dual credit courses were taught by business members but we granted High School Credit so I think there's a lot of potential for flexible Arrangements that could happen and then I know when you were talking about like a Tech Lab North or west I'm going to of course but when we're kind of looking at CEC and then we're looking for the valley I just think that we need to think about those people coming from you know and coming from Baltimore I mean it's still a long distance so I think that we need to keep in mind what's going to be best for the students as always that's what we should think of first so you know so one of my one of my rationals and my third non-negotiables is it that this would

[02:12:00]
do transportation in the model that exists now so that if a student could get to their home High School be at Atrisco Heritage or Volcano Vista whatever that a an APS bus would take them to one of these hubs if they didn't want to drive or didn't have a driver's license yet or and transportation and transportation and then I know you talked about aligning that if you came up with this new Department it would help with the lining resources and coursework but I'm kind of going how much I would have everything completely different than what we do when it comes to kids being able to choose courses I think that it should have way more flexibility and choosing courses but they can't really deviate that much from what's required right actually students have so one of the things that we are finding

[02:13:00]
now that's becoming quite frankly becoming a little bit of a problem is kids having a little bit of too much free time on their hands by the time they're seniors they have a fair number of electives plus as students are accessing dual credit classes they're getting one full credit in a semester so they're sort of acquiring elective credits at Double the pace and often they're taking that after the school day so we find that students have by the time they're juniors and seniors have a lot more flexibility in their schedule then they've had in the past but we don't always have a lot of options for them so they have the availability right absolutely and then really kind of the last thing I know businesses know what they need so speaking of representative was saying it's like speaking to the businesses is really important because they know exactly what they need and they

[02:14:00]
play every business that I have spoken to they want to work with the kids they want to have internships and mentorships they want to be involved so we need to make sure that they really truly are cuz they know better than we do what what they need out there and then the last thing is when you're talking about creating a new Department which I'm always skeptical of is how much is that going to going to cost so the new Department would be one new senior director who would oversee the world for senior director an internship coordinator at the district level and then each school would be in the neighborhood of 440,000.000 increase

[02:15:00]
and includes benefits sure you're on

[02:16:00]
because I know that that's not necessarily available to all of our students so there are some students that even though dual credits available it's not readily available for them for a number of reasons one they're either not really ready to be on an off-site campus because they need extra support so they need they may not get the support that they need at a CNN campus or at another campus and so I'm concerned about that and then I'm concerned about the internship mentorship piece and that is readily available to all students and not just the students that are receiving CTE support transition Services last week to talk about ways that we could remove barriers for special education students

[02:17:00]
listen to assess all of these Pathways and internships and mentorships at a higher level because I think that currently we have not just for them but for all students and barriers that we need to be really thoughtful about removing and your credit is one of those so one of the advantages to having some centers is we can offer increasingly and even in our Comprehensive High Schools we're offering dual credit classes on our campus with a facilitation by our teachers and a teacher of record at UNM or CNM or often CNM hiring on our teachers to teach those courses so I think that that is evolving in a way to give people more access to those horses it makes a lot of sense because we're using the existing infrastructure right right places

[02:18:00]
covered most of what I think so if I kind of summarize here I think one of the things that you need to do is to work with the policy analyst and the legislation to see what is available from a legislative point of view in terms of funding in terms of the kinds of things we need to have for CTE I think we need to flush out this business advisory model in other words for the pieces the pathways but I don't see how that all really

[02:19:00]
good idea and and there's a lot of things that we're doing here in our schools I like that a lot because it's available to students like you said the access is an issue but I also think of the facilities more of a virtual model in other words there's some in our schools or some other schools there's some in Wagner facility there's some in the Carpenters Union where they're big facility so these all these facilities so they know kind of where are those things exactly how are they being done I'll guarantee if you want state of the art equipment the Wagner facility for our bus repair

[02:20:00]
I think it's very important to Baseline where you are now as far as any others as best you can figure out what metrics are useful to you and where are we now because if you start going down this road and now we're not sure where we were and we're not sure where we're going and so it's really important to measure how you want to do that but whatever you can do to kind of Baseline where you are I will be important because if you can show where you're making improvements and then why you're not and then what do I have to do in that area right so I think that's important stuff

[02:21:00]
Mitchell Elementary School elementary school is easy easy to do experience of learning I mean just let them out of the playground you're going to see a lot of there but but you know how to do things you know build stuff you know that's that's all right period

[02:22:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:23:00]
aunts Creek drilling then most of my colleagues tell you the truth those guys until you learn what you're doing I mean safety was number one I mean I learned a lot from those guys I never did get forearms but you know and Not only was a learning experience

[02:24:00]
I need a diagram I need something that tells me how it all fits together you know and I think that would help but thank you very much greatly appreciate it yeah super OK Google

[02:25:00]
CTE equipment as well as the individual site ones for individual schools so my own daughter is taking EMT with that CC this year I think she's a much nicer student because of that experience so it's just as a quick overview is the next session so we'll have more information on that my outline kind of five of the presentations that I thought might be worth looking into and I'll give you some bullet points on him and I have longer notes if you want me to send them to you one of these Peaks you're interested to learn more about the first one was the school accountability kind of framework conversation about social emotional learning in school climate and it was a presentation to suggest ways in which we can build School climate into accountability

[02:26:00]
and as well as skills integrated across curriculum so not for State accountability purposes but more for the trigger supports how much like what you see happening with APS and that performance Frameworks now so we seem to be online with that presentation the second one the other presentation the next presentation that I wanted to highlight for you was the teacher Recruitment and Retention again a lot of stuff that we've heard of presentations to the school board leading up to this legislative session we heard from the Dead Rising regional coordinator who's a teacher in Albuquerque UNM on this presentation about partnership and also programs about teacher loan programs so those were presentations about Statewide efforts for Teacher retention Recruitment and not APS specific the third one is building a highly effective public education system this was the presentation led by Dr Linda darling

[02:27:00]
woman to angels on they reference the no time to lose report so it's a fact that we've heard before too and they talk about supports and Equitable resources as a way to build highly effective school systems that talked about enabling success rather than waiting for failure so building and support systems to do that they looked at suggestions for new accountability systems that can offer Warning Systems and meaningful learning and talked a lot about well-trained teachers in that report as a part of what makes a highly effective public education system the fourth presentation just to let you know about the retiree Healthcare so it's not Erb but the retiree Healthcare System and they presented lots of charts and graphs that I can share about how their plans to get to solve and see and they ended with their legislative updates and ped ruled that would help them do that which includes everybody now is grandfather in but

[02:28:00]
play Institute in a minimum retirement age for full vested benefits for retiree Healthcare is one of the mechanisms for solvency and then the last presentation from the Lac hearing last month to highlight is the teacher evaluation again Oaks return for that presentation they talked about teacher evaluation system should be a source not just to label a teacher but a way to create effective teaching and they talked about clear standards for evaluation practices what does it mean to be good teacher and is they feel like there's been mixed messages in the past about what that means and that it should come out to meaningful professional development I don't know why this is so weird they had a top 10 for Effective teachers kind of list it was felt like maybe 17 or 18 bullets but I did figure out the 10 some of those things were they effective teachers evaluation should focus on performance

[02:29:00]
there should be multiple measures to reflect instructional practice there should be multiple measures to assess student learning there should be high quality professional development and collaboration so all of those things in both of the Linda darling Hammond and Jenny Oaks presentations are things that I think have resonated with our legislative conversations they've resonate well with the no time to lose report and the presentations you've heard from Senator Stuart here so it was just an overall comment I think it's nice to see that most of what people are talking about going to the session seem to line up and now Dr asked to talk to you about the PED rules that are being proposed right now mister president members of the board and superintendent reading since we last updated administrative rules that have been proposed and in your packets we have are keeping a running list that is

[02:30:00]
from January to November and I haven't tabulated all of the rules I can tell you that we did provide a general comment on every Rule and that we recommend to any Administration when there's a gubernatorial change that is impending that rules should not be proposed within 6 months of a gubernatorial change because of concerns of you know understanding how the rules going to be implemented and the burden that it places on local school districts and implementing a policy and then maybe reversing that policy you know just a few months down the road so it just wanted to make sure you knew about that the first one that was proposes putting the grading of public schools and public school accountability into work with Mr Melendez to provide a very comprehensive letter which we can

[02:31:00]
hi to you that letter basically first states that the rule is in violation of State Statute and we have major concerns about the requirements of school takeover and the school options when a school is meeting accountability based on a one a test that we have concerns that is not valid and reliable there was also a rule regarding Charter School application and a pill requirements again that rule is basically that would infringe on local control of you as an authorizer even though the words in there are Mayan said to Shell we do have concerns about long-term impact of that New Mexico computer science standards that is a rule by Miss Mulatto and her team waiting on we do support the rule but again we have concerns about it being implemented and proposed before Auburn editorial

[02:32:00]
the teacher leader development Network and mentorship programs for beginning teachers is also we're also two rules that were proposed again we have concerns because it's based on off of a teacher evaluation system that only allows teachers who are exemplary who to participate in those programs and we know that there are many teachers who can benefit and supporting other teachers who are not labeled exemplary and then finally there will be a hearing next week about background background checks for educator licensure are human resources department and police department did review that rule they do support it but again we have concerns about the world being implemented during a gubernatorial transition so finally you know we are expressing concern that title to funding we will be working with cabinets to take other concerns in fact we did

[02:33:00]
meet with Dr Mears Department last week one item we will be adding is because of lack of funding the children youth and families Department have given their child abuse investigations over to other entities such as the Albuquerque police department and they are not fully trained to do those investigations and so we want to just keep track of these issues because we don't we need to make sure that they're investigated properly because just as a reminder there's a statutory requirement that any employee of the school district report child abuse which happens daily and we are concerned about the way those investigations have been handled recently so we'll be taking those and we'll be adding that to the list so that we can pass that on to the transition team into the new Administration so we stand for questions great thank you very much I appreciate that summary I was having a hard time somewhere

[02:34:00]
what is the process these are proposals or are they decorations I'm not sure so we have done that research in Iowa

[02:35:00]
do the documents but the requirement and I believe it's the state compilation and administrative rules division of the of New Mexico requires that any public or state entity who is proposing an administrative rule they have a comment period they posted for 30 days they allow a public comment that is taken in written form and that they have a hearing and then it is really up to the cabinet level secretary to make those rules final so that is the only requirement and and States it's not even the state statutes and administrative rule that rules the administrative rules that there's a kind of check and balance in the system or are we just seeing this is last minute barrage of rules on the part of

[02:36:00]
Mr President and Mr Garcia you know I think that there is a concern and that's why we express the concern about having rules that are that are proposed within 6 months of an impending gubernatorial transition whether it's and so that's why we worded it that way and so we want to make sure that you know if a governor is up for election and they're still operating and could be operating that's one thing but when there's an impending gubernatorial transition where we know there will be an administrative change we recommend that that shouldn't place and so it is up to the cabinet level secretary to make the final determination of those and I waited to the board of education has policy and then the Administration has procedural directive to implement that so they do have to decide the statutory relationship that their administrative rules so I guess my question is will we be monitoring

[02:37:00]
what happens in order to decide what steps to take as a result I can't tell if you know they're proposing these rules and what if nobody monitors but we got 26 days now for a change in the administration Mr President Mr Garcia yes we are monitoring they have a comment period that ends and then it will be placed in the compilation of the administrative rules and then it's up to us to implement those into policy and so we have compiled these to pass that on to the new Administration so that we can express our concern and to see what steps to clarify improve or remove the administrative code is made sir yes the the cabinet secretary can finalize it or can remove that rule so for example you'll notice on the background check and licensure

[02:38:00]
3 or 4 times within the past year and have received significant push back and so they're on their fourth version so just because they propose it doesn't mean it's finalized but the final determining factor is the cabinet level secretary thank you just to clarify for you that is that if there's a new secretary the new secretary I can do whatever they want to also so they can repeat those they can replace them they can do whatever they want to do with them now and

[02:39:00]
what are the implements at the procedure directive that does not follow what we think the policy meant right so that's the kind of relationship that I have a check and balance and and so that's kind of the question mark I think in terms of how how that's dealt with and I don't know I mean I assume that the educational

[02:40:00]
having a finding of some sort that the federal government was stating that they had to do so for example I'm in the process that I have to promulgate a new rule and it's in this time frame right now so but I don't have serious pushback from anybody so I'm curious about that and I think I think there needs to be some way of working with

[02:41:00]
issue of like a moratorium when it's something that is not necessary like because it seems that that needs to be coming as a directive to the state agencies to say you will you will cease and desist kind of thing or you will halt for a period of time when there's a transition because there isn't anything said to State agencies that we can or cannot do that except maybe in the instance where there is like a federal requirement and we're in like serious you know serious violation of something then yes you would have to probably get a rule because I am right in the process of doing right now but I like the idea of that whole moratorium but that again needs to come I think as a legislative mandate to State agencies you know sort of giving us a directive around why and when but I agree there it's difficult because the agency is responsible for then implementing that

[02:42:00]
policy as long as that policy is on the books and so it does create an administrative burden because then we have to go back and we have to create a policy but we may potentially be creating a policy that potentially is just going to be rescinded and that's a ton of work let me ask let me ask if she has any questions or anything any thoughts or comments or anything else

[02:43:00]
presentations I'd love to learn more on the school accountability and the teacher evaluations and and I just wanted to tell Dr doll that blue is her color very good OK Google

[02:44:00]
I think that's just a difficult one since the secretary of the governor they're still in you're still there so we're assuming that a lot of these will probably I don't know what happens in history wise when a new Administration comes in or a lot of a lot of rules of repealed Mr President I'm sorry I don't have that OK Google I think is important for us to have so if you do get a hold of it that would be that would be important to know and then on the charter school application and appeal requirements there was just the things that were just changed then so it wasn't

[02:45:00]
all of that or what I was just kind of confused about that one Mr President and Miss Miller out of going what they are proposing is really putting into statute to administrative rule to codify the public education commission's process of approving renewal applications based on the school grading system and then the other one when it comes to the grading of public schools I think kind of goes to something was talking about were they trying I don't know if you can find this out where they just trying to align the rules because of esse and that they had to put that in there because of what was going on with Esso on and I'm just wondering if that's something maybe that they they had to do just to try to line it mister president in the the Russ

[02:46:00]
how about the public education department publishes for changing the rules they did say it was based on Essa we can tell you from our research and Mr melendez's Deep dive into this and being involved in this very extensively along with our associate superintendents and superintendent that this is not incongruence with the current asset plan that was approved by the US Department of Education the US Department of Education has given guidance to state public education Chiefs telling them that they can propose changes to their plans but they must take 6 months of stakeholder input prior to submitting any changes to the federal government thank you

[02:47:00]
okay thank you very much I appreciate the update appreciate it I will go on for the consideration approval of the 2019 legislative agenda how does a discussion action Heather so I tried to wrap up this way of communication that we can use to share these points as well as the conversation around our legislative agenda but know this is just kind of a representative form of communication and we could create some others in the next month and a half so I guess you guys all of you know the history of how we got here and the plans that we

[02:48:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:49:00]
I'll give you a shot I have actually no questions OK Google

[02:50:00]
more coordination with not just those but with our teachers or their communities with our parents and those people and I don't know how we put that in there without making it you know voluminous and of course right now with regard to how we have to coordinate you know with the legislature we will be course coordinating with legislature is extremely valuable to us you know we can go up there and say something it makes a big difference

[02:51:00]
we probably need to somehow work that into our vision a little bit more so that we understand that those are a big input to us we know that there's this top level that we got to deal with but but really we're being driven by our students are being driven by our parents are being driven by our communities and that's what's really important so we want to make sure that that's really clear to us and again I don't know whether we really I mean it says it's an action I don't know if we really need to take action particularly because in reality this is kind of more of a flyer that says does this kind of agree with mostly what we're doing but we made it we may have materials so I think like

[02:52:00]
add items for the most part is being kind of a higher priority but but again we had a whole list of things that still could be an issue and still could come up to us so I can go with that where is a sample of what we can use to communicate and you really are kind of your action item is more on the bullet points to determine what our president so I don't know how you can you know right now

[02:53:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:54:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:55:00]
I need some more funding right we listen to it twice that must be really important right by the room is part of local control and graduation requirements graduation requirements and so I mean I think they're going to be lots of things

[02:56:00]
are near and dear to us that we discuss a lot that we don't necessarily want the listed but definitely probably implied in in sufficient funding in the freedom to really address the needs of our community and it may be more of an implication than spelled out because the list might be very long but we know it's a bit of an equity there's there's a lot of traction nationally on this is an example of education level

[02:57:00]
pause to put out an equity okay well I don't mind that at all but I'd sure like to get on the front on the front row of that I'd like to have our own first you know so that we could be a source of of input to anything that might happen in that regard that was like ethnic studies too I think you know when we are on board first or practice a lot of our constituents tonight and about and so I think for us to be able to and you know even talking about all of our students right we're talking about what do we really mean by this and it's complicated folks it has all kinds of different combinatorial things here to deal with and so for us to kind of

[02:58:00]
get on board a little bit with that I think is a useful thing and and that's kind of the idea and others they may be starting to propose some things up there well if we have things in play or on the say ready to build so to speak then we can actually provide an input to that so I think there are quite a few things you know CTE is a perfect thing they're going to deal with things right so if we have a framework and we have some ways to work and some ways to build this modeling and it's kind of the same thing with all the things she talked about with our Native Americans you know is that it's not just because you know we have an African-American Spanish

[02:59:00]
what all kinds of things are that are common or in terms of what we mean by equity and how we provide opportunity equal opportunity of opportunities and and so that I think is a is a big systemic issue that we need to kind of try to tackle and and and and and work on it and I don't have a you know like I'm going to have this presentation to do this and so forth and you got to understand there's a level here

[03:00:00]
it's not our own that's an important part of the deal and I wish we could have a nice discussion with our students and not here to to let them understand there is a role for the board in what you're talking about and there's not a role for the board and what they're talking about and that's an important distinction and and it's important for our young people and our adults to understand that distinction anyway I really believe it has to come from the state level so that it is implemented at the local level I don't trust that we can do that we will do the right thing if we don't have it at the state level so I really believe that it should be in

[03:01:00]
they didn't hear as well that ethnic studies be included here and it started at the elementary school levels will have a little different feel for what that's going to be so yeah good point I just have a question

[03:02:00]
God I think it is although again whether we would implement it correctly or not is another question you know but I think again funding is certainly a part of that picture because you know we need to be able to create the curriculums or need to be able to provide the studies the different kinds of curriculum that would be there we need to have the teachers and and the members that would be teaching those kinds of things I've been a big proponent of having an ethnic studies framework where you have kind of a general ethnic studies course they kind of touches on a lot of things and then branched off into different kinds of studies that you might have you could have a Native American you could have it African-American you could have a Hispanic and not just by ethnic group but there could be other kinds of things you know there are gender issues they're all kinds of different and so it's kind of a matter of trying to say how do we

[03:03:00]
organize that so that students can get some things and again you can start this early because again you know you start it when early and when you start early with kids kids get it you know it's adults that have learned these things in a long time that don't get it I was just asking the question in relationship to this document though with as are is that then part of instructional materials is it implied as part of that I mean how does how does ethnic studies relate then to our priorities part of do we need to add it to the list I mean I'm just for me I'm just saying I hear is talking because we have had meetings where we talked a lot about ethnic studies we've had lots of conversations about needing to expand it move it forward but where I'm trying to

[03:04:00]
I'm trying to understand is it is it a something or is it a value in the way that we approach our work similar to like we're approaching Equity so I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out like how does it fit them with our priorities and that were communicating out to to our constituents then you know it's disappeared original list it was when we had the discussion a little bit of a confounding Google for New Mexico studies which would include all of these things

[03:05:00]
and the reason is we have legislators who do not see the world away we do see it often the opposite in terms of you know where their limitations are at this point so my suggestion would be that we say New Mexico studies such as ethnic studies and then we maybe list a combination of of options for me this plays out at the legislative level in the students have to be allowed to take these studies for course credit otherwise students who are trying to get to college or dual credit classes maybe another way of presenting this that we want to be able to have options to offer credit dual credit that students can actually take I know the the one issue that was brought up at one of the high schools was that students who needed to take these clubs

[03:06:00]
because they were trying to just complete their core credits so our challenge is how do we frame this and that's part of the dialogue we can ask for with ped but the legislators need to understand that they have a role to play in this I can't tell I don't have a good read on the legislature but my hunch is that this could easily be manipulated into a fight we don't want to have the clarified because it's offered as an elective Now with an APS and there's lots of different iterations depending on the School site I think the concept is to make it being able to be taken as a core course there's a court history course graduation requirement not in love it would be a it would be

[03:07:00]
are you part of a graduation graduation requirement says you have to have two history or whatever right this could be one of those with the graduation requirements sector piercing members of the board and social studies for 12 years are specific world history US History government econ so you we could say in lieu of a US Cellular in history and a half New Mexico and 12th grade is government economics for semester those are specific requirements for graduation

[03:08:00]
instructional materials in our Drive needs to be to make sure that the instructional materials that are purchased for instance if we're purchasing world history then or US history that were purchasing the instructional materials that have real history in it and so part of it is our knowledge base in the knowledge base of the teachers who are teaching that have the ability to select instructional materials that have the content that we want the real history of New Mexico what's the real history of the US that doesn't that doesn't want to edit out so some of that just

[03:09:00]
turn the ability to purchase materials and putting it in the hands of teachers who have the knowledge base there's a whole another part layer of ethnic studies that needs to be I mean a good kindergarten curriculum is in part ethnic studies and it needs to start from kindergarten on so how how the how legislation gets framed I mean there are different layers of what of what has to happen partly it's professional development part of it is opening up Pathways for real collaboration in some of that is just funding some of that is monetary some of it is graduation I mean so I don't think we want to freeze it in the opens the door rather

[03:10:00]
then limit and then it's legislation gets proposed that we that we know serve the framework we're coming from and then help be part of how that legislation gets developed so it does seem like it needs to be spoken to I was thinking maybe in the on the second page in the green where there are three paragraphs maybe there needs to be another another another paragraph that the talks about somehow the urgency in the need to make sure that who are students we can reflect I'm not saying this well but but

[03:11:00]
what's the weather at Steele language whether it's ethnic studies whether it's even CTE in some of those things that they need that maybe a paragraph that more powerfully and directly speaks to curriculum that addresses who we are is a community so maybe it's in that first paragraph where it says the districts and school boards to serve their communities and be responsive to the unique needs of local communities including you know I mean that's where we probably can strengthen it around the you know the the cultural unique aspects of of a community or what we're trying to serve in a particular School District I mean that would be a way because as I hear you talk about what you're saying to me then that whole part of this history or pieces that we've been hearing it shows up in instructional materials it shows up even

[03:12:00]
in early childhood teacher Pathways art and music I mean even in that because there's a lot of cultural pieces that could be built into just the way that we do art and music in our schools and I think we do I think there are some ways that we already support that but we need to Broadbent even in the social emotional supports so but you're right I mean maybe it is saying it just more specifically that that is a mission for us in terms of making sure that we're looking at a way to embed that as a piece of it and obviously I mean I'm also going to be the first to say just by writing the words and saying this isn't going to be the answer to it either I mean we have a lot of work to do so I mean but it could be because I'm I'm also certain that this particular issue that's going on is also going to be part of what's going to be coming up during the session for us and so I think it really

[03:13:00]
he needs to pop here that you know this is this is the step of where we need to go but it also is part of it has to be part of our funding request because we can't get there without some additional dollars to I mean we really can't so what is the suggestion for the from the board here I just wrote something about culturally responsive materials culturally responsive curriculum and materials including courses professional development and training I know that in our legislative work session when we talked about instructional materials and teacher recruitment those were conversations that aligned with culturally responsive what I'm hearing you all discuss is that it's something that kind of overlaps both with insufficiency and local control and

[03:14:00]
you know if there were a bill about a graduation requirement that's might run counter to a local control conversation so I will have to talk when those that legislation comes available but I think we can we both into the narrative and within sufficiency culturally responsive as a as an item Point what about board member Garcia's thought about saying the last special education

[03:15:00]
play unique that way we can call it New Mexico studies you know I think that's kind of your point maybe if I want people to do is not react to what you're proposing you want them to think about it and I think that's it's not a reactive term I don't believe I think studies is a reaction but given sort of the flavor of politics and how people are being pitted against one another you know me when you want to anticipate that flavoring to have been sprinkle into some perspective up there and so we want to be able to do is say look if you come from the northwest corner of the state and we want to talk about you want to talk about a course around the history of ranching and farming and Agriculture and Etc that would be a very important cultural piece you know or agriculture or very I'm not a curriculum specialist so I don't know how you frame this but my thing is

[03:16:00]
the idea is to keep the conversation door open as opposed to people jumping right on the idea that this is just a bunch of you know UNM College blah blah blah stuff you're imposing on my kids and I don't want them to take that well no we're not we're saying we want education to be meaningful we want them to actually have an opportunity to get the sense that you know and and ethnic studies that I have appreciated that their families are not erasable that they come with the history that they can go back and interview their uncle's and their ads and their grandmas and begin to get a sense of who they are and in order to know where they're going you know it's pretty profound if it's done right so that that brings up interesting couple things one is do we have a New Mexico history course

[03:17:00]
New Mexico is a requirement for graduation that's generally taken in 9th grade but also it's a 7th grade year long course invincible and I learned every single one of the pics that were over 14,000 time but so so there's a question with our concept of New Mexico

[03:18:00]

really would like for us to I mean we're going to you know Santa Fe what what do they want I mean this may be something we think oh this is all wonderful and this is good and this is what they want but we don't we don't know or we asking them and I think that's important for us to know exactly what it is that they want so but some of them has stated that tonight brother we want to be able to move forward and accept this as an agenda so that

[03:20:00]
we have permission to move forward the seconds period

[03:21:00]
there's things we've mentioned on the second page as well as kind of the first page so I think the only thing we're really saying is the bullet items here are the main issues we're doing but she's going to read word some of the some of the things doctor Percy board member Mueller Aragon yeah I will work some of those and I'll take that suggestion I will come up with different iterations of it too like a small postcard or the point was to be brief and provide conversation points and contact information around what our priorities are it's so good do I have a second thank you

[03:22:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:23:00]
and it takes a while to get through that process so that's probably a discussion point to be had some time with a real dialogue you know saying look let's go over the process and tell you what we have to do because that's important for you to know in terms of how this works with regard to any employee for whatever happened right so that's important that we heard that they really want a dialogue and I think that what they're asking for is they really want to have a dialogue with us so I think people so that's going to be a positive thing in terms of of denial

[03:24:00]
do you know we need to make sure the dialogue with the real leaders of the of the Native Americans are part of that discussion so that they can help us understand how to how to address the students I think we should really think about how much flexibility do we have it is frustrating and we hear this over and over again with the frustration of people coming and speaking in public forum and then feeling like they get no response and I understand the barrier you know I understand that there's serious restrictions through open meeting

[03:25:00]
to really try to get some clarity on is this really and truly how we have to structure our meetings is there any way that we can that we can address concerns without waiting to the end with board member comments and I know there are issues but the community doesn't know their issues and so what it appears is that we sit here Stone face and not listening or not responding even when we are and we're processing it and thinking about it and understand the passion and the concerns that people come with it seems like we have some artificial

[03:26:00]
exactly the same thing that is that if you have a public forum you need to set the boundaries I need to make sure that it's equal for everybody who speaks and unless you set the boundary at 10 hours and speak for 2 hours a piece I guess you could do that well but the point being the point being is that this isn't the right for him for that that's the main point the main points of communities

[03:27:00]
we came to some some decision to change how how public forum was structured but the fact that we as board members can't respond to it until the end of the meeting at which find everyone's gone home there's nothing that says that we could not have board member comments there's nothing that says that ok Google

[03:28:00]
is there a way that we can

[03:29:00]
things that we can respond more immediately that's that's the conversation that I would like to have at some point I think it's the issue is really around when when we're faced with a particular issue too because public forum is also extremely helpful when we get some folks that want to come in and alert us to things that we might not hear otherwise I really appreciated the the I don't remember if she was a mother or teacher now because I was trying to manage all the names but who came and spoke very eloquently about Barcelona just gave us a heads up that's a public forum announcement it's an opportunity for us to just hear something but I agree when there are issues that are before us that are unique and it's something that's pressing it does require us to have I think a different kind of forum and a different kind of process which I understand we're working on and and that part we need to do

[03:30:00]
because we've had issues also come before us on many times around parent engagement and so we need to have that dialogue with those parents that are very interested in that and we've had lots of issues coming before us around special ed and again needing to have just the conversation and dialogue around those things so it can look like yeah we are responsible for those things I mean I I I I really have been thinking about this for months for the whole month and we've all been thinking about it for the whole month but it really hasn't been an opportunity there hasn't been an opportunity for us really to do that anything about that and to really you know aside from maybe talking to a few constituents here and there which is helpful but it doesn't resolve the issue of what really needs to be at home so let me share what I'm doing out in the community so that we can I mean this is what I'm doing I've reached out to the counselor in the community

[03:31:00]
in that area in the Northwest area and you're certainly included or will be included a board member on I reached out to her because what's happening in the school also needs to be addressed outside the community out of those in that schoolyard there's something else going on outside that Community we're not saying everything is wrong in that Community but I think we need to reach out to that community so I think what I what I'm proposing with the counselor and anybody else and I know we had somebody here from the city Mr Solomon who represents a native Community is a community dialogue it's a community dialogue with the folks in that community and we start off in that Community we start off with the neighborhoods looking at our neighborhoods bring it at our students as well or community of our schools and having those conversations it may be difficult conversations it will be organized we will look to see how we organize that but that's what we need to do is reaching out to the community instead

[03:32:00]
I'm sitting here and having these meetings here it's a district equity and inclusion committee should be out there you know we work in sometimes when we do our meetings they are done in silos and I feel that way so I think when we do our district equity and inclusion committee meeting the next one is January the 23rd I think we need to have it out there I'm sorry we need to have the meeting out there I really believe that it's a community dialogue and I think we need to listen to our community we need to hear what's being said what they want to say and this I think would help heal our community as well I would like to say we've had a nice I might say candy that we still have the same problem but I think we do need to have a forum and a community meeting with our people out there that that we need

[03:33:00]
I don't know what the critical

[03:34:00]
what situations going to be I'm just saying when we have a critical situation we say okay this is a serious situation we're going to have a community meeting out there with the community we're going to talk about this we're going to talk about what the process is we're going to discuss that and we're going to let you know what we're going to do okay it may happen someplace else maybe it happens to the Cueva maybe it happened who knows where it happens right I don't know but the point being is we may want to have some kind of a process in place that says when we run into a critical situation that we get a bunch of the community coming to us and say we got an issue here I'm not talking about one or two people I'm talking about a major issue like this we say we have a process this is okay here's what we're going to do we're going to follow that process and we're going to come and talk to you and that becomes they can talk and we'll do it as much as we can both make sure that we have to do but we're going to listen to them so okay

[03:35:00]
yes we do have a process and it's going to be a dialogue and we're going to talk we're going to talk talk radio

[03:36:00]
paid in the drafting of the agenda as well and then I wasn't finished because I just wanted to thank some people from a district equity and inclusion committee last time you know the reason the agenda was drafted and put together you don't have a lot of people and I appreciate the people from The District the folks at the district level that put this together but one person in particular that brought the what is it the food Coalition was Dr Muir she does an awful lot of working give her a call and she puts things together and I want to thank you and Cynthia for your work and putting that agenda item together and thank you so much

[03:37:00]
since today is supposed to be a day to remember and think of President Bush I have to say I was one of the yelling enchanting people many a time around issues that I disagreed with him on and that I thought was absolutely in the wrong direction

[03:38:00]
of what public service is and I really want to say without sounding obnoxious or condescending or disrespectful this group of young people who were in here tonight we need them as teachers we need them realizing the value of public service that this is something we're not leeches on the taxpayer we're part of the community that the community can't live without and we need other people to come on board and see it as something honorable and valuable and something that's worthy of us as human beings and that part I absolutely respect and agree with and I hope that we can convey it to the activist young people who were here tonight that we need that

[03:39:00]
what are fundamentally change who we are as an institution it's got to be with them on the inside not on the outside and so part of our our mission as a district needs to be to figure out how to open up those Pathways for that to happen to make them see that as part of their Vision but I hope that I hope that we can convey that message that there is honor in doing what we're doing right now there's only your teacher or an EA or custodian or an administrator or board member there's honor and there's something that we need the rest of the community to come and enjoy us on okay
