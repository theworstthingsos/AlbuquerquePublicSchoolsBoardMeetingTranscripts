[00:20:00]
warm winter coats to thousands of our students in need across Northern and central New Mexico the coats for kids campaign began when station manager Mary Lynn Roper wanted to provide children with warm winter jackets what began as a few donated used coats has grown into a large campaign collecting and distributing more than 10,000 coats across a very large part of the state the Albuquerque Community clothing bank is heavily dependent upon Our Community Partners to provide the items our students required to be in school and ready to learn because APS is the largest District in the state and in their viewing area we have benefited greatly from this effort over the years this year the clothing bank distributed more than 1,330 coats to 79 schools in programs in APS and we are still counting

[00:21:00]
it's a cold day today so we're going to try to get the rest of them out coat size is given to students have ranged from four toddler to 4XL adult in addition to coats KOAT gives APS the lighter jackets hats gloves and scarves and vests that they collect these items are distributed through the clothing bank to students to bridge the colder months in the fall in the spring members of material management Warehouse our warehouse and several key volunteers for the KOA tea coats for kids drive have worked tirelessly each year to determine the best way to package to deliver coats to APS in an operation lovingly called coat Magnum the team boxes on pellets that they can that can be easily loaded onto trucks and transported to wear house site at Lincoln Complex Lincoln

[00:22:00]
available for distribution to APS schools and programs what keeps the program going after 28 years the need our community still has that need it's not going away so we really value this partnership the stories of the children who receive the coats make the program come alive and I'm going to try to get through this story so during one of the giveaway events a young child asked Mary Lynn if he could save the tag from his coat that he asked him why and he responded that he had never ever owned anything new before and he wanted to say that text so he would remember thank you Mary Lynn

[00:23:00]
so I want to sing Mary Lynn and all the people at KOAT and our people and APS that made this happen without the key Partnerships the aps Community clothing bank could never dream of providing the number of warm winter coats that this partnership provides for our students several of these partners are here today and I want them to join me and one of the people that's not on this list I'm actually going to ask to come up and that is Elizabeth Calhoun could you please join me at the podium Elizabeth is our manager for special projects and all the overseas the clothing bank and I've been told many times that this is the most organized it has ever been with the coats for kids people around me so I look good so I wanted to

[00:34:00]
so we're going to have a rehearsal after the meeting congratulations and thank you for joining us tonight for the Board of Education to consider provide information or just see how the Board of Education operates we want you to know that you are welcome the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum

[00:35:00]
time signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outlines those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting tonight there are I think we have five that we have five speakers therefore to accommodate the greatest number of speakers each speaker has two minutes for comments within the 30 minutes for public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you you may not yield you use time to another speaker you're always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you're on unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with in 30 minute Forum time Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to the board members comments before we adjourn only at this time me your concerns be addressed

[00:36:00]
at the discretion of each board member so the first speaker is Haley Haley Willis it's hard to say and then the second one if we could just get you to line up will be Franklin Ghana thank you and I have two Masters in Education I have a 7 year old and APS public schools and every day when I drop her off I'm worried about her safety and I know this is a concern to all of you I know that you're installing cameras and you're adding things to increase safety but in the coming weeks they're going to be called they're already calls for walkouts teacher

[00:37:00]
brakes and such and I'm standing here asking you cuz you have the ability at this point to set the tone for this and to support it our teachers are going to make the change in the difference here our teachers are on the front line and our teachers are the one that they're going to throw themselves in front of my daughter or anybody else the same as I would and as we move forward think of carefully about how you're going to do this because teachers are going to look for you to support them to have a safe working environment my child and all children deserve safe learning environments and they have a right to demand that and at this point in Junction at this moment you can make it a teachable moment this is the right of citizens the right to freedom of assembly and freedom to actually say what they want to do and so I'm here to ask you tonight to support your teachers if they walk out if they strike if the principles decide to close the school because without this we're not going to move forward

[00:38:00]
we've tried everything else and the loss of life that we had the moment before earlier for it's going to happen again and again and again unless we make a difference and we take the stand so please I'm asking you as you move forward to think carefully how this is going to happen in Albuquerque Public Schools thank you this has to do with the restructuring of Hawthorne Elementary the enrollment there or what I've been hearing from the community is that the reason it was being shut down is because of a race and that it had a high population of African-American students and Latinos students luckily I do my research and somebody from the superintendent's office told me that that wasn't the reason why it was being shut down which I was happy about because my

[00:39:00]
what I would have told you would be different so I'm glad that I have a big mouth and do my research properly so that you can be a little bit more transparent with the community if you need to to be able to get what you need to get across done because that is not as a community activist what I promote and I want my leaders to be able to have a voice to make a clear picture for the community so that we are doing the right things together and if it does have something to do with race that you guys as Leaders can say no or yes or whatever you need to say but I'm glad that my family taught me how to do research correctly and that I do respect the superintendent's office so thank you our next speaker is

[00:40:00]
is Jerry Worrell and after Jerry Worrell will be knocking Zimbo the Dealey I'm sorry if I said that wrong you don't know how refreshing it is to have the easy name and my first order of business and I've been remiss in not coming and thanking the board members who have been to no less than three events at the Westside Coalition in the last couple of years the reason I want to stress and thank you for attending our meeting for the community and the board to work together on working on our mutual problems of which there are many

[00:41:00]
spell a member of the Trussville Economist neighborhood association which is right across the street from the new Trussville County's School complex and the Community Stadium and now the Field of Dreams so if there's a focal point for additional bad behavior by people I live there and what we have done as a community is to reach out into to put things in place that makes sense and what I want to share with the board is some of the things that we have been doing to promote Public Safety and our own safety for the last year and I think we will renew our goals of the West Side Coalition for this year it will be too stressed Public Safety and individual safety in the home and making our neighborhoods safe but I think we need to put our arms around the school complexes in the other

[00:42:00]
places as being a part of our responsibility also so if the 25 neighborhood associations that I represent west of the river in Bernalillo County I cover a pretty wide swath of the of the aps School boundaries as well as one of our members past president not candy Patterson but one of our past presidents Dr jovias has also created the inter Coalition of neighborhood associations and at those meetings you can reach all of the coalitions in the city and I think it's important for us to have this dialogue because you're going I'm sure you've already heard and I have to apply what I heard today in the saw today in the paper of what you have already done we also have something that I wasn't expecting but it's Senate Bill 238 I think that was just passed we should be encouraging the governor to sign which will give an additional

[00:43:00]
million dollars 10 million a year over the next 4 years for Brick and Mortar Security in our schools now I know you're way ahead on this already but additional money is not going to hurt if we're prepared to do that and some of the things that we have done in terms of safety doors in terms of door locks that cannot be broken in and other things we would like to share because we've done some homework on that I think we can work on together so I'm past my time but I want to thank you for listening to me and thank you for coming to our meetings and let's take it Forward together from here thank you because I'm always fast so I am from Refugee Resort

[00:44:00]
which is its Flagship program so we offer education for children like tutoring every Saturdays and we also also offered we also offer tutoring for adults and so today I know that I don't have much time so I'm just going to ask you to reflect whenever I'm going to be saying to think about it and then maybe cuz we need a lot of help for the children that was so we serve children from Africa the Middle East Latin America and also address local kids but our primary awake is for refugees and immigrants and so we have about 400 people that we work very closely with with my husband was sitting over there and volunteers and so I want you to imagine a child from a refugee camp

[00:45:00]
who's traumatized and gets to Highland High or another school imagine that this child suffered a lot of trauma and this child has been admitted to school and this child will be placed in classes according to her age and he will be passed on to graduate high school without even knowing how to read when that child gets to let's say a name that child drops out within the first quarter because they did not get the basics of reading and so they don't understand so that is a private of some of her children that we serve I also Imagine a young boy who came to me tomorrow he told me Mama Kazi in my school they give me even though I don't deserve the age and you said that one day I had to complain to the counselor telling her that I don't deserve this great and so the counselor helped him to be able to assign him to another teacher but

[00:46:00]
is not helping me with physics so for 2 months he has been asking me to find a Twitter for him actually him and his sister so and also Imagine a mom was a widow she's about eight children she's from refugee camps and this mama doesn't even know where the school is for the child she doesn't even know what a great report is even if she sees this she says she cannot read it and so I'm here just I don't have much time I want to be part of what to do and I want you to embrace the children of refugees immigrants and documented and others thank you actually started school thank you our last speaker tonight is Janet saying good evening Mr President and first of all happy birthday to the board members and that's

[00:47:00]
when I attend board meetings and and I am trying out a day so I can hear all the presentations it's really a good learning experience it's it's it's it's it's like putting it all together and then you know being able to to see someone explain the material and my little antenna went up as soon as I saw the CSI schools were on tonight's agenda and that included McKinley and Del Norte and I'm sorry I'm president of the Del Norte High School alumni association so I am hoping that that I'm interested in the whole sea song about 10 years ago when I volunteered with the African population and she's a

[00:48:00]
then who's just dedicated thousands of hours of time and energy to to working with refugees and last but not least and I'm glad that the channel 7 was here tonight because I have a new idea but hodgin Elementary School which is part of the Del Norte cluster opened in September of 1958 and there were many 10 and 11 year olds with shiny little faces and I was one of those and after realizing that was going to have it 60th anniversary starting in September I connected with some neighborhood people and we're planning a year-long observance of 60 years old and trying to do things that will involve teachers and students in the neighborhood and and do some positive things for one of the many neighborhoods that struggling with poverty and domestic

[00:49:00]
abuse and homelessness so just to give you a little update on that and again thank you for your service and for the learning experience that takes place at these meetings thank you thank you thank you all for your input and that concludes the public forum for tonight's staff yesterday we held a press conference regarding school safety for many years now APS has been exploring security upgrades for our schools for many years we say it over and over again frankly because it's true that the Safety and Security of our students staff and campuses are always our top priority horrific acts of violence such as that

[00:50:00]
witness last week in Florida and of course in Aztec New Mexico are very close to our hearts for us these incidents make for emotional and frightening times while we can't make guarantees in the world that we live in it is our responsibility to do everything possible to protect our students or staff and Community from danger we take every report seriously very seriously not a day goes by that APS is not actively assessing and reassessing safety in our schools all schools have security cameras and when are voters overwhelmingly supported by election the result was that over 5 million dollars was a made available for us to strengthen our

[00:51:00]
safety efforts and of course the New Mexico legislators have added 40 million Over a four-year period for State schools to spend on safety for its students truly safety is in the Forefront of everybody's mind there appears to be a pattern of violent incidents in our country there have actually been too many incidents in malls music festivals at music festivals in schools in nightclubs University's marathon races work places churches during Services everywhere that people feel safe and happy and gathered together seem to be areas that are focused what we're doing because we can't do this alone we are asking

[00:52:00]
do you need to help us and to be alert to everything and Report anything suspicious in other words if you see it or hear it or read it say something they need to speak to their children telling them that the very same thing if they see something suspicious it's not for them to decide if it's a prank or if it's not their responsibility is to tell an adult and it is not snitching if anything it is a very heroic act when families have loved ones in distress they need to be supported and they need to help them get the help and that that they need we can come together as a community I've seen it and I have it happens every single day we need that today we will come together to keep everybody safe I know we can do that so remember

[00:53:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:54:00]
actually spending time with our legislators during the session it was extremely helpful so as I said Mr Melendez is also here to answer any of your questions that I may not be able to answer or we can answer together as a reminder the governor has until March 7th to sign any bills that were passed and after that date any legislation that was not acted upon is pocket veto period actually in all my years of experience of working with the legislature the I think this is one of the smoothest budgets that we've seen because we did have 293 some improvements to the state and one of those things was more than

[00:55:00]
million dollar compensation package and so how does that affect us we are teachers would receive a 2.5% salary increase and then there would be a 2% increase for all other staff now those percentage increases are fully funded by the legislature in addition the minimum salary for teachers would be increased to 36,000 for level 44,000 for level 2 and 54,000 for level three in addition there was a corresponding piece of legislation that actually sets those minimum salaries into statute because in the past six years or so that they've done salary increases they have not adjusted the corresponding statute

[00:56:00]
what is the minimum salary two other things that happened with the budget as you know 42 million was swept Statewide I believe about 12 1/2 million dollars was swept from the district last year to help districts the legislature passed 5 million dollars that would restore those cash balances of course 5 million dollars doesn't do the 42 million dollars but it would be proportionately given back to the school districts in the same proportion as if it's taken away so that's approximately 1.25 million dollars that the district would receive from that but please know that the money would not come until after August when we have a new Revenue estimate so that money is not locked in in to Stone additionally

[00:57:00]
the public education department per state statute has to set a unit value at the beginning of the year and traditionally they do it maybe in statute or on regulation but they do it in statute they have to do it by January 31st and so they did that however there was 42 million left in the money that they should have or could have distributed to schools and they only distributed 30 of the 422 million dollars so what the legislature did in the budget is to request that the public education department set the volume again in June so that school districts could then see an additional distribution of 10 million dollars Statewide and again that's approximately 2.5 million dollars that we would receive in

[00:58:00]
so beyond the budget I'll go into some of the bills we we were successful and receiving 5.7 million in capital outlay and those are from projects that range from large projects for supporting you know various schools in doing some of the things that they have requested last year that was not Capital appropriation so we we kept those same requests for this year but out of the 12 million that we requested we received almost half of what we requested so I think we did pretty good period the hospital is obviously the general appropriation act that did pass and again no

[00:59:00]
action has been taken on that just a reminder also the Governor does have line-item veto authority over any budgetary or financial Bill a couple of bills that did pass we were House Bill 85 which would allow our employees to use any sick leave that they have accrued to purchase and they would have to purchase access credits for their retirement and that would be done through the New Mexico educational Retirement Board how to spell 98 is a bill that I know many of you are familiar with this is the local election act and this bill barely passed with about 20 minutes to go they were in conference committee about an hour before the legislature

[01:00:00]
and what the bill does is in basically moves all local elections which you as a board would be included in to November so currently your election is in February so this would move your election in odd number years non-partisan elections to November so you would be on the ballot with CNM the Water Authority are the boards and the mayoral election tonight so there's a lot of controversy about the bill there was a lot of the school boards Association adamantly opposed the bill this bill has been discussed for many years and finally got done in the final hours we do not know how the governor's going to

[01:01:00]
react to the bill but we can tell you that there's a lot of concerns Statewide about ultimately moving these elections to November in the odd number years some other a couple of other bills to highlight for you is Senate Bill 119 on page 9 does that actual statue change for teacher salaries of 3644 and 54 I do have to correct I apologize I made a mistake Senate Bill 234 did not make it it was on the Queue to be passed in the final moments and there was a 20-minute filibuster that that did not allow that to pass and then House and Senate Bill 239 which is the bill that's been discussed today and the gentleman

[01:02:00]
from the West Side Coalition mentioned this does allow the district to apply to the public school Finance Authority for Capital outlay to be made available for security and with that Mr Melendez and I stand for questions any questions from the board member and as far as I know we never heard anything about this bill to make APS be part of November elections and how is it that this could happen and we didn't hear about it that's my first question Mr Garcia we did provide an update to the board at our last board meeting on the this particular bill

[01:03:00]
at that point the I believe the the language in the Bill had the election for non-partisan elections in odd years to be in June and that's the way it came out of the House of Representatives and then was amended in the Senate to make this November and then in conference committee they got quickly discussed at the end but the school boards Association it seems to me that there's something wrong with this picture simply because as an elected body we should have an opportunity to weigh in as these discussions happen or before they happen and this is an end around once again undermining authority and once again an attempt in my opinion to dilute

[01:04:00]
any opportunity that this sport might have to actually represent the communities that we have been representing over the years I'm very concerned about that in the coming board member of Peterson what's the date by which the governor has to either Mister president

[01:05:00]
the executive the house and the Senate were all at the table the entire time we we don't expect any major changes except possibly some line item veto of language that was put in the budget but other than that we do expect her to sign it and for the they're not to be a special session on the budget is there anything we should be saying to the governor right now mister president with regard to the text

[01:06:00]
message to parents I know that it was defeated but I know you spoke about the funding that was attached to it is that still in place will that be in place board member Mr President board member Patterson there was $300,000 that finally ended up in the budget for a project or a pilot doing that we have been working and communicating with representative Gentry who introduced that bill and actually is the minority leader in the house who put the money in there we have contacted been working with some of our internal folks to see what it would cost us to add that text messaging option to Synergy so it's not a additional burden to our teachers we know that our teachers do a great job and communicating to parents the email phone

[01:07:00]
pause but what could we make it so that if they're sending an email could they automatically send them a text message at the same time so we're working through all of that I know that there's a lot of concerns about how it would work is it a violation of FCC law and you know text messaging and all of those things and I think the the pilot would allow us to figure some of those things out so we're looking at it we don't know how ped would distribute that money if it would actually come to the district we do know that representative Gentry is very interested in us exploring this as an option OK Google

[01:08:00]
what's District or would be be looking at rural areas around the state have they given any thought to that Mr President and board member Patterson to answer your question both so how would it work in a large Urban environment like us but let's be reminded and I was listening to the budget show you didn't think I was listening but the budget show last night Mr Elder said a comment that really resonated with me and you know we are Urban suburban and Rural School District so we could almost pilot it for the entire state but to your point you know there was a lot of discussion about this bill what happens in certain parts of the community and I think representative Salazar from the four corners area was telling us that his phone only works in his bathroom but doesn't work from any other place in his where he lives in rural New Mexico so we would be willing to work with

[01:09:00]
again we don't know if that money will be stripped out of the budget or how ped would do that so we would be working through representative Gentry on that thank you very much for your work appreciate it period one of one

[01:10:00]
the things that we've got to figure out is how to have meaningful relationships with parents in things like the community schools and it disregards the hard work that's already being done by teachers trying to stay in touch with parents with just this mechanical one one size fits all solution instead of trying to really analyze how do we how do we help support parents and teachers in that relationship so hopefully with things like our community schools we can be looking at how do we guarantee that parents have the information that they need but how do we do it in a way that's meaningful and not just one more bureaucratic stress on teachers so if we do indeed get some part of that 300,000 I think we need to really look at what would be a meaningful way to actually use it where it

[01:11:00]
what's the difference between Barbara just said is if we it seems like that that is not something that a lot of us are for cuz it just puts another burden on teachers having to do something else unless we make it easier as you were alluding to but if it's not something that we really want to do why do we want to even pursue that you know the money anyhow if it's not something that we're all 100% behind Mister president of the conversations from representative Gentry so this is

[01:12:00]
disability if you are interested in exploring this and so no decision has been made at the district level to seek the money out or not so I just wanted to make sure I was cleared okay thank you Joseph I appreciate it greatly what you guys have done at the legislature I think relative to the texting thing it also brings up a liability issue because if it happens to be a requirement that you do this the question is what if my kid didn't actually get the text and therefore he didn't do well on the test and now I'm going to hold you guys responsible and that could be all kinds of reasons why you didn't get a text so they're all kinds of issues with regard to this kind of thing and I think again some basic principles are I think it is messing with our local control I think the teachers are doing a great job probably with in terms of getting the message out what kind of talking about you know where are we

[01:13:00]
magic to summative test in terms of Park while everybody doesn't know about park by the time they come to school and they're not paying attention and you know so there are lot of questions with that so but I appreciate greatly and we do need to kind of I think pay attention to the election thing I think we did again we that's one of those things I don't understand exactly how it ever got through because in fact I understand I like your suggestions

[01:14:00]
that's what represented by them so I think that'll take care of it so thank you very much appreciate it thank you we'll go on to item which is the update of the fiscal year 2019 budget that's a discussion Tammy good evening president Pearcy members of the board what we are here what we're going to do this evening period

[01:15:00]
which in the law at that point ped will calculate the scg on a Statewide basis that is the state Equalization guarantee and we normally have our final scg number the first week in April so we're still you know fairly early in the process but the budget office is working really hard behind the scenes preparing documentation analyzing different pieces of legislation costing out different different scenarios and that sort of thing and so she basically has prepared and updated presentation to kind of let you know where we are in the process any of the the salary increase and so we still have a lot of work to do in ped will have a lot of work to do in

[01:16:00]
I'm giving us those interpretations so let me let her go through her presentation and then we'll stand for some questions Teresa thank you Tammy Mr President members of the board what I have for you today is basically just an update from the last presentation that you had you're going to see a lot of similar or familiar slides as we go through this and the audience may have been able to get some copies as well I think there are some around if you're interested the slides will be hard to see so that's the handouts so on page two this is so this is basically our timeline for the budget of when we need to have things done so I'm not going to go over it

[01:17:00]
play step by step by step so this slide should be a little bit familiar to you this is our breakdown according to the PED on how they categorize the funds that we receive in this whole presentation it will be only over the scg finding that we get it is not all funding through the district but just the operational funding so this is how ped describes the different areas of of money that we receive so for example 1,000 is direct instruction which is the largest area of the graph we're trying to do is another way to look at things and that is what is the student impact from the funds that we get so what I did was I took the way ped describes everything in their functions and I broke them down in four areas the first student

[01:18:00]
which is what I call learning interaction these are the things that the student has direct impact with the teacher anything that the student actually is involved with other direct student impact which includes things like the curriculum health and safety of the school maintenance of the school buildings they can't have learning if they don't have a school to have it in then we broke it down into indirect impact on the students the and that actually breaks into two sections one of the most popular things that you hear throughout the news is that everybody's top-heavy that all the money is in central Administration that is 2300 function in my analysis is the indirect student impact Central Administration it's the same number we didn't SKU that in any way then the fourth area is indirect student impact Central Services that's the rest of us that are behind the scenes

[01:19:00]
that are critical to the students learning however we're not in touch with them one-on-one it's paying our staff it's doing the budget it's you know procurement thank you know all of us that are behind the scenes so in doing that this is what the graph would look like 92% of our funds are actually impacting students directly and then 7.5% in an indirect method to see how I came up with those numbers for for those of you who like to do that let me before I say that this next page six this is taking everything has described in their functions and listed at the way that we're looking at it in the direct versus indirect impact to the students so these are verbatim out of their language but just rearranged

[01:20:00]
a little bit differently so what I was going to say is for those of you who would like to know how I came up with that Pages 7 through 9 actually show the percentages so I don't really want to go through those but anybody who has questions about is more than welcome to contact me so skipping to page 10 this is our state Equalization guarantee I'll look at it over the past several years since 2008 as you can see it's been a little hard to follow I guess this year we are looking at 622 million in the scg funding based on the new student unit value that came out on January 31st so it's a slide increase so the next slide we were asked to give you a look at how are fixed costs compared to

[01:21:00]
turn on fixed cost keep in mind that this does not include staff or benefits in any way this is everything else though so are fixed costs are things like the elections are insurance or legal fees taxes and our biggest one of course is utilities are non fixed costs are things like advertising assets buses contracts other textbooks that we help with the supplementing the instructional materials fund are Xerox copy machine that sort of thing are fixed costs are roughly 31 to 32 million a year that comes out to about 5% of the total SG budget are not fixed assets are 25 million and we've been steadily cutting those and that's primarily because our budget has been being cut so we've been really doing some

[01:22:00]
are are belt so to speak so I wanted to give you kind of a look at our utilities over the past five years the communications of course is our phone services are electricity gas for the buildings and water and sewer you'll notice that the gas has gone down the last couple of years and that's primarily because we've had pretty warm Winters but we also want to point out the fact that have a program called quest which stands for water energy conservation committee and they have been really working hard at helping us bring down our costs in our utilities turning off unused items and that sort of thing so we really want to give them a shout out to say thank you for helping us bring these costs down so here's the kind of the meat of it currently the estimated Revenue

[01:23:00]
because of the recent increase in unit value we are looking out about a 4 million increase if we stay flat funded so in other words if they were to roll over the unit value as we received it on January 31st it would look about 4 million extra now that is without taking the student population decrease into consideration when you take that student population decrease in consideration you're looking out about a 6 million-dollar decrease there are some other factors involved in the unit value such as training and experience the address and some other items that have an impact there as well and then I have listed as Miss Coleman mentioned earlier the races that are on the table so the two and a half percent increase the tier increases and the 2% increase and then the other thing on the table is the small school size adjustment may go away there is language

[01:24:00]
in the legislation that certain schools may not qualify for the low small school size adjustment which could cost Albuquerque Public Schools about 1.7 million so that's so looking at her scg coming in it looks decent at 12 million but then we need to look at the expenses going out so of course with your students there would be a few for your staff to the tune of about 3 million dollars with the raises that are coming in they will also go right back out so you'll notice those numbers are exactly the same as the ones above only a negative as Miss Coleman said we do not know at this time exactly how that language will play out we're hoping that they are giving us enough to actually fund what we will have to spend but we won't know that until we get the actual recommendations from them and there's some other small changes like the benefits that switch in January

[01:25:00]
750,000 for that and then some fixed cost increases the good thing there is pnm is not going to take us at 9 and a half percent like originally we thought they were going to so we dropped that down from 3.5 million to about a million is what we're thinking about so that comes to a little over 14 million leaving us still in a shortfall of about 1.4 which that's fairly manageable so some of the considerations that we're looking at this year and some of the budget request that have come in from different departments are instructional materials has been steadily declining in funds and there's a graph on the next page of you about that but we also have a lot of outdated materials we've been giving a 3 to 7 year plan that will roughly cost us about 30 million dollars to get back into sink

[01:26:00]
with with the adopted policy or the the legislative adopted adoption the first year phase of that would run us roughly 9 million dollars District wide custodial shortage with the increase in square footage and that sort of thing we're about 120 custodial members short so that's roughly 4 million athletic trainers have asked to be moved from 0.4 to a 1.0 in all the high schools that actually amounts to moving from a 5.2 ft to a 13ft at about 500,000 engineering the future is a magnet program at Valley High School they will be looking at about 6:50 to start that program for about 300,000 the assistant principals principles and assistant principals are asking for an allocation formula change it would generate approximately 23

[01:27:00]
FTE and cost us about 2.1 million dollars then we also have Arthur music in every Elementary School we have a 3 to 7 year plan for that as well that will roughly run a 7 million in total with the beginning starting year of about 1.2 million so we're looking at about 17 million in requests to come out of the budget at the bottom of just noted that there is a temporary recurring cost currently for the SS schools the MRI CSI TSI that we will be setting aside a million dollars to help assist those schools in getting to where they need to be so instructional materials just to kind of show you what they've been going through back in 2019 the district received over 8 million excuse me 2009 2009 8 million five we are down to 233 that's a significant cut and we

[01:28:00]
I have to try to make that up through operational cycle so then the rest of the presentation is we wanted to share some interesting information that we found across the state you might be familiar with this report I'm hoping everybody is familiar with the report that was recently done by the New Mexico Coalition of of educational leaders for some reason they did this study across the state using the information found on the website for BMS operation systems anyway for this year for the 1718 school year that compared or at least listen I don't know that compared to the right statement it listed all of our

[01:29:00]
our funding according to their functions well I took that information and made a few slides out of it just just so we can kind of see how things look and then I also did another slide based on some information from ped on a pupil Revenue so on slide 17 we just picked a few schools one of the ones that we did pick on purpose was Texaco and that is because they have been in the news a lot as a you know one of the benchmarks of where money is we were also giving a presentation last week I believe it was two weeks ago at the Westside Coalition and one of their members did ask us specifically about Texaco so we thought we'd shed a little light on that here so what this shows is using the data from where some of the some of the funding plays out across the district there was no

[01:30:00]
specific reason for these particular schools but we just wanted to kind of show how things layout for us on slide 18 it is the same information but in FTE form so the first page that you just saw was dealing with the dollars itself in percentages and this is the FTE in percentages and they pretty much follow each other where the money is is where the FTE is and then this slide is showing the comparison in scg funding I think one of the things that gets Lost in Translation is when we're talking about scg funding and we're talking about the unit value how the units are determined is different for every school district if you have higher risk you get certain points if you have higher teacher experience you get certain points if you are small school

[01:31:00]
do you get certain points all of those points add up to a unit which is what they multiply by the unit value so it's kind of hard to say one school is compared or one district is compared to another district for example you'll notice in the narrative one of the lowest receiving schools is Hobbs at 6800 per student and yet mascara is at 29 $1,000 per student so it's really hard to say everybody's getting the same thing and that when you look at one person's Function One spending versus someone else's Function One spending you know it's different Texaco for example has a little more money they can maybe we can or or another smaller District can so that was just kind of an interesting point that I thought might be helpful

[01:32:00]
the next slide is not up here because it is too big but your last page is the entire District I mean the entire state every district is listed here I would have loved to have done that on every one of these examples but as you can see my bifocals probably won't even work on this so this is every state and this is only I mean every District in the state thank you but this is only for function 1000 this is only what ped considers direct instruction so with that I do stand for questions question mark

[01:33:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:34:00]
is it in every every year and every school so write request so far and thank you for the for the presentation thank you for all your work this is just one request and I know that it's been made in the last year so I request for the teacher mentoring program do we have any funding allocated for that I am not sure that there is any actual funding earmarked for that I know there has been lots of talk about that we do have the mentoring program we do run that through our HR department is quite a bit allocated for the mentoring program and actually probably know this better there's there's a couple of million dollars every year that goes into that to pay for the mentors

[01:35:00]
forward is a funding program thank you thank you are the coming board member Peterson it's in the comparisons and all that is very helpful when we're talking to constituents and but one one detail thing where does the information that's on page 11 with fixed costs versus nonfiction costs where is that in the pie chart on page 8 which little piece is that president has utilities we have fixed cost everywhere everybody you know there's maintenance

[01:36:00]
there is no specific piece of the pie for that now the majority of it for utilities is actually in the peach colored the 12.7 percent are you talking about this particular pie chart OK Google

[01:37:00]
National that is not salary and benefits so it spread throughout I may still be scratching my head on that one for a bit but I may ask you more questions later regarding that let's see and another thing looking at the utilities I know that we've been working really hard on conservation really consistent is that because of the conservation I believe has changed now as I was going to relatively level on that so had we not had our conservation efforts in place you probably would have seen a spike in that because

[01:38:00]
sounds of the additional square footage and because of the increased costs one of the one of the real problematic and I don't know that this is anything that can get responded to tonight but I think it's something that we just need to be thinking about what is that although I'm glad that we weren't facing Cuts this legislative session the fact that the legislature allocated the 2500 dollars only for classroom teachers which means it leaves out all of our other certified staff is that correct slps we won't be funded directly for other certified staff and it means that the people who get paid the least like our cafeteria workers or even going to be getting less dollar amount increase

[01:39:00]
most most hard with pass Cuts is that a true assessment it probably is yes yes no part of the interpretation that I mentioned earlier the interpretation between exactly what the legislation says what the governor signs she has the power to veto some of the language but but that interpretation then we'll have to be vetted by public education department so we'll see exactly what language what interpretations they give us what instructions they give us as far as those other groups of employees that you mentioned the other certified agreements and so those are things that are going to be bargained with with the units

[01:40:00]
what represent those folks number one but number two we just we have an obligation to figure out how we're going to do right by all of our employees the other thing is just by the buy I mean the list of need can go on and on and and this just doesn't even come close to actually showing us up for the need but a couple of things I think we need to be thinking about one is instructional materials we have some horrendously horrible out of date instructional materials but I know if we give schools more voice and what they get if we make fewer centralized decisions and turn over more power and authority in what gets purchased I think that we could look at first off having having better materials in the hands of the people

[01:41:00]
both are actually using them and you know possibly look at saving money I just think we need to look at how we have the Common Core State Standards I think that we can stand by those in terms of what kinds of instructional materials people need but I think that we need to be giving voice to to school staffs about is it worth buying all of those consumables that don't get used what would be a better option for for various schools how can we make sure that the the funding that we need for ethnic studies materials and and culturally relevant materials or how can we make this decision so that's not that's not specifically a budget issue but I think it has budget implication and I think there's some places where you can actually make smarter choices if we if we look at that looking at sharing

[01:42:00]
play some of the decision making and then finally just because it comes up every year figuring out and I know this is joined with County and City too but figuring out how do we fund the community school coordinators in a way that people who have worked so hard to build up the relationships within a school don't face getting pink slipped at the end of the year it really undermines the work that gets done and somehow we've got to figure out and we can do it jointly with Partners but I think we have a real responsibility and we need to figure out how to make that consistent and not just your to year because it's too devastating to schools and and the people that are doing that and I think that this will be an ongoing conversation I'm sure it absolutely thank you

[01:43:00]
are you coming but remember Miller Oregon just kind of go to what number Peterson was saying about the instructional materials I mean I would like to know at the school at each school at every school what's that what are they lacking in an instructional materials they're the ones that that know and I would like to see I would like to see what that is I think that's an important piece of information that we need and then the other thing I don't know Miss Coleman is I mean I'm just looking at how it's just kind of gone down gone down you know kind of stabilized to 2014 to 2016 and then just took a dramatic drop is it called declining enrollment are they looking at his ped looking at that somehow and maybe that's having I mean I didn't think so but could they be and the amount of the instructional materials that we are allocated is based on in Roman but it hasn't declined that much

[01:44:00]
we have not gone down by 50% right you know so that the difference this is this is one of the areas that has taken significant budget cuts over the past decade and it shouldn't be I mean instructional materials can you think of anything that we can do to magically stop this from happening and I don't know stop this from happening so we'll see what our share of that is yeah I mean it's just a matter of Pride for the kids that you see their books and their I mean they're outdated and

[01:45:00]
I'm falling apart and you just need to be proud of the books that you're carrying around so we felt like this was a very important item to bring to everybody's attention comma so hopefully

[01:46:00]
forget this out more to our community and I think this is really good information for our community to have I think it says a lot not only just on our budget but just how we're doing relative to the state it's a matter of fact and so I think this is really good information so thank you Tammy appreciate it greatly thank you good job on the radio show too by the way yeah the video the budget on Facebook

[01:47:00]
this is the consideration for certification approval of the most rigorous intervention MRI applications assurances for 3 elementary schools at several of our associate and one thing I would mention again and I hope we can get through these in reasonable time and that is that there's a lot of commonality and what we're looking at here so for example in the MRI schools there's a lot of commonality in terms of programs that kind of things are going to do replacement of personal and so we don't have to read all 77 pages of every single one of these three to get the picture of exactly what's going on on these schools actually one of them will tell you pretty much what it is with regard to the kind of General things and that's the same thing with like we have kind of a master plan for the CSI individual school information is there and then the particular to the schools because of the size of the

[01:48:00]
turn off and so forth in what you're doing so I think again a lot of this information is is pretty much common so I hope that what we're going to hear here just as an indication is is a nice summary of of that kind of thing and so that's kind of what I'm looking forward and maybe board members can keep that that in mind as we look at comments if you got a specific one obviously bring it up but I think again a lot of it applies across all of these schools in terms of what we're trying to do so we got it Mr President members of the board I'm superintendent reading good evening as you all remember on December 6th we receive the state designation from the New Mexico public education department categorizing schools into three categories for the purposes of this agenda will be discussing three elementary schools that were categorized as MRI most rigorous intervention Hawthorne Hills and Whittier Elementary Schools we have been working under

[01:49:00]
play very tight deadline on these applications to prepare them in a comprehensive and collaborative way we have been working with our teachers and our teachers union we've been working with the ABC Community Schools collaborative individual Community meetings have been held at each one of these schools in some cases several meetings have been held individual staff meetings have been taking place at these schools as well as collaborative meetings with the three respective schools instructional councils over a period of time this evening Mr President members of the board we do have several members of the teaching staff administrators principles from these three schools as well as community members here to see the next step of this process through so I would like to ask all of those here tonight that have been part of this process in one way or another to please

[01:50:00]
and and be recognized please thank you very much I'd also like to stress that as you learned at our last policy meeting we do have three new principals working at these three schools to advance the work of the redesign and restructure as well as to support principals who have worked very hard on the application and getting it ready for your review we have worked very diligently to send it to you on Monday we wanted to take every minute possible to get it as close to just write as possible to make sure that it was a comprehensive document that reflected the work of the restructuring redesign it is Our intention this evening to summarize these applications with the one-page summary that Dr Blakey will be going over which is on the top of your

[01:51:00]
packet which really captures at a snapshot or a glance of the three applications for the purposes of a comprehensive review at which point upon that completion we look forward to standing for your questions so what you'll see in front of you is a document that doctor Gonzalez spoke about and this is a summary basically of everything that we have been discussing over the past month and several conversations It's a combination of actually meeting with community members input from parents input from staff and really looking at this as an opportunity to redesign the schools and I have to say I'm working with all three of these communities that we really have found that the communities we've been working with are really open to trying new things they've really taken this as an opportunity to bring resources much needed

[01:52:00]
resources to their Community because there is a significant amount of money that is attached to these applications and so it's been a very positive experience despite the reason that we got into this experience it's been very positive in bringing the community and the parents and the faculty together to look at how they can bring resources and opportunities to their students and so what you'll see is kind of an overview on the chart as Dr period She mentioned the three schools are similar yet within each school they have different theories of action and elements of the plan are different for each School however the overall just of the schools which I can walk you through are outlined in the one-page document so the kind of nuts and bolts of what this would look like different for the students in the staff begins

[01:53:00]
with the expansion of the school day in the school year so there are 10 days attached to the school year for all three of the schools these 10 days would start prior to the school year which would allow for Extended Learning for the students there's also an hour of instruction attached to the school which we mentioned I think last time we briefed you on the MRI it was talking about the genius hour so that genius hour would be an enrichment for students really working with Community Schools and Partnerships to provide enrichment to students while teachers are collaborating the extra hour for staff is actually taken from work that the district in the union did over the past two years in the sqt work of what it would look like to extend the teacher's professional day and so you'll see that outline in the application details

[01:54:00]
what's 1 hour per day are for different different things for the staff because just extending the day and hour for staff or for students without being really intentional with what that time is leaves us all feeling like we still don't have any time so the work of the sqt is really designed to outline specific things for the staff to work on during that hour as well as the students during the genius hour so we like to say it's genius hour for the staff and for the students so the framework that we used is really partnering with ABC Community Schools as the overall foundation for the schools and under the Community Schools you'll see the four pillars which is integrated student supports collaborative leadership family engagement and Extended Learning which we went over in the previous meeting then you'll see our core beliefs that we have outlined for each School

[01:55:00]
which is student-centered learning social emotional learning distributive leadership backwards planning standard space cross curricular and formative assessment and those are basically the beliefs that we are designing the schools with and digging into more with the staffs as we further the design so underneath each of those beliefs you'll see elements of the plan outlined so that it shows you where those elements in the plan aligned to our beliefs so for example do a language you'll see in student center learning social emotional learning standard space cross curricular as elements of the beliefs that we have for the redesign in specific to the schools do a language is in Hawthorne's plan as well as and early childhood is in Whittier and most prettiest his plan you'll also see on the side the side column

[01:56:00]
the five core propositions of teaching and this comes out of the national board Foundation the national boards propositions for accomplished teaching and so you'll see the five propositions of teaching which is designed to kind of lead the professional development work that students that teachers will be doing for students in the schools as far as in the plan you'll see as if you were able to review the documents additional stipends for teachers include additional type of for national board teachers as well as payment for national board teachers who want to submit their their boards so we would pay for their application if they commit to teaching at the school for three years you'll also see additional compensation for teachers because of the extended day that is actually designed as a stipend and so it would be the same

[01:57:00]
PlayStation 4 all teachers despite their levels it would be the the stipend for teachers for extending their day and so this hopefully gives you a breakdown of how the plans are aligned and culmination of also the previous updates that we have given you regarding these plans and again it's a culmination of a lot of work with communities teachers parents even students that came to some of our community meetings and so we had great input as to what the hopes and dreams are for these three School communities so with that we stand for any questions you have on any of the three School applications and we asked for your approval OK Google

[01:58:00]
I know you spent some time this weekend which is not in fact a free weekend like I should have been and I know you spent time on Monday I know you spent time you know previously so appreciate very much what you've done so other comments and I think that I think the frustration for everyone is not knowing what's going to happen and not having had any kind of the work that's been done is actually going to be recognized and accepted by the PD but I think we had no choice but to really do it in good faith because it is

[01:59:00]
I mean I think it's a model for every school in APS I think it's not just a model for schools that are in trouble but it's a model of how do we how do we really dig in and and make sure that the staffs in schools and communities and kids are getting the support that they need and that have the programs that recognize that so I I appreciate it and I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that it gets accepted and recognized and if there's concern that schools are closing then clearly is a board member I haven't been communicating to my constituent sufficiently because we have no intention of closing the schools there's a historical commitment to our community and you know really recognize the work that's been done over the years and not going to let go of that because it's valuable and we need to order it so thank you

[02:00:00]
are the comments questions remember Yolanda first for remembering as it pertains to staff that aren't graded as exemplary highly effective can you just explain how that's going to work because I read that you were obviously looking at those five core propositions when it came to hiring so can you explain that to me a little bit please sure that the application asks for how we will ensure that our teachers are minimally and so we are approaching that question as a coaching element of how principal leaders work with

[02:01:00]
staff and so were utilizing the par process that we have in place as a excellent model for coaching teachers up and that would be in place for all of the teachers who are minimally effective okay so I know they go through that par program so how long do they have been to become effective like how many years is it how much how much time are we going to give them to get their so if we started this is next year's the first year and then we have the second year and then we have the third year so how many years are you giving those teachers to be able to become effective presidential election or below they will be entered into the coaching model in the district that we have to undergo pure assistance in review support they will be reviewed at 45

[02:02:00]
Days by the power panel to really take into consideration what are par support teacher as well as the principal are seeing in terms of growth of that teacher and then it is again reviewed at the 90-day to make a determination in reference to their continued service within the district there are instances where that is extended although rare there are instances where for example if there's progress we want to continue to see that through but to your point when are they categorized or labeled effective that would be on their yearly summative evaluation which takes place or is designated or giving on an annual basis so if they continue as ineffective at that evaluation and what's going to happen then to those teachers at that school if they're still in the park program they get evaluated

[02:03:00]
is there still ineffective if if growth is not seen just like any other teacher in the park program determination would be made in a recommendation would be made to the human resources department reference to continue service within the district as a par decision jointly between the district cuz I understand they have a chance to still continue the program even if they're if they're ineffective so I just want to make sure the kids are getting getting the best and if there's not growth and not Improvement on to make sure that the kids have the best teachers possible so that's that's what I care about and then the other thing are there any new teachers are there going to be at the MRI schools do you know we do not know how many teachers are will be at the MRI at this point where are you out of school just starting their career I don't foresee there will be very many brand new teachers because

[02:04:00]
the lift of the schools is pretty significant and so they need to really staff with experience teachers who can come with the skills to really hit the ground running with these students as you know the first year of teaching is very difficult and so putting that on top of a new teacher would be in a sense setting them up for failure okay cuz I saw that there was a process so like in there will be a sign of mentor of their brand new teacher and their third year and then they are do you want them to become nationally board certified because that's how I kind of read into it if they are and you teacher they'll have the mentor and then go through the process is that something that's just going to be required of new teachers it is not required and it is there are new teachers there could be new teachers to the school that aren't necessarily new teachers to the profession as well as teachers are in the school that are not necessarily national board but do you want to get their board

[02:05:00]
and so that will be fully supported by the school as part of their professional growth and that's why the stipend to pay for their application is in the application and do you know how many national board certified teachers you have or teachers that have gone through the tpe program at the schools right now do upstairs in my office but not off the top of my head I don't know how many but we can get that to you how many we have in the districts okay cuz I'm I'm interested in the teachers at the you know three MRI national board certified how many have gone through the tpe program how many have been on the par program and improved I mean those are just important numbers for me to have we can get those for you in addition part of this process which we've really been working with the staffs on is once we get word from ped that the plan has been approved we will be meeting with the staff and

[02:06:00]
principals for those teachers who would like to be reassigned for next school year there could be a significant number of teachers that do choose to be reassigned for next year just based on the load that this will have their personal lives you have to kind of balance everything in what this work will entail and teachers that are minimally effective do know that they would be part of the par process and so there's a culmination of a lot of factors that as soon as we get word from the ped that the plan is accepted will move forward with offering the teachers who are currently in these schools a priority higher to teach at a different School of they would like to okay and then I was also looking at leadership tires and this was just a quote that was in there that there wasn't a competitive High Caliber pool of leadership applicants so I was like okay

[02:07:00]
I mean that was written I wrote it down verbatim so I'm just interested then what just says there is a shortage of teachers there's also a short of Administrators so I think for example in one of the schools we had 24 applicants I think one had experience being a principal in the past a lot of people were applying to get their foot in the door and so really looking at the ability to turn around a school and that level of leadership that we are looking for an experienced we actually had a hard time and principles that were signed up to say yes I want to take on this it's difficult to find nobody will agree with me but we just kind of school districts a lot of time so we do is we kind of cut ourselves off from leaders in the private sector that obviously transformed organ

[02:08:00]
patients that would be able to do something like that but we are very close system I think if we open ourselves up we would be able to find some very high caliber leaders so these principles now will they be obviously they're going to be going to The Institute the Harvard Institute I can't remember the exact name of it is that something that they're all going to do or have already done they will be going to it they will be going and then what about PPE are they also part of that or have the three of them been part of that already period

[02:09:00]
which Collective those are things we know Stalin and Castro tried all of this stuff and it just disincentivizes everyone including people who slack off so and to say there are none there are so I'm kind of going that worries me because someone else can pick up the slack for someone who's not doing it yet they're going to be getting performance pay for somebody else's work so I'm very upset about that one so what is the pay was $1,000 but they have to do this is what also was a 10% increase average amount of students on all assessment measures so all is pretty encompassing like all assessment measures what assessment measures when you're saying all and there's a 10% increase

[02:10:00]
set a short cycle and okay when it was all it was like okay and then I was kind of confused on the there was interventions for school enrichment so for those children who are performing above so they will get intervention help but it will be enrichment so I know it's at how that will happen and mostly what I saw in that was when it would happen that would happen during the intervention block so like how is that going to happen what are those kids going to be doing I understand when it's going to happen but I just don't get how and what's going to happen for those kids Mr President remember going there are a couple of examples that I can give to help answer that question the first one is in the grant we budgeted and requested a allocation for a transformation coach to really work with teachers on the interventions that you're speaking of the other one

[02:11:00]
is if you'll notice there is an allocation for a blended learning contract to assist with professional development and assistance to teachers to really integrate technology into the curriculum at the three schools to really again get at the interventions in the diverse learning needs of our students so those would be two examples that we would really execute the diverse interventions that our students need in the classroom based on a case-by-case student by student basis I know I remember I think it was at Whittier they talked about interest learning cohorts can you tell me what that are those on student asks like kids want something or they talked about interesting cohorts sorry I'm looking at one of the coaches for the school to see if she could further explain that we can check with the school and get back to you on that okay

[02:12:00]
and I don't remember if it was during I don't know if it was during genius hour or what they were talking about there would be two activities so one activity would be on Monday and Wednesday the other activity would be on Tuesday and Thursday so then what's happening on that extra hour on Fridays Mr President's the skeleton and then once we were approved we need a really get the meat on the bones if you will and once approved we will be working closely with our community schools Partners to really design the exact Services the exact programs that are students will be able to take advantage of within the context of the genius hour so every hour Monday through Friday would be

[02:13:00]
populated with activities and enhancement enrichment opportunities for our students on a unique continuous basis with every individual school so be assured that all five days the additional hour will be on populated with dynamic programming and that's coming from the community right that's where the community is going to get involved in and help with that absolutely we do foresee continue Community engagement staff engagement as once we are approved really designing putting the specificity into the plan taking genius hours and example to really be able to take the theory of action for example and really tie opportunities and programs during that genius hours that kind of supplement or support the theory of action that each school has in regards to their plan so absolutely continue to engagement will take place that's definitely

[02:14:00]
something that we anticipate because I think that's very important when you're looking at the three schools when you said we didn't have to read it all if you know me I'm going to read all the Thousand however many pages there were and I did see it was all very very similar so we need to have something there that's going to just be individualized to the to the school because I went through and just kind of wrote things from Whittier Los Padres and Hawthorne and basically it was kind of the same things and the only thing I think that I saw that was maybe a little different was that there was bilingual program at two of the schools there was going to be the three year old program at two of the schools and then I think it was the Outdoor Classroom science learning however that that's the only thing that I saw that was different so I'm hoping that with his genius our you're going to be able to bring in the communities in those School

[02:15:00]
neighborhoods cuz otherwise it looks the same and we're always talking about every school is different every neighborhood is different so we need to individualize it somehow and I don't see that there's any other way except that way Mr President member murata go on as part of the grant we will engage to a period what they're calling the planning period from December March of 2018 through June of 2018 and there is an allocation that we are requesting from the PED to engage in the planning of the execution of the plan to your point it is absolutely well taken that really the specificity take dual language take Project based learning take any one of the components within the skeleton in the one-page at a glance there has to be the specific components for each individual school added to it

[02:16:00]
so that is indeed what the planning period is intended for we have included teacher stipend money we've included on substitute money we've included money for professional development all to deploy a rigorous opportunity of planning and execution of a launch in August of 2018 for a very specific plan for each school to be launched and the thing that I saw from reading all of these and all the CSI schools is that when you're looking at students with disabilities or students that are English language Learners that those are the kids that have been left behind for Generations they're the ones that are never passing the park exam hardly ever I think Whittier maybe set for of 18 times there was an ell student that passed but when it comes to students with disabilities that never happens so this is just

[02:17:00]
we're failing those children and we have for Generations that I am hoping that this is going to help those kids because this is just a result of apses failure for those children that have already passed through our day through our doors and there's nothing we can do to remedy for them so all we can look for is is forward because there's nothing that we can do to help those kids that have already gone through and we know who those kids are and it is disproportionately Children of color thank you dot thank you I just want to say thank you for the work that was done because I know we've been involved in discussions and I've had

[02:18:00]
you know lots of questions and I've spent some time looking at things you know trying to catch myself up I think in terms of what's happening I like board member Mueller ought to go and I am also interested in just like the you know that test or how well that par process really results in us really moving teachers through that process because I could see that that is one of our major interventions for these schools is really moving towards that ensuring that the schools have you know that the students have access to highly effective teachers and that we're moving teachers I like the fact that the plan focuses on a lot of professional development because just as I was looking through all of these Myriad of CSI it's that piece there that just kind of struck out to me that you know the professional development is really needed so that we can bring

[02:19:00]
turn the teaching pieces in the teaching aspects up so that our students have just access to like quality teaching so I'm interested in looking at that as well the other part about utilizing the power process because it's something we know has been effective is in the Bios that you'll see for the three principles that were selected so these are three very experienced principles and really making sure that they are able to support the quality of the teacher in the classroom because we all want to make sure that our children every child has a good teacher right that will change the trajectory of their lives and I think that one of the reasons that we looked for these particular principles and one of the reasons that we selected them was because of their ability to really work collectively with staff to coach staff and to really recognize what good teaching is in the classroom thank you and I will say that to I

[02:20:00]
I applied the the decision on the leadership that was selected for for the schools because I think that's demonstrated just in their overall enthusiasm for the work and just their experience their bios were really impressive as well as the I can't remember what their titles were jeans Vedra and principal support specialist thank you the support specialist behind that because it sounds like there's definitely a lot of expertise and I agree with board member Peterson it's like it's sort of the model that we should have for all of our schools that are in trouble should be able to have access to this kind of rigor so that they can they can get themselves out I actually liked the collective incentive on my end I I thought that was great because I think it promotes teamwork this whole notion that everybody that's going to be in that school environment is going to own the problem it's not just it's not just the principal it's not just one person but they they're owning it together and their

[02:21:00]
I mean their success so I actually I thought that was a great idea and then the only thing that kind of struck me as I'm looking through the the actions or the theories that were putting in place and I'm sure it's going to come out through the Community Schools piece but I think where it doesn't come out loud enough and all of this and I'm going to always advocate for this being the social worker in the room and Community piece is really that student and parent engagement I think it does doesn't come out loud enough that I really hope that we're moving towards that direction to where families and students are also included in the decision-making and in the process of setting goals for what the schools but they're also included any evaluating how the school is making that kind of progress and giving feedback on that as well I think they need to be part of that and I just I just didn't see a lot of I'm hoping that it comes out through the

[02:22:00]
are there any schools peace and I look forward to the planning process to make sure that we actually lift that out a little bit louder period allocations were requested to be released during the planning period for positions like bilingual resource teacher community school coordinator to really be part of the planning during the Spring in anticipation of the execution of the plan so the benchmarks that you're speaking of that we're going to hold ourselves accountable to overtime in terms of those data pieces and what is important to the individual schools really laying down those benchmarks in those pillars if you will to monitor progress over time can really be identified and build on a strong foundation for deployment in August so we hope that that locations are line items will be approved as part of the credit

[02:23:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:24:00]
one of the things that was very important to them is that they would have the support of each other to go through this process we had in part of the structure for the instructional Council to temporarily participation on the icy therefore there have been parent Representatives at the Joint meetings that we've had we do as I've mentioned anticipate several more engagement opportunities for parents students staff and Community as we go down the planning period so we've had several we look forward to having even more thank you thank you for the enormous amounts that are here so I have no additional questions

[02:25:00]
well thank you and I very much appreciate your efforts it indicates to me that there's just a tremendous dedicated leadership that we have thank you superintendent reading for assembling this team on behalf of the schools and the communities including the teachers who were there as this process occurred to them they schools don't live in an isolated situation they live in neighborhoods and their parents who've been there for years you know generation after generation we mentioned ears being started a number of years ago I don't know how thorned

[02:26:00]
I don't know the other school very well but I have a problem with the logic that was utilized to make these schools into F schools in the first place I still have a problem with that and I cannot pretend that I don't it's faulty logic in my opinion it uses fallacious reasoning and a formulas that have never really been proved that they reflect anything other than someone's intent to manipulate a process so that charter school friends or others can come in and undermine the profession of teaching you know in my opinion I just have a big problem with that and I'm sorry that this is not part of the dialogue it's never been acknowledged it's never been put forward we don't have an opportunity to work this out I call for a dialogue at the last meeting I was on the phone and I really think it would be good I just wish that

[02:27:00]
ped and others who are determined to shove this down our throats and have that they would actually stop and think about what they're really doing it's working from a manufactured crisis and yes our schools need help there's no question we've been underfunded for years since I've been on this board it's a stroke of Genius in my opinion that you decided to use the Community Schools model as a way to begin to address the underlying factors and issues that need to be addressed and all of our schools and I hope and pray that that will be successful or that we can learn something from that I hope that it's taken and giving serious consideration as these applications are reviewed you know your education educational pedagogy appears to be

[02:28:00]
who won the Israeli attempting to to deal with all these issues from teaching to learning to organizational culture in a school it's commendable but I do think that there is something to be said about the collective versus the individual I'm frankly tired of individualism I think we need to learn to be interdependent and begin to reflect values that communicate that we are interdependent that we don't survive together it's not going to get any better it's going to continue to get worse you know I have for many years tried to understand community and work to build community throughout my career to help the community understand the issues that were happening in their neighborhoods by sharing data you know looking at the data for

[02:29:00]
what channel is to be able to say oh gosh it's not just this particular family that has been cursed by God or someone but it's something having to do with a process that we're all being subjected to and I have to pretend that I can't let me let me start again I don't want to pretend that there's not something called oppression are experiencing and these communities have experienced you know there's some people that believe that we should all be like that math High School the Cherry picks all their students you know and that gets put in the minds of the public or at least those are read the journal on a daily basis almost you know I think every student is a potential genius but it is going to

[02:30:00]
fire a different approach and I'm hoping that whatever you learn from this process will help us get to that different approach someday we may lose this battle we've lost it thus far but I can't think of much to say except I certainly would support anything and everything that you you're trying to do here but I have a lot of questions and unfortunately we don't have any guidelines to go by you know I won't be surprised if we don't get all of our applications through as we propose because I just have not been able to trust the logic that's being used by the PED over and over and again that systematically works to undermine us as a board of education and I don't like to be pessimistic but I have to say realistically

[02:31:00]
and I hope and pray that they will see it for what it is and I hope I'm wrong thank you hey Google what I called kind of a framework framework of things that were done new leadership at the school and District supporting programs like in construction

[02:32:00]
so for example what you doing structural rides at 1 may not be at all the same as you do at another school the community school framework itself is set up so that in fact every Community School May well be very unique to that community so we're not talking about cookie cutter thing here we're talking about a framework that in fact we can understand because there is a framework there and that within that framework the community can work on their own individual needs and activities so I was very impressed I thought that was very good I do have one question or something like that

[02:33:00]
so I would suggest that you put a little footnote in there that says we understand or we know that the the submission date actually is such and such which is later than the 12th of February cuz otherwise we're dead before we get started so maybe you can explain to me what the real date is so the real date is I don't know if it's anybody's birthday but it's Monday February 26th 2016 February 26th and that deadline was extended for all of the MRI and CSI schools by the public education department upon request of several districts and do we have an official letter then I would suggest you put a little footnote in there and reference that make absolutely certain that we know that's the case I always loved to have that and the 26 is a very very very very important

[02:34:00]
so I want to let you know that I will have other duties that day again I do I do have still some concerns about sustainability and scaling always have those concerns you know I don't want this to be a 3-year project and then it goes away or something happens we got to figure out what we can do to make sure that what we're doing is just an embedded part of how we do work and so figure that out as we go along you know make sure that this is not just a three-year and then everybody goes away and I know we've done projects like that you know we've had some very interesting because if you look at all the TSI CSI MRI got a good start on scary little bit

[02:35:00]
different models so I'm hopeful that the idea is that I think his other board members have mentioned this is not just a one-time kind of thing but how do we really work this and how do we work it so that I mean maybe this is something that's real positive about it what we're doing here instead of always talking about the negative maybe something positive to say how do we really categorize our schools a little bit in terms of the kind of needs that they have the prioritization they have and that's really what we're doing we're making a prioritization schools need a little less maybe but they need something so far it's called do this so maybe we can make this a positive thing in terms of what we're doing I do have concerns and improvements in accordance with this assessment this summer

[02:36:00]
possibility of the real progress that may be lost so as we have looked at our academic master plan that we said we need to have dashboards of how our schools are doing I'm talking about social emotional learning I'm talking about all these other areas let's make sure we put out those measures about what we're really doing so that it's not just what we do on our assessment and I think that's really important for you guys to bring back to us very specifically particularly for the MRI schools what is it going to measure exactly that's going to come back to us and says this is how we're really doing so I know what the Baseline is you got all the Baseline stuff for the Parker

[02:37:00]
I have I recognized board member Garcia's concern but I believe you guys have done a fantastic job

[02:38:00]
good evening

[02:39:00]
I have been designated as CSI comprehensive support and Improvement and given Dr Pierce's initial comments that we need a summary I won't read all of them like I had intended to read them to you just to refresh your memory a little bit a school is identified as CSI by being the lowest performing 5% of Title 1 schools or and this pertains to our high schools that are CSI schools they have a four-year graduation rate less than 67% for two of the past three years the process that our 17 schools went through as part of their 90-day plan is they looked at their data some of it being school performance or student performance data and they looked at the areas

[02:40:00]
that caused them concern dug down a little bit deeper to what might be the root causes for their learner-centered problem and they developed theories of action in order to improve that student performance and that would be their desired outcome for the purposes of this grant they identified allowable interventions in order to see money they have other interventions that they are working on as they develop their plans and as they work on their plans to increase student achievement however for this grant the allowable interventions did have to meet certain criteria and so that criteria is evidence-based where the research showed their effectiveness by experimental study so there had to be some research behind it

[02:41:00]
order to receive funding for their intervention so that being said Lori Webster has done a phenomenal job and coordinating the work of the 17 School Grants and at this time she's going to kind of give you an overall summary of the interventions that the schools have chosen and Lori Webster Europe good evening Mr chair and members of the board I am pleased to be here today A few notes to add as far as particulars with this grant one is that the maximum that a school could request was $150,000 in years one two and three of The Proposal year one is next school year the maximum School

[02:42:00]
request for this year 2017-2018 is considered the planning year was $30,000 the PED has issued in the RFP that they hope to notify schools on March 19th as to whether or not their funded and how much they're funded because of that you'll see many schools didn't budget money in their planning year and this is because they will hardly have time to spend it before the school year comes to a close in 2017 and 2818 this was very much a collaborative effort between district offices and schools have consulted with every principal of the 17th as well as many members of their instructional assistant principals instructional coaches classroom teachers in developing the plants so I hope you saw as you read through the budgets and the portion of the grant that was specific to each School

[02:43:00]
set the interventions although they are sometimes in common between schools that has more to do with the best practices then any sort of of plan master plan so we really did consult with schools very thoroughly but also like to thank the department of curriculum instruction the office of accountability and reporting a specialty Thomas Piper who heads the school accountability Assistance Department Michelle Drummond entitled one who examined all of these interventions and provided the citations that you saw in your Grant as to whether or not they were evidence-based and of course the leadership team of the district who is been part of this process every step of the way so a few high points of the different interventions chosen by the schools you'll notice that they are very heavy on professional development because the intent of these grants is to develop teachers

[02:44:00]
Cassidy's and to create long-lasting school-wide change some common themes and professional development include Avid data wise the data wise continuous improvement process that's often paired with formative assessments project glad which particularly addresses the concern already Voice tonight about our English Learners Kagan Cooperative learning especially as school seek to increase students engagement during the day in the classroom and student engagement as an overall theme for professional development was common across the schools across the school was the desire for formative assessment in particular schools are looking for not just Diagnostics that can be given three times a year or the park which is only giving

[02:45:00]
once a year but the i-Ready software provides standards Mastery so teachers can design their own classroom assessments to see where students are with the particular standard they taught that week or that month so having that level of flexibility was important to a lot of the schools at the high school level schools were designated as comprehensive support and Improvement typically because of their graduation rate so you'll see in the evidence based interventions that many schools are looking at Blended learning which includes Credit Recovery classes during the school day because we know that when students fall behind and earn credits they are at high risk of dropping out of school other interventions that high schools have chosen to examine that problem in particular is a Summer Bridge for incoming 9th grade and some middle schools are also looking at summer programs for incoming sixth graders so we know that students

[02:46:00]
you are very vulnerable in those transition years in 6th grade and in 9th grade and so having more time with them in the summer before they transition to a new school is an evidence-based intervention to improve their long-term performance and ultimately raise graduation rates I won't cover every intervention that's listed some are only adopted by one school but I stand for questions and would love to answer any questions that you may have about the CSI applications thank you very much I'm kind of looking at the amounts and they're pretty much stay the same so they stay the same each year my change in my change a little bit the question I had on some of them it was like purchasing software for i-Ready or iStation so then why would the number why would that

[02:47:00]
Mount stay the same the next year if they purchased it in the first year did the person but yes I'm sorry Mr President and board member of God when it says purchasing of software it refers to purchasing a subscription which is an annual subscription so it does need to be included in the budget annually okay and then I'm just curious because I don't see that there will be any control groups for the interventions so can you tell me how are you going to know when an intervention is working because it looks like you're going to use the same you know you're going to go through three years and you're going to use the same interventions but what if an intervention just isn't working and how will you know that it isn't if you don't have a control group how are you going how are you going to entertaining what's causing you know either drop or hopefully an increase in you know graduation rates are

[02:48:00]
what's the scores yes Mr President board member Moeller Eragon the grant requires that we select from interventions that already have a strong research base that being said there is also still the opportunity for APS to do research on which interventions are successful within the context of these particular schools it's not something that the grant requires us to outline in our proposal so I would refer it to the office of accountability and Reporting into the specific schools that will be collecting the data on those particular interventions okay so the schools will be able to go this intervention is working this one's really not working so they're the ones that will be able to look at that data and figure that one out so

[02:49:00]
get into this work is the 90-day plans and so the 90-day plans allow the schools to visit with their core teams every 90 days to see how interventions are working and make potential adjustments has outlined in their 90-day plans as they move forward so the hope would be that the 90-day plan allows them to move faster than waiting for a 3 years before they notice something's not working and they continue to use it so the schools will continue to use their 90 Day plans as part of that process so then that money then can go to something else if they're 90-day plan goes all this might not be when they look at it and it's not this isn't working so it's shifted to something else then I don't think it's part of the grant what we're writing and now it would we would stop using it but it wouldn't be like then we get the amount of money to invest in something else unless we use our operational dollars to use something that would be more beneficial to the students if we're continuing to use something that's not getting

[02:50:00]
I think it was almost all of the CSI schools that there was an over-representation of minimally effective or ineffective teachers and so what are we doing about about that cuz I think it was in there was a few schools that that wasn't the case but in most of them it was yes board member mobile I thought it was a very interesting finding that minimally effective or ineffective teachers are actually not overrepresented across all of CSI schools there are some at which they are and they were other schools that which highly effective teachers for example Highland were overrepresented as compared to District averages so that's a question that I think deserves

[02:51:00]
is further inquiry but I don't know that we know the answer to that because of the way evaluations are done it's a bit of a chicken or an egg question I think it's an important to find an answer to the other question is when after the 3 years and this money is is gone what what are we going to do if things are working we're going this is really working but you had a 150,000 every year and now that money is not there anymore and some of it I know once teachers are trained in certain things and they don't need to be you know retrained you already have the staff training but some of these will require a dollar amount so after three years the hope with the it would help us realign our resources so the grants also allow us the opportunity to try different interventions that have been successful elsewhere to see

[02:52:00]
if they are working and then if they are working we are able to as a district adjust our dollars to utilize programs or resources that we have seen have worked for the students in the particular school and then the other thing I saw the same is in the MRI schools was also students of color children with disability or outperformed I think every school by Caucasian students and ell Learners was the same you know was the same case so we need to just really seriously keep a real eye on that because it should not be the case cuz these children are all capable of learning and I'm just kind of of course concerned a lot about both groups but ell Learners what what do we not doing to help get them where they where they need to be and that's something that we need to really take

[02:53:00]
a hard hard look at because they should be able to get to where they need to be and I don't think there's a certain year I don't think it takes maybe a year for one child and it might take 3 years for another and when I've gone and talked to people at naleo they will say there isn't a magic year it's not a one year or three years there isn't a magic year but there is a certain year for every child and we need to figure out what that is for those kids because they are perfectly capable of learning and they're so awesome being able to do two languages to begin with so I think that's something that that we need to look at and another of my concerns is on the assurances that we had to do was like I don't know what that school growth is is going to look at I don't know what those targets are so it's really hard for me to sign off on an insurance

[02:54:00]
I don't even know what those are and I like most of you here don't believe a child can just be judged on one test score and growth for one child and the same percentage for another child is something totally when you look at them completely different so those are just concerns concerns that I have also that I haven't seen still is in our assurances when we're talking about a strategic plan I haven't seen that strategic plan yet it assures that there is one but I have not seen it so these kinds of things need to kind of all be worked out kind of monitoring the principles how are we really monitoring them and holding them accountable truly I mean those are just concerns I have for for all of these all of these schools so thank you thank you sir

[02:55:00]
so maybe I've been trying to bite my tongue I really appreciate the comments the board member Garcia you know you look at this list of schools and especially the MRI schools and it's a list of schools and neighborhoods that are struggling and if we don't address that comprehensive picture of what's happening in children's lives then everything we do gets undermined by the reality that kids live in and you know all of us here want every student to have the best possible teacher every year but how are we evaluating that and I have to go I just happened to talk to someone who is involved in the Coalition for excellence and Science and Math education and they didn't ask for the teacher evaluation and everything in the teacher

[02:56:00]
are you Asian can be extrapolated into the school grades it's based on Park and we have to we need to figure out are the assessments that we're using actually assessing what we want to find out and that terrifies me for the CSI schools I mean I just hear we're going to test that much more and what is it that we're going to be testing and what does that have to do with teaching but I do I feel compelled to read just one little bit I think it's noticeable that doctor who is the designer of them which is the underlying basis for Teacher evaluation and for the school grades he is disavowed that system as he studied it as it was put into practice over years

[02:57:00]
the mathematician himself who designed the system is saying that it's not reliable and so the the Coalition we conclude the teacher evaluation systems of multiple measures that include student performance results from standardized tests are inappropriate for making any high stakes decisions regarding New Mexico's teachers performances we further conclude that in accordance with the paper even using the results to cancel teachers based on the current evaluation Model results could be inappropriate and possibly even detrimental in many cases it is reasonable to extrapolate these results to the current New Mexico abcdf School grading system to we need to be honest about what's going on in our schools into the

[02:58:00]
did the MRI and CSI and does a TSI I always forget what the labels are to the extent that it's making us be honest and looking at what's going on in schools then I think we should celebrate I think we should take advantage of it be honest but to somehow pull just random Solutions are more testing more assessment instead of saying what do we value how do we assess what we value how are we going to put in place the things that actually will make a difference in the teaching and learning that goes on in a school I think only for really horrible things to happen kids don't need to be tested more they need to be assessed in an appropriate way with teachers who have the time to think and consider and look at their practice and then collaborate with their colleagues about

[02:59:00]
what does that mean and meanwhile to have the the structures in place where you pull in the community where you start recognizing there is research about language acquisition 7 years 7 years yes some kids get it sooner some kids that means if 7 years is the average it means that some kids take way longer than 7 years and the park assessment it's not that they're not smart it's not that they don't need content and enrichment but they need an assessment that actually shows what they need and not not park that does nothing but I mean we do know a lot about teaching and learning so let's use I mean I'm going to support the the framework because I think it's a start but I think it's a start for saying honestly what do we need but let's not let it

[03:00:00]
twist us around into something that's not sustainable and it's going to undermine good work that is going on and that blinds us to what we really need to fix I'm done with a speaker I believe these young people are required to take the parcc test within a year of the time that they get here period

[03:01:00]
I have a disproportionate number of refugees so how do we get the word out how do we help people understand like there's something wrong here we sat here as a board many years ago period And I when parents of special ed kids would come and said my kid can't hold his head up and you expect him to take the parcc test you know is anybody listening I heard it was I the only one in the room no and yet we've all sort of gone along with this scheme to allow people to enrich their friends in these corporations that sell these tests to us in the millions of dollars a year there's you know we're looking for a Russian connection and what is that goddess

[03:02:00]
not much not much and we've lost good stuff I mean in the beginning we lost lots and lots of stuff we said I'm not putting up with this I've talked for 35 years when we had this grant that West Mesa High School our kids did great but when the grant went away our kids did not do that good you know those are people who live in my district I talked to them I heard what they said to me and I'm telling you we can't continue to ignore what's really going on here that's it was hard to get through all of it and being the new kid on the Block I was trying to do my diligence

[03:03:00]
I need to all the schools that are represented in these applications and it's important that you know take some time and it'll be honest I didn't get through them all I just didn't have the time to do it and I think the thing that came to to light for me or what I you know as as I was reading I think I read like 13 of of them and what what just and I agree with what board member Garcia is saying is that it's sort of just underscored for me like sort of the desperation I mean part of it is like it's like where the size of our district is both a blessing and a burden because we have you know we have a lot of resources but we also have a lot of schools that got slapped with this designation and so it puts a lot of burden on us to come up with some plans move things forward and I was

[03:04:00]
are you from a systems perspective I was really concerned about that because I was like wow just coming up with her applications like stretched are resources what is it going to do for us in terms of actually monitoring and putting in place and implementing all of these practices and monitoring it and making sure that we're getting what we're going to do does do we have the capacity to do all of this so those are the things that I just was struck with and I'm really worried about that I also think that like was mentioning about just the i-Ready and the software you know and also seems like our school districts are you know we're sort of prey to these vendors that that have these new things and these things that we have to purchase and we have to buy in order to do it and so I wasn't really sold on it I was I wasn't sure what the value was to it and there was a whole lot of money but

[03:05:00]
what it just seems to me is everybody's trying to fill that 150,000 cap so I'm going to buy this I'm going to do that so that we can get something done so I think what what this is underscoring for me is that we really need to take a strong systems approach and looking at this as well because we are going to have to I'm concerned about the sustainability of what's going to happen but I'm also concerned about the capacity for us to really truly follow the dollars and follow the work that they're going to be doing and how are those assessments coming back to us as a board too cuz I was reading our insurance is I went back and I looked at that and we have this responsibility to make sure that we're following that we're tracking that we're doing all this good stuff and so I'm really concerned about where that's going to leave us as a as a district it's it's a lot of work

[03:06:00]
I think our schools deserve you know good attention and but they deserve good work and we don't need to just sort of like have a knee-jerk reaction say okay we're going to apply for all this and and I just want to say that there were some applications that I thought were really inspired I for one and you know I'll call out one I really was inspired with Highlands proposal I thought very bold you know new approach I want to change the school day I was like Hallelujah you know somebody who's who's like really looking at something that is unique and bold and let's try that but everything else to me it just seems like it was just sort of this wrote piece and I was concerned about like how these things got selected and and I don't know I just thought like there was just the sense of like well we just have to apply we have to do this and these are the things that we're going to pick from here's the menu and sort of was like a checklist and and this is

[03:07:00]
where are we going to go so I'm just concerned I understand your concern and one of the things that we would like to reiterate with this particular section of the grant is that it's asking for dollars to support what the school is doing so you're only seeing a snapshot of the work that they're doing within their 90 Day plans and so Highland actually submitted more information as to what's in their 90-day plan then what they're actually asking money for so it did help with the comprehensive approach or other schools really just put in what they needed for money but we have their 90 Day plans as like the backup to that if you look at the MRI and the CSI applications both the questions and the rubric attached to the CSI are very specific

[03:08:00]
in what it is saying that the schools can ask for and can't ask for and so a lot of the work that the schools are doing are not articulated within the plans because the application is pretty strict in what they're asking for so I think following meeting it would be appropriate for us to go over some school 90 Day plans to show you the comprehensive approach to some of this work because it's not as narrow focused as it implies in the CSI applications the i-Ready specifically has been actually asked it kind of started as being asked for from teachers in schools about 2 years ago because schools were looking for something that would allow them to use a formative assessment and also a diagnostic that would allow them to see where students come in rather than

[03:09:00]
can just sing the summative of the park saying that your students aren't proficient or your students are a one or two but they never got to see where they actually were and so some of the work with I ready because the teacher is also don't have they have the ability but not the time to design these kinds of formative assessments and so I already kind of came about for teachers to see where teachers entered so if they were in 7th grade but they came in at 5th grade it allowed them a chance to see the growth rather than us always seeing the summative and never being able to see the growth the other part about i-Ready that has been very useful to the schools that were using it is the standards Mastery portion which really allows teachers to pull which standards that they want to see how the students are doing and realign their instruction for students based on the students met that standard or not and what it does is it actually

[03:10:00]
Laos teacher so example Kennedy Middle School is doing a great job using standards Mastery and what they do is they have like their sixth grade language arts all pick which standards they're going to focus on each 9 weeks and then they pull out the teachers can actually literally go in and say these are the standards I'm teaching and then it allows them to measure how students are doing on those particular standards and adjust their teaching accordingly so it really does provide flexibility for the teachers rather than us saying here's a form of assessment you all have to take it on this day with the questions we don't even tell they get to pick the teachers get to collaborate and pick which standards it is that they want to measure within standards Mastery and so the teacher certainly have the ability to create some of these assessments but they don't have the time to create them so there is we have like some recorder we have some some places to look at where I read is being used and there's six

[03:11:00]
so we can see how teachers are utilizing it I can say that it's one of the few assessments that the teachers in the schools actually asked to have access to because they wanted to use it because they found it so useful to their practice and I'll just add a note that probably if you it's not probably certainly if you added up all the expenditures budgeted in these grants the number one beneficiary would be teachers and staff members because the highest costs are in providing stipends for teachers to engage in additional time to improve their practice to get professional development and to provide additional services to students thank you for all your work and

[03:12:00]
you know I was still receiving documents of 10:30 last night and I know it's been difficult especially making accommodations or accommodating my challenges and so it was it was very very difficult for me to get through all of this and I you know like to be prepared so there's some stuff that I may be missing here but one of the questions I wanted to ask you know I just want to make a statement about this period how do you really how do you change that really in reality we have to be realistic about that how do you change that and make these schools make this community sustainable word adding additional resources bringing resources to this community how do we realistically

[03:13:00]
play stainless and keep these schools going how do we do this Mr President and board member what is an excellent question I think that if we had all of the answers to that that question we would be doing that and we wouldn't necessarily be here at 8:07 tonight but I all I will say and if anyone else would like to add is that its ongoing very very hard work that the district takes very seriously and all the principles that I talked to in the course of preparing these take this work very very seriously and our deeply committed to that but we need to look beautiful

[03:14:00]
definition of students who are not getting the education they need so many of their sentiments I have a quick question for you period and then at that point it would be a conversation with the public education department if the district felt that we would like to change what we might request and that's subject to their approval should the grant be funded and we're not by any means certain of

[03:15:00]
getting everything that we ask in these proposals but we ask in order that we may possibly get the funding we request oh thank you thank you again I appreciate all the comments appreciate your explanation for some of the interim language General enough to where we can do the right thing if we will so I think that's what I'm looking forward to seeing is that doing the right thing in terms of how we assess students letting the teachers do the job that informative way that they need to do it you know so options for them to do the way that they want to that's what we need to do because that's what they're trying to do is to understand that was one of the complaints I've

[03:16:00]
what about the summit assessment is that I don't believe teachers actually get very much good information back that tells him specifically what they need to do and so the formative assessments are the things that are going to tell him that and just because we said three or four assessments interments that doesn't mean they have to be bad I mean they could be something very simple they could be something that the teachers really want to do to understand how their students are doing and how they get an immediate feedback so they can change the pedagogy of other teaching so I'm hopeful that you know that the right things and not just something that's going to lead us to what we think is a better Park test and that leads me begin to see so we're seeing things on the formative things that make us really look good look good I mean doing the right things then that's what we ought to be promoting and whether it shows up on the park or not we hope it does maybe but that may not because you know

[03:17:00]
I've talked about the El stuff until I'm blue in the face and tired of talking about it because you know we already have the research that tells us about the eels and how long it takes for them to learn in terms of the language and if you're going to test me in a language that I don't know very well but I'm not going to do very well you know that seems pretty logical to use tell me that's okay let's use that that's got a five year plan so you know it's not a matter of everything you know

[03:18:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:19:00]
did you play we are working on that we have an academic master plan we have the things that we're working on those are strategic plans that affect all of our schools including the ones that were talking about high school so thank you very much I will entertain a motion for approval of the plans and the assurances as stated in our second all in favor of what they're asking of Assessments and I just want to look at a child is we need to look at those communities and look at what those communities needs and those parents need to really be able to help

[03:20:00]
your child and I just don't see all of that in there like it should be again I think I think the 90-day plans and I don't want to go on for a lot of comments here the 90-day plans are already there for all of our school so it's not easy plans involve the community plans involve that we have a lot of these things in terms of the Community Schools what she explained was is that this particular application doesn't tell you all that information is not part of this application that information on the applications as stated by the people of us so they could put a lot of other stuff in there but that's not part of the application that's what they're saying to us okay I have to believe what they're saying to us even though I would like to see these things too I hope they bring back the 90 day

[03:21:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:22:00]
what night was really difficult for me I stayed up the last I stayed up until 1:00 trying to get through it I couldn't the night before I stayed up until 4:00 in the morning trying to get through it so I like things like I've said before not a few hours before the next the day that I'm going to be having to I understand all that I understand all that and again I think these people understand that I don't think these people don't understand that these people understand that I think the point is is that when the education department

[03:23:00]
but I don't know what you want to do about it you know because in fact I think they worked as hard as they could they work to get this information to us in fact a lot more information than I probably would have liked to have done if I had been doing it myself but but I can't I can't blame anybody for that other than you know the possibility for you know for what the public education department so we just got to live with it and that doesn't mean we like it but I see we did and if I can't read every word either I had to look at that and say what's what's the big picture

[03:24:00]
that was very well I read some of the summaries I read some of the different school things and I get a good picture about what it is and I feel like that's kind of what my job is it's their job to look at all the details it's not my job to look at every single detail it's my job to look at the general picture and that's my thought of it C and so I'm comfortable with that in terms of my thinking and I got to believe the staff as the one doing the real job here otherwise they're in trouble trouble

[03:25:00]
I change my voice to a yes to abstain I don't feel prepared as I indicated earlier and my statement with regard to that community and what we need to do is deeper than what we're doing here today all right so we have two no votes we have three yes votes we have four years of 1 234 so do you have that information OK Google

[03:26:00]
guys we need to do this in a little more organized manner so that we are not being put in a in a state of and as we go forward with these things let's let's work through the schedule here a little bit and let's get a little bit more you know communication so that we're not being put on the on the table here at the last minute trying to respond to these kind of things so that you can tell that that's important message not your message that way we can take the heat support message

[03:27:00]
so if we were to extend the deadline for the schools then that would extend their ability to get the money okay I will go on to let's see where am I ok

[03:28:00]
I'm sorry I had to me okay consideration for certification for the charter schools sorry period was once we found out which schools were designated as CSI doctor did notify each of them we held a meeting to review the application

[03:29:00]
and talk about the component parts and the possibilities that the application opened we did hold voluntary workshops for writing applications for schools that wanted to participate in them just a note that the 90-day plans as well as the 30-day and 60-day check-ins do apply to Charters as well so after all of the workshops of the 10 April 52 write an application for a CSI Grant eight of them went with that opportunity and I'll give you the chance to give you a little bit more information about those thank you for your certification and approval of the applications for the charter schools Ace Albuquerque development Academy Charter School

[03:30:00]
we did provide you a briefing on each school including why they were labeled CSI in the deeper analysis that we did in our office to support the schools in that designation and provided you a short summary of specifically what each of the schools were requesting in the grants and the last thing I would say is that I'm just laughing because the last thing I would say is that the school's from my review for graduation rate or for their standing in the school grade and have

[03:31:00]
play some delicate handsome insightful ideas and our work was to support them coach them through the process get them to this point for your approval and to not infringe on their autonomy and give them an Edict of what they needed to do okay let me ask you a question before everybody ask question why are we improving anything I mean we have no authority over the charter schools and so I mean it is a discussion item I think that's fine but I don't know what it is in fact we have no authority over the particular thing it's good information for us from a discussion Point fine I have no idea why it is exactly the president we are asking for your approval

[03:32:00]
Vera grants and along with the assurances that you did for the traditional schools this is the only way that the charter schools can apply for the grants because we are labeled as their Leah for this purpose and so we are there Ali-A for most purposes including special ed compliance that you'll know that we've talked about in past sessions so in order for the charter schools to be able to apply they do have to apply through us and we have to carry their application forward and we do have to bring it to the board for approval it's confounding on the other hand we don't I have a real you know I'm not dismissing what you're saying I'm just saying I have a real question about why it is I just

[03:33:00]
I don't understand you know because we have no authority over the programs they have we have no authority over the funding and how they use that and from insurance point of view we have no authority to assure anything in terms of what they're doing with the money I don't understand what the issue is here because if they're going to be autonomous and they're going to do their things applying through us is flying from the point of view saying we send it on so to speak but from the point of us doing any insurance is I don't have any idea how I mean we can't even hardly assure her own stuff so I don't understand Joseph's trying to say

[03:34:00]
yes we want to do better and we want to have some grant money to do this but they get they do get their money through us I mean that is true right so to some extent they have to go kind of through us to get the grant to them and then the grant comes back through us to them but that's no different than everything else we're passed through to some extent on the money you know what the except that the little bit we get on the top so just from the point of view saying if we're approving the fact that they're going to send the Grant I got no problem with that but for any kind of insurance I have no idea what we're talking about here and maybe I'm speaking for everybody here but you know from the point of view of saying on the fact that we're willing to send to Grants you know but from the point of view

[03:35:00]
do you have any kind of assurances on what they're going to do with it or anything else other than that I don't think we can we can say that you know so Mr President members of the board what you are assuring is that from my viewpoint and I may be wrong this is Webster but that you're sharing that we will hold them accountable so it'll be my role in this just like I do with the 90 day plans for each of our 2995 I didn't want to call to your attention there is one school Ace charter school that won't come on line until July 1st and we were specifically told by the ped that they needed to

[03:36:00]
even though we don't authorize them until July 1st so Mr President we're trying to do our best to be supportive of the schools and you know it is our responsibility to hold them accountable and to also support them so we're trying to follow the best that we can in this interesting designation and Grant opportunity so I've seen that I've seen that I've seen that now I mean I've got no problem assuring the fact that we will provide oversight just like we do in general so we will provide oversight and any funds that they get if they get it from the grant that's fine

[03:37:00]
if they don't do it right then we're going to call them on it but we're not going to interfere with how they're doing it in Ark in our system here we are going to interfere you know what I mean we are going to interfere you know this is that they interferes

[03:38:00]
think about that approval and say that's what we're doing here so I mean the cynical part of me goes well I thought Charter Schools were supposed to magically fix everything they were supposed to be have the magic wand and simply by being a charter school they weren't going to have any schools they were all going to be A's and B's and she look at this and it's basically snapshot of the same kid that struggle in our traditional schools so the fact is that the reality is their groups of kids that we need to figure out what to do with and to meet this indicates the charters to me this indicates that we need to figure out how to apply the resources in effects and

[03:39:00]
but that's not the that's not the question that's not the question is are we going to really look this is an approval or not and that's the question we have and so you know I think we I think our emotion is very specific to what you said which is that because the money flows through us and because they have this designation that we will allow the money to flow through us and and they can prove the grant request and will allow us to actually provide oversight of that money if it's giving back to mister president that the information contained in the application is to the best of your knowledge complete and accurate you further certified to the best in your

[03:40:00]
knowledge that any and suing program and activity will be conducted in accordance with all applicable application guidelines and instructions and that the requested budgeted amounts are necessary for the implementation of the project and so in that your further certifying that no erroneous information was provided and so I just would like to remind the board if we have concerns through our contract we can put a school on corrective action so that they can correct it and ultimately you do have the ultimate power to so we are not we are not doing this assurance B is really the certification board

[03:41:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[03:42:00]
are hundreds of pages together and so what I worked with the board office and doing us to provide you the briefing of what the analysis we did to get them to the CSI designation and in that briefing we do have the focus of what the requesting their funds for we did have provided the board office the entire flash drive with all the applications and so we can provide you the applications for you to be delicate with the amount of information so I apologize if I made it no I don't think that's a mistake at all I think again it's not our job to necessarily know all of the things that they're playing for only that from your perspective we got to trust you in terms of saying that those things are accurate

[03:43:00]
the fact that it's going to go to ped and that we're going to provide oversight in terms of what it is I think it's our job to read all those things and say that it's accurate because we don't even know these schools you know they're not our schools so I don't think we're saying that it's accurate from that point but we're saying that you know from a point of view of you're going to check this because you are the office I don't want to carry this on forever but it does that in general sound okay to the board members I mean you know

[03:44:00]
certification and approval for the CSI Charter Schools as it pertains to the language in appendix be right right now okay

[03:45:00]
so okay so we have a motion in a second all in favor say aye all right I'll post okay how many say no OK Google

[03:46:00]
on their own butt because we authorize them or locally authorized they have to go through us if they want to do things and so whether they ought to have to do this or not is a really good question but I think again we've we've taken on the ace we've taken on some of the health we've taken on those things because we believe that some of the principles that they're trying to exercise in their in their educational and I think that was what we had talked about with with

[03:47:00]
when is Elder in The Innovation but maybe you can ask the question and get an explanation so on and you I don't know you probably don't have this Miss Coleman but it was from the office of innovation so they were going to take money out of other textbooks and then they were going to put it 60,000 into I guess the board request to obtain Consulting team to develop a partnership model so is that 60,000 then paying that team to develop the model I'm just kind of confused because I mean I know we talked about a partnership model and that was with the with the charter schools right here when we were talking about when we had the leadership and all those schools and we talked about the idea of having more of a CTE kind of a focus with them being

[03:48:00]
a part of a foundation for that for more of our schools and to have a model that wasn't the magnet school model and it wasn't just a charter school model but it was kind of a partnership model where it maybe they would be associated with APS more as an APS school but still have all the a lot of the autonomy that a charter has so it's not quite the same as a magnet and and so Debbie was going to I know we had some other school districts apparently that had tried this partnership model or something and and she was going to look into that now I don't know if that's exactly it or not but that's all I could come up with so I wasn't able to be at the finance meeting and so she just had a question about that so I don't know if we can yes yes this is a milestone that we need to put down or

[03:49:00]
it was part of the financial report and it was just a line item that said 60,000 years

[03:50:00]
I tried to explain it now I may be totally incorrect so you can correct that if it is the board I'm sorry I stepped out and thought I was done and so if you're never done you already talked about I apologize but I did request the transfer of dollars from other textbooks and the reason for that is that that's actually being the function of that money is now being picked up through the curriculum and instruction Department through the textbook accounts and so the 60,000 is being transferred so that we can have support from externally and developing that partnership model and I heard you talking about that as I came back in that we had talked about the board request when we brought of looking at a different model that has more autonomy than a magnet but still a District school and starting to develop that model that research was just starting to come out on

and I appreciate that thank you superintendent reading for your leadership with regard to the the issue on security in our schools and for Miss Holly who's very concerned I believe that you've addressed a lot of the concerns that she has and you know one of the things that I don't want to see I don't want to see your school's turned into fortresses and stuff and I think what we're doing is good I think it takes good planning and it may take some time but let's do it right and let me see the closure of Hawthorne I think we've addressed that with Miss Franklin Franklin Hospital

[03:54:00]
and we're all working really hard to ensure that you know we just have the best school district and I think we do I mean I think we already have a great School District there's a lot of things and places that we can improve and we will continue to improve and I'll just say I was extremely happy to spend last Friday in a little confused though with Kit Carson Elementary in the parents were it's

[03:55:00]
really you know where the rubber meets the road and meeting parents and I was struck by the comment by one parent who said you know are our schools really not the best schools and that broke my heart because she felt like perhaps maybe she had a student in a school that wasn't doing so well and yet Kit Carson is doing well and so so we have to keep working because it's that it's that like that I have a hard time with because I don't I don't think any parent should feel like they're not sending their kids to a great school so but the the principal there and the leadership at Kit Carson is definitely a reflection I think of the leadership of the school and I was really I left with really good feelings about that so thank you

[03:56:00]
play the MRI and CSI schools I especially appreciated the presentation on the budget Miss Coleman and Miss Scott just incredible you make something so complex seems so understandable thank you well done and to the leadership thank you for your leadership I thought that the work that you're doing with your department for me personally lately but I'm trying to do what I can to try to stay present and hopefully stay more positive as we move forward is too great extend

[03:57:00]
and again a framework is just a start and I think that the way it is what's really critical is how things evolve in The Next Period of time so I understand why people would vote no on these things I think there's a lot of question marks but I think that we've got to vote Yes just so we can move forward and and keep working at it and on the one hand wish that the environment was different than it is but it is what it is just keep moving forward is no matter what gets thrown on top of this cloth through it and do it is right for kids

[03:58:00]
just want to thank Franklin for he's always here and always sticking up for the schools and always has something something good to say and I appreciate you always stays here through the whole thing and listens to what we have to say and I'm glad that we have come to the conclusion that the restructuring is not at all about race which is a good thing and of course to Janet I mean yay we're going to be celebrating those 60 years at that has been open so that's that's a good thing and tomorrow I'll be at my alma mater at West Mesa for the sea perch competition so it'll be nice to go back there and to how do you say your name how do you say her name just what she said is that children need to be able to read

[03:59:00]
helps to make them become a successful person and like the child had told her that they should get the grades they deserve not the grades that are just given to them we should all get what we deserve and not just have things given to us and if a young child can can see that I think that we should all be able to to see that as well and today one of my greatest role models and somebody that I look up to for many decades passed away and I was listening to some of the things that he had to say and one of the things was were living in a world where we're always trying to people try to separate us by race and he did say it's not about black it's not about white because Christ belongs to all people and as you always ended remember God loves you

[04:00:00]
thank you that is from one of our well-known pastors I'm going to contribute to the betterment of us by not saying anything except for this exception Education Center
