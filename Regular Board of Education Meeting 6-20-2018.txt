Miss price has gone well above and beyond what is required of her job overseeing Counseling in the district and to support all of the counselors and to advocate for them on a daily basis for example she chose not to accept the award at the end of the year meeting of the school counselors because she felt that the focus needed to be on the schools and not on her Mr Price would you join me at the podium I am specifically because she works for me and I have I have the great privilege of having a wonderful employee so there are any family and friends here to support Mr Price would you please stand so we can recognize you show us appreciation again for Vicky Pryce

turn on Pandora

[00:11:00]
tonight I have the honor of recognizing several exemplary staff members is Orozco is Travis Maldonado and Miss Apodaca recently discovered a financial scam targeting New Mexico school systems Finance employees these sorts of scams can be quite costly 2 years ago a County lost 38,000 and two School District employees wired more than 60,000 combined that they were able to recover and last year the City of Albuquerque wired 400,000 to a fraudulent account which they were unable to recover and the Sakura School District lost about 200,000.00 the perpetrators spoofed my email so these emails look like they were coming from me made it look like a legitimate request and it created a sense of

[00:12:00]
I didn't say we need this right away we need this payment made right away the perpetrators were knowledgeable they had an air of authenticity and even use the name of other staff members in the emails calling them by first name they can just create this quickly it really doesn't matter so that really helped to legitimize the request also the scammer attempted to bypass our normal internal controls and the email contained very poor English so that that's one of the things that they look for both of these things sent up a red flag to miserable who worked on identifying the issue stopping any potential payments and notifying the appropriate staff of the attempt so when they started working this it basically was reported to the state auditor's office as it should be so there are their efforts resulted in a notice from the state auditor

[00:13:00]
do all government agencies in the state warning them of the specific tactics that were used in this scam the notice also stressed the importance of having strong internal controls and setting up strict processes to follow those controls so what could have happened this attempt was a request to make a 26,000 payment fairly small in the grand scheme of things we set up this vendor and missed our opportunity to stop it I am quite certain that a much larger request would have followed so we needed in the butt right away miss papa would you please come to the podium Missouri Roscoe was unable to join us this evening control processes can be very unpopular as it is

[00:14:00]
what time is perceived as just putting up block walls right they can be unpopular however many of you many of you knowing that your due diligence stop this scammer in their tracks validates our processes thank you for the ways that you support and especially protect the district let's show our appreciation for these exemplary staff members thank you in English

[00:15:00]

and although I found it hard to believe that it's actually summer given how hard people are working the fact is it must be because no one is here for public forum so we can go on to the next item of this business of National Merit Scholarships of 2,500 those included

[00:20:00]
live graduates of APs for the 2018 school year and those students are gauge Bowman Cibola High School Emily Clark Manzano High School Akshay Jane La Cueva high school Caroline padina Pineda El Dorado High School in Elizabeth Vaughan for from La Cueva high school and I'm proud to announce 6 more college-sponsored merit scholarship winners Maria Anna Cheshire El Dorado High School Benjamin C Cochran Del Norte High School Matthews High School Nicholas Justice La Quinta High School Matthew Sanchez Volcano Vista High School and Meghan Trainor in La Quinta High School these students are among approximately 3,500 winners of National Merit Scholarships financed by us colleges and universities these Awards provide

[00:21:00]
between 500 and 2,000 annually for up to 4 years of undergraduate study at an institution financing the scholarship college-sponsored merit scholarship winners are a part of the distinguished group of about 7,500 High School seniors who will receive National Merit scholarships for college undergraduate study and that will be more worth more than a total of 31 million dollars that went to these young high-achieving students last Monday June 11th at 25 summer lunch menu across the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County children were served lunch with a church that's pretty good but

[00:22:00]
that's not all as the families leave each story time in the park session they receive a copy of the book that was read and a tip sheet of strategies and supports for reading at home the goal of this APS Title 1 family engagement initiatives to support families so they can guide their children towards reading proficiency and a lifelong Joy of reading studies show that young children who have access to books in the home and who are read aloud to regularly have the best chance of becoming successful readers and there's nothing better than bringing that precious book home and having an opportunity to read it once and twice and four times and have baby brother read it that really really has an impact on our families story time in the park is an opportunity for parents to see strategies for reading aloud and questioning techniques for reading

[00:23:00]
pension they get to see that being modeled if you have not had a chance to participate in or observe story time in the park I highly highly recommend it last year I read the book corduroy to a group of students I even brought my old beat-up College corduroy jacket none of them had ever seen that material and I may bring it out again because I'm definitely going out the story of meal Adventures will continue Monday through Thursday until July 9th and for locations please check the aps dot edu website two weeks ago we watched a video celebrating 2017 2017-2018 students of the week they were just darling tonight I'm bringing a video highlighting some of the memories from 2017

[00:24:00]
18 that wonderful wonderful school year that just flew by let's watch just a few minutes of the video the communication teams have created

[00:25:00]
not nice there's much more to that video and you can watch it on aps.edu website I encourage you to watch it I also encourage you and I can't even believe I'm saying this I mean I encourage you to get onto our Twitter account

[00:26:00]
we have Twitter and actually I have Twitter my pictures on it and every single school it seems like everybody is getting on this Twitter account I mean you can see obviously I'm not very good at this sort of thing but it's so exciting because it's just like this video but even better because it is updated almost daily and it has pictures and it's from all the different schools and you scroll through that and it's like this is the real APS so I encourage you to get on to that and and look at it now right now it's all kind of like ads and things like that because school is out but if you scroll go back go back in time and scroll back and you will get a flavor a true flavor of what it's like to be to be APS that concludes a superintendents report thank you very much thank you very much know we're onto special

[00:27:00]
this is a briefing on the new Charter School application review process and it's a discussion item Mr President members of the board and superintendent Reedy in your packets as a briefing on new Charter School applications it's been some time since they district has received an actual application for a new Charter School in fact the most recent charter school that you approved was 3 years ago and that was Kimberly leadership high school so what we provided in your package is a briefing and including New Mexico State Statute which the first step that an applicant has to do is to submit a letter of intent we had six applicants do that by the January deadline the second application the second deadline is by June 1st the applicants must submit their full application to the district from their other requirements for

[00:28:00]
statute is that you as a governing body have a public hearing on the new of the proposed charter school which we will outline in the timeline that we have in the last page I've also included for you the procedural directive which corresponds to State Statute but we'll use this as we come back to you with recommendations but I just wanted to provide it to you for for you to be familiar with so for example the board May approve on page 5 approve with conditions or deny an application in an outline clearly and procedural directive and lines with State Statute the reasons you make an application finally on page 7 we did provide you a glimpse from the National Association of charter school authorizers what they recommend and one of the things that they recommend is a review team which we have put together for you so on page 8 we do have an outline of the

[00:29:00]
the first of all the letters of intent we received six letters of intent you'll notice that four of the six did not move forward for various I'm sorry three of the six did not submit applications for you know their own reasons you'll notice that the city schools charter school that was submitted by Mr Jones was submitted late it was submitted after the deadline they had been reminded that the deadline was 11:59 on June 1st that came on that deadline and so we did have discussions with legal counsel in it since it was beyond the deadline we did reject the application so I just wanted you to be aware of that in case you get any questions we did receive there is one application it's number four solar Collegiate charter school has submitted their application to the public education Comm

[00:30:00]
and then the South Valley innovation academy in Alma Sanchez submitted their application to APS and that application was submitted as Albuquerque innovation academy which is just slightly different than what the letter of intent have the review team will be made up of myself are manager of Charter School business Judy Bergs are special education liaison Patricia Espinosa James Vedra who's the aps principal support will serve on that as well with Glenn Wilcox who's the Zuni Elementary Magnet School principal and specifically this school has been proposed as Blended so with Blended learning and so you may be asking why is he was chosen but he's part of a magnet school number one number two he has that experience with Blended education and then we have two Charter School administrators who are experienced with that as well and so we have a team of seven

[00:31:00]
you'll notice the deadline was June 1st at 11:59 p.m. today we had our training with the team on an overview of the rubric that we will review and use to to evaluate the application the review team will then get back together on Wednesday July 25th to have a discussion about a preliminary analysis of the application and to see if there's any additional questions that we want to ask at the capacity interview the capacity interview will take place on Monday July 30th at 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. and so if any of you want to attend that it is a public meeting and it will be held in Vallejo Martini on August 2nd to develop our recommendation to you on August 8th you will have your public hearing with the in the policy

[00:32:00]
directions committee meeting I'll do a short introduction to that review the timeline for you the school will do a 10-minute up to a 10 minute presentation to you that will then be public forum that's allowed that is in a line with your procedures here so up to 30 minutes of public forum and then you will have an opportunity as a board to ask questions of the applicant on Monday August 20th we will meet with the applicant to give our recommendation so whether we are recommending approval approval with conditions or denial and then we will bring the recommendation to the full APS board at the special Board of Education meeting on Monday August 27th at 7:30 so a lot of work to be done between now and the statutory deadline of September 1st but we will get it done and we wanted to make sure you were aware of our process and we stand for any questions

[00:33:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:34:00]
I have a brief that has the location on it but I don't remember the exact location off the top of my head but we will be providing that to you in our recommendation do we have to make to our policy to be in compliance with this point are procedural directive I just provide procedural directive so that you show specifically what your procedures are that you are held to internally and

[00:35:00]
are you a line with State Statute we just tried to give you the whole you know State Statute local policy and then National perspective that's what I try to do when I do the briefs and that is appreciated thank you thank you thank you vice president in the district targeted at least 10 kids what kind of

[00:36:00]
how could we make and so she actually implemented that program this year called Target 10 where counselors and we have about $22,250 225% in The District so sort of add that up in your head if each you know it's a little over 2,000 kids that we could make an impact on so they implemented it this year and she's going to present to you sort of what happened and what the results were so Vicky price thank you very much vice president Garcia members of the board and superintendent radio

[00:37:00]
I'm surprised as we go through and talk about what our Target tone initiative look like so as Dr Muir was saying you know I wanted counselors to have a role in attendance so while they do so many things at the school I thought we could help a little bit so it might not seem like a lot for each other to pick 10 kids but it's already adding to their very busy case loads but they were willing because they know that address in attendance is important to the overall success of a student at school so what we decided to do how do we decided to do this was we well the reason we decided to do this first of all we wanted to align with the academic master plan it was something that the counselor said never really talked about and we thought that we could be part of that it's also a standard for counselors across so the United States to collect data so

[00:38:00]
this is a really nice concrete black and white thing that you can collect data on we also wanted to know what kind of interventions worked because while people were doing a lot of work around attendance they were saying it's really hard to move the dial and it's hard to impact attendance very positively you can work and work and work and you might get two more days you know so it's it's hard to know where to spend your time we also wanted a kind of universal intervention that every counselor could do across the district that was the same all the tenants kind of fit that role too because it was a concern at every level so that's why that's why we picked a tendency we also felt like this was really the key for us being part of the whole school community in attacking these struggles that students have also by doing this when you when you

[00:39:00]
talk to kids about their attendance of course it opens up a lot of other things that maybe they need help with which is right up our Ally is counselors so our counselors stepped up to the challenge and here's what they did they took they took attendance records from the previous year and they looked at which students had big attendance concerns and they pick 10 that they were going to Target now I left it up to them what kind of intervention they did because that was part of what we wanted to find out what was going to work and what was it plus they really like to be creative they're a creative group of people so I let them decide what they want to do now we have the data from the previous year for the whole year but our intervention last between October and March so we had to we had to do it as a percentage change rather than that because we need to compare the same data to the same data so

[00:40:00]
everybody took on 10th and then we had them submit which 10 students they were going to work with at the beginning of the year we also asked them to tell us what kind of interventions they were going to do so as a result of talking of taking on 10 and Dr Muir did talk about that we have about 225 counties in the district not everybody was part of this attendance intervention are Crossroads counselor who are drug and alcohol counselors are College and Career counselors are resources they won't necessarily part of this so the numbers are a little bit lower than than every single person in the district taking the song so the number of students that were part of the intervention were 1707 students of these 55% had an increase in attendance and if you know much about attendance work a 53 percent increase is pretty good

[00:41:00]
904 students improved their attendance this year 904 students who didn't have good attendance to previous year when you look at the students that improve their attendance here's where they really impressive data comes along the average increase in attendance per student was 15 days that's three weeks more of school that on average that they attended this year than they did last year so we broke it down a little bit by grade level and Elementary had the biggest increase which I guess we weren't all that surprised about because we felt like we could have a pretty big impact their High School's very challenging with a tennis because the kids are getting themselves to school and so that becomes challenging

[00:42:00]
what school we had success there but I think we learned quite a few things about what kind of interventions work with middle school but you can see here 488 Elementary School students increase their attendance along with the middle in high school numbers as well so we did have significant gains in each each level the next part that we looked at is part of the interventions was we kind of broke the interventions down into types because we wanted to know what was working so they submitted reports to us telling us what they did some of the interventions were individual which means they met with the student only the other interventions were parents only contact so they didn't really do much with the students they just supported the parents and helping get their kids to school did individual and parents small group small group

[00:43:00]
parent individual small group and parents so they did a combination of everything and there were also some whole school initiatives so counselors were part of other initiatives that were going on at their school the surprising part about this was that meeting with the individual student across all grade levels didn't really work what we found was that especially in the elementary and middle school levels there had to be a combination with the parents for it to be successful and keep in mind all of these were supportive kind there was no punitive language used with parents it was also supportive how can we help what can we do I think we were surprised that Luke and the parents in the Middle School level was as important as it was but we did find that that was very important High School it was more challenging for high school

[00:44:00]
but what they found the school that had the most success with this was doing a school-wide intervention around attendance and what they were doing was getting the kids involved in activities at school so when you do attendance work if your time kids into school and high school and getting them interested in coming for some other reason besides just school they're going to show up a little bit more I think that was really good information for our other high school counselors to learn so as they move forward and want to do intervention getting kids involved is a pretty easy thing for a counselor to do with all levels the most successful was when there was a whole school initiatives going on so everybody in the school is a teachers to staff everybody's working on getting to school a bit more so our conclusions like I said students had an average of 15 days we were really really proud of

[00:45:00]
that I think the counselors worked really hard we also learned what type of interventions work with students some of them really didn't take a lot of time either some were pretty intensive interventions but some were relatively simple and easy so so a lot of the counselors felt like well I can take on a lot more kids in this kind of initiative next year because this didn't take a lot of a lot of time out of my my day we also we have a lot of new counselors in the district so kind of going back to the basics and teaching people how to collect data to inform their practice that was one of my goals because it's really important that counselors have informed by something they're not just you know what they feel like is important they have reasons for doing what they're doing that they're practicing programs are set up with meaning and purpose so we're going next year we're going to continue this

[00:46:00]
we're going to do it again we're going to start it from the beginning of the school year we've kind of revamped our reports some of the reports were a bit challenging for the counselors to use so of course we were able to clean that up I think you know doing something unified as a as a group is important I think it helps us collaborate as a role group together more I think we see how our work starting in elementary goes all the way up through high school so I think there was a some very positive things the counselors are always nervous any time we talk about it is because they're afraid they'll become the attendance people at their school but what I just keep trying to explain is I feel like we all have a role in attendance and I think the counselors did a really really good job of helping students I think three weeks additional day average additional days for 900 students

[00:47:00]
thank you I'll be happy to answer any questions that you have it thank you my question is what do you feel is what would what kinds of support would be helpful in making the boat because I just know you know lots of times will try something and it goes well and it's not that it's not successful and you feel like you can keep going but it gets harder and harder year after year so what what would help make it sustainable long-term I think as we continue to gather information about types of work if we can really train people on interventions that don't take

[00:48:00]
a lot of time I think that's going to make it sustainable of course I'm always wanting more counselors in the school district which is you know is always something that we're looking for the more people we have doing this work but I think having them be having the counselors be part of attendance work as a whole as part of the school Community I think that could keep it sustainable too but I think it's the interventions are going to be the key if we can show people how to do this very easily you know with a phone call to parents or with you do meetings that don't take a lot of time I think that that's my guess anyway about what's going to make it sustainable thank you what a wonderful project I think it's yeah I always like anything that demonstrates

[00:49:00]
what's the date you know to to inform a practice because I think it helps to just sort of hone in on where your efficiencies are and so I think it it sounds like a great project I'm still trying to get my my brain into it's like I just got off a plane is very helpful for this group of people that you know the counselors is often times it's hard to see your progress you know it's hard to see what's what you know what you're making what your games are but this is really nice because you have a way to you know it's a measurable game and so that that also just sort of like Sparks the light and just makes you feel like yes I am making an impact and you know attendance is important and it's probably I mean if we were to probably go back and even

[00:50:00]
just look at those students that made that you know additional time in school or you know what was the social emotional game for them and I'm sure those counselors would see those too absolutely so but it's just a great project I love it and that's creative thank you thank you for what you're doing well as history report I don't have anything set up but yes I think we can arrange to share this with principles get this information out the counselors at the end of the year were presented with all this information and we're giving him we're also setting up a lot of information about interventions they can use for next year and I hope

[00:51:00]
I'll try a different intervention next year but yes I yes I'd like to take this show on the road and sell it to everybody then the other thing I want to hear how are you able to reach parents cuz it Elementary School it's it's a lot easier to access or gain access to parents and then middle school and then in high school how are you able to reach some of the parents I know that you said that was the most helpful thing to do it was the most helpful for elementary and middle school high school actually nobody chose an intervention that had parents involved in high school right so I'm hoping that next year that happens because the high school counselors now got to see that that's a very good way to go with students and the interventions that people did buried some was just a phone call hey how can I help someone had individual

[00:52:00]
I think some did it through parent-teacher conferences when the parents were already going to be at the school one of the counselors she sent home she talked to the parents on the phone and let him know what was happening and she said home like weekly reports yeah your kid was in school and and did a lot of positive reinforcements and what were the common strands that you saw you know with intervention with your intervention what were some of those coming over with somebody was paying attention to their attendance somebody cared about their attendance so we saw similar results with a lot of different interventions but the thing that was the same is

[00:53:00]
is families and the kids knew their counselor and they knew somebody was there to help them when they were struggling with getting to school because sometimes the intervention was just simply reaching out to them thank you so much thank you you're welcome

[00:54:00]
I think this is real important documentation that we can use in our lobbying efforts for why we need the money in the SVG because we need to have the people who are able to most impact attendants are the people who have those long-term relationships with kids and are integrated into the school and we don't need extra grants we need money to hire the number of counselors that we need long-term so thank you for doing this because I just realized it's really critical for what we use and talking to legislators thank you very much good evening thank you for allowing us

[00:55:00]
to present you tonight every year at the end of the year we get together we're called The Joint governance panels so it's quite a few people who represent APS Administration quite a few people who work as teachers in the schools all of the Consulting teachers with the park program and the two people that coordinate both the mentor and the park program will introduce a second and we have our annual Retreat what we do with this Retreat is we look at all of the data that we've collected all year long on how the program is doing we talked to him because what is that mean what do you think that means how do we can how can we change the program to address that and we celebrate the fact that we have all this information and we're doing this great work and then we get busy making sure

[00:56:00]
that we address the contract language that guides the the programs as they continue their work during the year and we then that's tedious because then we go through and we make sure that we have co-written before we even take it to the negotiating table everything that we need to agree on so that we can advance these programs so it's a cycle of doing and Gathering data and reflecting and monitoring and changing and every single year for 14 years we've done that and every single year at The Retreat we say wow we should share this information with the Board of Education and the superintendent and so we're pleased that we followed through this year I want you to know we do have this data for every year of the program but we're presenting the data that we have this year with our two wonderful coordinators you acknowledge who was for 12 years are Mentor teacher coordinator I want to introduce you

[00:57:00]
to our new Mentor teacher coordinator program coordinator and that's Michelle lemons and I'll have her go first thank you this evening received about Mentor teachers as well as the beginning teachers that we serviced this year through Survey Monkey that was provided by the union and these are the results for the mentors

[00:58:00]
the number of mentor respondents to the survey was 205 out of 285 that were signed to beginning teachers through the year that the 72 percent response rate which was down slightly 5% from last year how long these mentors have been meant for teachers is down about 10% to 64% but in the years of 3 plus and Beyond it Rose so as they gain an experience those numbers are shifting in our data and we're very happy to have that experience more experienced mentors some of the mentor responses and beginning my own classroom teaching skills is at 86610 be more reflective about my own teaching is at 9:11 and 8:10 to agreements move down 4% from 88% to 84

[00:59:00]
4% for agree but 10 degree rows from 11 to 14% in helps me develop leadership skills is at 99% which was a slight decrease of 0.22% which we feel pretty good about 60% 64 of mentors communicate more than three times per week with their beginning teacher face-to-face communication is required by the program at least one time per week and that was at 98% of the three categories of observations and total those observations calculate to large portion of the nature of the communication between mentors and beginning teachers the top five kinds of mentoring provided according to Mentor teachers being the greatest extent include listening to daily weekly concerns reviewing progress and addressing various questions at 88% providing accessibility trust and understanding at 77% offering emotional

[01:00:00]
report supporting feelings of being overwhelmed managing stress 76% modeling positive attitude professional rapport with others in addressing issues of concerns at 76% discussing effective routines and procedures at 75% when combined with some extent all five are in the 90th percentiles what is interesting as out of four out of the five top are effective factors 96 percent of mentors felt that their BT improved in several areas significant areas indicated for improvement were less than a differentiation instructional strategies effective procedures and routines classroom management all in the 70th percentile noticeably effective factors are showing Improvement in 51 percent of BTS I'm sorry amount of time spent addressing them in mentoring practices other categories specified in comments included special ed

[01:01:00]
collaborative work continue to Improvement for beginning teachers including classroom management by far and 49 percent lesson planning and differentiating at 36% instructional strategies at 30% the mentor program office feedback we added some questions about the mentor program promptly and professionally responded to their phone calls or emails 16% didn't contact the office 73% of menstrual and professionally responded to questions and or request for help about Google Classroom 24/7 didn't have any questions or need help comments about how to improve or more positive but included online classrooms Google Docs is much easier to handle comments of what country

[01:02:00]
pictures of saying and it's really tiny up there I'm going to highlight the last one this mattress said that it is it is nice to know that I can have be a part of helping a new teacher see their purpose and love of teaching in the last line in this slide I'm always inspired by the energy that new teachers have and their willingness to work hard and to make sure every student is doing well in their classes to send a survey to begin their first three years of instructions 3599

[01:03:00]
417 Beatty said that they communicate with their mentors more than three times per week 91% said that the amount of time was enough so they're feeling very supported and 4% was a combination of all types of communication and the top five beginning teachers positive attitude was at 74% emotional stress at 64% introductory questions at 6:44 and building trust at 60% three of the top five match the three from mentors 92% of beginning teachers feel they had a positive

[01:04:00]
experience with your mentor and they helped in the following categories as you can see 26 other comments included all areas or more than one area of support 94% of the following categories with lesson planning differentiation the strongest gain at 33% what beginning teachers are saying include the top one which I just love I need I need Improvement in everything except technology so that's pretty reflective of Our Generation knowing that my mentor teacher was available to me if I was in a place of Crisis I think it's pretty telling for the stress of the beginning teachers feel okay and then discussion implication of questions and projection

[01:05:00]
continue to find the mentor program the meetings and trainings and the mentoring role highly effective the location of the classes at the mentor teachers take is a source of continuous reflection revision 67 BTS again are going to roll over for the fall so we have them flagged and 108 beginning teachers start to start in the fall of 2018 that have been identified since May 7th so those are slated ready to be assigned and I just wanted to flag systems in place for mentoring that are needed to make this successful including our database that we managed on the survey monkey that allowed us to do the surveys to collect the status the Google Classroom having access to Google Classroom to be able to monitor the documentation is needed to submit in order to complete their mentorship for level two advancement and then the HR data that is shared between our Standalone database and the systems within HR

[01:06:00]
and that's all I have for you today except to say thank you for your support and my colleague Wendy's going to come up with just a minute and talk about our program if you had any questions I'm happy to answer them do we have any questions talk really super proud of the collaborative relationship that really thank you for all of that I do have a couple of questions one is are we sufficiently funded to are we fully staffed and how much are we lacking because I noticed I mean I thought that it should be every weekend and it looks like that is not the case so

[01:07:00]
so what additional funding do we need and or what's the barrier to make sure it's every every first year I'm going to defer to my Administration and to Ellen about that before I get myself in a situation but I will say that some of the teachers and so they're not always identified board member Peterson members of the board and superintendent reading I'm going to take the last part of your question first we are still refining our systems of identifying beginning teachers and making sure that they're placed throughout the year this was Michelle's first year as coordinator of program she's worked really hard to create an infrastructure between the mentor

[01:08:00]
and human resources to make sure that we're identifying new teachers and getting those names over to the mentor program as they get hired and then making sure we do it again second semester I think our goal is to make sure that we support all beginning teachers with mentors but we are adjusting systems and I think Michelle did a phenomenal job for her first year and I think we're going to do better next year right aren't you working on systems now we do all of that in a context of a state law that requires that we have mentoring for beginning teachers the state law is a great law actually we designed this program 14 years ago around every single part of that law what is unique in Albuquerque that I think other

[01:09:00]
where's ships have not focused on is the mentoring that takes place at the school site so are people are interviewed accepted into the program as mentors and then placed if there's somebody at their school and their same grade or their same subject that needs it so we've developed this in my opinion Stellar program when we first developed it there was about 1.5 million from the state that got distributed to all the school districts around the you know all 89 school districts that was then after intensive law being increased to about 2 million dollars we did Lobby for a long time to say it needed to be on a beginning teacher basis rather than taking a chunk of money and dividing it up because the more beginning teachers you have the less money you have to actually work with

[01:10:00]
and the state went into recession and we lost all that money as they were saying we're only going to fund a social thing essential things then we got 1.5 million put back in the budget and then it was there for one year and then Governor Martinez established something that she called a mentoring program which I don't know whether or not it ever was acted upon but in the mentoring program that got the 1.5 million dollars the idea is somehow teachers with high test scores were mentoring teachers with low test scores but it didn't address the law which is you have to enter beginning teachers so all of that means that the Albuquerque Public School System through their operational budget has been funding this unfunded mandate for some time

[01:11:00]
thank you do you have more questions for Michelle I don't think so that was it so the next person I'm going to introduce is somebody okay so let me back up in terms of background as we started working on developing our Mentor program we decided jointly APS and ATF that we were ready to address something that other school districts have been working on that we wanted to start working on and that is pure assistance in review period many school districts their programs have the mentoring component and a component of intervention for teachers who are identified as struggling in their profession somebody on an improvement plan we actually created under the umbrella of the joint governance panel to

[01:12:00]
programs that are connected by The Joint governance panel and as we continue to develop our support of struggling teachers through our program we realized we needed somebody to be a liaison with principles and to help principles with their work of writing plans and evaluating teachers and that we also needed somebody to help the drink governance panel with the review of the increasing number of cases that we were listening to so we asked a Consulting teacher who was working the program to be the liaison she's done an amazing job has a great data to share for us and is sharing after she retired one month ago I just want you to know that she's not working for APS anymore but she's leaving Fuller what an intro thank you for your time tonight board

[01:13:00]
where is I want to remind everybody in the room and we'll wait for this to come up I think we're for everyone in the room pure assistance and review par is aps's our District's process for identifying struggling teachers supporting them with a Consulting teacher documenting that support and then making Personnel recommendations so they are identified the struggling teachers identified by principles their supported by a Consulting teacher one-on-one both the principal and the Consulting teacher document the work that is done in very prescribed ways and then it is presented to the par panel The Joint governance par panel that's made up of two principles to teachers ATF and APS HR they're all at the table and they listen to the evidence and they make recommendations this is our 12th year of the program and so we're very

[01:14:00]
please to show our the data from our very important work so here it is in the middle of the screen there you'll see last year we worked with 66 teachers 44 were brand new new identified by principles 22 were carried over from the year before that's 1.2% of teachers of the teaching Force so I'll just let that sink in a little bit and that was similar to last year it was 1.26 last year you'll see the earlier years up there the numbers have remained pretty stable of the 6665 of the total was regular red and 25% were special ed teachers and that was a little bit of a change we had fewer special ed teachers identified this year we have some theories on that part of it being there is a shortage and

[01:15:00]
principals were in a quandary of if I identify this teacher and they lose their job I may not be able to replace them so that was one of the theories were floating around you'll see that Elementary had about double mid-school and regular Ed and Elementary in mid special at teachers were identified this year more often now we completed 47 cases of the 66 that we worked with the success rate was 55% this year that's high nationally we're really in usually between 25 and 35% about a third or successful in park programs that's the norm we have an unusually Good Year I attributed it to my very fine Consulting teachers which I'll talk about in a minute but also because as trends go some years are higher than others you'll see those teachers that decided to resign or retire and then discharged or non-renewed 7 people

[01:16:00]
lost their jobs it was 15 last year so it was lower this year and two other additional teachers lost their license because they didn't do their dossier and couldn't advance of the 66 I thought you'd like to know the levels the highest level or level two teachers most of the teachers were working with her half of them about our level two teachers and then level one and level three are split you might think oh we're going to get all level one teachers that are really struggling but that's not the case so it's an interesting mix of clients and that's all my data of slide but I do want to say that I want to point out or Consulting teachers did an incredible job this year as they do every year and a par program is only as good as its Consulting teachers that's a nationwide program truth

[01:17:00]
we have excellent Consulting teachers and they had a pretty interesting year with some challenging clients but also one of our Consulting teachers became ill mid-year so the other ladies stepped up increase their load and they just did an amazing job so I wanted to go on record to thank them and one of them is in the room tonight and that is reach a cone I also want to point out that ree has been training to take over my job for the last six months she's incredible I feel so pleased that I can leave someone with her skills this program in such good hands you will see a smooth transition and she will continue the very high quality of the work that we've done in our program we're very proud of it thank you questions I'm sorry

[01:18:00]
what what are the qualifications I'm just curious about how are they selected their elected through interview process we look at their teaching we look at their background in understanding and experience working with adults they their experience mentors their level three teachers actually all of ours right now are national board certified so it's a pretty high criteria and a wedding system and how many we have four serving yeah they work very hard and they travel the whole city everyday but they're not teaching anymore right no they're working with those teachers in their classrooms thank you

[01:19:00]
relative answer reason for why there are so few High School teachers that it looks like percentage-wise from elementary to Middle School it's really pretty balanced when you consider the number of teachers but then High School seems quite a bit lower well this year was lower last year we had more so that was a little bit surprising to us and every year the figures change just a little so it's just sort of I'm curious about how a little ones your teachers unless it's an extreme case so are our preferences is the first year that beginning teacher gets

[01:20:00]
is there a teacher and all the support of the school that they can give them we get calls from principles that though they're very concerned so they were closely with their HR staffer and if towards the end of the year they're still very concerned they can write a plan then or we can wait till the fall of the next year and write it and start the support right at the second year this is another thing that I think APS can be incredibly proud of and the fact that it's really based on the expertise and and the professionalism of teachers and not a random evaluation system thank you and an incredible panel so we know when we've made a recommendation at the park panel you have a table of professionals that have looked at a lot of evidence so it is very well transparent and documented it is defensible I've got a question

[01:21:00]
Infamous rudess and this is for a future conversation it's not it's not really for tonight but I'm just curious because over the years I know the EA's have really worked at getting a career ladder established and we have incredibly talented EA's and I'm wondering if there's anything if we can look long-term it anything comparable to the kinds of support that we have for teachers getting it in place for EA's Boardman member Peterson are you referencing as far as support to fill positions and special ed is create additional orientations just for them when they're hired so that they know what they're getting into because that is usually what the hardest part of that job is when you're doing

[01:22:00]
Pacific body needs with those students so we're working on that already but we need to address all of the EA's in orientation as well but the parents wonderful and thank you for the work that goes on with that I just wanted to add that one of the things we have seen over the last five years in the trends in the clients that were dressing is the ongoing concerns around 88 and FMLA leave and EOS complaints and the people feeling extremely targeted in all areas so I think that's what's making this job harder for the Consulting teachers and the panel because we're not just looking at performance anymore we're having to address across the board stuff and it does muddy the waters and we have to be very careful about how we approach that so I just want to praise the team and the Consulting teachers for doing that additional work because I see that is a change over the years people are trending in that direction now

[01:23:00]
thank you other questions I think we're done we're done thank you ok Google 7 a b c 1 through 13 and 15 so this is item no excuse me the items that we are looking at this evening are item 700 thank you

[01:24:00]
Nexus board member comments will start at the end all right just really want to thank Dr Thompson for including us in the American Indian English language learner research Association I think I've got the acronym New Mexico School Board Association we need to do a better job of talking about what we doing the senior celebration

[01:25:00]
is put on through Indian head is incredible the pow wow the fashion show the Dual language and the seal for Zuni and for Navajo and the efforts to grow that I mean what we're doing is not sufficient but it's remarkable you know it so I think that there are lots of people who don't realize how how much we're doing and more to do and so those are really good helpful lots of supporters of Hawthorne outside and there were lots of dedicated

[01:26:00]
add stuff inside and there are no parents who are interested in leaving Hawthorne and I think reaffirms our commitment to the schools and so thank you everyone who's been a part of developing that I just landed and always available to take care of business and I appreciate your promise

[01:27:00]
set an opportunity to attend the American Indian English learner research Alliance thanks to Daisy Dr Thompson and for her to have you know what she did she shared her story when she grew up on the on the when she grew up in the it's actually the native Nation we need to change the language that we use and we talked about that a lot but it was a fed from the US Department of Education and we had a conversation conversation it's called a native language of America it is part of the culture and how we all grow up in native land

[01:28:00]
this is how they determine funding at the federal level as they use labels and that it's important to do that I think we need to take a look at that and change that but I think the most incredible thing is that we have a teacher here at APS who teaches Zuni which is not a written language and he's incredible he teaches five at five different schools he carries a backpack with stuffed animals and that's part of how he teaches his class you know his classes and what he does is whenever the students are in class in the Bell Rings they don't leave they stand up and if he's busy they wait for him and what they do is they wait for him to provide them with his Blessing and then they bless him and it's part of the culture and respect that is showing in it's that relationship that he

[01:29:00]
mess with the students and it's phenomenal it's incredible Kansas student that has been working with at Del Norte High School Jasmine who was also one of the Young Voices in this conference and that's what we need more of and stuff and I was really impressed with that and the other thing I wanted to address and it can't go you know it can't go it can't be silent is I grew up doing the I grew up in the 50s and 60s doing the Civil civil unrest and there's a young person I was affected and impacted by some of the things that went on and I never thought I would see the day again in the United States would happen once again and this cannot be something that we can be silent about this is something that we need to talk about this is something we need to do something about our children cannot be separated from their parents and if the fact that they're

[01:30:00]
set a that the president made one change which doesn't really change a whole lot we still have parents and their children incarcerated that will be children throughout the United States that will be lost because they won't have their parents how hard this is that I know that in our district we may see some of these some of these children come through let's open our hearts let's open our hearts to those who need us to stop it really truly is the real APS and are real narrative so thank you again for all the work that you do and I have no furthermore

[01:31:00]
I just want to I had an opportunity to attend the points of light conference in Atlanta and you've never attended it was like it was like a social worker's dream I was like I felt like I was in like Social Work Nirvana anyway it's about Community volunteerism and Civic engagement it was such a beautiful event but one of the things that I came away with is just so much more appreciative of the work that we do at APS to engage our volunteers and that was through our community schools initiative and I kept thinking about what was happening there because it was just talking about how to mobilize volunteers and how do we engage students and Service Learning in the importance of engaging students in Civics and I would you know I would have put up our staff against all of those National folks anytime because I think our community school initiative should be part of that points of light

[01:32:00]
the conference just to really showcase the way that we've mobilized volunteers to really do the work that we're doing and then the other thing that was so impressive is that I had an opportunity to see the students from Parkland present so that was it was amazing and again just it was affirming with just the work that we do you know that I get to do the privilege that I have of being able to be part of the school board and listening and just being part of APs so that we could put these pieces in place and so I went there for work but it always turns out to be about schools but it was it was the fabulous event and I just wanted I just needed to say that because it was very funny because I think the work that we're doing on mobilizing our volunteers is incredible we could and we maybe do

[01:33:00]
a little bit more nudging on like Service Learning with young people and being able to give them opportunities to be civically engaged will go a long ways for us thank you just want to say you are much appreciated as a staff those of you who are here and of course is not a failing school district we don't have failing schools we have schools that are very degrees of struggle to try to deal with what they have to do with as part of their mission but they also take on many many other things because they have to and we have good stuff my heart is also broken about what's happening with these young people and their families and how they're being separated as a matter of national policy and I believe it is a crime against our common humanity and

[01:34:00]
I need to find a way to align ourselves with others who would be willing to file a complaint with the United Nation the court in The Hague or whatever it is but we have to stand up it's it's time I don't know what what that means exactly except that I think that we need to reach out to our elected officials and tell them that this is wrong and we are not going to stand for it so thank you Google

[01:35:00]
go to United Nations to the presidents are delegation seems like we don't do resolutions per se but we have sent letters off because on that note you know and unfortunately we keep hearing oh this isn't American and the fact is it's very American go to Angel Island been that fight between and that push between what does it mean in which which part of being American is going to be dominant and we can't be passive I mean I think that's the thing that what's happening to me about because there is a real fight for

[01:36:00]
soul of who we are and we need to be part of the leadership of what that looks like in the United States just pulled out of the meaning to be a very calculated manipulation and I just think in terms of what do you believe in what are human values this is a core issue that we should be able to Rally around and say no this is wrong and perhaps if we do others will step forward as well and I don't know it really it's a little out of our boundaries perhaps they're parameters but I just think that to not speak would be saying a lot worse than if we do for the criticism

[01:37:00]
okay the next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday July 18th at 5:00 p.m. in this room and the next special Board of Education meeting will be held on Monday June 25th at 7:30 a.m. and the delayo Martin room thank you all who decided to stick with us throughout the meeting and we appreciate your attendance
