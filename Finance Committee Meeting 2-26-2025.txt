[00:02:00]
strategic planning and I will turn it over to you ladies thank you thank you board committee Romero and board members this item is a discussion item to let you know what we're doing with the FY 26 budget we have a draft calendar in your packet and this list some of the activities that happened to develop the budget and the dates the corresponding dates some of them you see that have already happened for instance the community meetings happened back in October we already have rolled out some of the budget development to the schools we were anticipating an April 15th budget submission yesterday that they were going to give us an extension to May 19th so there's

[00:03:00]
going to be a little bit of a change on the dates and presentations and we will get you another calendar but this is more to give you information on the activities and the dates perfect thank you Miss Apodaca I am pleased to hear it I'm sure you are too that extension of that deadline period do we have any questions on this initial update that mess up a doctor provided I see none and Miss Apodaca I wanted to kind of put this like as a Tickler in your brain and also superintendent as we look at approval for the budget just

[00:04:00]
more closely aligned it to our goals because before I know we were being you know Mindful and we're saying it's go on and go to but to really dive in on how we're going to be intentional with the way the budget is going forward and I would also be interested in looking at what that Gap is looking like with ftes and our enrollment and because I know last year there was we talked briefly on that but to see how that's been updated from one year to the next I would be interested in that information as well okay awesome thank you we will go ahead and continue our next item is an update on the district's investment program for the second quarter of FY 2025

[00:05:00]
investment update for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 for the investment program for the district so if you notice in your documents you have for this item there's an investment summary some highlights from that summary the district is primarily invested in US Treasury agency bonds at quarter book yield of the portfolio decreased from 4.8% to 4.41% interest rate 3 million compared to 9.5 million the last quarter money market funds were at approximately 170 million to 291 million square government investment pool increase from 180 million to 100,200 from 161 million and treasury Investments were at approximately 327 million

[00:06:00]
compared to 243 million and there's some other information from our investment advisors in that packet so with that I stand for any questions thank you Mr Turnbull members of the committee do we have any questions related to this item okay I see none thank you so much for your presentation we'll go ahead and continue our next item is a discussion for operational location for change of schools and our present for this is Miss Apodaca and Draya who is our executive director of federal and state programs over to you thank you cheer Romero Tapia this item is to discuss how we have changed at risk and Title One Fund allocation this is one of the major changes in the budget that has been done previously to really address the guardrails and the goals particularly looking at

[00:07:00]
guardrails 1 and 4 this is looking at how we can make sure that we're giving the allocations of support in order for schools in priority in emerging schools particularly to meet those guardrails and to make sure that we are following the performance framework on how we distribute our resources so as you may recall this year we created the Office of federal and state programs which has significantly changed the way that we watch for duplication of services and that we are Distributing funds from a district level and so in this presentation and the information you've received you will see how we have significantly changed the allocations for title one and at risk funds to meet the goals and the guard rails through our performance framework so with that I turn it over to massage the

[00:08:00]
this work actually started with your work so your work with the communities and having the community meetings and listening about Equitable resources started us to see how we could do that we did work with e r s educational resource strategies and they took a deep dive into our finances to help identify where we could do changes they did a presentation to the board at that time and in all of their work they were able to identify operational

[00:09:00]
the only ones that really had flexibility so taking the work that they did and working with our staff we came up with these changes it was done not just by looking at and being able to do different levels and levers in different amounts and then looking at the results and seeing kind of the impact and we did that for many months for many different models and then we were able to bring the recommendations that we saw that would make the difference and support with the board is trying to do to cabinet and cabinet also looked at it with the superintendents and being able to pinpoint what you have before you I'll turn it over to Dr Blair so she can talk about kind of her process with title

[00:10:00]
good morning Madam chair members of the board and superintendent Blakey you will see in your packet on the top part of the page is our current practice with Title 1 locations and that has been the practice for several years this year we raised the poverty threshold so every year at the 80 Day Count we look and have What's called the direct certification process and we determine how many students are eligible for Title 1 funding that then delivers a percentage for school so in the past schools that have to 50% or higher threshold poverty threshold or funded School Bass in title one this year we raise the poverty threshold to 60% so any school who has a 60% or higher student poverty rate was funded are allocated excuse me school based Title 1 funds the other major difference is that schools identified as priority on the performance framework are now going to be giving off the top three FTP in order to do the

[00:11:00]
transforming schools that includes a transformational coach a community school coordinator and the Student Success systems coordinator additionally schools identified as emerging on the performance framework going to be given a transformational coach priority and emerging schools were also given title funds additional funds for genius hour or high dosage tutoring and for high-quality professional development the other major change is that the pupil allocation drastically increased so every student every student is equal to 777 so that significantly increased the amount of money that is given to schools against 60% or higher poverty threshold and that we stand for question thank you Doctor Playa before I have my questions I will throw it up to the committee members to see if you have any questions related to the presentation

[00:12:00]
I don't have any questions right now but I think that this is really fantastic and I thank you all for working so hard on this and I look forward to the results thank you member Benavides remember Dominguez I'd like to Echo that congratulations from board member Benavides I know that this is I heard if I'm correct to figure out what was the best change my first question is and I don't forgive me you might have answered it in the q&a's so will all 12:00 priority schools get the additional FTE the three additional left all priorities

[00:13:00]
Kohl's receive the three additional FTE off the top okay and I know that this is going to be hard on other schools particularly in my district I hear a lot of you know what we have Title One kids to and yes and there's not enough for everybody as we should be I hope that's a correct statement so what what are the implications for for other schools that are not do not meet that 60% are they losing all the title one money's number because

[00:14:00]
who is not 60% or higher is not going to receive school-based Title 1 funds that doesn't mean that they don't receive Grant funds and title funds and other ways and an example is all elementary schools will receive a 1.0 Behavior redirector right now schools have to have a population of 500 or higher to receive that so that's significant because there are many elementary schools that are smaller that are seeing a need for additional support for student Behavior so School base Title 1 funds is what we're talking about here it doesn't mean that those schools are without any title fund specifically they just don't have the title one allocation at the school of okay and that's a new one that's hard to know unless you're here in the presentation so are there other of those nuanced

[00:15:00]
are there are there schools who threw some calculation particularly priority schools that actually show more than 100% need of of Title 1 funds is there a calculation out there that that shows that the boards certification if there's a 1.6% multiplier and this is a little technical but what that means is that it accounts for students and families who may not have submitted documentation that would get them qualified under direct certification so there's wiggle room so yes there are schools who have a party at 100% as far as priority schools there are some priorities schools in that area

[00:16:00]
wake up at the poverty threshold is just based on the direct certification numbers and not necessarily on the performance framework so while there is some overlap that would just be happenstance it wouldn't be anything other than those students qualified as direct certification I hope that answers your question Madam chair and board member Dominguez that's a good question and to reiterate what is said because there are schools 50% implies like to when we think about it that that means half but it actually isn't half because the poverty level is so high over 100% that when you get to 60% that's actually more looking at what we would think of 50% because there are schools like you pointed out that are over 100% poverty level the other thing to really point out with these questions is that these

[00:17:00]
Airsoft funds that are dependent on federal dollars so the schools know that too that this is not guaranteed money for next school year and so that is why we are advocating for this funding particularly with the federal government because if we if it does not go through then these all of what we're talking about would not exist for next school year so this is really tangible on what the title one and Medicaid dollars are used for and if we do lose the money then this what you're hearing today would we would have to come back and change that this wouldn't exist Segways into the next question and what how are we how is the district preparing for the tenuous I'm going to remain hopeful

[00:18:00]
but for the tenuous situation that we find ourselves in I mean if have you run models that without this money Madam chair and board member Dominguez without the money it wouldn't none of this would exist so it's kind of like a dollar we would be unable to supplement the level of support that we wouldn't be able to go against so without it then they the people attached to because a lot of the money we put in even in the title in Medicaid are people as Dr Blasio's transformational coaches Community School coordinators so

[00:19:00]
we would not be able to fund these positions without the federal dollars how many are we talking about their how many positions we could get you the exact amount but it's I mean it's a lot of 1.0 for every elementary school so I would guess to me I haven't like coffee so I might be really off about 300 positions we also have department number of how many positions are funded doctor significantly according to Dr Blaze Facebook

[00:20:00]
artists Elementary event and a lot of concern about how am I remain again I remain hopeful I just tell people there's an assumption that it has already trickled down to us and I'm saying I don't I don't believe so I think they are good people fighting the good fight in Washington and you can do the same to you so but there is that with Federal money they're going to lose their jobs that superintendent Blakey and the team will keep us in close contact of anything is actually impacted and what we need to do to make decisions moving forward I think

[00:21:00]
exit thank you thank you and I have two questions for you all and my first one is is this alignment that you presented today associated with the conversations that we had several months ago I think even over a year ago so before Dr Blakey you were superintendent where we had asked about what programs we need to take a deep dive on what programs are actually effective what we needed to make some changes on and I don't remember the term because I remember board member Jackson even specifically asking in our committee meetings and as meetings as a whole if we were ever going to get a report on that is this aligned with questions yes Madam chair members of the committee yes and there's more to it I don't know if Dr Gonzalez is on but this is kind of the first phase so Dr Blair has been able to look for what we say

[00:22:00]
it is like duplication of services and so that's kind of the first phase is how she's been able to find like misalignment in Howard Distributing resources or duplication and be able to be more strategic about it coupled with that Dr Gonzalez is working on a return on investment research studies so I don't know Dr Gonzalez do you want to speak quickly on that yes good morning chair Romero members of the committee superintendent Blakey the words of return on investment return on learning and duplication of efforts have wrong in our ears since that meeting your sighting and one of the things that's a tangible is the establishment of the federal and state programs office I think I hope you are seeing some alignment within the context of this very presentation as well as knowing that we are working diligently to evaluate programs to ensure

[00:23:00]
return on learning which is another way of saying return on investment are we seeing the return on student outcomes based on the expenditures monetarily that we are expending for example right now we do have an outside contractor evaluating some of our programs to report back to us the way we are for example executing intervention programs within reading and math so a great amount of money is being used to intervene and support students but are these programs working are they yielding the outcomes we need so I'm excited about that as an example there are other examples that are in the works and we are really working to maximize the funds that we have both operationally and federal and state money so I'm happy to talk about this but

[00:24:00]
that's just a taste or an appetizer of the initial work thank you Dr Gonzalez I'm eager to hear cuz I think we this was a conversation we've had multiple times and I love to hear that you're all are making progress and actually have made some significant change and updates on this thank you my second question is a little bit to the first part what board member Dominguez was asking and it's more in relation to the schools where their budgets adjusted in the opposite direction of not receiving some of these funds I was curious how have the principal's been proactive to work with you know making these adjustments for their schools how is that affecting them and overall what is the morale of our team you know moving forward with the lack of these funds for them chair Romero members of the committee superintendent that's a fair question

[00:25:00]
change is hard and one thing that I can say is since the very beginning of the school year we rolled out the performance framework and we shared the construct or the tears the system of support we're going to use to support schools so it became something tangible if you will and then as the months went by we began to connect it to student outcomes so we began to connect it to our score card the outcomes that were seeing within our school at the beginning of this year this calendar year we shared with them the parameters of how we are going to build the budget so it became even more profound or even more real but nothing's real until you get your budget and that happened a few weeks ago so right now we've had several support sessions one is most recent as yesterday to help principals conceptualize the the how how they can build

[00:26:00]
budget how they can incorporate some of the pieces for example a priority schools the three positions into their work on the daily basis we also have our assistant superintendents working on overdrive to support on individual conversations with our principles because change in the way that things have happened in the past is something that deserves conversations and deserves an answer to why and although we've been giving that in the general sense we noticed that individual conversations and brainstorming is really important with our individual site principals at the site level so we are also keeping notes in terms of a principal advocating you know what I got my budget I realize this performance for a work I recognize that there's been a change but I need this to really make it work

[00:27:00]
so we have that list and we're working on I'm really being intentional going back to the whole conversation of return on learning to see exactly okay you need this let's have a conversation let's justify the why and then we'll make decisions based on what we do have put away for that so it's a multi-pronged approach of support but I would just end by saying that the very essence of this support is the system of support which brought us to this place to find in this matter so I hope that's a little bit of an answer to your question no that's fantastic fantastic thank you thank you and again I'll commend you all Dr Blake in your team I love the Fort Worth thinking and how we're now we're being proactive versus reactive so great job thank you thank you thank you a couple with what Dr Gonzalez said just to add real quickly the performance framework I'll also is yes schools on the priority and emerging will get more money but it's it's

[00:28:00]
tags for specific things and so I know that's something the board had brought up to is like why is money left on the table or so this money is like for a specific things that they have to use connected to our six promising practices the schools that are in the acceleration and distinction while they might get less of the funds their funds are more unrestricted so they can have these a community school coordinator transformational and how they're able to use the money that they get where is the schools in the priority and emerging while they get more their tagged for these specific items that Dr Blair mentioned okay thank you doctor for that explanation okay we will go ahead and continue so our next item is a discussion of student enrollment projections and methodology for this is Miss Apodaca and I'm sure Mr West will be joining

[00:29:00]
one of the items also that we worked on this year is we wanted to make sure that we were using a good methodology to predict the enrollment for the next year and we want we intentionally wanted to find a way to find the correct number that would be the last disruption to schools you know what Finance we recognize that home important is number is in Staffing and ultimately for student outcomes that we have less disruption so we went to our experts we went to supper and we discussed this enrollment projection and we're able to work with them to be able to use this methodology that

[00:30:00]
we like I said our intent is to try to have less disruption so I do have Chris West on the call if you wanted to talk a little bit about this methodology good morning and I don't know who's controlling the slides like I can use the slides to explain a little bit so just like I can just say we tried to find the method that would limit disruption so hope she is the idea is that we're trying to in the past what we have done is we've we've staff schools based on how they looked this year or the prior year and then you do this thing as a compliance window by the 20th day of school we look to see whether we are meeting

[00:31:00]
there's a number of students that you have to have which equate to a number either a full-time teacher or full-time teacher with the an education assistant a full-time education assistant or having two classrooms so there are these set classroom sizes that we have to do and in the past what we have done is we we kind of wait till that happens and then we have to take away a person and move into another school or at a person so we tried to find an approach that without disrupted so that way it's difficult when you have to move stuff around you get going so we did is we used three years of Prior data to them try to predict what will happen next year and then if you go to the next slide please

[00:32:00]
so the idea here is we're trying to look in it please please grant me some Graces that use a terminology that's used cuz it doesn't sound good when you talk about kids but the idea is you're looking for the number of kids who survived again this is from one grade to the next so what we do is we end up for kindergarten so we always take the lowest grade so for example for elementary schools we take the kindergarten so the kindergarten they're funded the same way based on the kindergarteners we can get to figure out what next year will happen is what happened this year and why is that because of birth rates because of school choice because of all different things it's really hard to get the kindergarten number right so instead of trying to predict that number we just say you know what we're just going to keep you the same way you experienced this year so we try to keep that last disrupted as possible obviously more kindergarteners show up

[00:33:00]
then they'll have to get more stuff or more fde but we try to keep it as stable as possible so again we also do that in middle school so Middle School use the 6th grade so 6 to 8:00 and then a high school we use a 9th grade so that whole idea is we generally find that people will start and then I'll go through the entire grades usually people are choosing to go to a school that might not be in their Home Zone area they'll still do the same thing they'll say okay my kids going to middle school next year and I like to see what's available and finds the needs of my child and they'll put them in sixth grade right now period so the denominator is the number of kindergarteners there so we had a

[00:34:00]
how many first graders were there the next year and it's just the ratio so if you have everybody stayed there from kindergarten first grade it would be one or 100% if 10 students left it would be 90% so the whole idea is doing that the cross grades and then we do a 3-year ratio to try to take into account any big changes and have you been in the classroom before or work with schools for a long time with you guys have you know that they'll be sometimes these groups whatever's going on in the world of time like we did have a little bit of bump from covid I think from people being home for a little bit but anyway that is a three year ratio is that out could you go to the next slide please so here just an example like I said I think my example was probably easier than what I'm looking at on the screen so but again I tried to show one that was a real school so this is Comanche elementary school so I was showing you guys here for instance how we calculated one of their survival ratios so

[00:35:00]
we looked at the number of kids that showed up in their school on the 80th day or sorry that was enrolled in their explanation day for 1st grade which was 41 kids and then we looked at your prior to see how many students were in kindergarten and then that ratio because they're less kindergarten to less first graders and they're working together to your prior that's what we get that 953 or 95% I have to go to the next slide please and then so what we do and I know there's a lot of numbers for kindergarten for three years first grade second grade second third fourth and at 4:50 and then that last comment was just a three-year average so if you were to look at Comanche you can see that Comanche to go down a little bit from kindergarten first grade so it's a little bit of movement going on there that's why they're ratio is point 927

[00:36:00]
but then you see that they do get a bump so there's something that happens when people then come in the first grade there and those kids stay the second grade it's a little bit of movement again and so forth please see it kind of goes up and down but the idea here is that we're trying to create an accurate measure of what goes on in the school over 3 years period so that way we kind of have an idea of that works kind of smoothing out any types of Pops so that was applied to every school and it's a change so we've had to or not we had to sorry that we show them the numbers and ideas that the numbers are public so everybody can do the same thing with us because always reaching transparent because we all are using the same tools and able to ask each other for help and questions then we can all do things together because we're on the same page you go next time please where do I have a next slide I'm not sure

[00:37:00]
thank you and you know as I mentioned before this is our attempt to try to get it as accurate as we can because our goal is definitely for student outcomes and not have disruption for the students and the families great thank you and this is exactly what I was referring to at the beginning of really interested in diving into this just to see how to use a line with our enrollment so thank you members of the committee any questions related to this presentation okay you have a question I'm having a hard time clicking on those little icons so I love the system right like you said

[00:38:00]
it's transparent it takes the average over 3 years by grade level and so I get that you're trying to mitigate any severe outcome with an average and yet I say this as a former educator classroom educator sometimes things don't pan out in the classroom and so while this is true and the looks good to me I know that between the numbers and the reality sometimes there are are disconnects and so what potential

[00:39:00]
two questions what potential disconnects are there that you can foresee and two have you have you talked to Boots On The Ground School sites teachers to to see to get feedback to lessen the disconnect that this is exactly what is going to be in the classroom teachers is that it's very disruptive when we have to change classes around in the fall will we still have to

[00:40:00]
to an extent yes what we're trying to do is lessen the extent of mobility in the 20th day count as to our classes being more at a true number so that it lessens the disruption it won't be a 100% we expect we will have to move things around particularly we would have to move schools that we would always have to if they're over enrolled so if they're out of compliance we always have to give FTE to make sure that they're in compliance we're also if they're not in if they're under enrolled then we kind of look to see do we have enough to balance on the other side but if not the money has to come from somewhere that's where you have to shift it around on the other side so it's an attempt to get a closer accuracy so there's less depression but we'll see you know what happens in the fall if we were able to lessen

[00:41:00]
Direction but really what we're trying to do is have less change for students the first 20 days of school it's always really hard when they get attached to their teachers or their schedule that then their schedule is to change and we have to because they're out of compliance so we're just trying to get a little bit better at how accurate we can be with it thank you and and one more follow up how so if you if we're trying to lessen the mobility at the 20-day count but you have to I mean if you have to make those adjustments I'm trying to remember how long it took to to have the dust settled so to speak to make those adjustments those adjustments happen by what the 80s know we make the adjustments go ahead were you going

[00:42:00]
the 20th day as the compliance date that we are making changes and we're able to see what like you said what the reality is in my experience what I've seen is it usually goes to about Labor Day in a little bit after Labor Day we start to see things settled and then sometimes we do have spring compliance so after the holidays when we start the next semester sometimes we do see some compliance issues at that time too that we definitely will address and again you know for it to settle and for the students to finish the school year thank you

[00:43:00]
okay thank you for that anything else before we move on okay thank you so thank you for that presentation we will continue so our next item is to consider approval of the January 2025 Winter Haven the floor here thank you for your consideration transfers for the month of January 2025 is composed of regular alignments program needs with nothing out of the ordinary and I stand for questions thank you any questions related to this item
