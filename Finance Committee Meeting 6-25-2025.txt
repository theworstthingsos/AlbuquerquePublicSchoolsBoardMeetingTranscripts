[00:05:00]
we will go ahead and continue our next item is to consider approval of for lease agreements for Clear Channel outdoor LLC located on Albuquerque Public Schools campuses in Bernalillo County we acknowledge New Mexico State Board of Finance required approval and authorized superintendent or Deputy superintendent of operations to execute the lease agreements and for this our presenter there we go is Mr Hawkins I will turn it over to you sir good morning good morning Madam chairman of the board superintendent Blakey again we're here before you ask for your consideration of approval for lease agreements for Clear Channel outdoor LLC Billboards and those four will be at are at Hayes middle school high school CEC and Lincoln complex just a brief bit of information that we went through an extensive process with collaborative process with the team the foundation and our teams as we

[00:06:00]
open it up and looked at some different bids or I should say different proposals so it was a competitive process and here's where we are today this and again as you said Madam chair this will still need to go to the State Board of Finance for approval and so with that myself as well as several experts are on board for any questions you may have thank you so much I will open it up to the team for any questions on this sorry it's just that we are on the list 3.5 I'm sorry 3.4 yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay so yes I do have a question and it's in reference to the answer that we received that board member Courtney it's the

[00:07:00]
first question what is the purpose of this type of media does it have a good return on the investment and the statement is made in the first sentence the Billboards are an essential part of our Communications toolkit I understand that highly visible far-reaching and Incredibly effective so how do we know that and whatever evidence supports this I'm going to I believe we have on I'm going to ask her to join me to help answer that question as far as the data we have Mickey Mouse it's a pleasure to be in front of you today I do not have specifics on The Impressions that the Billboards have and I can get that information for you from Clear Channel

[00:08:00]
over the years I think when you see the 91,000 in in kind that that states the value of the advertising that we get from the actual Billboards I hope that answers your question and kind of tackles out a little bit for you remember Dominguez but I would be glad to get the Impressions numbers if that's what you're seeking numbers but I guess I'm still a little bit unclear about like I know Roi I had someone from San Diego Zoo for for me and I never realized how yes but I guess I'm just on the basic

[00:09:00]
I don't I'm not clear about how this works so what's the cost to APS because I'm sure we have to pay something to Clear Channel we don't are they being kind so we basically have these Billboards and have for a number of years that are on our property and because they're on our property then Clear Channel is talking about we're able to advertise so you'll see like our staff of the month we always advertise them up there we advertise a lot of events up there so we're able so that's what he's talking about that we would normally have to pay thousands of dollars for to buy ads to play Billboards but because these are on our property we actually make money off of it so Clear Channel

[00:10:00]
money to the school based on wherever it is so that's one of on the next agenda item that's why you'll see Transportation has been very interested in having a billboard because this will help supplement their budget so we actually get money from these Billboards we don't pay any money they're leasing that property to put the billboard on okay so follow up then what's in it for Clear Water for Clear Channel so for Clear Channel one I think part of it is partnering with APS and who is being able to put these in Prime locations that they're able to have their Billboards in because they're on high traffic areas so I mean are they advertising that it's a clear

[00:11:00]
will any billboard that you see like on a highway always has whoever it is on the bill on the bottom of the billboard like if you drive by any billboard in the country so this does have that it's a Clear Channel they're the owners of it and and and and they so they take full responsibility I think I read in here's one of the questions they're entirely responsible for the structure and repair and all of that if I don't remember I think of it as a lease so any any property that we would be leasing or we would be landlords so we're responsible for that piece of property maintaining a piece of property right which is super simple in this case they pay us that rent amount to rent that property and then they're responsible for the the business they conduct it would be very similar

[00:12:00]
we had a piece of property on the corner of ABC somebody wanted it we rented it to him we had an agreement they paid us for that agreement what they do on that property right would be would be their peace our peace would just be that making sure the property meets all requirements and and so on and so forth with that kind of the different piece that I think the safeguards here is that we do have a say in in what is on the billboard and approving some of those things to make sure it's in alignment with with our vision board Vision with our goals and APS Public Schools so so the messaging or the advertising is entirely APS or their other is there other content there are Madam Madam chairman so that's their business that's their piece but that does I believe get vetted through our Communications Department so they run their business as part of that we get a we get so many so many slides right or so much air time for that are

[00:13:00]
put up publicly and and that's why we met him Communications Department does okay all right thank you I mean it's it's not something that you're you know everyday person this is good clarification appreciate it thank you thank you that was helpful with the explanation when I first saw the info I didn't fully understand either that it was something that they pay us I had understood it the opposite and so that's why I was trying to get clarification but obviously it's a great investment in you know to get some free advertisement and partner with other businesses in the area too you know it is

[00:14:00]
a great collaboration so thank you for clarifying that and explaining it to all of us I appreciate it any other questions on this item committee members okay thank you we will go ahead and continue our next item is to consider approval now of the lease agreement for Clear Channel outdoor to erecting new billboard on Albuquerque Public Schools property in Bernalillo County and we acknowledge that the New Mexico State Board of Finance is required to approve and authorized superintendent or Deputy superintendent of operations to execute the lease agreement and so Mr Hawkins I'll turn it back to you all right thank you madam chair members of the committee and Superman Blakey again we're asking for you to consider approval of this lease agreement and as Dr Blake he had mentioned this will be to erect a new billboard at our Patrick J Garcia Transportation site for any questions you may have perfect thank you members of the committee any questions on this new erection of the billboard

[00:15:00]

[00:17:00]
BTS fits into Zimmerman trust property and A&W would be helpful board member of Dominguez as far as I know Mary is a man is just a long time donor to K&W and when she passed this has been this was donated to them and accepts a lot of donations
