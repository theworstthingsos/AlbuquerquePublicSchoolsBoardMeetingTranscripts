[00:05:00]
aps.edu in addition for those of you here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you thank you thank you and our first Speaker this evening is Charlotte Parsons she will be in person you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking can you hear me okay yes ma'am thank you board members thank you madam superintendent I'm here tonight to talk about the upcoming bell schedule or the bell schedule for the upcoming school year that's not on our agenda tonight but I'm getting nervous about when it will be so I wanted to make sure I got my opinions and earlier than later this year has been incredibly stressful on my family and on most of the families that I know and love I think I hope that we're considering changing the order of the kids and the way that

[00:06:00]
play the times that they get there next year right now what we have set up is that our elementary students are getting there at 7:15 right that school starts at 7:30 and then most people that have siblings in Middle School including my family we take our kids to school right after that and then they sit at school for nearly two hours and before school starts luckily we have the boys and girls club that keeps them there for free but there's no way of knowing whether they checked in or not now I have a well-behaved kid I know she checks in but for people that don't and they don't know if their kid makes it or not to Boys and Girls Club it can be really scary to know that those kids can be there in the morning for two hours at Best what were setting up is to where kids are going early in the morning and sitting for two full hours before school starts bored and tired and so it's been a really hard thing on the other

[00:07:00]
can we have of course is driving our kids twice so what I do is I take my kids to school at 7:30 they're at my elementary child and then I go home and then I take another round of kids to middle school at 9:00 that means that I can't get to work until 9:30 and I know that a lot of people don't have the privilege to do that I think it would be a lot more appropriate if we had the kids the way that it used to be or in whatever some districts where the elementary school students start first and then we have the middle school students and then those students that can drive in high school can take themselves at 9:00 I totally understand we don't have the bus service to accommodate closer time together as ideally we would but Mrs Parsons I'm sorry I have to stop you you know you're two minutes please wrap up in quick short sentence all right great I'll send you guys an email with more of my thoughts but please for the love of our children let's think about changing that back thank you ma'am thank you very much

[00:13:00]
I moved to approve the consent agenda call Savannah Dominguez house is there any discussion right we have emotion from a second from member of can we have a roll call vote please Janella stoica crystals one which is consideration of approval for the nomination of Janet Garcia for the New Mexico School boards Association 2024 excellence in student Achievement Award and our presenter for this agenda item is our board Secretary General store thank you I think these are the fun things that we get to do on the board is here really great stories that are happening in our community so first I'm just going to give some background on

[00:14:00]
guess the word is I'm the New Mexico School Board Association Excellence for student Achievement award program seeks to promote the enhancement of student achievement and to focus local school boards on efforts to improve student achievement the annual award is sponsored by the nmsba and presented on behalf of the nmsba by the local school board the recipient can be an individual or group that must have played an important role in improving the student achievement at the district level so we recently met as executive team and we went through a ton of nominations because there was just amazing things happening in our district and one person stood out in particular and that was Janet Garcia and the reason she stood out was because she actually saved a student's life from choking she is the lead custodian at La Mesa Elementary School and I believe that her story just kind of brings us back to that Humanity that a lot of us don't see in the media a lot so for me it was something that we should definitely promote as not only just a way to promote

[00:15:00]
when's for student achievement or outcomes things like that but just to uplift stories that can really benefit us I think morally and just bring that I don't know that good it was good feelings back to us so that's who we as executive team decided to nominate but we are open for discussion if anybody has any questions for us or would like to learn a little bit more about the story are there any questions or discussion sorry that's not an opportunity for a few questions from the audience so with that I will see emotion for approval of this action item this is Crystal I'll move for approval of the nomination of Janet Garcia for the New Mexico School Board Association 2024 Excellence the student Achievement Award call second this is Courtney thank you we have a motion for member popular Romero and a second from Member Jackson please Janella

[00:16:00]

[00:17:00]
60 to 80 million for this presentation we have RBC Haley I'm sorry Kaley exit more than okay good evening my name is Kaylee weimerskirch with RBC Capital markets here on behalf of Eric haragan who unfortunately can make it through to jury duty so I mean Mark unless you have any further comment I'm happy to jump right into the finance update thank you so good evening and update on the district's so on your first slide we have the history of assessed valuation and I believe that they started with the presentation up thank you so here we have the district's history of assessed valuation the district's tax base

[00:18:00]
need to see very strong growth both in the residential and non-residential sectors the district's tax year 2023 AV increased by nearly 6% you know pushing the 5-year average growth rates over 4% and the 10-year average growth rates nearly 3.5% for financial planning purposes though to be conservative you know we project a growth rate of only 2% in the district's current plan of Finance so on our next slide we have the district's history of tax rates the district does have a two male Levy and an HP 333 love you in place the district also has a four dollar and 48 Debt Service tax rate to pay his General obligation bonds for a total residential tax rate of 10.00 and 59 cents the district's current plan to finance is based off of keeping the total residential tax rate level at its current rate of $10.95

[00:19:00]
on our next slide we have the district's current outstanding debt so the district currently has 430 million of outstanding General obligation bonds legally the district can issue up to 6% of its assessed value So based off of the district's 2023 assists value the district is only 35% legally bonded to capacity with over 800 million dollars left in legal capacity if you can see at the bottom of our slide we have a bar chart of the district's debt service requirements the principal and interest payments and you'll see that their structured in a rapidly declining manner this allows us to lair in future without a tax rate increase additionally as your Municipal advisors are always looking for potential refunding or refinancing opportunities but we just do not see any at this time in our current interest rate environment that's something

[00:20:00]
always look out for two continuing on for the district's overall did management plan so the district did successfully go out to voters for 200 million of General obligation Bond authorization back in November of 2021 we have sold 70 million dollars of that issuance authorization so far we plan on selling 80 million dollars now with 50 million dollars left of authorization to be sold in 2025 on authorization the district is scheduled to go back out to voters in November of 2025 for an election amount currently estimated to be $240 million dollars that election amount is subject to change both on the needs of the district and based on the fluctuation in the tax base additionally this past November the district did successfully renew its sb91 again until 2029

[00:21:00]
as I mentioned previously the district does have HB 33 in place also and with that lasting for 6 years it won't need to be renewed until 2027 continuing on we just have an overview of the time schedule of this issuance so again tonight we're just updating the board on the plan of Finance you know your April meeting we will be back to help the board or walk through the board with the authorizing and delegation resolution to go to sale we are currently in the process of obtaining a rating from S&P once that rating is released will begin tomorrow's starting on April 17th what's the sale of the bonds expected to be on April 24th and then closing currently scheduled for May 15th which is when will be available for the district to spend on voter approved projects so if that I pause and see if anyone has any questions for me regarding the 2024

[00:22:00]
wholesale or even the district's current plan of Finance thank you are there any questions no questions from the board thank you thank you for your time and should you have any further questions please do not hesitate to reach out to myself or any of my colleagues thank you that's the conclusion of 7.12 which is an update on the district's investment program for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 or presenters are still and Mark Turnbull along with Deanna Woodring president and Senior advisor of government portfolio advisors an update for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 with that

[00:23:00]
I haven't had the opportunity to meet government portfolio advisors has been your advisor for about 6 years now we've been very proactive in the New Mexico Market we managed about 5 billion dollars across all of our accounts down in New Mexico and it's a privilege to be in front of you today I wanted to just touch on so I will share my screen here and make sure you guys can see this so I have our report for a year in and I wanted to just touch on some of the structure and how we managed the portfolio and look at the portfolio for structure and investment

[00:24:00]
so I first touched on interest rates we've all heard a lot about interest rates in the market and I think they're real key with how we're looking at the Investments for the district are very conservative but active as far as looking at where opportunities are within that conservative measure the key over the last year has been we've had significantly higher interest rates that have been pushed by the Federal Reserve and actions of the Federal Reserve board and the district has benefited from that and we have benefited in a couple ways One is using making sure the banks and the money markets are paying Market rates and that stepped up quite a bit as well as we do have an investment component that invests anywhere from 0 to 2 years to three years in the portfolio so having those balanced portfolio structures allows market and I to really look at what's going on in each of the sub-sectors of the portfolios and we have them divided up by purpose which I'll touch on in a moment the key with this slide is that we are

[00:25:00]
interest rates and so what we're looking for in the portfolios is just making sure we're locking in as many rates as we can across the investment Horizon and we've got a pretty good discipline and how to invest each of the subsectors we haven't seen 5% yields in over 15 years I've been in the market since a long time ago 1982 and we are have to be used to in and embrace changes in interest rates and that's what your portfolio strategy does these I just brought you comments on what's going on in the markets and just for a kind of a brief overview we've been through a very high inflationary period after covid inflationary inflation is coming down but it's not quite at the target at the Federal Reserve is looking at 2% until it hits that they will not bring it back down when they do come down though they normally come down pretty rapidly so we're trying to position the portfolios to make sure we're balanced

[00:26:00]
and being able to handle that movement and keep the portfolio earnings at an attractive market rate the overall structure of the portfolio we have cash and cash equivalents the cash equivalents are held at either the money market funds at the bank or at the state LG IP and then the investment component is comprised of US treasuries Agencies and US Agencies security so conservative in nature but dynamic as far as the investment structure the overall earnings yield on the portfolio right now is it 4904 that is up significantly from where we have been over the last several years and the average maturity the portfolio is only three months so the key with how we invest fixed income securities in balancing risk and return in the portfolio is through that average maturity so you're pretty short so you're not exposed to Too Much market price yet we're being able to reset the

[00:27:00]
values in each of the portfolios when we look at the components we have the bond proceed Capital project Bond proceed portfolios in each of the sectors we have a investment component and a liquidity component the liquidity component is made up again of those bank money market type instruments in the LG IP the Investments are comprised of those US Treasury and agencies and having both Investments and liquidity is really important because as those rates change they offset balance each other so as of the year-end December 30th the investments in the bond proceeds account capitalization at 5:30 the investment core investment the operating fund at 5:49 and the liquidity of the operating fund is at 5:31 so that's where we're pulling up those 5% earnings I will know that our longest investment fund is the self-insurance

[00:28:00]
when did the school district is self-insured and so we were investing those Securities out over a 5 year period of time and some of those Investments were made at those low rates so he totally expect to see that you'll come up as well so the key for you is as the oversight board here is there's discipline within the structure of the Investments and the portfolio has reset very nicely with this increase in interest rates GPA also provides a comprehensive compliance report this compliance report every couple of years we bring forward the investment policy for the district so this shows you an oversight level and at the do sure capacity level that the Investments are being made within your both statute and policy and describes out those percentages of your total holding So 20% of your portfolio is held in US Treasury Securities about 17% is held in US agency security and the remaining are in all government investment pools

[00:29:00]
conservative in nature but the portfolio is being is in a way that's able to shift to these interest rate moves and then the other part of the compliance report is on maturity structure so the portfolio 60% of the portfolio is under 30 days that the liquidity component of it and then by policy on 100% is shorter than 5 years and then the rest of this is just the Holdings that calls out exactly what I just kind of covered in the summary level for you for disclosure purposes it does have the ratings scale on all the Securities that you own and that is it for my report so I stand for any questions read thank you for your presentation are there any questions from the board there are no questions so thank you again and with that we will move to agenda item 7.3 which

[00:30:00]
is our budget update for presenters are still running Opelika or Chief Financial Officer joined This Time by Rosalinda Montoya executive director for budget and strategic planning update for 2024 budget and 2025 I'm going to give a brief update on these are the funds that we received for covid Relief a legislative update right now I'm just going to give

[00:31:00]
a very brief update since the governor still has not signed the whole legislative packet and I'll continue to bring more updates as that progresses then I'm going to do the FY 25 budget timeline and we will have FY 25 budget presentations for Capital Food Services transportation and special education so I'm going to begin with the next slide on the operational budget versus actual so for FY 24 or budget was 923.6 Million are you today to expenditures are 489.8 million we have encumbered 373.5 million with a balance of 60.3 million which will be

[00:32:00]
by June 2024 and next is our funds update this is the federal covid relief funds we received 242.1 million we've we're very happy that all the spending is moving very smoothly as planned and we've only have like available to spend about 26 million of the 242 million which is about 89% of the budget so we are well on our way to to have all this spent and of course we have listed there the big buckets of what this money has gone to and I just want to mention that we made sure that we did not do a lot and reoccurring expenses and if they were reoccur

[00:33:00]
we already had designated places for them to return to for the FY 2525 budget the legislative update the brief one that we have right now the highlights that I'm have is just the 3% increase to all public school Personnel the general fund was 95.6 million we receive about 23% of that which would bring us to receiving about 20/22 million and our operational and transportation cost for 2:00 is about 25 million so that portion would give us a point to million shortfall the second item I have on here is the appropriation for health benefits the general fund was 25.6 million or 23% of that

[00:34:00]
what's 5.9 million but our cost is 8.7 million with another shortfall about 2.7 so combined we have a shortfall as of right now of 6 million with those two items so the FY 25 now moving on from FY 24 to 5:25 are operational budget timeline we are already in March I can't believe it but you know we sent out all the school budget templates and we also sent out the department templates so and we also had Community discussion about the budget and we've got a lot of feedback which we will go over in more depth next presentation and then now we're going to move to the to the budget presentation for 25 and I'm going to pass it over to

[00:35:00]
thank you thank you wrestling so bored president members of the board and coming superintendent tonight we begin our FY 25 budget presentations this is our second year to utilize the sfog guidance to display our commitment to student outcomes by aligning to APS schools honor guard rails and support the Strategic plan we begin with support departments that provide infrastructure Transportation food and nutrition and support services these establish the foundation in order to provide educational services to our students the budgets we will discuss tonight include some of the funds that we described in our community meetings these funds are

[00:36:00]
allocated for specific purposes are presentation includes Capital food and nutrition transportation and special ed so we're going to start next please on next with a capital fund so Capital funds are made up of SB 9 which is voter-approved property levies you heard that before in the previous episode for specific projects and those projects were named in the election right now we are working with 2017 bonds 2019 Bonds in 2021

[00:37:00]
we talked about the purpose of capital funds and they are for facilities for infrastructure to support the district we talked about the scope of the funds to support the master plan and capital projects and we also listed allowable use of the funds next and the next slide you will see the breakdown and it makes sense that most of it goes to Contract Services because as you know we use a lot of contractors for construction and we also have some allocations for equipment I wanted to bring to your attention our breakdown and when we looked at actually making sure that we could display how we're

[00:38:00]
the goals we looked at the interrelationship between a supporting department and academics or instructional because if you think about like in this instance and with food and nutrition and even Transportation it's hard to say like which square foot is for reading or which square foot is for math or which breakfast is for reading so we looked at it as a support to what the schools are doing so if the schools at the district identify certain percentages that they are using for for the support department should be supporting that so we took those percentages and we allocated the support department funds so there's a correlation

[00:39:00]
now another way we could have done it was to get the whole amount and divide by 4 but that we didn't feel like that was reflective because if they School says we're doing 60% to reading but then we say the supporting department is doing 25% it doesn't make sense so we wanted to make sure that we proportional and allocate them so the supporting Department support the schools so that's how we came up with those breakdown okay thank you and then the next slide is the questions from SFO G so in the sfog there's guidance on the type of questions at the board should be asking so we tried to make it easy for you and and make sure we put them in the document so that way the questions are there and

[00:40:00]
responses are there so we're able to tell you if the budget is expected to increase decrease or remain flat we wanted you to know the strategy with these funds what are we changing what are we doing different so we are going to follow this or the other but it's going forward and then next on the next page we wanted to give you some specific examples so we have some expenditures description of the expenditures and then again the guard rails so you can see for instance career vocational

[00:41:00]
so the next FY 2525 budget is food and nutrition services we have on the next page we have the purpose of these of this budget the scope and the allowable use one thing that I wanted to point out is how many meals are served with from our food and nutrition services we have almost 3.3 million breakfast 5.9 million lunches 5.8 million snacks and $130 points 130,000 dinners so they are very busy department and you'll see something interesting in the next one that I point out their scope of course is to provide nutritious meals and then there's some allowable use of the funds

[00:42:00]
one thing that I find interesting with food and nutrition in most of the budget we say that 90% goes to Personnel this is the one budget that Personnel is a smaller portion than their actual supplies because they provide all those meals and that's the biggest expense oh sorry and then so and then explained the the first two columns are the breakdown of that the person being smaller than the materials and supplies and then that explanation of the gold breakdown being correlated with the schools goals since food and nutrition is also a support department on the next page are those questions is your budget expected to increase or decrease their stay flat and the answer is

[00:43:00]
well is the strategy with these funds and what is changing and if they're going to be using these funds any differently from how they did in the past and one of the things that they are doing they're going to be updating and replacing their equipment the next slide gives examples of how of specific examples of how they are related to the goals and the guard rails the summer feeding and family Thanksgiving meals guard rails for New Mexico girl produce or rail for ETC Transportation roughly its between 20 and 21 million

[00:44:00]
and it is based on ridership we have to report to the PED similar like we do with enrollment we have to report ridership on 40-day 80 day and one 20 day and then they have an allocation method to be able to fund Transportation next again we documented the purpose of APs transportation and it is to transport students to and from school safely and on time ready to learn the scope of transportation and the use of funds next again we have the breakdown of the expenditures you can see most of it goes to personal we do have some Contract Services for bus

[00:45:00]
actors and we also have supplies and materials again we use the same methodology to be able to show that we support the schools and the proportion and allocation next and here is the sfg questions again how we do see it increase because of the 3% increase in salary and then also the strategy anything that's changing and how they're going to use the funds differently next and we want to give some expenditure descriptions again you can see that transportation of students is supportive of 12344 special education preschool students and we transport to and from

[00:46:00]
BBC and early college which is related to go three Transportation does get funding or they do provide for field trips but one of them that Transportation funds 100% is they transport 16 elementary schools to the state capitol during the legislative session and that comes out of their funds and next is special education next one is very important because it kind of shows they have two main sources of funding one is operational and one is federal their total budget is about 270 million dollars

[00:47:00]
I will start with the operational portion which is about 242.6 million and and here they have their purpose of the funds the scope of the funds and the allowable uses of the funds of the operational funds on the next slide we have the breakdown of operational budget and along with most of the funding we see that the biggest and 13.7 million goes to contracted therapist and Subs about point one goes to gifted education and 12 other and then once again the gold breakdown is correlated with the school goals

[00:48:00]
and then on the next page we have those answers to those questions is your budget expected to increase decrease remain flat and it also has an increase for the 3% increase of employee pay and what their funds will be used for their strategy was changing and how the there's no major changes but minor changes occur as needs vary from here to year and then next we have specific examples of some expenditures that directly go to 1234 and guardrail to with the disability and give to teachers and educational assistance software supplies and materials for gold one two three and four sign language interpreters therapist and counselors go 1234 and guardrail

[00:49:00]
turn into the next we move on to the special education federal funds next ahead of me and then they have their purpose of the federal funds and the scope and the label use of funds for this and this is about 26.4 million and the breakdown of that 26.4 million again the most the largest portion goes to Personnel at 18.7 million the next about 3.9 million charters in private schools 1.7 to supplies and materials 1.6 to contracts and 5.5 professional development and then the gold break down is correlated with the school goals and then for the federal portion of these funds

[00:50:00]
questions have been answered this on this one in particular it will remain flat what's their strategy what if anything is changing and how it is different from prior years next we have specific examples of things that go to particular goals and guardrails compliance trainers go to guardrail one as well as assistive technology and then we have academic trainers teacher support and software that all go to go one two three and four and we have Representatives here from all the support departments that are here to answer any questions that you may have with that we stand for questions great thank you for that presentation and I will go ahead and open up

[00:51:00]
42 questions starting to my left thank you so first again I love these presentations and I just love how you've aligned it to the goals you you're being proactive and even asking the questions Associated but my question specifically to the charts that were you have each goals listed out for each specific department and then we have other for the other category are we seeing a common I guess Trend with each department of what we're allocating specifically to other that's outside of our goals this was actually the proportions that were using is for from this current fiscal year cuz we still haven't correlated everything together for FY 25 and what came to us another was kind of a variety being the first time we had some people that thought the other was like

[00:52:00]
custodial employees or or some didn't know like supplies how do I allocated to a particular one so it kind of had a lot of some variation but what this year we kind of are gathering the the goals and percentages a little bit differently we're doing it more of a survey instead of having them do each line my line because it was a little more it was confusing to so that was one of the improvements that we did this year so it'll be interesting to see what this how this will break down changes now that we're doing it in a different fashion so we will give you that update of how it turns out on the may present in the main presentation thank you and then okay and I feel like this is something that's a common Trend every time we see our budget

[00:53:00]
each year reports looks like we're going to show up being deficient you know by a small amount this one's 6 million and I know we usually end up making adjustments have we thought I'm sure we have what we thought ahead of where we're going to absorb that do you know offhand for me since we sent these out we've already seen that actually that has probably reduced a little bit because most this is for all employees including those that are paid with Gramps cuz we have to make sure that we're going to be at that they're able to support that increase right cuz a lot of times the grants don't increase and so we have to see that and it looks like all the grants are going to be able to cover that increase so it's gone down already a little bit I don't have the exact numbers for thank you for your presentation I

[00:54:00]
I have a question about food and nutrition services so I'm like 16 I believe it says that meals for students with dietary needs and offering vegetarian items daily is that something new that we're doing or is it something that's already in process and what does that look like at the school level I'm not sure if Sandy is here to answer yes I am yes good evening with you know just different dietary needs as a doctor prescription

[00:55:00]
thank you no more question great thank you remember the Migos I'm going to pick you back off your food and nutrition question and so I hope she hasn't gone very far I've been out in my visits to schools I hear from nurses that they struggle sometimes to get snacks to kids particularly middle schools because they have such a long day and they're struggling to accommodate appropriate snacks for diabetic kids so they are the fruit this is the report the fruit

[00:56:00]
go quickly and then what she's left with and I don't know how she gets this food but she squirrels it away I guess after breakfast what she ends up with is cereal like Cocoa Puffs and I forget the other Fruit Loops and so I just want to raise a raise that as a concerned and maybe we can I don't know how we address this kids are coming in at 9:30 and then again at 3:30 and I guess it's because of the way things are staggered lunch is staggered 11 12 and then one just creates a very long day I don't know if snacks are provided to Med schools and so

[00:57:00]
that's something that maybe we can address somehow I don't know if your budget I know budgets are tight but I worry that kids are going hungry and I know that they're also not allowed to get seconds is that also correct if they come back out I don't know why they're scrolling food because really that is not appropriate because we don't want to have another areas of the building so what students don't want to take there should be an area

[00:58:00]
students to be able to take for a stack later on those are going to be items that are not perishable because we don't want to have any cheese sticks yogurts or anything like that in the backpack and end up having a child get ill or a sibling and because it was out of temperature so the snack program at a middle school is not it's after school snacks are provided but not during the school day the only time is school day snack can be available is that the top schools where is extended day and the state PD allows us to do it our funding is federal it's not through operational so you know if the district would like to purchase next and the District of if that's the way you want to go about doing it thank you

[00:59:00]
I think we're going to have to be creative about how we the information that we get from schools right I mean when you have children in front of you it's it's it's it's very different I mean I remember as a teacher having Ramen in my closet ready to feed children and so I will move on to another question if I may and it has to do with the special education the first question under Federal

[01:00:00]
is your budget expected to increase decrease or remain flat and the answer is remain flat and yet our needs at the school level seem to be at least schools in my area seem to be increasing I was informed by one parent who is going to send me information are you aware that on New Mexico has the highest number of fast I don't know what that was fetal alcohol syndrome babies so that would impact she was challenging our efforts my explanation of our efforts to decrease the number of kids in special education

[01:01:00]
and so I said thank you for that information I'll take it I'll take it to our the next appropriate board meeting and so here we are and so I just question again my reports are that there is an increase in needs in in special ed and so how do we Square what is what local schools are reporting with with the budget presentation and I think that's just for future FYI there's a disconnect and and I think we need to address that and I will turn this over to Bonnie to give any insight on that

[01:02:00]
good evening for president Dr Blakey in members of the board like to introduce you to Bonnie Anderson she is our director of special education budget and data so first of all representative Dominguez you are absolutely right the need for special education services in this district is increasing while our overall enrollment is going down our special ed enrollment is remaining steady increasing slightly those needs are being covered by our operational budget with teachers is the office so we are covering those needs even though they're increasing our federal budget supports mostly the expert support trainers

[01:03:00]
compliance people and additional supports to classrooms it's not the basic classroom service that comes out of our operational budget and we are covering those needs did I answer your question or not really well again there's a disconnect between what is reported and what teachers are facing at the school level and so between that and and what I'm seeing here I just think it'd be great to to have walkthroughs and then it's very interesting when I'm invited to hear instructional councils talk about what they're having to do to accommodate a tightening budget even as they are

[01:04:00]
and part of the problem I know is it's hard to get evaluations done quickly for whatever reason I mean again there's there's a disconnect and and it would be helpful if and what number will be back probably in June to present to you again on that on our federal budget and how we're supporting students in the district so I think the more that we have specifics about that we can address and I think the most specific I can be is if you look in District six sixes

[01:05:00]
play some individual schools will just for or request forward to the administration of the only other time I want to add is that we are very aware that we have a lot of vacancies in the district and that has put additional pressure on those license personality that are still with us and are still serving kids and it could be the part of what you're hearing is that struggle to find enough licensed people that are willing to come and work in our schools it's not so much a lack of money as it is a lack of a pool of available license teachers and we're working on the time you're absolutely right and it is if you bring in a substitute then that case load has to fall on existing

[01:06:00]
teachers and yes any more questions yes but I will hold off okay I'll turn to remember benavidez thank you so much for the presentation and it was fantastic and my first question was answered so I appreciate that I was really curious how the allocations were made on the pie charts for gold one through four so you explain that but my second question is regarding food it's very popular topic I've been too many constituent meetings especially for my District Four where in the parents and the students are curious if there is a chance for the menu to be very to be more reflective of a very diverse student body and I don't know if that's an option but I thought that I would ask and let you know that that's what they're talking about well I appreciate anything back and yes we're always taking no information about what students are

[01:07:00]
going to eat the product that's what we're after and we do have to have the menus compliant and with the amount of menus and special diets and everything that has to get analyzed normally it's about 24 different menus we run on any given day that we have to have analyzed so having that additional work to would be hard to accommodate just certain areas of town we do it for the district and it gives the opportunity for students to taste all different types of ethnic foods thank you so I actually do you want to go back to that pie chart and specifically just as an example the capital goal breakdown I I I'm not sure I totally understand it and so I I think

[01:08:00]
hang on a simple level which I'm sure it's not this simple on a simple level like even if I just take Gulf War in the capital gold breakdown sorry go one there's 94 million allocated to go one so on the most simple level with that be 94 million is allocated to Elementary Schools Board member Jackson I'll try to help with this question because I asked the same thing and finally so once I understood I'll try to teach back so really the capital money and most of these infrastructure money's really are 100% goes to all four goals and is probably more seen in guardrail 2 as far as the equity and infrastructure so assigning them to goals is kind of difficult because they really are the like that the bottom of being able to achieve the goals

[01:09:00]
so what Finance did was they took the averages of the school so when they have the school budgets that the percent of each school budget that went to go one two three and four and other was put into this chart so I don't know the off the top of my head but this looks like approximately 30% was to go one so they just took 30% of the overall capital budget so they align the percentages of the schools as a whole to these so that's why all of them are the same exact percent because they just divided 100% of the capital budget into the percent of the schools as a total okay so can I clarify back so as an example let's

[01:10:00]
do we have Smith Elementary School and Smith Elementary School has returned their budget to you and they've said 70% of our funding is going to go to go one 10% going to go to go to so then what you did is when you did the capital gold breakdown you put 70% into the blue box of Smith Elementary School into the blue box and then 10% Into The Orange Box yellow box yeah and it's not an initial school it was all the schools together as a whole OK Google and then that's why some of the breakdowns are kind of similar because you get the high schools that probably have more Elementary

[01:11:00]
combined those percentages were applied okay so in the operational budget when you see that and you see an overview of the operational budget for schools and what percent goes to each goal it will look exactly like this with all the schools combined that's the exact same graph okay okay that makes more sense to me and so this is because this is fy20 5 this is the projected amount that will be going to the schools for next year 2041 my other question was answered about the shortfall so I think those were that was my thank you remember

[01:12:00]
I got three for special education my first one is I know with the gifted teachers and majority of them are halftime have you looked at increasing any of those positions currently I know I know right now you're really strapped on the budget but I don't know if that is a possibility it's not so much a budgetary constraints the the same item I was talking with this board member earlier a lack of available training license teachers and we don't want to allocate in such a way that the the available teachers flock to certain school so we tried to kind of put the allocation level where everybody gets something and as we can find

[01:13:00]
more available license gifted teachers and identify more gifted students we can increase those allocations okay a second question I know PD is looking at making a universal IEP and I don't know when that's coming out is it in this next physical year or board member Tom radio they have not given us that date yet I know that it's something still in the process and so we anticipated it should be coming out soon but we haven't received any details on what when that'll be okay I was just wondering based on your own budget right now if you're going to incur any costs when that new IEP comes out and look at it and Anderson can speak to the Olive Garden in the system yeah so we'll definitely be looking at a lot of men men hours to do that and training training our our teachers are IEP special

[01:14:00]
it's going to be a roll out and we hope that we receive it sooner rather than later funds is PD going to support in that particular area or is it going to be totally on APS today hope that they would support but we could probably anticipate that it'll be on APS so as we look at our federal funding and you see some of the trainers that are in their we do have trainers that will support schools and will help us with that role out in addition to our exceptional District specialist but we have been here tonight that will be charged with supporting schools and principals okay thank you my third one I forgot it but no thank you very much I just wanted to know what those extra costs that may incur as we're rolling out that whole IP process you know and I know it's going to be a tough one so thank you thank you I also want to thank the team for the presentation and

[01:15:00]
for being so proactive and thoughtful and already answering the sosg questions for us which it made it very helpful for me because I think those were a lot of the questions I would have had I also want to acknowledge that many of us did ask administrative questions or provide suggestions for how many should be spent or get into the Weeds on some of these things which I think is fine for this meeting but I think as we move forward it's important for us to think about how we stay in the board Lane around strategy goals and guardrails and so my question is related to the goals and guardrails specifically and I think it's probably most appropriate for Acting Superintendent Blakey it is helpful to see the projected changes and what projected strategy changes there might be as well and implications and so I think of the guardrails in particular as being the frame

[01:16:00]
on which the district can use to make trade-off decisions so in a resource scare environment if you're going to have to make a cut you'll make that cut by prioritizing wraparound supports Equity high-quality curriculum and instruction voice and engagement and staff support So if you're looking ahead to potential cuts and as it was reported in the media potentially up to 12% and cuts how are you thinking about using the guard rails in the garden and the goal of the goals to inform your strategy around those potential Cuts Barbie allocation board president members of the board I think in exactly the way that you're talking about it but I also want to reiterate what Miss Montoya said about the SR funds so that money that we're losing that could be for seen as a budget cut I think the district was very proactive about making sure that those funds were not recurring funds so even though it will look like we have less money

[01:17:00]
those are all things that were put into infrastructure or one-time funding very low number of people and the people that are on it most are able to be brought in on a place where they were moved from which I don't want to get in the weeds of that but a lot of it will be absorbed so the budget cut of Esther dollars in the SR Cliff isn't as prevalent in Albuquerque Public Schools because I think we were pretty proactive about knowing that that was short-term funding and with the finance they even had to like if people requested that you had to check this is not recurring and if it is what's your plan for it so that was good proactively but yes the guardrails are really you used to make those hard decisions so that it is done in almost a very non-biased way as to if it's a pet project or something we really liked because with the goals

[01:18:00]
honestly we can argue many things are connected to the goals and I've heard a lot of people say oh this is connected to go one which is great people are talking about goals but it's really the guardrails as far as how we're prioritizing Staffing funding and whatnot and that's where those conversations come in also with us looking at duplication of services it's really connected to the guard rails and if we're seeing duplication of services that aren't connected to the guard rails the roads have been really helpful in us being able to make those non-biased decisions in prioritizing funding and doing things differently as well thank you for that so I know we potentially had additional questions from Member Dominguez and maybe memberito do you have additional questions not right now and I'm scrolling

[01:19:00]
formulating a question after your presentation but it's not complete so I don't want to hold everybody up I'll just write it in all right thank you and thank you to our presenters as well for that presentation on the budget and for all of your work and preparation for it so with that we will move into agenda item 8 which is our executive session so we will have consideration of approval for the Board of Education to convene in executive session as authorized by the public meetings act to discuss strategy for collective bargaining negotiations as allowed under Section 10 - 15 - 1 185 and pending litigation as allowed under Section 10 - 15 - 1 877 legal cases to be discussed are number one of LG
