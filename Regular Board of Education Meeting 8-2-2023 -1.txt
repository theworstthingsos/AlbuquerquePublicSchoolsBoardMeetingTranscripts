[00:08:00]
graduated from the Washington Middle School today I am here because there's some parents we have found out actually that APS is considering investing to expand the school the elementary school Coronado all the way to the 8th grade something that it seems that if if if it's done

[00:09:00]
will limit the access only to students to continue studying from 6 to 8 grade as a mother I am part of the San Jose neighborhood I am very worried that all those neighborhoods around the area and the schools is Gonzalez and the Washington will be affected who is behind this project of investment it says we need the investment the financial investment and then continue with the bilingual Pro like something like that such as offering the opportunity to every student that wants to be part of the school

[00:10:00]
that they will have the same opportunity to be a registered and continue such education the values of the Albuquerque and the new Mexican families go further than just a few that want to limit the access in in any school to the families and students and their students and we cannot take the risk that such access for educational

[00:11:00]
Play La Senora Gloria 377 Washington Middle School of them have graduated from Washington Middle School

[00:12:00]
are schools you know we already have a building why not invest in the building that we already have I said Muchachos Mexican recipes because there's been a lot of changes in The Faculty that's a substitute teachers Etc and they had to go through all that and their education has been affected so why go through it is impossible for the students to focus on their education when some of the classrooms are extremely hot or extremely cold and so we know that a lot of the buildings need to be

[00:13:00]
bodily improved to avoid such thing as maestros Brandon Thomas Nissan

[00:14:00]
so I would like to play with you to please consider investing in our school and an hour bilingual program that is so important it's such a great thing when people are able to speak to two or three languages right now investing that so please consider this this evening I'm here you know as a parent or something that you would look at that Mexico score thank you for listening to me tonight and all of you as well you know why not invest

[00:15:00]
schools that are already working and so I can I play with you to please reconsider and and think about this all the students in and you in New Mexico deserve to have a great education why not work together towards that thank you so much for allowing me to make my presence thank you next time if two minutes period

[00:16:00]

[00:18:00]
play I am a product of Albuquerque Public Schools bilingual programs transferring in the east side of Elementary School transferring into Washington Middle School and then attending Albuquerque High School where I earned three bilingual skills which I have credit to the bilingual programs at both East San Jose and Washington I am here to advocate for Washington Middle School's bilingual program as it is fundamental to its feeder schools to its community and to its students both neighborhood and transfer and many of those students are now going on to high school and to other higher forms of education so Washington Middle School program is a necessity as it provides students many from

[00:19:00]
lower socioeconomic backgrounds the tools to succeed in a much larger and more competitive educational environment in high school comprised of students from all backgrounds Washington Middle School's feeder schools some of them do have bilingual programs so how does it make sense to take away the program that Bridges the opportunities provided at the Elementary and high school level I want to end today by I guess pleading you guys to keep Washington Middle Schools bilingual program and supporting it there really is no need to revoke or take away resources from an already spread thin School District thank you thank you mister and board members that is the conclusion of public forum

[00:20:00]
thank you I just want to say thank you to all of our speakers for coming tonight and sharing your thoughts and concerns with us and we're going to continue on with our with our agenda so just really appreciate you taking time out of your schedules tonight okay so our next item and this is for the audience one of the things that the district is doing is we're focused on student outcomes Focus governance and there's we're going to we're going to continue with this and we're going to actually have this at the first of our agenda tonight and a commitment that we're making is a district to be focused on the work that we're doing to improve student outcomes tonight actually the first item that we have is our self evaluation as a board we are committed to doing this on a quarterly basis and this is an opportunity for us also to to take a look at the work that we've done today and where we are so I just want to

[00:21:00]
I just kind of want to preface a little bit of what it is so there are I have to put my glasses on so we're using we're using a rubric that is given to us by the Council of great City schools and the framework for the students focused governance is built around six research informed competencies that describe School Board behaviors and the degree to which we create the conditions for improvement in student outcomes and those those competencies are vision and goals values and guardrails monitoring and accountability communication and collaboration unity and trust and continuous Improvement so we're looking at each of those components and how we're setting the conditions to do that so the board has made a commitment to our own professional development and the work that we have to do in order to set those conditions so that we could have some success as

[00:22:00]
so I'm going to ask for each of the board members one of the things that we had to do part of our homework was to look at our rubric in our evaluation tool I know that I had some difficulty using one online some of you may have not because I'm just struggling with the whole Google but we did put it on the Dias for everyone and so it's just looking at this and if you recall what we have to do is we have to kind of go through each of those sections and say what kind of points we want to give ourselves or the not so much points but where we felt like we're making progress so it's always a great opportunity for us so social worker like me to say how do we use this to be reflective I really want to use an opportunity to be reflective around the work that we've done but also to be honest with each other as we're on the days to are the areas that were struggling with if you've got like some personal concerns and places where maybe we are struggling and we still need

[00:23:00]
I'm interested in your thoughts on that as well so I guess you know I'll just open it up if you would call I think last time we still had 0 points I believe we were still at 0 points which is it doesn't mean that we haven't accomplished a good things so if we're looking for us at vision and goals I don't know if someone would like to just take a stab at where you think we are on that and what are some of the accomplishments that you feel like we've done on this one okay I think I think we've actually moved to 10 to 10 poyntz and because I think what was holding us back last time was the interim goals we still had an adopted interim goals or sorry the superintendent had still not adopted interim goals in collaboration with the board and so I think that now

[00:24:00]
we are there so that kind of combines with the next the next blurb that the status of each interim goal is able to be updated multiple times and I think the presentation that especially Dr Bowman gave last time kind of delineates how it can be updated multiple times so I think that we have made Improvement up to 10 full points on the vision and goals section other board members still about that I gave him a 1013 so the board publicly we publicly posted our goals for the public and so there we did that prior to adoption but we also have them on online and on a web page so we definitely have made those available and they're out there is there anyone that disagrees with that feels like we not accomplished that area so no struggle there anybody

[00:25:00]
I only had it I underlined it I think we accomplished it but it's I think that the status of each interim goal is able to be updated multiple times during each year I'm just curious how the others interpreted that well I introduced it and I'm looking at Bowman if he ever if he wants to correct me on this but I believe that when the girls were presented it was beginning middle end of years so that was like multiple times throughout the year that we were going to be updated plus we have the then we just get a calendar and she's got a progress monitoring calendar that everything is is outlined very specifically over the next five years how everything is going to be monitored so I was had full face in the ability that it was monitored multiple times

[00:26:00]
okay I think the only one for me that still hangs me up a little bit is on the smart goals measuring the population starting point in an ending point starting date in an end date only because we don't have a real true measure just yet we're still on x's and y's so that one just it calls to my mind that we're still not quite there because it's not clear to the community what we say we're going to grow some a certain percentage but we don't have their I didn't Dingus on it because I think we're making great progress to that because we're waiting on on some information but I know we're real close and Dr Bowman has like he's nodding his head yes because I think we're going to get really close there on on ways but we've made some really good progress around that and that was the only one that just kind of left me I mean if I was like going to hold herself to truth Fidelity I mean it just made me a little nervous but I think for the most part this is the area on the vision and goals I think that we've done a really good job of being

[00:27:00]
really clear and articulating those and really getting those out and you know down all the way into the classroom all right we can move along then move on to values and guardrails how does someone anyone else on the board how did you score us here I have a sister and again the values in the guardrails were real explicit on some guardrails making sure that they're understood and we're going to be spending

[00:28:00]
play a whole lot more time because our next presentation after this is about the community engagement but how we're going to continue this process of making sure that we're communicating that piece now I just want to remind everyone that's watching it in the audience is that these are the this is the work of the board we're responsible for getting all of this done and so we we have spent a good amount of time about over a year basically getting input looking at this and and coaching ourselves up through this process so that we could make sure that we're that we're going through and we're getting these things done so when we move on to the next one monitoring and accountability and he was like I mean mine was like between a 0 and a 10 if we could give it like you know that's what I would and we can't write do you want to describe why it's still a zero I just think that we don't know yet that we are investing 10% of the time that's I just don't think that

[00:29:00]
I know that for sure we're just starting and as far as you know receiving monitoring reports we have got one but that's not report so if you take it as plural then I'd say those would be a couple that I would you know that's why I would probably have to give it a 0 even though I put it like a five five how about the rest of the time I tried yeah I was kind of in that same spot as well because with the good parts are is that we have adopted a monitoring calendar so we have made some progress and I'm monitoring calendar does span the late of our goals and our guard rails I mean so it's it's definitely for the next five years I I don't know if I was a staff member I'd be really happy about that because you kind of know when it's your turn so I think that that makes it makes it really simple for us to start to anticipate when something's going to come up but it also helps the public anticipate when a particular goal of guard

[00:30:00]
who's going to be discussed and when we're going to be going over that so if you haven't had a chance to take a look at it those in the audience or those that are listening is it is posted so you can see when when we're going to monitor a specific goal or guardrail so we have agreement I think on a zero there okay good communication and collaboration how about board member top you remember what are your thoughts on this one I'm sorry I probably am still at a 0. 1 2 5

[00:31:00]
there's just a lot of Disconnect on some of these other areas that we haven't followed through completely just yet I can get something that we that I think we've done well that were so about receiving the final version of materials in advance I think that the the staff and the board Services have done really well on getting us the material in advance and I think we it's a process but we're getting much better at sending in our questions in advance and reviewing everything timely so I think that first it's still in the zeroth that that's something that we have done well and we're and we're getting better all the time I know for I guess the person who's been on the board what a difference that has made for us to get materials way in advance because it gives us an opportunity to do our research think about questions that we have and sort of prepare

[00:32:00]
prepared we're not looking at something just at the first time first read that was really difficult when we used to do that because it would I think it would catch staph off guard too as well as we're trying to Pepper questions right in an open session it's not it's not easy to do so I really I just want to say too I really appreciate staff on this superintendent has told me that staff is appreciates it but we also know that we still have some work to do on that too because we need to also meet our deadlines around that so if we've got a deadline for questions we need to honor that as well I think that is something that we have to work in terms of changing our Behavior so that we can make sure that we're not creating a whirlwind where we don't need a whirlwind we need to be really thoughtful about that process because it is this is a team effort this is about being in partnership with the district and we need to be better stewards of that as well so but I do want to say thanks to the staff that have

[00:33:00]
you know receive those questions and get information to us timely it's really been very helpful really appreciate when there's links to other documents or information that can really spell it out for us so so thank you there so we have agreement we're still at a zero there right because we have some things that we need to work on all right another section is unity and trust and this is the board will lead with one voice and its pursuit of the goals on this one I think we are at is 0 I mean we're working on adopting policies and I think there's going to be a lot of discussion I think we are very much and have some very serious conversations that will be discussing at the policy meeting on the 7th I think

[00:34:00]
specifically addresses the the board has not adopted policies that establish wait wait the board had the negative we will be discussing a board operating procedure document so I think we're we're working on it we're getting there but we're still at 0.005% and new board members coming in how wonderful it's going to be to have it spelled out that way I mean I know as a board member who came into this process is not necessarily everything neat for us in a place so I think this will help us with our government structure and also just add that coherence to that so it's a it's a good start attendance is good art tenants

[00:35:00]
I wanted to point out something for the public you know that we were going to have some good discussions around and and good clarifications around conflict of interest and I'm looking forward to that so yeah 8:00 all right the last section is the board will invest time and resources this is continuous Improvement at the board will invest time and resources toward improving its focus on the goals and how did how did this I guess I'm not spoken up on a score or else you haven't spoken up on the score if you have good attendance yes you have good attendance of our time in the board meeting and we are doing

[00:36:00]
evaluations yes we are we are doing self-evaluations which is really important I think it's important for the public to know too that part of this is you know tracking the estimated annual cost of Staff time invested in governance during its annual self-evaluation so you know we know that when we create World Wind or we create that it's also cost to the district to do that because we take you off of something else to get prepared for this and give us other information and we need to be we need to be thoughtful about that too so how are we how are we staying you know the course and also getting the materials and the things that we need for continuous quality improvement we've got to commitment to that but also that we're not that we're investing wise and terms of the time and how are utilizing everyone's time towards a progress toward our goals and our interim goals any other comments anyone have any comments or Reflections in terms of just you know you're in so

[00:37:00]
where and how you're feeling about you know this process and what it's meant for us so far or what it's meant for you personally I'll just like a short comment that something that popped out when we were when I was reviewing this and I started it but I think it repairs to be repeated where it's on page to the bottom it says the goals and interim goals will challenge the organization and will require change in adult behaviors oh look at you you so I think if that's something we keep at the Forefront of all of our decisions like we can't do things the way we did it in the past and really intentionally make that shift it will help us move forward I guess I'll be a good social worker put that back to you because for me I think I'd like to do things it's causing me to pause I'll say that because many times I want to do things now and be quick and move forward and for here

[00:38:00]
play obviously you have to collaborate with other people and it's not just about a decision maker but multiple being involved so it's caused me just to be a little bit more patient in the process and that's been that's hard you know but we're making progress any other Reflections go ahead board member Peterson okay so I've been thinking back about the community and certainly without a doubt people care about kids coming out of school being very literate and very mathematically competent and you know all of these other things but the other thing that we heard and I think we talked some about this meeting to be in our yard sales but I'm not sure if we are taking it to heart

[00:39:00]
the things that we heard very loudly from the community was that they didn't want test scores to be the only measure by which kids are evaluated that they wanted students to be seen as individually as individuals and instructed in that way and they didn't want to go back and I think this was certainly not absolute and there were people who will live and die by test scores but I think the overall the community spoke very loudly about wanting to see children experiencing their education and learning in a way that is different from the kinds of high stakes testing that we had lived through for about 10 years and I think we wanted to have that attitude reflected in the garage but

[00:40:00]
but what I fear as soon as we have a goal with a numerical outcome in the goals are leading that the things that we heard that are supposed to be reflected in the guardrails start getting pushed aside experiential learning project-based learning how classrooms function and how students are in the classroom and I think it's something that we need to be aware of and I think that's part of the whole process of monitoring right because we're going to be doing things on an interim basis and they're going to be bringing information to us I mean I think that's the role of the board is to continue to hold that value and how do we see it reflected in the way that the works being presented I think that's when the work that we need to be doing is not so much on those Technical and tactical questions but it's really around the strategies like how is the

[00:41:00]
what is she going to be reflective of you know the ways that we can assure that children are experiencing that you know that that opportunity in a different way and it's not just about the test score but how how do we also draw that how do we draw to that outcome using other strategies and I think that's that's the key to it so that's going to be the important side I think of where the board is going to be and you know and I understand that there may be pressure at the classroom level or at that level to look at it just really you know myopically from just the test score just the piece that that need to do but I'm hoping with the Strategic plan and the road map of how we're going to get there and some of the strategies that they're going to put in there that it's going to sort of blend and they're going to be able to speak a little bit more about that and I think the first practice session was was a good session because I think we could see some of those things in there where you know we there was some questions around strategy but

[00:42:00]
but it was incumbent on us to ask the harder question of like what is the strategy that's really going to get us there so I think that's where that's where our role comes in I think it really holding that value board member controls you're like shaking your head do you have anything you want to add to that you're being so amenable tonight I do have something to add and it's a concern that I've had I've been looking at the summary that are consultant Ashley pause put together so are you coming or are the parents who attended the newcomer Community engagement and I believe the the tribal

[00:43:00]
we're really clear about a global awareness education right critical thinking skills that they described as being aware of Self in the world they reference stuff that represented their voices and we can't allow those ideas to be eclipsed and and I am concerned about not honoring those voices because

[00:44:00]
and part of that is very clearly Multicultural education but pay attention to those who are protected groups that we reference in our in our goals so it's a big it's a big list so it has you a little concerned that's good that means we still have work to do for ourselves as well remember Jackson you had something you wanted to yeah well I think because your question was how has this process helped us to reflect on what we do is the board and what I have really really appreciated about this work over the past what year and a half you're a total right is it really delineates what is board work

[00:45:00]
and what is Administration work and what is our role and what is the world of the administration and it has been really helpful I think there's a tendency of always got you know we got to be involved in everything but it really helps to understand like we do the governing work and then we have to trust the administration we have to trust the superintendent we have to trust the people that he hires to then use their expertise honestly to then deliver upon the goals that we have set forth and so I just think this this is going to be so helpful moving forward to remember that we have to trust what you guys do you know what the goals are you know what the guard rails are and you have a strategic plan and so we're here to to govern we're here to Monitor and you know we have to have a have that separation

[00:46:00]
which is also I think going to be really important as we move forward like your editorial set actually yeah like just dawned on me as we move forward right that this is 5 years this is what this is going to look like and this is what the new role the new rule of the board is and that's to govern so I really appreciated the work for that I was going to I was going to tap board member so it's like your your little motto that you learned it's like with your what was it with your oh yeah your hard work and my support yes with your hard work and our support we're you know our goal is to get there so that's the mantra for us to is really also letting letting some of this go which I think has been been really helpful and trusting our experts and treating you like experts too and treating you like the professionals that you are so that we can trust the the collective knowledge out there about the experts knowing how to get

[00:47:00]
we've just set the vision and where we want to go and so working there and I'm I'm the same with the board member topping Romero I think it's it's about patience and I really have what I appreciate is that that's what this process is done for us is board members but it's also brought for me as a board member is it has focused what I know what my name is and I love that we're having conversations about student outcomes and we're not having just these other conversations but really talking about how we're getting there and what's the you know what are the outcomes that we're seeing and where where we're headed to what we're doing that's the part that makes me really excited so I'm really grateful for that all right so what I see as we add up our totals here I see that we have a total of 15 points for our for our

[00:48:00]
is the where we are but you know numerical score it doesn't mean that we haven't done some hard work we're continuing to do this process and it is a continuous process and so as we're continuing to improve the district's continuing to improve as well we know that not everybody is going to be scoring at 100% totally right off the bat we're in this all together and that's the goal that's that's the culture we're setting is that we're in this process to learn and to continue to do the best that we can around this rubric and around the the goals in the guard rails that we set for ourselves so with this actually need consideration for approval of this and I need a motion for our quarter to three of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation of the Year order 3384

[00:49:00]
it's going to have a roll call on that maybe on the air gun yes Danielle Gonzales Barbara Peterson yes this is the top of your Romero yes that's enough right our next item for discussion is our community engagement is going to talk about some of the activities that we have plans coming up to board members Courtney Jackson is heading this committee and board members Danielle Gonzales and Josefina is our part of this yes so we hit the ground running and we were appointed two weeks ago at the last board meeting we met Thursday we met the day after and our objectives of this committee is set forth by the board is to one create a two-year plan for community outreach that will be a follow-up to last year's

[00:50:00]
student outcomes Focus governance leading listening sessions if you'll recall we went out to the community to ask them what their vision and values were for our students it is also to share the goals in the guard rails and the Strategic plan and how we plan to achieve those goals in cooperation with the administration we are also going to use this opportunity to seek input on characteristics from the community for our next superintendent and then the second overall objective is to create a standard process for Community engagement again for the at least for the well we're going to create a calendar for the next two years but we also want to create a standard process so that again we have we have standards as we're moving forward so that as the board turns over we still have that that in place so currently our most

[00:51:00]
Ordnance objective right now is to work on a community Summit this is going to be a really cool event so starting on no Tuesday evening August 30th August 29th August 29th we are going to have a community enchilada dinner at Albuquerque High we are going to invite everybody everybody but specific invites are going to go out to those who participated in the community listening sessions and the point of this again is to introduce the community you know we we told the community we were going to set goals we told the community we were going to set guard rails and we told the community that we were going to set a strategic plan for Albuquerque Public Schools and we've done all that in conjunction with the administration and now it's time to celebrate we've worked

[00:52:00]
we've done a lot of work over the past year and a half and so we're going to celebrate that so we're going to have a big enchilada dinner on August 29th and then the next morning we're going to have a a VIP breakfast and then a summit and the community Summit is really again going to to to highlight to kind of have individual discussions as to what the goals the guardrails and the Strategic plan do as well as use this as an opportunity to start to bring back characteristics that we want to see for our next superintendent so that is that is all in the works that is the pertinent work that we are doing right now and we the invites are going to go out this week this week so start looking in your inbox we know media is on there so on look for your look for your invite so the

[00:53:00]
the summit will be held at Berna facio and we're really looking forward to this this is we've worked hard this is a celebration so so we're excited about that so that is our very first community outreach event that is is coming up really quickly and then again the next thing is part of our objective was to kind of create an overall plan and I think board member Dominguez has some updates on how that plan is going and we're just in the preliminary stages there was a brief meeting and got a sense for what worked last year and what what tweaks need to happen to the system we use a year ago in October so what we do know is that the community engagement events will begin October

[00:54:00]
again and we're going to try to wrap them up by before Thanksgiving and you hit on something that's important we're going to have to figure out a way to make the community engagement systemic there was a great idea board meeting to get feedback so that's that's an idea what idea but this 2 year plan will be posted and its and its preliminary stages and we right now we're we're

[00:55:00]
nail down and then we'll we'll transition to the more substantial to your plan discussion remember Gonzalez do you have anything to add that I did not touch on you did a fantastic job of covering the work of the committee so far the only thing I would add is one of the themes sort of undergirding the conversations is that this is the community's plan it's the community's goals it's the community's values it's the community's and as we have changes as we have elections as we bring in a new superintendent things are going to be changing in the district but the community developed this plan the community owns this plan and the community will need to continue to own it in partnership with us so a big part of it is really thinking through partnership and collaboration and opportunities so that we're not saying hey we developed this plan and look at it but we're saying hey we all developed this together and we're in it together and we're going to implement it together so I think really just thinking through

[00:56:00]
during all of this transition and change that's going to be happening across the community in the next year I love the way you tie things up with a bow thank you any questions I have a quick question are going to have a capacity at a particular venue so it's not like it can't just be like yeah everybody come I mean I mean I think we all have to think about capacity correct I mean so so I'm just thinking of that because we've got the the journal here and I was like oh you know I just immediately went there and I got a little bit anxious about that so so there's going to be like there's definitely going to be like an invitation and a process for that so that

[00:57:00]
Dr Blakey back there was kind of going wheat wheat you know like where are we going to have this we're going to have to be at Wilson Stadium or something you know it's like but so to be thoughtful about that process too I just want to just make sure that we're there but we are going to have a celebration of some sort and there will be an opportunity for the community to participate in that and then I think with the community engagement events that are going to be slated in the fall it'll be a continuation of that evaluation of that celebration too so they'll still be opportunities for other families to attend not everybody's going to be at this one big giant event because I can imagine you know I'd like to think I mean I'm positive thinker like I like to think that it's going to be everybody's going to want to come but you know we don't have like the convention center so we have to to kind of maybe we pivot on August 28th doctor I'm just it just makes me nervous that's all

[00:58:00]
so we have a capacity of 200 right now all right and yeah and so yeah good problems to have yeah absolutely it'll be a great problem to have but I just got nervous but that's that's that's that's exactly why we included RSVPs so that we could keep track of the numbers okay and real quick before we move on I really want to thank Miss King Dr Albright Miss Barnhill for helping us with this I'm sure if sometimes feels like we like our steamrolling but it's you know it's important to to bring the community into it so I appreciate the help that you have given and Miss Barnhill if you're listening which I think you are thank you so much and Dr Aldi know you're listening so thank you so lots of good

[00:59:00]
used to report out that we have coming up in this process for continued engagement with community and under the student outcomes Focus governance that's its continuous it's not like one and done so when we went out to the community last year we are real intentional and that we said this isn't going to be the only time we come out this is going to expect this as a new way and this is board work this is us going to the community going out and and soliciting this input and getting that feedback to us so that we can also roll it up and it will become part of our evaluations it'll become part of the conversation as we go through this process and hopefully you start to share with everybody through the board meetings the understanding of where our community is and what we're listening to them say so we don't go just at the beginning of a strategic plan at the end but it's a continuous process so that they're also can ask questions at that time about where monitoring is where we are what's the status so

[01:00:00]
I envisioned it as this continuous loop of this two-way opportunity for communication about where the district is and we can start to gain I think some trust also around the work that we're doing so good work you guys got there like Fast and Furious but I appreciate that and any other discussion or concerns on this not we can move on all right so our next action item is the presentation on the negotiated agreements and Mr Torgerson chief of human resources and legal support services and Dr Valerie who's executive director for Labor Relations looks like we also have God I feel bad because I don't know him the lawyer he's going to sit in the background just kind of whisper in their ear so thank you so much thank you so much

[01:02:00]
we did provide you the documents ahead of time so that you could look those over but we did want to give a brief overview of the changes there was a lot of cleanup language that was noted in the overall document and I would like to emphasize that this year we primarily focused on the interests that were developed by the management team and by the ATF team so as brief overview of the changes for ATF I did not bring my glasses so I need to bust out the big paper we updated the preparation time language to ensure that all teachers are able to receive their appropriate time we established a site supervision stipend to ensure that the duty is covered we increase differentials for special education head teacher athletic directors and coaches we updated
