[00:05:00]
Gonzales will you please introduce our speakers yes ma'am thank you our first Speaker Romaine Romaine thank you again for students on the autism spectrum I am here today because of my profound concern about a new District policy that is reducing funding for schools that serve large numbers of special education students this policy bases general education funding on the percentage of time that special education students spend in general education classes this budget change will reduce funding for teachers who instruct my son in art

[00:06:00]
music and physical education by half I am disappointed and alarmed that APS has decided to implement this policy US federal law Section 504 states that our special education students have a right to be free of discrimination in schools that receive federal funding but this policy contradicts Section 504 it will mean that many special education students at Colette Park will simply not receive the same instruction as those that other schools within a PS that have fewer special education students in effect this policy is punishing Colette park for serving students with special needs to stop over minute please in one sentence wrap up what you have to say it is fundamentally unfair and openly discriminatory discriminatory to allocate funds in this way it is illegal thank you man our next speaker is Amelia Robertson if one minute one should begin speaking thank you

[00:07:00]
good evening Madam chair members of the board my name is Amelia Robertson I'm here as a concerned parent and I'm here to thank the board for the common sense policies around transgender students that APS currently has current policies include calling trans kids by their names when I was coming up that was considered basic human decency I know now some people consider that ideology and I don't know if any of those folks have ever had a nickname I did also want to address comments around suicide rates at the meeting two weeks ago trans kids do have a high rates of suicide this is known but I urge the board not to confuse effect and cause trans kids have suicide because they have high rates of homelessness Pirates of suicide because they face abuse at home physical and sexual from parents unsupportive parents who would try to beat the game out of them one thing that is statistically true if you want to reduce the a trans child's rate of suicide by half

[00:08:00]
all you have to do is have one supportive adult in their life so I'm urging you please let him continue to be able to speak to teachers and counselors in confidence I'm not exaggerating I'm not being hyperbolic when I say current policy is Saving Lives period and the reality of what happens when individuals are encouraged to transition versus engaging inappropriate therapy John that children identifying as transgender have an increased suicide rate of 600% this is not because of the state of confusion but due to the consequences of transitioning through chemical and surgical mutilation The Narrative students who do not admit gender

[00:09:00]
yeah we'll have an increase of an increase chance of committing suicide is an absolute falsehood it is after starting puberty blockers and hormone replacement that individuals show a dramatic increase in suicidal Behavior 10 years post gender reassignment surgery the suicide rate triples to 2000 % General mortality is increased by three times crossword placement increases pulmonary embolism by five times a study in American cardiologist reports a six times higher risk of heart attacks and seven times risk of a stroke do not Define reality please be informed and protect our children is Ruth Porta you have one minute man once you begin speaking thank you

play which ranks 12 nationally for gun violence and which is the leading cause of death for teens in New Mexico we asked this they support our safety that our APS police presence be increased at our schools giving us more boots on the ground and eyes in the game to prevent these instances also that the Board review current policy to be more in line with the reality which is student on student and violence and not necessarily active Intruder Mass situations which we are trained in for Alice please wrap up very quickly the time to believe the time to work together towards Solutions and real issues is upon us School safe should be of the utmost priority in order for us teachers students in schools to drive thank you very much thank you very much speaker is on Zoom Rebecca Boyer yes that's correct me we can hear you when you begin speaking it'll be one minute hi my name is Rebecca Boyer I'm a educational and I have been

[00:23:00]
EA with APS for over 22 years I love what I do I love my my students and I love my school it's a great school and we have a great staff that are working tirelessly and one of the things we're working tirelessly on is are preventing gun gun gun gun possession as well as violence in our school recently we had a a very scary situation where it turned out to be unfounded where someone students started receiving text messages saying that there was going to be something going down at West Mesa many of the students were very afraid some came to her administrators who started looking into this right away but many of those students went home and they were afraid these kids are at all of this they are students who are dealing with mental health issues and PTSD as well as anxiety they should be allowed to be able to be students and not be afraid not be looking for an

[00:24:00]
from their school our schools making some strides we recently have our cameras working on campus as well as pointed off campus to be able to keep us safe but I'm in a place where I have students I'm sorry staff that come by to see me on a regular basis and they're coming in and they're not feeling safe I'm sorry I have to stop you please wrap up yes they are putting on Facebook they are like wearing high heels in the sand on the surface they're looking like they're calm and everything like that's okay but they're thinking we need your help to be on Solid Ground again thank you our next speaker is Roman de Leon

[00:25:00]
you have one minute hello my name is Roman DeLeon I'm a student at West Mesa High recently we've had a shooting in front of the school as well as a threat as of yesterday I was one of these students that spoke to the administration however I feel like as though our Administration didn't respond in the way that I felt safe staying at school or an improvement that could be made is making the students feel hurt rather than saying we will look into it or we can't do anything because it is not confirmed as of right now I don't feel safe going to school or going or one of my friends and family members don't feel safe letting me going to school because of these reasons that were unexplained that didn't give us these Necessities to allow us to feel safe and not those being provided

[00:26:00]
it just doesn't feel like the administration really cares for the students or the staff I hear students and staff being afraid that someone's going to shoot up the school or they're hearing rumors and that we can't attend school because of these how am I supposed to be having this normal high school experience being nervous about speaking or being bad at math when all I remember from school is the shootings and threats and I would hope that the board would think about implementing a solution that would teach teachers and administration as human beings and to understand students and other Administration underneath them as an emotional state and rather than this is just a rumor thank you sir her next speaker is Theresa Elgin

[00:27:00]
give 1 minute tonight good evening bored I just wanted to start out by saying my name is Teresa again I do support APS policies in place of supporting lgbtqia plus Community but that's not what I'm here to speak about we formed the action now group at West Mesa because we were having so many campus safety concerns and I understand that maybe not be clearly visible as we come and speak at these board meetings we've really been encouraging people to kind of come and speak to their own truth right but actually pretty comprehensive agendas weekly and we make these meetings available to staff and students in a very public place in a very transparent way in a way where we are trying to get as much students involved in trying to come to a solution that's good for

[00:28:00]
students staff and community members we have been in the process of developing a survey we were ready to release that survey this past week when an outside consultant was brought in in order to talk to our staff members and their different reactions to that throughout the staff but I can't speak on their behalf conversations do take time to have with our staff members and we've been going about this in a very researched and thoughtful way in the hope that we're going to be able to come to a solution as teaching professionals together so please just wrap up quickly and one step I'm just going to the last little reminder there was a student that was shot directly off campus last week Monday and we're working towards a solution together as a community thank you thank you for next speaker is Carissa Gonzalez

[00:29:00]
this is all she have one minute is Chris Gonzalez I felt that I need to stand here again and hopes that the board will hear this knowledge that are still occurring at our school campuses for instance high school as you've heard earlier we just had another incident right off campus right across the street another student that was shot thankfully she is fine or our student family which is getting old and falling on deaf ears we've been waiting meeting weekly and now we're currently working with her you know family members of West Mesa Community members but some of us from these board meetings to share these concerns of guns on campuses and other weapons and you know threats of harm and these issues have really heightened the fear

[00:30:00]
amongst our students and our staff so I'm not sure how much of a wake-up call that we need to do as APS right the ones that have been proactive on these issues in the past months you know we haven't seen a lot of progress as much as we would like to see I just have a few questions how are the board members addressing these issues how they being inclusive on these important discussions plans Solutions and reference to the issues that were brought to the school board and do you know how our students are feeling at this point with these concerns where's the accountability my accountability is being here is Gonzalez I have to stop you I'm sorry you've done over here in the evening Australia read apologize I went right past your name my mistake you have one minute when she begins speaking all right

[00:31:00]
in reference to the gender dysphoria curriculum New Mexico State 361 criminal offenses of child abuse and abandonment some definitions here from the statute abandonment of a child consists of the parent guardian or custodian of a child intentionally leaving or abandoning the child under circumstances whereby the child May or does suffer neglect including bodily harm a child means a person who is less than 18 years of age APS is data that the child is under the age of 14 this curriculum is brought out neglect means that a child is without proper parental or custodian care for the child's well-being because of the Guardian negligently refers to criminal negligence which means that a person should have known of the dangers involved and acted with the Reckless disregard for the safety of your health of the child abuse is disregarded the medical data that only danger and harm has come from the children who are pursued treatments for gender both short and long

[00:32:00]
APS says intentionally endangered parents children attending their schools APS is violated civil and criminal statutes so I wouldn't call it successful thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Muriel Leon lazcano you have one minute you have one minute hello and I have come here to talk about my and many others worries on gun violence on campus last week and just yesterday there was talk about a gun shooting on campus but it was investigated and it was discovered to be a hoax but many other times it has not been this past year and last year as well we have gone into lockdown several times I don't feel safe my friends don't feel safe my teachers and staff don't feel safe I don't want to feel unsafe on campus anymore I hope that in me talking to you you will realize the gravity of gun violence in

[00:33:00]
and around the campus I wish you have a safer school and currently the school is working on a Saturday to gather these opinions on how to do it through the action now group I hope you will become a part of it as well and I will take the end to take the actual steps necessary to make the change into impact the safety in our classrooms thank you have a good evening thank you our next speaker is Donna Fletcher and she is on Zoom she's doing now Don are you there yes I am thank you sorry I was born in Dallas graduated from Del Norte

[00:34:00]
early childhood education center for 29 years in Northwest Albuquerque and I'm astounded that APS is considering renovating some of their low performing schools and low enrollment Elementary School to early childhood education education centers APS needs to focus on improving student outcomes for children K through 12 I'm very pleased that the aps board and superintendent Elder in Apso have developed next steps on student outcomes Focus governments I think the goals and the guard rails are great they are definitely going in the right direction to improve student outcomes for K through 12 APS families in the entire Community need to put all of our efforts into these next steps it is so important after

[00:35:00]
years as an early childhood educator in the private sector it is disheartening to keep hearing that we are 49 50th in the nation regarding literacy math it seems like everything APS and our tax dollars need to be used to better student outcomes for children K through 12 and we need to fix this before we even consider teaching and providing education for children 3 and 4 year olds and the safety issue is just unbelievable thank you thank you ma'am or next speaker is Laura Vickers give one minute man thank you so I just want to let you know because I don't think

[00:36:00]
it's been very clear about what we want the first thing we want is a social worker we do not want these social worker taken from another school that needs it like real grand that school needs their social worker okay second thing you want at least three more security guards or csa's and my suggestion here is that you mark it this position like all the other businesses out there in Albuquerque that show hey we need these people I personally look for the positions online they're buried you have to really get in there oh you have to sign up you have to do this you have to do that okay you know can we make this public that's pretty simple thing to ask for the other the third thing that we would like is to be trusted as professionals to resolve our own issues that school

[00:37:00]
without bringing in outside sources that have no idea of what's going on in our school so I'm sorry I have to stop you you've been over a minute please wrap up one quick sentence please consider that and by the way my daughter is just fine I think adult Behavior probably starts at the top and then goes down like that thank you man our next speaker is Gabrielle wheeler you have one minute I've been coming here for the last four weeks my name is Gabrielle wheeler for almost 12 years now I hold an event every year for breaking 50 because I'm an advocate for for New Mexico come to come out of ranking last and my area of expertise that I've dedicated my life

[00:38:00]
mini mini sleepless nights through covid staying open through covid educating kids that will APS was closed and now I'm hearing that that APS wants to convert their buildings into Early Child Care Centers you are not experts in the 0 to 5:00 and what I've heard every week is that these children are afraid to go to school images of Sandy Hook come to my mind these children don't feel safe they don't have enough security guards and now APS is saying that they want to take over three and four year old we are Private Industry we provide home like nurturing environments that is a safe environment for these young children if we want to fix what's happening in New Mexico you have to fix the foundation you cannot take the 02583 that are specially trained

[00:39:00]
in early child care I just thought of something funny to say that you know it's like asking Chick-fil-A to start making hamburgers there's no comparison for the Early Child Care industry for your time thank you ma'am or next speaker is on Zoom it's Casey Peterson Road surprise surprise and tell her about the secret curriculum but if you want to know about the secret curriculum we have more undercover investigations and go to Freedom families united.com and we have three up in the Albuquerque Public School Systems and we've been reached out to for other investigation quite an overwhelming

[00:40:00]
and also working on something right now should be out here in the next day or so that is specifically regarding the school boards and some of the school board trains you guys have been attending so it's no wonder why everything's gotten so extreme these trainings I've been listening to all day absolutely nuts so we're adding that up right now that'll be up at Freedom fams united.com and anybody can reach out to us at reclaim the kids at protonmail.com if they want to go undercover or share a story or anything else if they want to help to reclaim the kids that's reclaim the kids at protonmail.com thanks thank you sir our next speaker is Michaela Peterson you there can you hear me can you have one minute once you begin speaking okay thank you a child's gender

[00:41:00]
identity is there a mental health so School staff like Casey said they are coming forward talking about the unethical Behavior being asked of them to hide Children's Mental Health from their parents depression and self-harm self-harming children are being overlooked and hidden from their parents because of these policies this is not a political issue you know you are the biggest school district in New Mexico you could be the leaders on this issue and say so many lgbtq and vulnerable kids the medical and pharmaceutical industry is making tons of money on each of these youths and they are LED into this affirmative model of gender care and as we as children's protectors leaders and Educators you know we should be asking a lot more questions in their defense when did the schools gain the power to determine which parents are fit to raise their children is every teacher administrator counselor social workers staff superintendent and School Board member who backs this policy or says nothing are you ready for the legal

[00:42:00]
ramifications of knowing a child had an identity crisis and mental health issues vulnerabilities and kept it from their parents and what if they do God forbid harm themselves you will be held responsible for that harm it should be criminal to keep a child's mental well-being from their parents is Peterson I'm sorry I stop you please wrap up in one quick sentence I know you guys work really hard and I just hope that you will look into this issue further it should not be a political issue it is about saving these vulnerable use thank you thank you and board members that concludes public forum thank you I want to thank everyone for speaking tonight and as we stayed in the in the you know we describe where we're going and the procedural directive we go right into our meeting so I just want to thank everyone again for being here tonight also wanted to make an announcement to the board I meant to do this at the beginning superintendent Elder got held up in a meeting with the

[00:43:00]
strategic planning group all the Advisory Group he did text me that he might be running late it seems like the meeting is going a little bit longer that was the only night they could host this meeting and it's with the community so that's where he's at tonight so I just wanted to let you all know that all right so our next item for approval is the consent calendar and this is consideration for approval of the March 15th 2023 Board of Education meeting items do I have a motion for this place I need to approve the consent calendar items for March 15th 2023 all second this is Danielle thank you have a roll call please yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay the next item is

[00:44:00]
student outcomes Focus governance and I'm just going to have just a have a couple of notes Here on the next steps on where we are on our student outcomes Focus governance first I just want to congratulate our my fellow board members and superintendent and the administration we finalized to our four goals and our guard Wales we've got them these beautiful posters I want to thank the administration and the communications team for helping to get these up these will stay up in the room plus they also gave us these really nice colorful pieces that we have on the Dias will help us as we're going these will stay with us on the desk so that we can kind of remember that we're going to have to commit them to Memory but was a good piece for us to have for tonight at the last meeting we adopted an implementation calendar outlining the work ahead and as much as we have accomplished by listening to our community and setting student outcome Focus goals and guardrails this is a long process and we have only just begun

[00:45:00]
so we've done some really good work there's no doubt but there's definitely a whole lot more to come so among our next steps is adopting a monitoring calendar that the administration is now working on it was superintendent Elder will talk more about that at our next meeting obviously it's not here tonight we're going to be communicating with the public we've got some other folks communicating with the public and sharing our goals and guard rails that are work created with their input and helping them to better understand our focus on student outcomes I do want to mention to the board I did have an opportunity Channel 7 has been really generous they they did interview me yesterday to just ask on an update on where we are and I really appreciate the media taking the time to to Really follow along with this and they've made a commitment to want to fall along with us and putting out some more media spots for us so that we can especially if we're going to be hosting events and we need to get parents on to those events we're

[00:46:00]
what's the receiving board member training on effective progress monitoring so that's going to be coming up for us as well I know that our wonderful coach Ashley is going to be working with us we're going to be practicing monitoring a specific goal that's going to be coming up later this summer as we get first we got to get through this legislative session there's some things that we're working on and we've got budget but that is already scheduled and I know if we saw the the implementation timeline that Ashley had sent to us you can see that we're going to start on that the first part is just a practice so that we as board members can also get into the the group of asking the right questions and sort of helping us to move through this process we're going to be begin policy diet to ensure policy is aligned with the goals guard rails and board work and we're going to be revising our board operating procedures to align with the goals and guardrails including the boards conflict of interest policy in our own guard rails after Consulting with Ashley I would like to

[00:47:00]
April 3rd policy committee meeting in which we were going to discuss conflict of interest code of conduct and Board review procedural directives Ashley explained that are approved timeline calls for an ad hoc committee to work through the details of our board operating procedures and that ad hoc committee should comprise just a couple of board members who would work with her and then make recommendations for the board so that we would consider those and then discuss those together and I'm kind of like a surprise announcement but I would like to appoint board members Dominguez and Jackson to serve on that at home committee and the reason I like to do that is because both board members Dominguez and Jackson have our part of the somg cohort that is going on in receiving ongoing coaching on that policy chair Gonzalez is not able to attend the April policy meeting so that was another reason that we were also looking at that and the only other item that we had considered

[00:48:00]
shooting on the agenda for the policy committee was an updated conflict of interest form that was more appropriate for board members and so we handled I believe that that was drafted there was a new conflict of interest form that was given to everyone tonight I think it was on our diet so if you can take a look at that and sign that and get that over to Johanna King that would be great I've also asked Ashley to be available if any of you have any questions she's actually are you I think she's listening to us tonight too so if you have any questions about our next steps for the board and the district to we can discuss that further so I'll open it up for questions but yeah can we go back I guess I'm confused why it's not like three people so like why the policy chair wouldn't be included in that and what it what is it so all it what it is

[00:49:00]
is and we did this before because I know we had board member Peterson and Gonzalez at the beginning working together as an ad hoc and they presented some policy work for us I think it was all of our board procedures that were were done so it was with two members this is just our we had talked about needing to come up with our board operating procedures so that would be our code of conduct how we go into schools sort of looking at all of those things that we talked about that we need to do that would be in alignment with sosg and Ashley is going to coach the two folks that are going to pull that together and and really quite frankly when we were thinking about this I thought about you and board member Dominguez because you two are continuing to be part of that sosg cohort and I thought it would be a good way for you all to get some coaching with your your team members that you're doing you're working with and it was close to that so I thought it would

[00:50:00]
be a good a good idea for the two of you to to pull that together doesn't mean that none of us have any input into it but it's an opportunity for you to is to board members pull it and then we'll come together and we'll consider it as a group so that was my thinking on that so bored operating procedures and like within just like working on it in a month because you mentioned how long is this process expected to it shouldn't I don't know Ashley can you come on cuz I'm not quite sure how long it will take but it will be with the two of you sort of looking and it's it's very it's not looking at a big piece it's just really narrowly looking at our operating procedures for us are sort of around those things that we talked about code of conduct how we go into schools our communication Ashley is there anything else that I'm missing in that hi

[00:51:00]
play good afternoon or evening bored and president Montoya quarterback so you're bored operating procedures are generally just the the guidelines you have around how you're bored interacts with each other with the community and with the district and you probably have already have these and and one shape or form generally board operating policies and it sounds like you have recently done or review of them so it shouldn't take a very long time to actually do and generally the process is about three months but if you've recently gone through the review process of the of the procedures that you have in place it takes maybe a month maybe 2 months and part of the reason that it does take so it does take a little bit longer is because one of the things that your committee will be doing is actually going out

[00:52:00]
visiting one-on-one with each individual board member to get their Vision their their Direction on how these procedures should be should be directed go ahead OK

[00:53:00]
I have nothing to do with anything else other than you were going to be here for the next policy meeting anyway and we didn't have a really heavy agenda so it made sense to just go ahead and cancel that and we'll reschedule when you're back cuz we know you're going to be back and we'll do that I am not I mean I'm working with my coach and I was working with Ashley and you know after some conversation you know looking at it it was like it's also kind of like having fresh eyes and so it's having two different sets of board members that would be looking at it too so you've done a tremendous you and Barbara both did a tremendous amount of work on that so it's sort of like just having two different board members who can put a different set of eyes on it so it's in no way of like leaving anybody out or dismissing anything else but it's really just sort of broadening that perspective so that we could just make sure we have different perspectives and it was a I saw it as an opportunity for board member Jackson

[00:54:00]
Dominguez because I know that they're both really invested in that cohort to in the work that they're doing their because I think they could bring some learning some perspective that's also coming from the cohort so that was my only perspective on that on why I was wanting to just have those two board members and as Ashley said they will be visiting with each of us anyway coming and we're all going to be coming back and so we can look at it that way I have utmost confidence to that both of them would indeed like come back to you board member Gonzalez around you know maybe a Hawaii or something or getting some like feedback on some things if they needed to if they're working on it but it's really just to change perspective and it was just to have a broader perspective and it's going to be very focused it's very focused right and it is reviewing what we already have in place which was a lot of work was done into that but it's just an opportunity for us to go back and just read that and review it but we're working with it when the eyes of sosg and again I just

[00:55:00]
believe that board member Dominguez and and Jackson having spent you know they're spending in a lot of time with the s o f t cohort so I thought it would be a good idea I appreciate this because in light of the cohort and the work that we're doing currently it gives me at least a very specific homework assignment as it relates to the readings that were doing collectively and it gives us some one-on-one time with Ashley and and give me some time with the board member Jackson I mean we don't really we don't really get to talk to one another and so I think it's a great idea to start

[00:56:00]
putting up channels of communication on topics that will be productive and I jump in so I'm hearing what's being said but I also feel like we're now duplicating the work that what was already done cuz it sounds like we just went through this entire process and we all had input as to what are operating procedures would look like and now I feel like we're just we're repeating the same cycle of what was done and it just doesn't seem like good use of our time and I could see if we had done this at this was something we looked at years ago but we just went through this process and it just does not seem wise to be duplicating our efforts when we it was something we just discussed and I think Ashley you wanted to I could see you wanting to to weigh in on that on the reason why we do it under the somg so the

[00:57:00]
it's a part of students can focus governance is getting the board to align your activities with board work so prior I'm not sure when you did the work but I'm assuming that it was before you entered into an engagement with cancel the great City schools and and started implementing students focused governments and that's really the lens that this is going through so having having done the work to my recently is is actually a really good thing because that means that there's it's likely that most of the stuff that you're going to the committee will bring forward is is what is already there but it will just be the committee will be tasked with tailoring the work to what is what is what is a line with governance getting the board to focus on board work so that the rest of the district

[00:58:00]
and then align their behaviors their adult behaviors with a student outcomes Focus one of the other questions I think I think that answer one of the other things I wanted to clarify so you you all adopted the implementation time line at the last the last meeting or the meeting before and this was this was one of the very first things that was on the implementation timeline as a priority for doing this work so if the board no longer feels that this is a priority then it'll be necessary for you to vote to change the implementation so and so so bored member I appreciate what you're saying I don't think it's going to be a duplication of effort as much as it is a quick review just to make sure that we're in alignment and that's

[00:59:00]
and we're probably going to get a great grade on this one I mean I think it's just mostly just seeing places where maybe there is a gap and there is maybe something that we need to to tweak a bit but it's probably not going to be a lot so I'm anticipating that for both board members Dominguez and and Jackson is that one is it helps them with their sosg cohort work to that they're doing because it gives them a homework assignment that they they can work and they can get some coaching on and they can work on that as well and and I think it'll just be very a for us on in terms of the work that we have already done at that is already let us through is just really affecting that and just if there are places that we need to you know to to tweak some things that it'll probably be mine or but it's not I don't see it is very repetitive but it's kind of part of our self evaluation piece do and just making sure that line I have heard us all in the diet is about

[01:00:00]
code of conduct and those kinds of pieces and so there is a need for us to just sort of strengthen that and so it's an opportunity for us to do that go ahead so yeah I agree I think that this this is a good ad-hoc committee I am happy to sit I think that having word operating procedures you know looked at refined is definitely something we need to do the only addition and change that I would make to it and can't wait to work with Josefina girl we're going to do it the change I would meet is because we have a committee structure and we have a committee chair and this is part of the diet this is part of the refining this is part of the procedure I would request that the addition to this ad hoc committee is the policy chair to

[01:01:00]
to add to whatever work has already been done and refined so let me just interject here I understand because I was chair of the capital outlay committee at Capital outlay and Technology property committee it doesn't feel good or at the moment to to be displayed but you know the whole time I kept telling myself there's there is a higher purpose here and oftentimes I have to tell myself trust the process and and so I guess I'm throwing that out I'm looking forward to to revisiting what's been done already

[01:02:00]
because I I feel a little disconnected from that through no error from anybody else but I'm looking forward to having Ashley's guidance on on the questions that that were left lingering so I see it as a good sosg training process but just to respond to member Jackson's of displacement I think it's about acknowledging expertise so one yes I have spent my entire career in education policy working with school boards and school districts around these issues so to bring certain level of expertise to the table around these decisions and not anticipating this I already reached out to school board members across the country and to my school board policy coach to say hey which other districts are doing

[01:03:00]
Sophie and who have also updated your procedural directives or administrative directives whatever they're called in other districts and your policies and what have you learned from the process and what are some good policies and how are you guys develop policies so I started that work already I'm happy to hand it over to member Jackson but they are the relationships and the expert and member Dominguez the they are the relationships and the expertise and the experience that I do bring to the table we each come with their own expertise in their own background every single piece of that experience that we bring to the table is valuable and so I think there's no danger that we won't benefit from board member Gonzalez's work and experience it's played a

[01:04:00]
you're rolling where we are right now I do think that there is a tendency to sideline certain views and I think that having board member Jackson board member Dominguez look at this with fresh eyes will bring more to it not exclude the expertise that board member Gonzalez has it is playing a major role in the direction of the sport but I do think that in this case it would help balance and equalize the expertise and experience of two people that haven't played such as you know this has nothing to do about individuals or anything like this one of the things that I've come to realize after being on the board for five years is that sometimes having opportunities to demonstrate our leadership or build our leadership and our expertise is really crucial because

[01:05:00]
does we're all going to be well you all especially those that will remain are going to hopefully we have you know various roles and developing rules and so I think it's really important and it's a great opportunity to sort of Bounce in and out of different areas so that you can develop that level of expertise and those relationships and that collaboration as well so I I really I just I also want to say board member Gonzalez has nothing to do about your expertise we totally evaluate your your expertise is the policy expert is really helpful the intention here was just really to just look at the policies that we have right now with certain helping to develop our board members that have interest in those areas as well too so that they can also develop some expertise and some Partnerships and and Leadership roles and those pieces as well so that was that was totally just my intention on that in terms of of setting that

[01:06:00]
no matter what and as a policy chair we're going to rely on your expertise to make sure that as we're looking at it that it's looked at from the lens of your expertise I just have a quick question Ashley if you could just let me know what if there would be any harm to having a third person on there I mean it's just to the the number that's usually used whenever any other district is going through this so generally for an ad hoc committee you just don't you want it to not be you want it to be fewer than a quorum of the word so the number the number of I have agnostic when it comes to how many people or who are in any of this discussion but generally as a rule of thumb it is a good idea to spread the spread out leadership

[01:07:00]
is on your bored almost a checks and balances and as many of you have mentioned new eyes and and having giving the opportunity to let other people look at the decisions before you and as president before your code of mentioned this is actually something that will so the items that end up in your policy manual will will go that our policies will go back through the policy committee I assumed as part of your traditional structure however this is not necessarily a policy conversation this is more of a conversation about boards and agreements and how you interact with each other how you interact with the team so there's a whole other section of the student of the implementation timeline that has to do with redoing your committee diet and I would expect that

[01:08:00]
that would be a different group of individuals for that ad hoc committee and the policy diet I would actually expect that to go through the policy committee because those are very specific policy things so that's that's my overall feedback as far as the decision-making process is gone thank you I mean I know we just all have our strengths and I just want to make sure that everybody does know that and we all have an equal saying whatever is going on so and I am I I just trust that that is exactly what's going to happen whether it's two or three people that they will make sure and talk to all of us so thanks Ashley that was the intention any other comments or feedback I do have questions about other parts of your report sure if we're ready to move there go ahead

[01:09:00]
so the first thing that you mentioned is the next step is that we're adopting a monitoring calendar that's being prepared by the district what's the time frame for that so I know that Ashley sent me today I've got a calendar that is it goes like from here all the way to like January and there's the monitoring pieces are in there and it's going to be what we're going to monitor what's going to be the first goal we're going to monitor I understand what we're monitoring what's the time frame for when we will see the monitoring calendar and start the process so so I got them I got the calendar today just before this meeting so that I could look at it and I can I'll get back with Ashley didn't have enough time to finalize that today so I would assume by the next board meeting will have that calendar completed unless Ashley am I going to have it ready go ahead know so what so the monitoring calendar is actually

[01:10:00]
something that the superintendent is working on with his team and that will be a conversation so that'll be a question for him and generally It generally takes about a month or a month or so after you have finalized your goals and guardrails it really just depends on how much time it takes them to identify when different when the different interim goals and interim guardrails will be measured and then how long it will take to prepare the reports after their measured so that that's it's really that just the the staff looking at the time line and figuring out how everything gets laid out over the span of the app so when we met earlier last week we talked about what goals we would start with first and I know that the superintendent talked about potentially starting with Cole

[01:11:00]
on that we would practice with Goal number 3 so that we would start there first but a lot of the goals that we have so once two and four are dependent on us having data so we have to get the data in there so that we can set the monitoring schedule for those so that's one of the things that we have to we have to get ready and I'm sorry I misunderstood your question because I did get this implementation calendar from Ashley today so I'm like seeing calendars everywhere and we did have that conversation so the superintendent right now is superintendent I don't want to put words in your mouth but we started with that particular piece first thinking that that would be the first one we would go for and then he's going to put the calendar together on the others based on when we get data so that we could we could start with some good we'd have to we'd have to start with some data yes

[01:12:00]
talked about this last week for the first time some of the goals we don't have the data for but we do have our number three so I think we could start with number three I just haven't worked out quite the details with Dr Bowman and his team regarding exactly when we could start but I believe when I spoke with Miss pause the goal was to begin at work sometime in early June so in terms of when the district calendar we would be able to be integrated with the implementation calendar I'm just trying to get a sense of when we're going to see things because a lot of the update was this stuff is coming so just wanted to get a better sense of like well when so again for the monitoring some of the data has to actually happen so we're going into April and we'll start taking the most of them right so then we have to wait for the results one and two were sort of on I don't think there's a lot I can do we do have the possibility of sharing

[01:13:00]
name some of our interim data and we talked about maybe that might be best what Miss pause it indicated was that we were to begin to provide data to you so that we could work with the board learning in terms of what kind of questions are good questions to be asked and Paris in terms of how we will be responding to the type of questions you're going to be asking of us and that was supposed to be the work sometime between late May or early June through September and then September will start getting into the interim goals more specifically because we'll have broken down the data by then and then we have to develop the calendar for this month is go one perhaps for a grade level this next month is goal to wraps for grade level because we're not going to all of it every time and that's what the calendar has to be developed so what I was under the impression that I was produced with something for early

[01:14:00]
calendar beginning next school year if I may there is so I think I think there is a misunderstanding about what the what the monitoring calendar is which is that is my fault I should I should have made that more clear so what I will do is I will prepare I'll prepare an email and send it to the entire board that clarifies what the monitoring calendar is what the role is that it plays and what you should expect for it but essentially it should be it is a it is a calendar that stands for the entire length of your of your the entire cycle of your goals that and it details when the board will monitor which goals which interim goals interim guard rails and then at what time you will look at your overall performance for your summit of goals

[01:15:00]
and your the yearly performance of your guard rails so I will provide that clarification email and I'll still work with superintendent Elder and his team to make sure that they that they have Clarity on that as well okay you had another question on the communication I bet no it was so superintendent Elder said we could potentially start reporting on the interim goals answer my question of those because there was a lot of feedback that we provided in the first presentation on the interim goals and interim guidelines in the district was going to go back and make some edits and I just wanted to get a sense of that time for her and Ashley shaking her head no on that go ahead Ashley I'm sorry no so when you the interim goals and the interim guard rolls that you saw were the those are not things that the board has control over

[01:16:00]
change it and I made it I feel like it was very clear when you voted to adopt your guard rails that the guardrails you adopted were based on the interims that you saw and those interims were the superintendent's interpretation of the guard rails that you adopted so at this at this point what you saw is what you have if you have the intention of those changing its the boards roll to go back and change the actual guard rails to make them more specific around what your expectations are go ahead and just feels like a switch and I mean that we can go back and look at the video but in the conversation we have a lot of feedback period I get it that you're process is that we don't have control over their rooms but if we gave feedback that we didn't feel

[01:17:00]
we should be brought up to speed about them I remember Ashley warning Us in her very in a very subtle way are you ready are you are you ready to well you're right but I think at the end of that meeting what I remember is that we had given enough feedback during the discussion that the leadership team knew what we were asking so I left that meeting believing that we adopted the guard rails with the interims that they had presented with a lot of feedback in terms of how they'll be able to think about those as a reporting to us so I thought the

[01:18:00]
also be taking that in terms of like some of the inputs or some of the report out that they'll show us and how they got to the particular measurement that they had or the the thing that they proposed so cuz I know that when I was getting coached as we were doing this and I kept saying are we comfortable because what I understand is that as we adopt these guardrails we're also adopting these interims and so it doesn't mean that the district doesn't take into account some of our thoughts around the ways that they could look at those interims or the kind of inputs or the kind of data that they're going to use to to support where they are but I mean all I'll say is I think we just need to give ourselves we need to give ourselves a chance to try this and do this it may not be perfect and may not be exactly what I hear from the others on the cohort is that it's not going to be perfect this first round but

[01:19:00]
give it a whirl let's give it we are very invested in the goals in the guardrails that we have and I think I think we're going to it's going to be okay I mean I think we just need to we need to trust the process and we just need to keep moving forward where we are because it's really important to what what I hear from the from the board is it was really important on our guard rails in terms of what we had and what we knew that we wanted to to protect for the community and I think when we get our first reports out and we see it will be able to see how we're doing against those guardrails and terms of the way that they were they were written and let's see how how well the district comes back to us and terms of those things on how we protected it with the feedback that we also gave them I mean it was a great conversation so I don't think it Gets Lost in Translation but I think it will become part of the richness of How It's reported back to us superintendent

[01:20:00]
so as far as the bait and switch I don't think that's really fair because it wasn't us that was told that this is how it had to be with that said I thought you guys gave us good feedback and so when we've been meeting we're talking about and we may come back to you and say you know what we really do have to move this interim feedback so I understand that I miss pause is very clear with me know know when they accepted they accepted and you don't have to but we got good feedback and so we're working on it and we may very well come back to you before June and say here are some changes we'd like to propose and you have to accept is that is that but that wasn't because we were fully we walked out saying yeah we have to make these changes and then I was informed that know when you accepted dinner and guardrails you accepted for the guards except

[01:21:00]
I mean so I would just like to see if you said you're not ignoring the feedback that you were given then we still don't know if you're going to make any changes though to those schools and guardrails correct like we don't know and so it's hard when we just don't know what's going to happen and we don't have the finalized version really and I know that it is has really nothing to do with us but you are saying that our feedback was good so yeah and I agree with that like I said there's been moments in this process that I've struggled with the process and and this is one of them I understand that I'm not technically required to make the adjustments I think we may be interested in making some of those adjustments and we would bring those to you so I guess my point around this isn't the Bible is there's no technical requirement of

[01:22:00]
anything so if when you asked did we feel comfortable with the guardrails I shook my head and said no and then you said you were voting just on the guardrails not on the interim so I said okay I will motion for us to approve the guardrails I was I felt like I was pretty clear in that meeting that I was not okay with the interims I think lots of folks gave feedback superintendent has acknowledged that and so what is the harm to seeing the revisions that are being made particularly for some of those goals and guardrails where there was a fair amount of conversation around what was the intent of the goal or guard rail versus what was interpreted I think there was a lot of feedback on the equity perspective in particular in terms of how you might measure disparities across the district by student group or zone or whatever there was another one which I'm not remembering right now but I see no reason why like we don't share information I guess is the is the

[01:23:00]
when do we see the monitoring calendar how do we know where we're going just making sure that there's more transparency both in terms of what are our responsibilities as board members collectively as a board and what's our responsibility in terms of holding the district accountability accountable for their function if I don't know what you are doing or not doing it's hard to hold you accountable the district for your work on this but I think it's just asking for more communication more transparency and we're getting there I just want to say because we just met literally when did we meet superintendent with Ashley I can't even remember the date because we just had our was it was it was last week so we're getting there we're trying to pull all of that together so that we can bring it to the board this was literally an update of what our next steps are our next

[01:24:00]
what is to adopt a monitoring calendar which were pulling together so that we can bring it to the board so we can have transparency my my thought is is just keeping you guys updated on the conversations that we're having of how we're pulling ourselves together so that we can bring this you know we can bring this all to light so that we're all on the same page there is no page really and I think that's the most important part there isn't like a page that you will have seen or we haven't talked about it's really about processes that we're working on so that we can bring it to you all we can bring a timeline we can bring all of those pieces and I appreciate you holding us like well when is that going to happen and how soon is that going to happen those are the things that we're working on and you just heard Ashley she's coaching us it was literally just last week that we spoke so we're going to be bringing that and it's going to be it will be much more coherent in terms of where we are I don't know what else I want to say on that I mean except that you know

[01:25:00]
then the newness we just passed these at the last meeting so gave him a lot of feedback I appreciate the superintendent's thoughts that he took the feedback and so if if you're going to be bringing back an adjustment on an interim because you took the feedback that's great and then we'll look at that but I'm also aware that under the sosg approach we don't approve the interims they have to determine how is the best way for them to measure themselves around the goals in the guard rails that we set so they're going to determine what's the best way for them and we gave them and we gave feedback in terms of what you know what we thought would be a good some good suggestions on that and let's see how it comes to us on that and we'll see how it goes and then our job is holding them accountable to what they said they wanted to do and how they were going to do it and that holds us accountable to monitor each of the schools and those

[01:26:00]
so I just have a quick question and maybe this goes to maybe it goes to Ashley so we're going to be adopting a monitoring calendar soon right but we're going to adopt this monitoring calendar and we may not even have the finalized version of the interim goals or I mean that's a question to you Ashley I mean is that how we do it so the monitoring account you really need to have the insurance goals before you adopt the monitoring calendar cuz you have to know if the if the interim measures that you're looking at are going to change then that may change up when you're able to monitor them they may be snapshots that are taking it at different points throughout the year one maybe in December 1st it really just depends on what it is that you're

[01:27:00]
if it's an assessment or a survey or whatever it really depends on what the interim is going to be so if you don't know what the interims are you don't you can't have a monitoring calendar but again the guardrails that you adopted are the individual comments and this is true for any vote that you take as a board individual comments are individual Comics individual board members do not have authority to send directions to the to the district the action that you take as a body corporate the action that you take is a board is what sends the direction to the district and so when you vote to approve something you were saying to the district here is here is the direction that we are giving you so all of those individual comments only mean as much if you

[01:28:00]
actually vote in a way that is consistent with them so I strongly urge the board to use this moment to reevaluate what your guard rails are and I heard the superintendent and hear him say that he that he liked the feedback that he would like to make changes but just understand that the direction that you have given him is clear and so any any changes or any any expectations that you have around what changes need to be made should be embedded with the priorities that you're setting through your goals and through your guard rails so Ashley had a quick question for you so on boards that are just starting this process because we're just starting this process and I'm assuming that there are boards that have probably bumbled through this first part I would think this is the hardest part is just getting started

[01:29:00]
and you know getting into the to the rhythm of it so how often and does it occur at that there is a shift I mean that you know and there's agreement but again I think it's a very collaborative process right where it's a it's a give and take we're collaboratively working on this and we're looking together we're learning together because it's all so a cqi process it's a continuous quality improvement process we can look and we can say you know that was a great goal on that was a great interim but you know what it's not really giving us the data the way that we thought it was going to give us and so we're going to have to come back and tweak it and that's what monitoring is for as well correct absolutely absolutely and the and in your sosg manuals one of the items that that you self evaluate is is the statement that is

[01:30:00]
the statement true that the board has not changed their goals or guardrails more than once per year and that's the that's what we're trying to accomplish here it could be so if you're going to make changes that you should do it now before the superintendent develops his strategic plan around the language that you have that you have adopted and that's where that's where the rubber hits the road in this conversation you've adopted you have set your priorities and said this these are the things that we expect to be the highest priorities for how the district is managed how resources are allocated so on and so forth so at the point where you change those priorities then that is going to open up the entire strategy to be changed as well and I have a feeling that that is not the direction that this poor wants to go correct so so

[01:31:00]
superintendent so I guess you know cuz s o f g is going to be a conversation that's going to be it every board meeting from now on so this is this is us doing our work and this is us thinking through this process and so if at the next I don't know I don't want to put the board I don't want to put superintendent on the line but I had a meeting soon that share with us if you're going to change those interims then we'd have to come back and we'd have to review those and then we'd say but we've adopted these guard rails right so we'd have to amend this somehow that we could do that as part of I guess is the board meeting we'd have to put it on there and is it a new action you know new discussion action so so there isn't any reason why we we couldn't do that I mean I agree it's not a Bible it's not like setting we want to get this right we want to do this well so but at the same

[01:32:00]
what time I you know we're not going to be in a hamster wheel we just need to kind of start we need to we need to kind of be clear so that they can they can do their work so superintendent not to put you on the spot but if you all have been thinking about that and you have thought about changing some do you have an idea of when we could have those communicated to us I will have it definitely done so that you have time then to look at the monitoring calendar we have assessments beginning in a couple weeks that's going to take up a lot of time and energy but it's not we started talking today after that meeting so there was a good feedback we you know Dr Bowman and I we spent some time really kind of knocking these are some good adjustments I don't think it's going to have any impact on your guard rails because I don't think it is suggestions of changing your guard rail so I would think we will have this out well before

[01:33:00]
any monitoring calendar was brought to you and again I understand kind of in my head that the monitoring calendar Melanie needs to be ready by the beginning of June so I think you can stay over the next 2 months we can definitely get that to you right back know is that feel comfortable with the board go ahead you know my mom if I understand correctly if I understood Ashley correctly the Strategic plan is that correct yes and so I'd say the guardrails are the biggest issue for us in the room to talk to you about what we see happening in the district so I think we'll be all right yeah so you

[01:34:00]
you can move forward I don't think you guys made any suggestions that were so heavy that they really impact the work we're planning on doing the idea of breaking down you know disaggregating the data by zone or by a student group is not an impact on how we do the work it simply is just a different way of looking at what day do we collect any other comments sorry I'm trying to find the interim president okay I mean I think we can I mean

[01:35:00]
still sounds like we can still get there I like The Confidence from the superintendent that it's not going to impact our goals that are guardrails and in that sense but it was good good information and and I just will say as I thought that the information that we gave so for example like the data sets by zones I just really felt like it would just give them ideas of how to present the the status of that particular goal of guardrail I didn't really think they had to change their interim in that but I mean that's I think we can get there and I think the things that we requested about more specificity was for me was just that it would come in the way that they would report it out I didn't see how it would change you know what we were looking at just sort of a broad broad interim so I thought it gave the gave them some really good ideas of how to like present that day or to present the information so if superintendent is feeling confident about you know

[01:36:00]
I'll pick it up again at our next conversation and will continue to proceed with where we are on on the work and going forward Ashley is there any other partying comments you want to make at this point we're good okay love your green she's got her Saint Patrick green on that's good okay so our next item up is a report on the goals guard rails and strategic plan as it aligns to student outcomes and this is from superintendent Elder well I think probably is not much I can add to the conversation that we just had other than we have been looking at at the interim and and the goals and his team are really working on some of the processes that will have to be put in place in hell we're going to do some of the data reporting probably more importantly I think right now is really some of the work we're doing around the Strategic plan I'm sorry I was late tonight but I was at the advisory committee

[01:37:00]
and it's a good thing I went because they had some really pointed feedback it was really productive and helpful and it was good that I heard it and I think it's important that we really as we engage with the community in this work that that I'm present and so I appreciate you allowing me to have that opportunity to be there and and just be a part of it I didn't speak much I couldn't help myself once I had to jump in but overall it was it was a good feedback and some of the people were having a hard time you know getting in on it because they were I think one of them was that is still in Santa Fe and so I was sending comments on chat and it was good to see if those comments were being picked up and included in the in the notes but we are in progress to continue complete the Strategic plan either by late April early May which is a deadline we had originally proposed and we're really getting along we're in to the work now of our initiatives

[01:38:00]
and trying to sort of align what resources we have and see what we can do in the in the coming years one of the things that the advisory committee had to be reminded of tonight I think it's important it's a 5-year plan and everybody's really excited to get started and and but one of the things that you start to look at the list of initiatives you begin to realize we can't do everything year one it just isn't possible there's too much and so it is going to be a step by step process I do appreciate a tuned because they keep reminding us of that too because I think if you guys have pointed out in the past eight years in traditionally sort of and as a result we've done a lot of things but maybe we haven't been great at anything so this process is reminding us it's going to take time to make a change in in the machine but it was a good productive meeting and I feel good about where we are

[01:39:00]
in terms of that and I appreciate the comments along the student outcome Focus governance in our role in that and what we have to bring back to continue the work as we work with you great any questions for superintendent go ahead it would help me is a is a grapple with all of this work to have more I'd appreciate some more substantive reports from what kinds of things you've heard from the committee you know it doesn't have to be ours we don't have to own it but I think that the more it helps give us a context of what you're hearing from the community with the thoughts are and how you are taking that and thinking about where we go with it with your knowledge base it would be very helpful

[01:40:00]
appreciate that I will have to think about how to do that because it's a you all selected a wide spectrum of of committee members which is great because we're getting different opinions shared so there was some discussion tonight for example around rigorous instruction and there was some concern about what does that look like would this what would the curriculum if I would that be canned curriculum and on the other side there was discussion about but it's good to have a concept of scope and sequence it's a good idea to have standards or being met so it was just nice balance of commentary that was being laid out that we can take into into our planet to hear that too because they've been doing a lot of focus groups one of the teachers they had a couple meetings with Native American students because that was a group we really thought we needed to get into

[01:41:00]
strong feedback and so all that sort of coming out and this advisory committee needed to hear that and sort of recognize that and and and and it's going to take a different perspective for some of them so it's it's a blending of ideas I try to take notes that maybe I can I don't want to some of it's done you know I mean these are people talking incompetence to other people so I don't want to go too far but I think in generalities I can speak to what we did so I'll try to do it more of that as we move forward as we meet with them I don't think I meet with them for another month any other questions I just have a question about the participation how would you rate the participation on the advisory committee has it been good tonight was light we didn't have the I wouldn't you

[01:42:00]
I'm talking to your advisory committee members if you encourage them to attend I think tonight is a lot of reasons people had a difficult time and I don't know if it's because of legislative sessions coming to an end or what but tonight was lighter than the previous meetings we still had a good number there just was lighter any other comments

[01:43:00]
the history behind you know Ells Hispanics Native American voices were fairly new to the conversation and we're going to take our claim so we are different thank you well and APS do I just add the refugee community and that too that makes us ultimately unique in the state it's just with the number of refugees that we also have to support as a district attorney boy we're getting close and we get to welcome our newest person Jessica Martinez is our policy list for so welcome Jessica welcome to the party doctor Escuela and TC rice

[01:44:00]
why couldn't I couldn't help myself members of the board superintendent Elder thank you very much for the warm welcome I'm especially grateful for the warm welcome that I received from the 4th Services Department of members of the legislative team and you all so thank you very much I'm a 22 year educator in Albuquerque Public Schools a product of APs myself I am for 9 more weeks the parent of an APS senior so the countdown is on but yeah I'm excited to get started and support of the work of the board and our District administration my first day on the job has been fantastic we spent the morning up in Santa Fe at Senate Ed with superintendent Elder for the confirmation of pet secretary Romero so it's been a great day I'm excited to get started welcome aboard the better president of the board to tell her we have

[01:45:00]
5 days to go the budget passed the Senate I think it was a Monday or Tuesday and the House of Representatives just this afternoon and accepted all of the sentiments which is a little controversial because it raised the spending by about a percent so now we await the governor's action it doesn't include a 6% salary increase and I think last time we came it was 5% they added an extra percentage and I didn't want to remind you that the Senate didn't include that averaging like so that was not removed and we talked about that to you the language in the requirement of House Bill 130 but it is on the governor's desk so that's the building increases instructional hours to 10001 140 so in your update there is some language Provisions that we wanted to call out to including that averaging language but one thing we

[01:46:00]
I want to update you on is we did hear some indication of future revenues today on oil and gas and so this year's revenue and it's been interesting cuz they usually do a revenue update several times during the session but we notice they did not do a second and so this year's Revenue just to give you an indication was based off of 85 active oil rigs there are 106 operating and you know the price of gas so we're going to see some record Revenue that prohibits schools to have professional development or school on on an election day this does not go into effect until 2024 so we will work on that next legislative session and we have discussed it with our calendar committee HB 126 the graduation requirement Bill and this is been stalled on the senate floor for about a week

[01:47:00]
we will be watching it over the next two and a half days to see if there's moving in the last days HB 127 which is minimum salaries for our educational assistance moving them to 25000 did pass the Senate unanimously unanimously and is waiting on the governor for Governor's action hb130 this is the increase of instructional hours to 1140 did pass the Senate so it's past the house and the Senate they did an amendment in the senate for professional development requirement for high school and middle school teachers to go to be 30 hours of professional work included in the 1140 the calendars that we are proposing as a district to accommodate the submit and HB 1999 is the increase of the school at risk Fine Arts and administrative salaries that passed the senate in his way to the governor's signature yay Madam president members of the board superintendent Elder so finally just a few more

[01:48:00]
what does sp3 which changes the family income index and we have several schools who receive those funds those changes did pass and is waiting for the Governor's signature along with the universal lunch program and so we are working with Chief Operating Officer Dr Blakey and the governor's office on a meeting around the world making and implementation of this Billings I know some of the governor's office reached out to several of you as well as we 131 which is the capital outlay offset bill that's been stuck on the house for sale on each side for a few days and we are hopeful we had some conversations today that that will get moving a surprise for perhaps Senate joint resolution one which is the Constitutional Amendment that would go to voters to decide to go back to the State Board of Education in 2024 that again is stalled in the house floor because they know that'll take about three hours so we're going to see if that gets hurt tonight or tomorrow

[01:49:00]
we've also included some information in your packet on the language of the budget we will be bringing you a list of capital outlay that is signed into law and then we need to do a process with you to recommend to you those those Appropriations that we want to accept again this is the part of your offset the district's offset of capital we did receive a record 13.4 million dollars in Appropriations for our schools this year and so some of our schools that are seeking significant funds that can carry over those funds to next year and use that with future Appropriations so that they're trying to get million dollar appropriation so we'll work on that continue to improve processes and we stand for questions for today any questions explain what is ended up in one 30

[01:50:00]
professional development time what's included what's not so the only change that was made was that 30 hours for middle and high school can be within the 11:40 where the elementary is 60 hours within the actual requirements of the language didn't change basically moving conferences out of the instructional hours and into professional development time that's the main and finding everything so basically because there's so much already in middle and high school professional development time is that why there's the difference between yes and even before we saw the amendment I had been working with the calendar committee and we had already met those requirements before the evening period

[01:51:00]
kids are absent a lot of it is because of family situations where the adult primary adult can't stay home and it impacts our kids attendance hugely not to mention just how infants do when family can stay home with them and it sets them off on a much better course so I was heartbroken with that one go ahead 1 3 1. 0

[01:52:00]
38 million yes but we got there because of the capital Appropriations that we received we have to pay that offset of Siri for Education thank you thank you thank you thank you and good thing for businesses with the family leave too many of them went out of business
