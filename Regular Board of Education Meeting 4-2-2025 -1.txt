[00:16:00]
Mexico open meetings act requires that our agenda specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when your name is called our online guess will stay in a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have set aside 45 minutes for public forum tonight we have 22 speakers so you will each have two minutes to speak let me know what time is up you will be asked to quickly wrap up if you feel unable to convey your message at aps.com in Edition

[00:17:00]
for those of you who are here tonight a representative from our service center is here to assist you and she's right back there so at this time Mr Gonzalez will you introduce our speakers thank you board member Jackson our first Speaker tonight is in person DiMera and ready followed by Ron Muir and Tony Watkins I have two minutes thank you my name is tomorrow 125 plus sexually explicit materials found in the aps library library

[00:18:00]
the presence of this content shows that you have whether through apathy and sympathy lack of vigilance or deliberate action broken that trust perhaps all while they're strong and statements of us being booked by nerd lgbtq anti-lgbtq we ask that you just let these materials please speak for themselves some will be reading out of the materials tonight so I encourage parents who are in the room with their children to have their children step out if you don't feel comfortable with your kiddos hearing these materials and if any of you do not feel comfortable with this material I asked you to ask yourself if I don't feel comfortable as an adult hearing this why should children hurt and I will make sure the markets okay our next speaker is Ron Muir

[00:19:00]
you have two minutes once you begin speaking sir period back in January you as a board decided to get rid of 9th grade health education well there's a sign right in front of us and we can see that really should be put back here until it don't Behavior changes what an 8th grader goes to 9th grade is one of the biggest changes in their life and one of the classes you got rid of is help them deal with those changes like suicide in drugs and sexuality and you talk about student outcomes you're all for students.com so I'm asking you why are you why do you say student

[00:20:00]
important why over here on your goals gold number for says that you know all those things they are taught in 9th grade health education and they do affect student outcomes the survey that you all decided was part of this decision to get rid of 9th grade health education one of the things on that survey that you didn't notice was it over 2000 parents wanted to keep 9th grade health education in 9th grade evidence that this is an important issue are you really really want to have to deal with suicide sexuality

[00:21:00]
9th grade health class will teach them how to handle that please take the time at the next school board meeting bring it up and go for a vote and listen to the parents listen to the students do the right thing thank you thank you sir thank you our next speaker is Tony Watkins you have two minutes once again I'm here to stand with New Mexico foundation for open government and the opposition to the New Media policy that only promised the board president to speak to the media constituents deserve to hear how the board members voted and why this is essential for basic accountability the rationale that would be confusing to parents in the media is patronizing and insulting to our intelligence it also smacks of control of information which is particularly problematic given the attacks on freedom of speech

[00:22:00]
going on now at the federal level secondly I urge the board to familiarize themselves with APS policy KB this policy was the outcome of a lengthy organization effort by families of Education to bring over 500 family and community members together to write a policy that spoke to our lived experiences the policy calls for cultivating Equitable and effective systems expanding communication utilizing the history and culture of our families and communities as a foundation for education and building relationships and capacity among all stakeholders regardless of their place in the organizational hierarchy the adoption of the New Media Paul see is clearly a violation of policy KB we urge you to send the New Media policy and direct the administration to trains is officially committed to equity ethnic studies and building authentic Partnerships with families and other community members

[00:23:00]
we can be reached at Family Center for education at gmail.com thank you Mr Watkins our next speaker is on Zoom Hollis Hess we can't see ourselves but I'm guessing you all can see a really cool elementary school and I can hear the first tripping and I think

[00:24:00]
I like my environmental Club at my school and I like that we have access to our outdoor Garden of the public schools it's pushed by Sapphire and I'll just read passage out of here and the precious

[00:25:00]
is the name of a infant baby and so they said an adult male here so he's on me then he reaches over to Precious starts with his finger between her legs I say Carl what you doing he says shut your big ass up this is good for her then he get off me and take her Pampers and he tried to stick his thing in Precious this book goes on to have other things like this quote Niger rape me I'm not still in shit fat bitch your husband Rape Me Right me so we have five minutes and it goes on and on so I know there's been a lot of proposals for removing explicit content from schools I think this Falls in that category but can we just start with a simple rule and eliminate just across the board write a rule that any book one in 10,000 books Everett schools that's how

[00:26:00]
those are so many books to choose from so I would say A good rule that we can just write today is any book that talks about finger fucking or raping an infant should just be off the table just my opinion or next week sorry our next speaker is Tara Dayton hello my name is Tara Dayton I'm from Monte Vista Elementary School and two great things that I want to talk about that are happening at my school are that the school garden is being revamped by the environmental club that I run before school with about 13 students and three mom volunteers amazing volunteers the kids get to learn about things related to the environment and they also learn about the fundamentals of planting seeds in our garden we recently got a 5000

[00:27:00]
from the city and I want to mention the young lady who just spoke Hollis Hess and her brother helped get that Grant the students were involved in writing it in the club and we purchased $500 worth of sorry we purchased $500 worth of plants and compost native plants and shrubs and compost from plants of the Southwest the students are also publishing a book about New Mexico plants and animals another thing that is really positive and great happening in my fourth and fifth grade gifted classroom is that students are participating in The Wild Friends program with the UNM law school they collect data for instance when the leaves change color and they enter that data along with other data into Nature's notebook which is a dashboard that is free to do citizens science they also helped write a memorial which was passed by the legislative session and Governor Grisham will declare

[00:28:00]
Statewide citizen science day on April 25th there will be lots of great things happening in around the state with this declaration and yeah just wanted to share that positive stuff for Outdoor Learning thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Sarah Smith thank you children and young teens will you please leave the room there are over 125 + books in Albuquerque Public School libraries that are age inappropriate for students these are books that contain graphic descriptions and images of sex acts including between teachers and students detailed passages of children being sexually assaulted molested and raped children using hard drugs and alcohol teens engaging in self-harm cutting and suicidal behaviors and much more if these books were rated like movies are they would be rated R N C-17 or Triple X for instance the book of silver Flames is sold as adult ER

[00:29:00]
play fiction this book is present in seven of your high schools as well as Van Buren Middle School where it can be accessed by kids as young as 10 years old a brief quote he pounded into her at a steady Pace the liquid slide of his cock into her sounded absolutely through his other wife silent bedroom his balls brushed against her tickling her with each powerful thrust into quote this is clearly not age-appropriate for 10 year old children a 17 year study of children beginning in 7th or 9th grade found that exposure to sexually explicit media including books and graphic novels is associated with early sexual debut unsafe sex and multiple sexual partners thereby increasing the risk of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in that study 23% of girls and 14 percent of boys had been exposed to sexually explicit novels other Studies have found that kids exposed to sexually violent media are more likely to be involved in sexual violence including sexually harassing their peers forcing others to have sex and being victims of sexual violence the book Push by Sapphire already mentioned is

[00:30:00]
present in 8 of your high schools plus Tony hillerman Middle School this book contains numerous detailed passages about a father raping his daughter including full penetration rape of an infant you are providing this book to children as young as 10 years old will you please create a policy to ensure that the books in your school libraries are assessed for age-appropriateness you need to perform a full audit of your school libraries in order to ensure you are protecting children from content that is harmful thank you thank you our next speaker is in the room and I believe it's Dawn Andretti followed by Dr Christine mirror good evening to the sexually explicit books in the aps Library as I continue to read excerpts from this guy that's in my hands of the books that are in these libraries

[00:31:00]
is there any point that I'm told that I cannot continue you have proved my point here if you don't if you do stop me then you still prove my point here so any sensible adult hearing these episodes would do the same as we do books like Judy's blooms forever which is located in Douglas MacArthur and cochiti Elementary plus many middle schools and high schools that says when we woke up Ralph the name of Michael's penis was hard again this time Michael made it last much longer and I got carried away and I grabbed his backside with both hands trying to push him deeper and deeper into me and I spent my legs as far apart as I could and I raise my hips off the bed and I moved with him again and again and again and At Last I came I came right before Michael as I did I made noises just like my mother Michael did too and quote are you comfortable with letting children have access to this content thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Dr Christine Mirror by Michaela Peterson talked to Mary you have two minutes once you begin speaking

[00:32:00]
good evening board in August the HB 171 advising committee only spent $15 on their agenda for a discussion on discretionary units for social studies and to make the decision on health education and PE 15 minutes for two very important decisions that had to be made and then presented to you why in March there was a journal article that showed that you all decided to change the registration option for after two people came to talk to you that was extremely encouraging that was great it was a great movie that happened by APS so I'm perplexed APS made a decision to fix the registration process when two individuals spoke at a board meeting however when over 2000 individuals voiced that they are concerned about health education moving to 8th grade

[00:33:00]
I wanted to see it stay in 9th grade the board is yet to reverse that decision that was made by the board first we were told that we needed to hear from health professionals well I was a bit taken aback by that because I am a health professional I have a PhD in health wellness and health education as well as many other health professionals that come in front of you and spoken then we were told that we needed to that you all would just monitor it and as it was moving forward well I'm not sure how you're going to do that with all the cuts that have happened at the federal level and I'm guessing that the yrs is no longer going to be administered Across the Nation much less than APS because of the cuts that have happened I'm not sure how you Monitor and that's in every other year survey anyway so it's not a good monitoring tool for health education I do not understand what the board refuses to move on this issue when you have been made aware of the sound reasons why the decision to move Health was not a good decision in addition

[00:34:00]
your focus on improving student outcomes how do you improve student outcomes without a strong focus on student health beginning with health education to bring it back at your next meeting and take the right vote this time thank you our next speaker is Michaela Peterson followed by Arturo Quintana you have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you when we asked kids to leave the room and it's it's a little hard to read out loud even in this meeting that means it's absolutely true library books it's not

[00:35:00]
talking about any other ideologies or anything else just pornographic books in our kids schools and right now under APS policy a parent can contest a book one at a time at each individual school but these books are in many many schools if even half of these were in half of our schools it would still be over 10,000 challenges for sexually explicit materials that's not oversight that seems like it is obstruction by design that is purposefully exposing our kids to this stuff now studies show that early exposure to sexually explicit material causes psychological trauma anxiety shame compulsive behaviors it causes academic decline you should at least care about that it causes risky and early sexual behavioral problems increases exposure increased exposure leads to unprotected sex coercion it increases their vulnerability to grooming and

[00:36:00]
I have a son who we are adopted he was sexually abused before he came to us Predators groom children and they use sexually explicit material to desensitize them so that they can Target them they first tell them and ask them if they can keep secrets from Mom and Dad which is another issue we have with Public Schools right and then after that they expose them to sexually explicit material pornographic material and desensitized that and then they write them over and over and over YouTube please I have submitted a policy proposal for you to just Define clearly and transparently what sexually explicit material is and please just get it out of our schools thank you ma'am our next speaker is Arturo Quintana followed by Janet Sayers once you begin speaking sir

[00:37:00]
I want some you are sick and tired of hearing all these books and quotes being expressed out loud but if that's the case for you guys to hear us then so be it this is not a matter of free speech you are free to say whatever you want however if you defend these explicit books rather than opposing them you might as well be protecting the rapist the murder of this send your logic and reasoning or subjective and deluded it's common sense not to give us a bed in your home to let a murderer table or to invite a rapist in your house to watch over your child if you see these labels clearly you wouldn't invite these kind of people who act with malice that's how dangerous these books are however if you intend to be ignorant about it and save these books then try giving these books a test run in your own home Library like that about page 18 quote for sex addict your tits

[00:38:00]
check your clit or tongue or asshole is a shot of heroin always there always ready to use and quote for those who oppose what I just said this is the kind of material you're advocating for and that's just disgusting thank you thank you our next speaker is Jenna says and as always you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president of the aps staff and Janet Sayers a graduate of 1966 high school and I wanted to comment on four things I do want to thank board members Gonzalez and more for attending the open house and a social emotional learning program last week at Hodgen from making themselves available to interact with

[00:39:00]
the public and also answer questions and take questions at the end I did want to also comment on the wonderful creativity and talent that I saw yesterday I went by the metro youth Art Exhibit which is opening and it'll be open I believe for 6 weeks just amazing work coming out of both all of our high schools but also our middle schools and and it was just encouraging to see it then I'm glad that Mr deface in the audience cuz I just wanted to bring up again how many Recreation facilities are out there that are totally independent from the school building such as the soccer fields at Comanche Inez Hayes Middle School summer

[00:40:00]
Almonte Jackson and it just seems like there could be should be a way of allowing Public Access either with a different kind of fencing or something but we will have a long hot summer and it would be great for those to be available and my last thing and I I'm really not ready to I don't know what I'm going to say about it but I cut the article out of the paper where it talked about the board members only being allowed to comment or commenting through the board president please wrap up very quickly I will wrap it up I I know what you're going for but it just seems like Beach Boys each board member has a unique perspective and a unique set of schools and constituents and Josefina Dominguez is my rep and I want her to be able to

[00:41:00]
say how she feels about the different decisions that are made so I don't know but I'm going to keep it close and look at it more often and try to decide what I really think about this thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Lorraine I believe it's loader you have two minutes once you begin speaking I have three young children under the age of 10 and it's important to be held accountable for the content in school libraries just like we said parameters on the internet and TV for them school should be selecting age-appropriate material that's what parents count on unfortunately I've seen inappropriate materials at the schools and grateful that parents are raising awareness to protect children We should strive to set a policy to allow access to age appropriate material while protecting them from the stuff that isn't thank you for considering my input thank you

[00:42:00]
connect speaker I have listed is Audrey Eldred and it says 4th grader okay my name is elementary school I would like to talk about to learn a lot about law because I got to go to The Roundhouse in Santa Fe and I actually got a pill pass for citizen science day Wild Friends is also a very cool administration because

[00:43:00]
opportunities to kids that are younger and they get to make differences and they get opportunities to learn about law and they get to go on really fun field trips and I just wanted to add that positive thing citizen science is this thing that citizen science is a way that average everyday people like students and teachers get to help raise the environment and help with the environmental knowledge I use Nature's notebook and I get up on my dashboard and I send it to all the way in Roswell and it's a really cool experience and I just wanted to add that positive no thank you

[00:44:00]
thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Christina Williams thank you ladies you have two minutes my name is Christina Williams Elementary School for all students and this week we brought some of that together dedicated teachers and parents and community members came out this weekend to start building or outdoor garden and Labyrinth from funds from our outdoor activity Grant we set aside or Chromebooks this week and embraced our Agricultural and archaeological Heritage through day long activities this Thursday turning our outdoor spaces into Dynamic classrooms and the Friday I was able to attend my first ever Sandia on fifth grade

[00:45:00]
Excursion I talked about very look forward to an event that all fifth graders get to do at Alameda and I finally understand why it was such an amazing Capstone experience for our students I witnessed those so-called troublemakers transform into quiet observers as we sat and a squirrel snuck up on us and we were captivated as dears trailed behind us and the whole class was in rapt attention as the wind blew through a trees I hope this is something we can all get behind and share because this is something that should be available to all of our students are students were tipped going under the underbrush finding evidence of producers consumers decomposers and they were bringing vocabulary to life the vocabulary there in the classroom they get to see and touch and feel and smell in our class and our outdoor classrooms on Thursday at our campus I saw student

[00:46:00]
is it struggle to communicate verbally students that normally are wearing headphones and need one-on-one support and they go outside and they are overwhelmed by the outdoors and had breakthroughs squeezing balls of clay and making seed balls that will one day become Wildflower Gardens in our back I got to stop you right there you go over your two minutes can you wrap up real quick please up and so I look forward to this continued growth and I do hope that you all support the social emotional learning for all of our students they all deserve an opportunity to be outdoors and learn not just wear places where teachers are willing to go that extra mile thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Megan long Megan are you there yet we go you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking hello I'm speaking today because I would like there to be a

[00:47:00]
rid of opposition to the new board policy that prohibits elected members of the board from speaking to the media about their vote curiously this this policy comes after a contentious series of board meetings and is I believe an attempt to stifle any board members whose votes do not align with the majority this policy reflects the escalating assault on free speech that we are witnessing on a national level constituents deserve to hear from their elected officials without the censorship of the board president you cite wanting to maintain Unity to the public there isn't Unity when there are votes of opposition presenting it as such as false we deserve to know when board members who have voted in why board members have voted in opposition we urge you to resend recent the New Media policy thank you thank you

[00:48:00]

regarding nature the environment and ecological systems with Hands-On activities like working in a garden students engaged with learning in a way that also helps them see how their actions make a difference in the environment around them while books computers and the internet help students learn information spending time outside and working with nature can help them understand how that information applies to the world around us and they really can make a difference and I also helped out on the planet of yours Club on a Vista and the kids there they're learning how to do research they can use art to learn about nature and it's just a really amazing experience and I think Outdoor Learning should be in more schools if it isn't you know already in the schools and if it is and they can use more support thank you for your time

is Deezer counselors with the parents deserve to know and the kids deserve to know thank you thank you our next speaker is Nina Simona are you there any now thank you well hopefully not the intention of the policy the language suggests limitations on board members First Amendment rights while I acknowledge I need to distinguish between a board members personal opinions final board policy decisions I don't think I need to remind

[00:58:00]
board members are elected representatives for their districts and as such must be able to speak about publicly about their positions on board votes and their positions on issues before the board in order to communicate in a meaningful way with other with their constituents policies are prohibit free public speech by elected officials are undeniably anti-democratic for this reason the policy statement must be revised to meet the appropriate goal which is in this instance is to show clear distinction between a board board members personal opinions and a final official board policy decision in case we're difference of opinion arise upon reviewing the policy both in New Mexico foundation for open government and the ACLU of New Mexico have concerned that the policy constitutionally limit school board members from the stuffing board decisions must respect the Democratic process they also have a fundamental First Amendment right and duty to explain their votes and engage in public discussion about policies that impact the community

[00:59:00]
rather than leave this policy up to interpretation or misinterpretation I request the board visit the language in 44 to clarify intent thank you for your time thank you board members that completes public forum for tonight thank you mister Gonzalez and thank you to our public forum guess we will now move on to the next item on our agenda which is agenda item 6.1 student outcomes focused governance for this agenda item we will consider acceptance of progress monitoring reports for interim goals 3.1 3.2 3.3 which are related to post secondary Readiness our presenters for this item are superintendent Dr Gabriella Blakey Dr Uncle Gonzales Deputy superintendent for leadership and learning Sherry jet Chief academic officer and Mark Garcia Associates super

attendant for secondary education invite you to come forward and have a seat as I mentioned it will be monitoring interim goals 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 tonight measuring post-secondary Readiness before we begin however we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I did consult with the administration and believe that all of the criteria for an effective report have been met but I will open it up to the four for anyone else who thinks we may be missing any one of the elements so do any members of the board have any evidence that suggests that we're missing any elements for the progress monitoring report okay excellent since everyone agrees that the required elements are present in the report we will open up our floor for our monitoring conversation and as a reminder we have asked

[01:01:00]
children's in advance over email that are technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those questions and those answers are posted with the agenda materials for the public as well as for the board of course to see each member is expected to ask a question during this monitoring session to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails those questions asked tonight must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results driven and time bound and as an additional resource board members have in front of them do that a guide with guidance on the effective question asking strategies and we also email the effect of question asking strategies in advance to board members so let's go ahead and get started for the administration is there anything you would like to

[01:02:00]
present before we get into our questions no all right so we will go ahead and go into our questions I will go ahead and just start with our folks who are online so we'll begin with number Dominguez but it's with regard to interim goal 3.1 the section evidence of plan and my question is how will you know if your if the top quote targeted communication strategies for multilingual learners

[01:03:00]
and quotes are working the board of President members of the board board member Dominguez so when it comes to 3.15% and families that also speak various languages were working on providing schools an updated sale and stole handbook and within this handbook we're going to produce various one pagers and various tools that schools can use to communicate the various Pathways to community members to teachers to Educators so that we collectively have a broader understanding of community

[01:04:00]
what's within bilingual seal attainment and one thing that we're going to be doing as well as taking account both anecdotal and Survey results of communications and actually looking into if communication is working by taking into account what the communities telling us in addition to enrollment Trends keeping an eye on that data and seeing if more incoming 9th grade students are actually entering into the identified courses so that's one indicator of if communication is working but one other thing that we realize is that communication for bilingual sale Pathways shouldn't have been in 9th grade and we're talking this communication to start in pre-k and Kindergarten Roundup recently where this information was provided so it's not a one-time

[01:05:00]
thing that we talked about bilingual cell it's all encompassing it's what we value in Albuquerque Public Schools our community is expressed the value of being bilingual so starting early as we can in communicating bilingual sell opportunity but then following it up through specific key points in students transition from like example 5th to 6th grade 8th to 9th grade and so on great thank you Doctor Garcia additional questions well I guess so what I'm hearing and correct me if I'm wrong on enrollment to be an indicator mostly

[01:06:00]
and not just at the high school level with 9th graders but you'll be tracking 5th grade transition 5th to 6th grade is that correct I think I missed something in there for president or president when we talked about communication specifically for earning a bilingual communication is working we can't solely just look at enrollment in a 9th grade bilingual course it takes a communication from pre-k through 12th grade and consistent and communication so that communities can communicate this in different languages so that

[01:07:00]
multilingual community members can have an opportunity to see what's available within the district in addition to that also ensuring that we're getting feedback in regards to our communication whether or not it's working both anecdotal by speaking with stakeholders Educators family members are and is the communication that we're delivering working and if it's not what adjustments can be made so it's fluid in nature and we're always in a continuous Improvement mindset in that through a cycle of continuous Improvement we do a survey we take it worked or not but it's fluid and continuous and communication for bilingual cell encompasses pre-k through 12th grade I'm going to continue a little bit because in

[01:08:00]
reading one of the answers there's discussion about monthly or regular information the dissemination of information to key stakeholders I just I did not read how the administration would get that feedback and so I guess I'm sensing president and looking at the data through multiple measures specifically to give an example I think one of the things that we monitor ourselves with through the data is God real 5 which speaks about our accountability to the community

[01:09:00]
in relationship to ensuring voice of families and ensuring voice of Staff as we work to roll out any number initiatives including but not limited to the work of bilingual seal so in preparing for Progress monitoring a few weeks from now we are looking at that data now and seeing how the strategy and the accountability for example with ensuring voice of families parents on a schools instructional counselor as a specific interim guard rail to ensure that we are looking at the data from a longitudinal point of view is there another example is every school has a principal advisory committee that's another data point that we are monitoring in one of our other

[01:10:00]
girls to ensure student voice with roll out is monitored we have advisory Council that inform the work at a school level as well as a district level so these are just three examples of ongoing monitoring of data to ensure accountability to us the district in ensuring that we are keeping the pulse if you will in regards to ongoing collaboration and communication with internal and external stakeholders thank you Doctor Gonzalez we will go ahead and move on to the next if you have additional questions so next we have memberito yes Mike question mark

[01:11:00]
I didn't hear it states many students and families like clear information on the requirements and benefits of the blank bilingual seal particularly the goal Global seal now APS wants to launch a multi-lingual Outreach campaign and I see a steps for the students and how are you going to be doing that could you give me some examples on how you intend to reach out to families and just share with me some of those thoughts thank you tomorrow the board specifically some examples of how to communicate with families again is not really a one-time thing but thinking about what available technology that we have available to us for example parent view APS website we have our APS Communications team and any

[01:12:00]
opportunity that we have to communicate the benefits of the bilingual cell but really what moves people I think for example are the stories that we provide and we have two real examples of the benefits of bilingual sell tonight honoring and recognizing the very first two students in Albuquerque Public Schools to earn the Navajo bilingual cell so tonight was just an example of how we're communicating that opportunity moving beyond that again I talked about providing one pagers to community and in different languages in so forth so really trying to shift our mindset to not think about bilingual attainment in like one time and space but it's all like I said before it's like a cohesive mindset and it's a way of doing business with an Albuquerque Public Schools and really schools leaning into any opportunity we

[01:13:00]
have to have a family night or a transition from one grade to the other for from 5th to 6:00 to ensure that we're providing that opportunity another area in this communication is providing visuals of Pathways so that when students do transfer from one Community to another that they have knowledge of the pathways from pre-k through 12th grade and what opportunities lie so really also updating those visuals and then any time again when we have these like 9th grade nights that we purposely and intentionally provide that information to families so those are just several examples of to provide for you at this time great thank you dot no right now thank you thank you we will turn to vice president

[01:14:00]
thank you so my question came to me at under 3.1 but I think it actually applies to all of them so what what I've noticed is that you all have done an amazing job of increasing the access to the information through all three of these you have essentially you have increased the Supply right you've opened up the ability for our students to have access to all of these programs but my question I think naturally flows from that is what are what strategies are you using on the opposite side to drive demand what are you with strategies are you using to make sure that the the opportunities are there but how are we going to drive our students to want to take these classes

[01:15:00]
how are you communicating the value we obviously know it's a value because we've made it a goal but how are what strategies are you using to ensure that our students demanded board member Jackson board president Gonzalez Dr Blakey members of the board when opportunity is real they will rise to it and when students actually can visualize a future that they see themselves potentially being part of specifically when they see a future that is a line to what they're learning in school so the rigor and relevance of what they're learning tied to post secondary Readiness really creating this idea that when students are thinking about a career path that it's aligned to their goals and their interests so we're launching

[01:16:00]
afford next Generation strategy at Manzano in Highland High School and this strategy is career academies in schools aligned to Career Pathways and really career connected learning so involving industry Partners in alignment with what's being learned in curriculum so when students are taking courses that are learning through the lens of College and Career Readiness so if they're working on math problems how are they seen the relevance to their post-secondary goals so really connecting the relevance in curriculum to the students future and I think that's one example in a strategy that we're going to be implementing to making opportunities thank you dot

[01:17:00]
I think that that's a great analysis for what was it 3.2 how are you driving demand for our bilingual seal and 4-Hour AP if I Madam president I like to give a specific example in regards to 3.15 conversations in regards to what this data is telling us I think one of the jewels in the crown of APs if you will is our dual language programs we're very proud of them we also recognize that the Lion's Share of those programs are an English Spanish humble dual language program so that conversation we need to Foster those programs build those programs make those programs more Dynamic but at some point we will hit a point where

[01:18:00]
the students within the Albuquerque Public Schools that want that program will hit a ceiling so how do we look at that ball through a different lens and I think it is through pathway for the global seal which basically provides space for students throughout the district who are taking coursework in a different language French German Navajo Zuni unit Chinese Japanese we have these Pathways in Albuquerque Public Schools right now how do we spell that word now that may be on a one by one basis because you may have some students at CEC taking the Chinese pathway and we may need to work with them with intentionality did you know that this pathway exists did you know that this portfolio option to demonstrate your competence in the second language exists what is

[01:19:00]
what's the benefit of this for you what post High School benefit does this have for you so really looking at the bilingual seal through a different set of eyes if you will in terms of capitalizing upon what we saw tonight which is a huge milestone for us as a district in really highlighting two of our Pioneers in terms of attaining obtaining the bilingual seal in native language there's really momentum in that space to support in Foster increase participation in that seal I want to say one more thing about that though it doesn't start at 9:30 we have many students in many examples throughout the district where we are at the 5th grade level providing 5th grade by

[01:20:00]
single seal certificates an outward symbol to that student that family that community that they took course work and attained a bilingual seal in elementary school likewise in 8th grade those numbers continue to go up although they are not specifically monitored in this goal they provide the groundwork in the momentum for us to build upon throughout the system thank you dot we will come back to you if there's any additional follow-ups or additional questions will turn to member top your Romero thank you so much is surrounding 3.2 where we talked about developing a task force consisting of diverse stakeholders I would like to know a little more about that and what this task force is going to look like and how much influence would they actually have in the decision-making process

[01:21:00]
because when we hear many times from public comment it seems like there's a disconnect there and what intentionality are we going to have to make sure that this isn't just in talk but in true action page 5:00 p.m.

[01:22:00]
Albuquerque Public Schools are students and families just some some of the most recent conversations that have taken place about level law specifically that we learned and we're working with the platform in the state was that when we had a broad number of students logging in right at once the system would crash so we actually worked on communicating that with level all to improve what's happening with that system also through this advisement task force understanding the barriers for students to actually get activated within the system and with that information we've been able to communicate strategies for schools in order to engage families and students in activating their accounts within level all and today I know this is a little bit off of what you asked for the question but I just would like to give some examples of how

[01:23:00]
task force has been working in listening to stakeholders and finding out how we can support them so I think it is is relevant but right now a current student activations is 26,948 so 70% of our students have activated accounts and right now the real the real goal for level all is to ensure that next step plans are completed so that students create in 8th grade their next step plan through their senior year so that they can align their post-secondary goals to their academic plan and right now we have 2,841

[01:24:00]
add task force you know level all is a little bit new to us and so we are working with a lot of the stakeholders that Mr Garcia referenced in terms of okay what are we learning in terms of what's happening with level all in the school so those task forces would include or the task force members include for example our principles are teachers who are acting in The Advisory role we also leveraging our principal advisory committees which brings the student voice forward and then I think an exciting part but it's still very much in its infancy is how we're thinking about leveraging Community voice in the work particularly around 3.2 we recognize that to truly bring a new experience to high school education we really need our business and industry Partners to win their voice to that work period

[01:25:00]
and what our vision is and I don't know that their voice is particularly active on this task force at this time but we do need their input as we continue to grow and use level all with our students and to help students really envisioned that future that we know there will be great and thank you all of our presenters did you have any additional follow-ups thank you will turn to member benavidez thank you president Gonzalez so my question is related to interim goal 3.2 and just for reference I'm just repeat the data shows that 60% of 10 crazy students earned a credit and career connected learning during the fall semester 2024 representing a 7.8% of 2.35

[01:26:00]
identify challenges and scalability resource allocation Equitable access Etc however we have not yet discussed long-term impact tracking and so is there a strategy in place to measure real-world success of the career connected learning graduates in terms of career placement or higher education enrollments and if so when will this be implemented board member benefits word president superintendent so I think when we think about long-term tracking specifically we do a senior exit survey as a starting point in addition to keeping track of post-secondary credits attained but through that senior exit survey those things are accounted for you know what their next steps are going to be after

[01:27:00]
High School I think in addition to that when we think about 3.2 specifically it's the number of 10th grade students obviously earning credit but as a goal 314 we've shifted our mindset and how we're looking at how students are sequencing through courses so they enter an entry-level course and they go in a concentrator course and then a computer course and thinking about students in a computer course and knowing that if they earn advanced placement as an example that's a way to earn credit and college if they are not industry certification that also is a metric that shows that students are College and Career ready those are a couple of examples so really thinking about how we're tracking students so we've talked as a goal 314 and

[01:28:00]
in my responses I talked about a dashboard and with that dashboard we're looking at data in a way that's comprehensive and not in a single point in time so 3.2 is a little bit in a single point in time in 10th Grade but we're not thinking just for 10th grade so looking at the end in sight trying to figure out okay for a certain cohort how many industry certifications were earned then also looking at specific Pathways and finding out okay at this particular School through this pathway as an example how many industry certifications how many horses in April have been earned or like credit course for example so really I'm looking at College and Career Readiness data in a comprehensive way I hope that

[01:29:00]
give you a couple of examples of how we're looking at the data at the end in relation to the data at 3.25% and so you know that's something that can be reported upon but I think it'll probably be difficult to to reach out to students after and to find out what careers have you entered based on your training at APS men and women Clearing House on some of that data not all of it but we do have post secondary College enrollment we do not have it correctly or specific

[01:30:00]
but we have some of that in our sapper Team does monitor that and it is data that we do have available to us but to your point absolutely It's Tricky the minute they walk across that stage and move into the real world to continue our connection to that data but I think there are ways we as adults can change our practice and behavior to find creative ways to maybe find some of that even if it's a sample of students and their post-secondary thank you dot thank you so I have a question related to Google 3.3 which is covered in that document pages 4 through 8 there's information

[01:31:00]
plan in the progress to ensure that all students have Equitable and sustainable opportunities to prepare for their postsecondary goals and so my question is a current performance question which is essentially what do we know about the student population that is farthest from opportunity for this from being able to obtain their post-secondary goals who are those students where are they going to school what do they need what barriers are in their way and how are you gathering information about them and then responding to that a board member Gonzalez for president so when we look at advanced placement data specifically I'm going to give some data points for our focus group students special education students in semester

[01:32:00]
was at 8% and for this fall 2024 credit entertainment for students with disabilities was 12.9 percent that's an example of the district as a whole and an area of opportunity growth for us obviously that's not the number that were okay with we need to improve that the next would be English language Learners and in semester 1 of last year we ended with 32% and then at the end of this semester semester one this year at 40.5% or 40.5% so both but earlier I talked about the data dashboard and providing real-time data for schools not just at the end of a semester but how do we triangulate the data in real time so that the end of a

[01:33:00]
period schools can see exactly are in advanced placement courses we can disaggregate the data by focus group students and then providing the right intervention at the right time for the right student and I think we've done a good job in shifting our mindset about advanced placement and ensuring that we're communicating with students and families about these opportunities and encouraging them to be part of a what I want to say is that what we used to do is ask ourselves who's ready for AP now is the district asking ourselves how can we get all how I'm sorry we used to ask are they ready for now we ask how can we help students be ready for a so really a shift in mindset but progress monitoring at all points of the school year and then

[01:34:00]
again like I said providing those interventions but also shifting from looking at data as a district in relation to the goals but drilling it down to the school and then to the individual student thank you for that so all board members have had an opportunity to ask a question and so I'll just open up the floor to the full board if anyone has any additional questions I actually have one additional well go to member benefits thank you so this question is in relation to interim goal 3.2 again and I notice through the report that collaborations with Nissan and Toyota dealership and a trade Union provide valuable opportunities but additional Partnerships are needed and so to diversify the students access to other Industries so is there a plan in place to create additional Partnerships and if so what fields

[01:35:00]
we are we do have a plan in order to grow those Partnerships and it is working through what we're learning through Ford NGL and developing what Pathways we want to create at the schools to ensure that we have both Equitable access across the district and we have those strong Partnerships so we're we don't have 13 schools knocking on the door of the same partner saying let's partner right we know that would be overwhelming so to that in what we've started and we started this with Manzano and Highland old ready is basically and asked that map around what are the industries what are the businesses and the partners that are in the community in proximity to the school but it doesn't necessarily have to be in proximity that support the Pathways in the career opportunities that we want to offer to the students there and then by doing that we were able to leverage our

[01:36:00]
preschool coordinators and we're also partnering with our friends at the United Way to tap into those relationships and Partnerships so we can really begin to build them and I do think to your previous question about how we track post-secondary success I think that will be part of it right when we strengthen these Partnerships and we're constantly checking in and nurturing those Partnerships we're going to be able to tell those stories and collect more information about what are APS graduates are doing after high school and board president Gonzalez and board member benefits I think in addition to a is saying the idea is that we develop these academies of Albuquerque that every High School will have so it's starting with the schools that Miss jet mentioned that every school will have the academies at their school and it will become the way that we do high school because unfortunately for a lot of our students they they

[01:37:00]
don't have access we have opportunities but we don't provide access for all of our students so a lot of times it's if you knew to go to that school to be part of that pathway or the academy or if you know your teacher or your parents told you that Sandia Labs does internships and you're able to do that but we don't have it as the norm and so all of our students don't know what is out there so the plan is actually that we build this out and every school so every school has a pathway in the pathway has multiple jobs within it so the pathway isn't specific to a job the pathway is broader than that and it's a way of how the students will learn their content through the lens of that pathway to bring relevance because we've seen a lot of students become disengaged in high school particularly and I'm very apathetic

[01:38:00]
play just like going through the motions of school and it's concerning to us you know that we're not providing this to our students and then you know they graduate and they don't know what that what that means or they don't graduate because they are like this is I don't want to play school anymore so how we can really provide that relevancy but the idea is that it's every high school every student that would have the pathways at their school thank you great thank you I see that you unmuted did you have additional questions I think they just got answered thank you great thank you any other board members all right well I would like to thank the board for a very productive conversation and now we will move on to a vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a reminder

[01:39:00]
do you accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and the administration and that we have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for our students lines up to our communities vision for them so in order to accept this report we must all be able to answer yes to the following three questions when does the reality of this report meet our vision for the goal to is their growth toward the vision and three is there a strategy and sufficient to cause growth toward the division so does any member have evidence that those three components are not there are we good with accepting guests tomorrow

[01:40:00]
thank you so given that the answer to all three of those is yes then the word can accept the monitoring report confident that the data is accurate and that the superintendent is performing at this point I will entertain a motion to accept this monitoring report I move that we accept this monitoring report for remember benavidez a second this is number Jackson thank you we have a motion and a second Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please yes and so the motion carries like to thank the administration not just for the report but also for all the great work that you're doing on postsecondary Readiness and it was really exciting to see the students be recognized for their efforts as well so thank you for that we will move on to our next item on the agenda which is number seven

[01:41:00]
consider approval of the consent agenda for this I need a motion and a second to approve items 7.1 through 7.18 by movie approve the consent agenda for item 7.1 through 7.18 and 8.18 thank you we have a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda can we have a roll call vote please yes yes yes yes so that motion carries in our consent agenda is approved we will move on to our next agenda item which is 8.1 to consider approval to Archive the board policy if he naming renaming and dedication of facilities and for this I will turn it over to member

[01:42:00]
okay thank you president Gonzalez and if you all were call we did discuss this at Great length that our board meeting on March 5th I believe and I think the the board was pretty clear on rejecting the idea of the the board keeping the responsibility with the board and kind of archiving it and giving it back to or giving it to the superintendent to take care of and under her responsibility however we did not change the motion to reflect that so what we actually voted on was to not accept the revisions to the policy so what we are here to talk about tonight is what we discussed at length at the March 5th meeting and so if there are any comments that anyone wants to make about the pros and cons of the board keeping this policy I'll open it up great so thank you for that we will move to emotion and a second to consider approval to archived the board policy

[01:43:00]
is there a motion and a second will there be an opportunity I need to clarify my vote because I didn't have a chance to do that at the last during the will there be a discussion before we vote to discussion so I will move to Archive board policy fever and this is Crystal second thank you we have a motion and a second and so we will turn to discussion on the motion to Archive the board policy on naming and dedication of facilities is there any discussion or questions

[01:44:00]
during the February 5th Board of Education meeting I shared my belief that I firmly believe that all buildings should be named in a way that honors and respects the history and culture cultures of New Mexico especially are indigenous history however during the discussion it occurred to me that I also have an obligation to Elementary

[01:45:00]
but when you have the parents have a generational and emotional connection to that name children who had attended that school 30 plus years ago now have children attending the same school so the choice was nostalgic also it occurred to me that Coronado Elementary School parents voted to keep their name and in a discussion with superintendent she reminded me that Kit Carson and communities also voted to keep their day so it's complicated but what was illuminated for me over the days after the February 5th meeting was this deep change requires building relationships in order to share his views on sensitive topics and this is something I couldn't articulate at the moment which is why I voted no original originally

[01:46:00]
but I was better able to think about this and articulate it as a days passed so relationships have to come first and I think we know that as elected officials or I know that as an elected official if we're to educate our community at large and that doesn't happen overnight we cannot skirt the hard work of relationship building and so I also reflected on the fact that the last three to four buildings have been named after upstanding administrators and a committee of Administrators made that choice for superintendent shows that committee so if the board should influence anything I'm suggesting that the board should direct the superintendent to expect the question is is

[01:47:00]
meaning of building the direct responsibility of the board and I landed on no and still believe it's not but if the responsibility was in our court it would be our responsibility to remind the superintendent to honor and respect the culture and history of the vast majority of the communities so that explains my last phone but it also explains why I will vote the way I do tonight is there any additional discussion or questions I have a question submitted I asked please describe

[01:48:00]
practical consequences of archiving policy Fe and how it would impact the process for naming or renaming APS facilities and the answer was the administration would need to write a new procedural directive as soon as possible as there are two schools currently in the renaming process and so can you disclose which schools they are board president Gonzalez and board member Benavides we currently have the new international school which needs a name so they are going through a process now so we need to kind of know where they're going through the old process right now because that's what we currently have and Polk Middle School is discussing changing their name as well and my next thank you my next question is just off the cuff superintendent Blakey how do you feel about this becoming

[01:49:00]
how do you feel about that because you weren't here on March 5th and I believe it was the March 5th meeting although board member to me as has me confused now so you were here to weigh in and I would love to know what your thoughts are for president board member Benavides I think we've discussed it at the policy meeting so I think that's what a board member Dominguez was the date of that and I think what I had brought up during that time is that I certainly do think it is a connection of the board and the administration working together on it I do have concerns about the the part of the policy that states that board members if a majority of the board decides to change a name that they can I do see where that would not fall under the board's responsibility but

[01:50:00]
there are usually financial implications to changing a school name that can be upwards to a million dollars in changing a school named and so the board having connection to approval of the name change during the process is helpful in keeping kind of everybody on the same page of the community changing a name because it will come to the board probably in the finance side of it for approval so you know I do think that the board does have a role in a green or the bond and the money to build a new school that is named but I do think that the board has always accepted the community input side of a name

[01:51:00]
in my time in APS I've never seen a board not approved the name that came from the community and I think that's what board president Gonzalez was bringing up as if we would never not value it then why would we spend our time on it so I understand that I'm concerned I do have some heartache over the can a board override to just change names of schools so I don't like that part of the policy but the procedural director of does have a substantial amount of board influence in the procedural directive so we would have to change a lot of that in the procedural directive rather quickly as we have you know two schools following the current procedural directive in policy thank you I have one more points make if you don't mind so with the last meeting it was brought up that

[01:52:00]
the meaning of schools and Facilities it doesn't really follow sosg we are here to focus on student outcomes and this is not directly related to that and I do see that but I did some research into other schools or districts that are within the Council of great City schools and it's a very small sample because I believe there are 78 maybe more but you know the Baltimore City Schools board of education has kept this responsibility there was no info in the Denver public schools Aurora directs the superintendent to established procedures But ultimately gets the responsibility the Phoenix Union High School District the governing board directs the administrators to develop procedures for naming the district facilities and keeps the responsibility and so like I said it's a small sample size but I think if we were to do our research and look at all of the schools I think it would be very but I don't think that it would be strongly a superintendent responsibility and so

[01:53:00]
but I don't know why we have the pressure to do it now specifically right now especially knowing that there are two schools that are actually going through this process when it doesn't seem to be a practice of all schools that are using the sosg governance model so that's just something I wanted to contribute and if there are any rebuttals to that or questions than anybody wants to ask I'm happy to answer them board president board member benavidez I think that our current process is probably when AJ sent his like these are the his recommendations our current processes probably more on his second one recommendation Administration and one is that the board serves as like the last approval so like which I think is what ours is more like but then there is concern on that as if the board is just going to rubber stamp

[01:54:00]
whatever comes forward is that essential or not but that's what we do currently is probably more on that second part of we bring the final recommendation to the board at the end the board member whose District it is and typically serves on the committee and just as a point of clarification that Baltimore City Denver and Phoenix are not actually student outcome focused boards so they are members of the Council of great City Schools but they're not doing sfg fantastic Who provided you that information so quickly Ashley pause thank you Ashley all right if there are no additional questions or discussion we will go ahead and move on to our roll call vote we do have a motion and a second so Dr Albright I'll turn it over to you and again this is just a reminder the vote is

[01:55:00]
do you approve archival of this board policy so yes means we archive it and no means it stays with the board as was currently written because we did not accept revisions last time Courtney Jackson yes other than that no Mingus Ronaldo's yes so the motion carries and we will move on to our next agenda item which is agenda item 9.1 which is our discussion items and for this we do have a discussion on board our board time use evaluation for this our presenter is

[01:56:00]
play board member Josefina Dominguez who per this round conducted our time use evaluations I will turn it over to you remember Dominguez so for the first quarter of 2025 and then finally some proposed Solutions so in the first quarter of 2025

[01:57:00]
we had a four-hour meeting 21% of that meeting was devoted to progress monitoring and 79 to the annual governance review edits February 19th was an hour and 48 minute 63% of that meeting was devoted to progress monitoring of gold to we have one special Board of Education meeting and then several committee meetings to ad hoc committee meetings to policy committee meetings 35 minutes with regard to the progress monitoring percentages even though we have a 21 percent initially

[01:58:00]
63% in the second meeting in February nonetheless in the total hours of board meetings and committee meetings we come in at 13% of our meetings being devoted to student outcomes or rather 13% yes 13% of our time being devoted to student outcomes however if we included and I'm just throwing this out there if we included Community engagement that was completely devoted to explaining student outcomes and getting feedback on the goals that we monitor that would go up to 59% so keep that in the back of your mind

[01:59:00]
these numbers are numbers at Ashley Paws and I work through because there were some challenges in the data entry data entry took over 6 hours and I don't believe that's a good use of time but I digress so it took 6 hours total troubleshooting a formula error in the spreadsheet and which I finally had to reach out to Ashley the report the actual report preparation was an hour total board member time again 6 hours so in my analysis and recommendations of evaluation report is to track the boards

[02:00:00]
however the current method is inefficient and requires excessive administrative effort on the part of a board member so some key concerns inefficient tracking process the current process involves creating and maintaining 21 separate spreadsheet tabs popping and pasting links to YouTube recordings and agendas and manually filling in unnecessary what I consider a necessary data and this approach diverse time for more impactful board member work second requesting timestamps are strange on limited staff Resources with only two staff members in the board service office the additional step of providing a timestamp a request that was made I believe

[02:01:00]
Porter at least for my meeting with board member astorga that would further increase staff workload without a direct impact on student outcomes and finally three questionable value of time use evaluation if only student outcomes monitoring is considered a priority how does this process respect board member time or the goal the current message doesn't affect the intended goal of documenting time spent on progress monitoring so the proposed solution is to publicly announced and Report progress monitoring time at the end of each monitoring session that would take a very document time immediately the board member

[02:02:00]
immediately log this time into the time tracker spreadsheet on the spot the approach eliminates redundant work and was board members and staff to focus on more critical tasks and so I would suggest that the board adopts streamlined approach to track time to respect both board member and staff Time by implementing a real-time logging system at the conclusion of each progress monitoring session we can eliminate accurate documentation of the progress monitoring efforts the change with free

[02:03:00]
to see how much time we were actually spending in meetings so I think that's valuable but again I think that's something that we can document on the spot and and and and and save everybody a lot of time great thank you very much for your analysis of the time you use as well as your recommendations I want to Circle back to the factual component of your presentation the information that we need for our q1 self-evaluation is how much time we spent as a board in q1 on student outcomes focused and so can you just for us the Q one percentage of time spent on students it was 13% okay what I'm

[02:04:00]
sing in the spreadsheet is 13% for February and 6% being the average across the quarter or 5.88% so I just want to verify to make sure we have the right number either way none of those are 50% so we're not meeting her 50% goal whether it's 13 or 6 but I just want to clarify what I'm saying is for the quarter is 6% so it would be that was a clarification I asked Ashley and yes it's it ends up being for the quarter is 5.88% okay so then that came from February okay so the number that we need for the quarter is is the 5241 self-evaluation next meeting

[02:05:00]
also just given the recommendations presented by member Dominguez typically in according to our governance manual it's a responsibility of the board secretary to manage the time use evaluation and monitoring process with our board secretary out on leave those duties have been delegated to our vice president and so I'd like to ask our vice president acting as secretary if you could just see Clarity from the council great City schools on these issues the number to raise and the recommendations that she has made as part of her evaluation and I do want to just acknowledge all so that it is practice of Ward Services office to timestamp the minutes and so that was not intentional primarily due to the absence of a services

[02:06:00]
is that person during this time so that will be addressed that that is standard operating procedure for for the minutes and we've spoken to board services staff and the superintendent about that already and so remember Jackson will coordinate or connect with the council about the issues that member Dominguez raised and are there any questions for member Domingo's about the factual component of the report and the time use conclusion of 6% egg I just want to make sure that you caught that if we were to add Community engagement that is focused on reporting out and getting feedback on progress monitoring our goals that could potentially have gone up to 5 0 9

[02:07:00]
like I said 59% for what we could do differently and so are acting board secretary will Circle back around with our coaches on those recommendations and what we can do so no additional questions we will move on to our next agenda item which is agenda item 10 and the president's report so we will begin just with public forum and acknowledging that public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue but we do want each speaker to know that you are heard that we take notes that we're listening and that we do follow up with the administration on resolution some of the issues that we heard about tonight were related to books to health education to Outdoor Learning to public access to Recreation areas to Children's Health and Wellness and to our board governance manual also want to acknowledge that between the

[02:08:00]
last meeting and this meeting we did host to public Community engagement events are mid-year Community engagement about our goals and guardrails and those two events were hugely successful so big round of applause yes we had about 80 people in attendance and I think the Highlight was working with the Community Schools staff to align work that they were already doing to engage community and to get parents into buildings to not go online to that so we are doing our community engagement in coordination with our Community Schools staff so that was really great and just like to thank the committee again which is number Jackson and benavidez for your contributions to putting together those engagement events and our next regular board meeting is April 16th so during that meeting we will discuss

[02:09:00]
any important topics one that we just addressed was a quarter one word self-evaluation so as a reminder each board member conducts their own self-evaluation using the sfg rubric we've provided two different ways for you to do that if you'd like to do electronically or if you'd like to do it the old-fashioned way you can do that either way you just need to have your scores emailed to me by April 14th and that's to allow enough time just for the analysis across any areas of consensus or discrepancy with board members of the relates to that rubrics so we can have so I can present that day and we can have a conversation around the self-evaluation so that deadline again is April 14th that was shared in the last attic lands weekly message and we'll share it again this week that April 16th agenda will also include the bond sale and a first presentation on our community engagement plan as a reminder this is a presentation from the community engagement ad hoc

[02:10:00]
Community ad hoc committee to the rest of the board to get our feedback so we will ask questions provide feedback and suggestions to that committee and then that committee will go back and quickly turn around those revisions and provide new materials to us for our May 7th board meeting which will be the Action meeting related to our community engagement recommendations and again this is our community engagement plan going forward for the next two years which aligns with our new progress monitoring calendar which will also be approved at that May 7th meeting but sticking still with the April 16th agenda there will also be a budget presentation in that meeting and that's going to cover both federal and state programs as well as the district's operational budget which as I think folks know is the vast majority of the budget so that's what we will be covering then and per usual

[02:11:00]
did you receive the budget materials in advance have an opportunity to ask specific questions about the budget those questions are answered during our Q&A period so that we can spend board meeting time talking about strategic issues related to alignment of the budget to the Strategic plan so that's April 16th meeting then on April 22nd we have an audit meeting at 5 p.m. on April 23rd there's a finance meeting at 8 a.m. which will also include another conversation around the budget and the district just to acknowledge that the district does have a comprehensive progress monitoring infrastructure in place and so even as we as a board or monitoring just the goals and the guard rails it's important to acknowledge that the district is also obviously doing a lot more than that so we begin reports about each of the Strategic plan priorities

[02:12:00]
in January starting with special education we paused that to redirect and focus on budget presentations but once we do approve the budget on May 7th we will resume the district's strategic plan implementation presentations so that'll be starting up again so an opportunity to dig into more detail on specific strategies and initiatives that are cross-cutting and related to the Strategic plan not just to progress against the specific goals okay so May 7th meeting we already talked about that will be when we approve the final budget so that'll be presented for approval the budget is due to the public education department on May 19th so we are set to meet those deadlines but again a reminder to please review all budget materials in advance please ask questions in advance that are Technical and Technical so we can have strategic conversations during our meeting also on

[02:13:00]
May 7th we will have a progress monitoring conversation around goal for which is skills habits and mindsets for Life success and member Benavides will be progress leading the facilitation of that progress monitoring and so we'll meet with the administration to approve the report and that concludes the president's report and our next agenda item is agenda item 11.1 which is to consider approval for the Board of Education to convene an executive session as authorized the public meetings act to discuss strategy for collective bargaining negotiating negotiations as allowed under Section 10 - 15 - 1 185 so is there a motion and second to convene an executive session I move for approval for the Board of Education to convene in executive session this is member Topia Romero I'll second this is number Jackson thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call

[02:14:00]
votes please Courtney Jackson yes yes Ronaldo tell me to yes so the board will go ahead and continue to Executive session we will reconvene to open session after the executive session but at this time I'd like to ask everyone who is not part of the executive session to please leave the room and leave the virtual room and we will
