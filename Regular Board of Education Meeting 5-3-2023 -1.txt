graduate and I still have a child in APS I'm here today to discuss restorative practices tardy policy and aps's response to hoax threats school to claim to use restorative practices need proper training from higher ups down in order to do so it is not enough to use what is thought to be restored to practices when it is indeed not not implementing restorative practices properly fails everyone involved also if there's a rumor of the threat on social media the community needs to know that not only the schools is aware of the threat but they must confirm after investigating if the threat is a hoax to tell communities that silence assume safety in this day and age does not suffice we need peace of mind to know our children are attending school safely at the high school level across the district and better tardy policy needs to be made students are able to walk in at any time they're missing important information and we cannot students who are not in class thank you for your time

[00:06:00]
are next speaker is Chevron Kidwell you'll have 2 minutes once you begin speaking meeting list have other great options on Jose period

[00:07:00]
play County Schools they didn't want diversity they wanted segregation and when they didn't get it they left at Truman and Washington there's a valuable diversity of experience and background precisely because they are not segregated programs but you have to want diversity and integration Coronado's avoidance of Washington and Truman sends a message what we value is segregation and if we don't get it we'll just leave because we can and segregation is the price APS has to pay to keep these privileged families are you willing to pay it at the expense of working class families who stopped by APS and created a thriving dual language program because I keep hearing that this magnet plan won't impact Washington and but that's false Longfellow had a thriving dual language program right up until Santa was opened and scooped up most of Longfellows teachers and now that program is gone when Coronado opened the principal bragged about poaching teachers from schools all over APS this magnet for Coronado

[00:08:00]
Elevate the needs of privileged parents and it will throw the title 1 schools that built dual language under the bus the teaching resources are scarce and you're going to offer them to the segregationists before everybody else thank you thank you ma'am or next speaker is Rhodes Parker you have two minutes once again talk about the establishment of a new duel language options for dual language middle schools Truman and Washington I attended Washington where my Spanish teachings were solidified by the great teachers there unfortunately they're simply Aren't Enough resources to go around and they are already lacking them at Washington because Title 1 schools always

[00:09:00]
you seem to be the last ones to get their necessary resources to continue teaching us if this school is established teacher will be taken from Washington the idea that this the establishment of this school will not impact Washington Improvement is false thank you thank you next speaker is Vanessa Parker Massachusetts middle school I went to Washington Middle School I loved it so much I also went to Coronado and Coronado I always got bullied because I was a black kid like it's sad but it was just the facts and everyone always making fun of me because I was different and

[00:10:00]
everyone made me feel like I fit in and I felt like I belonged and it made me a better person and it helped me so much with my Spanish thank you thank you our next speaker is Dan Gillespie you have two minutes thank you to talk about the elementary science education standards the topics Arrangement ngss New Mexico adopted science standards so on page 13 of 102 204 for second grade constructing argument with evidence

[00:11:00]
some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed in some cannot so if you go to the disciplinary core idea PS1 - B chemical reactions heating or cooling a substance make us that can be observed sometimes these changes are reversible and sometimes they're not so heated or cooling is mostly about phase changes unless you explain something about kinetics this doesn't belong under chemical reactions in fourth grade four dash PS4 Dash 3 generation multiple solutions that use patterns to transfer information I think they're trying to say is generating compare multiple solutions that use Waze to transfer information student could easily confuse and infer that patterns always convey information as described in the disciplinary core idea PS4 digitized information can be transmitted over long distances without significant degradation

[00:12:00]
in 5th grade 5 - PS1 - 4 conduct an investigation to determine let's go this one's even better 5 to PS 1 - 2 measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating cooling or mixing substances the total weight of matter is conserved no total mass say Mass use maps there's a disciplinary core idea limitation statement at this grade level two minutes I need you to wrap it up in one sentence please the standard that the public school students and through five it doesn't teach anything they go to Middle School

[00:13:00]
department is taking full advantage by secretly transitioning impressionable children with mental health issues who basically diagnosed himself

[00:14:00]
gender dysphoria pardon me who is student health and life skills Angela Ruiz as seen a project Veritas undercover video and why is APS hiding her Angela Ruiz has been scrubbed from the aps website but she was there in March 2023 and I have screenshots what are her credentials even if she has some kind of medical doctor or lawyer and I highly doubt that giving her annual salary which I am able to look up she shouldn't be transitioning other people's children and hiding that from their parents or instructing APS teachers to do the same this is from your APS website student health and life skills working to reduce youths behaviors through Comprehensive Health education access to health services and creating safe and supportive environment in school where is the part about hiding issues of mental health from parents and transitioning children without parental consent since I have a little extra time today I included a photograph and you're going to get a copy of this

[00:15:00]
I don't know who this woman is but when I was at your board meeting and the middle of March she threatened to beat me up out in the parking lot so now I get an escort in and out of the building but I've got thank you ma'am I'll be happy to take care of that our next speaker is on Zoom nicolette's Sigmund are you there can you hear me yes we can you have two minutes I understand that the priority is starting High School later so teenagers can get more sleep but at some point the solution becomes worse than the problem it is frustrating that high school start times were surveyed without the contacts that it would be that it would put middle schoolers in a terrible

[00:16:00]
what position I understand this is because of a lack of buses and drivers the bus issue deserves to be addressed with as much tenacity and boldness as the extended school year and time changes were addressed it feels like the time changes were made with tunnel vision with a blind eye to the domino effect it would have on the other students families and our community the busing issue needs to be addressed before we make sweeping time changes if our district is not equipped to handle the time changes in a responsible way that it can't be forced I have had four children go through Middle School our bus stop is one of the last stops in over the span of 12 Years the bus drops my kids off 45 to 55 minutes after school gets out they would get out of school at 3:05 and not get to the bus stop until 4 p.m. now what the time changes they will get out of school at 4:15 and won't get home until after 5:00 p.m. it will be dark by then during the winter how is this okay also how are kids supposed to focus on

[00:17:00]
on their core classes so late in the day also how will they have time for outside play homework and extracurricular activities and family time I would like a response from the administration on this issue and I would also like to know if the administration was aware that kids can get home up to 50 minutes after school on the bus thank you so much thank you our next speaker is Marcy may have two minutes once you begin speaking thank you my name is Marcy May the letter c should just stand for child but it seems at 8:00 concerned with other topics

[00:18:00]
and conservative cowardice means that you're afraid to stand up for what is right or what your campaign platform was being afraid to address the issue that a drag queen was allowed to substitute for kindergarten class because so-called conservative board member told a concerned teacher that they should be careful about talking about this our tax dollars are not made to make any person straight gay bi or whatever feel safe those money are meant to educate children not to make the children not to make the teacher happy especially in a sexual manner she also stands for complicit conservative contemptible and chemical castration of you was invited to an educational Forum last year last week but not attended a certain conservative board member claimed that standing against child mutilation and chemical castration have hiding medical information from a child

[00:19:00]
transparent was too radical of an idea not that teachers who complain about never having enough money to even be able to afford to buy a sandwich for a child though they so graciously guide them through medical decisions down to the age of five so they can vicarious live through an unsuspecting child quite contemptible which is defined as feeling morally Superior Superior disliking another group such as the parents again tax dollars are supposed to be used for educating children not preparing them for sex trade business moving right along she is for communism another variant of socialism period

[00:20:00]
2 minutes 2 minutes left

[00:21:00]
that one of my co-workers is going to be announcing here and I also sent you survey results from students and then we closed a staff survey today that was administered to 86 staff members and I have the results here and basically the findings on that is that staff are in agreement with students that we do need more security Personnel CSS on campus we would like to address the truancy issues and alongside the tree and see issues the conversation has been like if we're addressing issues and we want to be holding students certain expectations will we receive support for that in you know creating a tardy policy or creating whatever policy it is that we're going to get students to class with and then we would also like to allow Administration to uphold policies with consequences and those were the findings from the staff survey sadly actually know is coming to you know a temporary clothes

[00:22:00]
at the end of the school year we only have one more meeting and that's next week and we're setting for 4:30 a.m. objectives right on how we're going to address these specific needs that were outlined by students and staff and we're going to be getting a community survey out on May 20th and then I would also just like to say that I stand by APS policy and support of the lgbtq community I think it's very important that all children are accepted into the classroom and that they can navigate their identities in a way that is safe for them thank you thank you our next speaker is Laura Vickers you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening board members and Elder I would like to invite you to our March against guns in schools on May 20th

[00:23:00]
it's a Saturday at 10:00 a.m. it starts and we start the march at 11:00 I'm going to leave these here for you so that you can either post them or read them and I'm I invite you to come I hope you will attend it's weird we're inviting everybody it's all inclusive not leaving anyone out which is what we should always do and there's going to be a guest speakers art entertainment food information how we can come together as a community we're not advocating that people don't have guns we are advocating that gun stay out of schools okay so I would like to leave you this and again formally invite you we are still pushing forward because we believe that this is going to empower the community and give the students a voice which they do need and we stand for them Bill saving lives that is the ultimate goal and

[00:24:00]
do we want to promote campus safety and just once again not promoting guns on campus okay so we invite you May 20th and everybody in this room is invited to come May 20th of March against guns on campus okay thank you thank you very much for next speaker is Michaela Peterson you have two minutes once again period so we hosted the education panel that none of you were interested in any of the reports that we are getting from parents or teachers who have attended a training so they see problems inside of their classroom

[00:25:00]
some of which are concerning like counselors saying that they will not report even some self-harm when it's reported to them they won't report that to their parents to the students and then there's the project that I toss video that were told you won't respond to the superintendent Elder thinks is fake but again you could request the entire video all of our materials the teachers have sent to us were more than willing to sit down and speak with any of you again we'll have more education panels and you'll be invited one of them was the New Mexico School Board Association a brave School Board member from another District sent it to us even though we know that Danielle gone is you were there you could have blown the whistle you could have stood up for parents rights couple weeks ago there was an APS funded lgbtq and Educators Summit the Barbara

[00:26:00]
but they're very concerned about 2 and 3 year olds and early Elementary School students learning about inclusivity when we're not even addressing the issues of basic safety and violence in our schools or invasive proficiencies and those are much more important to us I hope that you will attend our next Educators panel we will send you all of the trainings and information that we have and we would love for you to work with us and try to help fix the education because we do have a lot of teachers and parents coming to us but they are scared of you they are scared of the community they're not sure that they'll be heard they feel like everything just falls on deaf ears they're literally scared for their kids safety does Peter I'm sorry you've gone over your two minutes can you wrap it up in one quick sentence I did receive a report that even the lgbtq questioning kids are scared to use the bathrooms at a couple of the

[00:27:00]
and I have to ditch or just avoid going to the bathroom and hold it all day long thank you our next speaker is Casey Peterson you have two minutes thanks to you today and yes we have been doing these undercover investigations and we've heard that many of you are skeptical of what we put forward or outright say that it is a Lie the invitation is absolutely open to everyone and yes even you know Scott if you are superintendent Scott Helder if you would like to sit down with us if you have concerns you can email them to us ahead of time and tell us what proof you need us to provide if you like to sit down view the entirety of the videos if you would like to discredit any aspect of what we're doing we're more than willing to be a completely transparent the contact information for us is it Freedom families united.com all

[00:28:00]
for contact contact information is on every single one of these undercover investigations we've done it's just getting started there's good reason why people are saying indoctrination is being pushed inside of our schools we're not just crazy and if you'd like to see that we have other stuff that's in the works we can even show you stuff that's not published yet things we are working on and we can discuss why people think this and you can even tell us what proof you would need to actually prove this to you if you will sit down with any of you all of you will do it publicly privately however you would like to on your terms we will clear our schedule make time for you and show whatever you need to see if you want to see the hours and hours of content that you would like or if you would like contact round one specific clip whatever it is we're willing to provide that and our door is open again freedom family united.com most of you probably know where to find our undercover investigations and we are more than willing to sit down with you anytime and we'll schedule for all of you or any of you or just like to sit down

[00:29:00]
now that's just fine rather than talking about disparaging our name behind our back or calling all these people crazy conspiracy theorists it might be okay to sit down with us talk to us and even prove us wrong if we are wrong you should show that to all your constituents to all the people in the school you owe them that you owe them to actually show us for who we are or to give their concerns address them correctly and just let us know contact us again anytime you have our contact information thank you thank you sir and our last speaker is Jennifer the grass you have two minutes once you begin speaking you know coming from the New Mexico background I was born and raised and I can tell you right now one of the reasons that I always have that Troublesome feel is when there is a lack of appreciation so I want to be the first one or I should say the last one since I am the last one Speaking I want to thank you for what you do

[00:30:00]
day in and day out at the end of the day we are all humans we all have those ups and those downs and you know Mr Scott I was I started my career as an English language Learners teacher as well and as I continued moving up it reminded me so much of what did I learn when I saw that student outcomes don't change until adult Behavior changes I can tell you right now I was a student back in 1977 and I will be a student until the day I no longer exist and so I want to thank you guys for what you do and making a positive impact in the lives of so many sadly too many times when we come to a board meeting and I've been to a lot I went from being a professional to a teacher to a teacher of the year to a principal to a district official why because of the Educators in New Mexico if you were an educator in New Mexico for that I thank you if you're a parent and you live in New Mexico for that I think at the end of the day if we want to see positive changes happening no matter where we are we can be at home

[00:34:00]
for your consideration the contract and performance framework for El Camino Real Academy our office has been engaged with school in the development of their academic admissions specific goals and we fill these goals will help move the school performance forward and I turn it over to the doctor at this time I'm not a president of the board and superintendent of the school's goals are in line with the goals you've set for the districts and for the missions specific goal one we do agree with one of the board members recommendations to improve the wording and we'll do that administratively and again we feel that these documents allow us to move forward with the accountability and support of the schooling some of your concerns for this contract term and I turned over to Jennifer Mercer to make a phone calls yes good evening president

[00:35:00]
thank you for your time and consideration tonight as you review El Camino Real academies contract and performance framework at Accra we are at K12 school with a strong team and culture that supports and cares deeply for our students and families we recognize your concerns in the importance and urgency of working with our students to increase their academic Proficiency in our committed to making every effort to ensure their success in alignment with our mission we support the whole childhood working to Foster their love of learning investment in their own education and facilitation of skills that will allow them to thrive as they follow their passions and career Dreams by have some of the questions that you had sent to us that I'd like to address briefly and more depths depending on what you would prefer so the first one had to do with the academic growth rate and reading math and science during the

[00:36:00]
we actually within the last 5 years have not given the park exam that was prior to this 5-year contract that we're in the Tamela was used in 2018-19 and then pass that we had the few years of covid where we weren't doing a state assessment and now of course we were with the NASA so it's difficult to pull that that kind of data into the growth rate although I do certainly understand your desire to have sort of a baseline as you're looking at the performance framework so if I can refer to that second question that you have where you were looking for where we stood in the cohorts I did break them out into cohorts on the performance framework because we are K12 school it's a little difficult to try to have one you know here's your percentage of ela proficiency for 13 grade levels all average out so we're trying to look at that in a more realistic way our PCS or build this way

[00:37:00]
well for the same grade bands that you see in the performance framework so broken out in terms of percentages I can go into that for you as far as making the projection with the 5% points of increase again do you want me to go into the specific numbers or what would you prefer I would so with the ELA in the state assessments are K2 band was 13.89% and so if we projected that of course with the 5% points increase it would be 18.89% of the the 326 and again it would be of course 19.88 with the 5 percentage points increase 728 was 22.82 per cent and of course that makes 27.82% in 1912 right again this is a reflection of the state assessment of 11th grade only I will say that it was

[00:38:00]
and trying to triangulate data and pieces like that we did go back and look at our NWA of demonstration of proficiency for the four grade levels together that make up our high school and that's 20% proficient so that is why we had a higher number there projected when you see that inside of the performance framework so and math we have our K2 band was 6.33 per cent again project with 5 is 11.336 was 6.0 per cent projected would be 11 728 would be 5.5% projected will be 10.5% and 9312 was 12.25 5% with a projection of 17.25 percent in the area of Science of course we do not have a great band score

[00:39:00]
22.22% with a projection of 27.22% 728 3/8 ^ 17.65 projected 22.65 again those projections are for the end of this year which we don't have that date again and then 11th grade was 8.33 present with a projection of 13.33% the third question asking about our performance indicators are they achievable I will say that after meeting with you all a few different times we were very clear that our original projections were to high so we have revised those and you see that in your performance framework that we've provided for you we do believe that they are achievable and competitive one of the things that I looked at was the name test results which as you probably know were pretty

[00:40:00]
pretty low this year and reflect I think the pandemic frankly it's one of those indicators that shows how much lower those are the fourth one you were talking about our whether we met substantial progress toward minimum student performance or educational standards so our site is a reports from the Charter office that indicated that we've made substantial progress toward departmental standards of excellence or the student performance standards identified in the current Charter contract the 5th question was regarding the mission specific goal and we certainly understand why you would like to have a little bit of rewarding their made sense and we accepted the suggestion that you've made at the bottom for rewarding it in that fashion I think that would be not a problem to do that and then the last question we had was for the regarding special education and this was the definition of meeting standard and that definition

[00:41:00]
came off of a prior contract that have been approved I did speak with our special education coordinator regarding this and we do understand your question we're happy to reduce those numbers so we were thinking suggesting three for IEPs and two for evaluations because it's an annual piece instead of a semester which is what the site visits tend to be any other discussion or questions answered the questions that we have a phone so I'm sorry you said that you were going to reduce the IEP those out of compliance you're going to reduce it to three and then for the student evaluations I'm sorry I missed it too right okay okay okay and then I know

[00:42:00]
can the the rubric is written by the teachers and so when they're determining what the criteria is to determine proficiency how did they do that like what what is the process to come up with that number cuz I obviously it's not something arbitrary right sorry it's not and we actually have been working with a rubric from Texas that was designed there so the teachers are taking that one and and working with it it's based on the standards across those areas that you know Encompass team so those are all built into there and of course they would have to be meeting that particular standard to get the four on the rubric and then and then it would work its way down and similar to what we're looking at it from so you're so we're looking at the 5% so I know you kind of went what it would look like next year and then you

[00:43:00]
expect that the following year it would be the same percentage and so in 5 years you would have gone up 25% is that what you're hoping for yes we're hoping honestly to be much higher than that but that is that is what our goal is at this point okay so then in 5 years for like English language then you would just be you would be at 48.250% and then math would be at 30.9% or 69.1 not proficient so if I could ask you board member Eric on are you looking at the performance I'm just kind of just yeah okay so the the numbers that I was giving you was the proposed off of the off of the day that we have from the 2122 school year because we don't have this year's data we were trying to find some place that was

[00:44:00]
Napoleon between and that's why when you're looking at the performance framework some of those numbers may be a little closer to that so it may not be that it was 5% this year and 5% next year because again we don't know what the data is yet from this year but after you start into 2324 and you move forward it's always going to be the 5% and I understand that we don't have the 20 I mean you don't have that yet so you don't have those numbers so I was just kind of looking at the you know and mssa numbers of 18.2 proficient for ELA and then the five point nine for math so I was just kind of going off of of that number which is you know as you know I think it's still very concerning to me so I know you said that you were hoping to go much higher than five you know adding five percent

[00:45:00]
we're kind of looking at 5.9% in math and adding like 5% to that and you're still a you know 90% of the children not proficient and that is always going to be concerning I'm sure to all of us so then the only really other question that that I have is if you don't reach these proficiency levels so how long do you want to give yourself so let's say next year you know in 24 you don't get that 5% and it's much lower we're hoping it's going to be much higher but what happens if you if you don't remember as a practical matter what the put your Charter contract that you've been proving tonight says is that

[00:46:00]
if Mr Escobedo and his team at any time during either of his site visits has a concern about how the school is progressing on any of these indicators including academic he would bring that notice of concern to the school the school would have an opportunity to respond to that you all would be copied on that and if at some point the school doesn't address that sufficiently in your opinion or doesn't address it at all even more egregiously you could then move through your Progressive discipline for one of a better word up to and including revocation at some point if you make if you feel that the school needs one of the legal standards for revocation is there anything that you can add to that because you know what I would like to hear what you have

[00:47:00]
we're doing that with a number of schools regarding their financial corrective action plans around their audit so that's a pretty typical process but it's when we don't see the progress and so I feel like these goals and the performance framework and contract will allow us to move forward with that accountability and support so we really kind of have like a year to kind of look at how everything is going so probably this time maybe next year or probably maybe next summer next June when we have a little more information that will be able to really look and see how that goes right is looking is that the soonest that we would be able to see it not a president to members of the boards of this contract is starting July 1st but you know if there are proficiency

[00:48:00]
so I'm going so we will be looking at these assessment results and and talking to each one of our schools around them okay this will be at least getting the ones this summer for the testing that just occurred this past this spring so and then the only I mean the only other thing I would say is you know my sincere concern for for our kids and for academic growth and that is something that the board that is a very important goal for this entire board and as you can see I'm up there and how important that is to to us I would hope that I wish you the best I hope because that will be better for for our kids I hope it doesn't have to get to the point where you know we have to revoke or that I would hope that things are not going good that you yourself would voluntarily you know close to school down to benefit the kids so

[00:49:00]
thank you any other comments I'll just add that I just want to say thank you Doctor Escovedo and school for agreeing to meet and coming up and reviewing the performance framework in a much more realistic manner I am concerned as well it's in my district and I know that the families that are attending are traditionally from my district as well and it is painful to watch and see the low performance it's just unacceptable I mean I think all of us on the school board definitely want to see all of our children get the best possible education that they can have and I understand there's challenges and there's things like that but I mean one of the things that anything that I've learned through going through this governance structure around student outcomes focused is that we all have to

[00:50:00]
stop pretending that we're doing the best that we can if we're not so if we're not doing the best that we can we need to stop pretending and do something else the students really deserve the best education and we have plenty of quality places where our families could could get that and so I'm sincerely going to hope for the best I know that we got to this point and it's not very pretty and I'm sad that we had to get to this point but it's where we are so I'll entertain a motion please I'd like to just know I know we are going to and thank you for working so hard on and we're going to be working hard on a process come July but I do want to know for that meeting there are a few things that

[00:51:00]
come to mind every time Charter renewals come up and it struck me that you all have a a board is that correct it would be helpful I think to have board-to-board communication and and be helpful to know who sits on the board and you know what are the credentials and how have they have your members been selected how do they fit into your vision and in this case especially because you're dealing with such a vulnerable population and it seems to me your board members should be able to bring some knowledge about the kids you serve

[00:52:00]
but I want to hear from them there should be someone from that has is adapted Finance probably be a lawyer so these are thoughts that have come up every time we go through this process and also how how are we this is a challenge how how will Charter Schools embrace our goals and guard rails right and also your approval the evaluation and approval process it seems to me that we should and correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not a contract person but we have somebody here

[00:53:00]
it just struck me that we should have something in writing that that mirrors the evaluation so 51% of monies finances should go to Direct Services is that correct there's there's some percentage I think we're so remember to bring us we're going to get to all of that in the workshop that's planned because there are plenty of I know that part of what the board members are asking for is just that overview of Charter governance in in totality and how that's what are our implications of the authorizer and I know doctor Escobedo and I and Joanna have been talking about you know a lot of the content of what's going to come up there so I think that's you know because I think for the purposes of tonight is really looking at this particular framework for this particular school knowing that we do have an infrastructure and we

[00:54:00]
I have a structure with the with the office to do that continuous loop of review and and I you know I want to trust that we're going to be able to get that I think I think a lot of the things that we've learned through this process is that our process sometimes is not very clean and it needed to be more structured so we learned some things through that and we also I think had an opportunity with the charter schools that we've talked to to impress upon them the focus of the school on student outcomes Focus governance and are responsibility is an authorizer to look at all of our public schools from that framework in terms of how are we doing and how are we actually ensuring quality across the board for all of our students whether they're with our district schools are with our Charter authorized schools and so I I felt from that conversation that that

[00:55:00]
it was definitely a conversation that I think was heard and listen to so but on the on our Workshop that we have will invite our charter schools to let them know we're having that cuz it's going to be an open meeting but also have an opportunity to hear the information that we're getting around our education on this as well so one final question that is pertinent to what was said today we're going to be hopeful and and positive but there was a comment about if goals are not met you go through a notice of concern and then someone use the phrase Progressive

[00:56:00]
what constitutes legal standards for revocation is that I didn't see that President and that's going to be part of our Workshop as well in Spanish with all our projections these conversations to be more realistic about their goals but they are exceeding the 10 years around that okay thank you all right so did I have a motion in a second or not yet I can't remember I've lost track I do not yet okay so I will entertain a motion to

[00:57:00]
okay

[00:58:00]
our next item for discussion in action is consideration of the approval of the amendment to the contract for Mark Armijo Academy Dr Escobedo will be joined by I Believe Miss Aguilar president from 200 students to 400 students this school has intentionally wanted to stay small but the legislature changing this the removing charter schools from the eligible for small school size adjustment they really need to grow to keep some of the resources about 80,000 dollars will have a new executive director next year Sean Morris from RFK currently will replace Monica's executive director and she's retiring I have met with the school to discuss the request in our offices recommend

[00:59:00]
is that you consider an enrollment cap increase of 50 students from 200 to 250 students we feel that this will allow this the school to move forward with attempting to recruit students for additional resources but really not growing too fast they are up for renewal in a couple of years and can request an increase you know at any time Beyond tonight but that would be our recommendation for you tonight to go conservative for this request I'll turn over to Monica good evening thank you president Montoya and board members and superintendent Elder yes original 430 and that was pretty ambitious and yes I am retiring June 30th will be my official last day and I'll be handing over my school my family to Mr Sean Morris and I you guys sent over a few questions

[01:00:00]
so I'm going to go ahead and address those at this time so increase enrollment for us is crucial due to the small school size funding being removed and increased enrollment equals increased funding equals sustainability for our program and our students what sorry Mark Armijo Academy which was formerly newest charter school was founded in 2001 so we were one of the first charter schools here in the Albuquerque area and we have always been a district Charter so we appreciate the support since 2001 we went founded it was a collaboration with ydi and to the state we still have programs at our school through ydi and this day we continue the original Mission of the school to build relationships create small classes and focus on the social emotional needs first are enrollment has increased since

[01:01:00]
pandemic and we currently have a waiting list of 30 students we serve students who need credit recovery and are possibly on the verge of dropping out of high school and of course you're dropping out that leads to many other issues and our students are already dealing with several issues on their own we offer small school sizes with an average of 20 students in regular education classes and an average of 12 students in special education we have about a 35% of special education population currently right now we have a small I'm sorry small group special education so we have inclusion in some of the content areas we registered students who are looking for a second third and sometimes last chance to graduate high school we build relationships to get to know the story of each student this helps all

[01:02:00]
understand the needs that must be met yes socially emotional needs and mental health issues are usually our priority we create a graduation plan with each student this could be a four-year plan but it could also be at 5:00 or a 6-year plan we currently have a night school which is primarily online and 14 students are enrolled we plan on creating a night school that would be in person and provide flexible scheduling for our student population so the increase in enrollment will be in our night school not necessarily our day school a small school size funding is gone and we need sustainability to continue to serve our student population of our school we originally planned to stay at 200 students forever we've truly loved the small size however the removal small school size funding has shifted our mindset

[01:03:00]
and we must eventually hit that magic number of 430 students to maintain our program we do have a 5-year facility plan which includes eventually increasing to 430 students Marco Antonio's have created great relationships with school counselors from traditional APS high schools Rio Grande Atrisco West Mesa Valley in particular those counselors at the schools we first students to Mark Army who need a more personalized smaller learning environment we work closely with other charter high schools and help find the best for all students we are about building relationships with other Educators and families to collaborate on making decisions that are best for all students we as you know we're located

[01:04:00]
Southwest part of Albuquerque so our student population is mainly from the South Valley and west side we have a 95 percent Hispanic population and so we accept all students do not discriminate we are in a highly Hispanic populated area however we recruit throughout Albuquerque and Target all students of every race yes are SAT scores of the students that we want and provide hope for those students to earn a high school diploma those students are our Target population we get the students who have been told over and over they are not proficient we give them hope and expose them to higher education our mission is to work with these students yes the percent

[01:05:00]
just presented are from the SAT and again yes we know they're low the students who registered at Mark Armijo Academy usually come in about 5 and 6th grade level in reading and math however our academic targets that we work closely with Mr Escobedo for the next 5 years focus on our short cycle assessment which is Northwest evaluation NWA each year our goal is to increase by one grade level current data call NWA scores currently in the fall which was about 26.2 percent of our students scored above 10th grade in Reading I mean that's huge like that I was super excited and then 8% score of 10 grade in math so yes or SAT scores are low that is only 11th graders

[01:06:00]
scores similar 26.4 students and this is all students night to 12th grade scored above 10th grade in reading and 11% scored above 10th grade in math we are we have hard-working teachers who every day every period must make adjustments to curriculum to meet the needs of each student it's all about individualized support at our school we have two top positions because I believe one of the questions was what are your top administrative salaries we have an executive director and we also have a principal however now with the new transition we are working with our board on restructuring our organizational structure our student population is considered the most high need and we acknowledge and love them for who they are and where they come from we are accountable by providing hope

[01:07:00]
a high school diploma is obtainable looking at our graduation data as a school we calculate our own we do look at that in a minute but in 2018 19 we had 23 students who registered as true 9th graders 15 of them graduated in 2022 and that's 65% which is you know student stay with us they will graduate however we do we get those students that have that five years and 6 year plan period education department is 77% we are helping the dropout rate the plan for each of our students might not be the norm and that is perfectly okay we provide our students exposure to higher education every student who graduates must apply to higher education and a majority of them CNN we work closely with CNM to provide dual credit and expose them to

[01:08:00]
career opportunities academic proficiency is definitely important and we are working with the public education department on the accelerated learning approach we are part of the new teacher project which provides coaching and modeling to our curriculum team each student who graduates from Marco mijo Academy must complete a portfolio presentation this is a reflection of their personal story which includes a reflective summary of grades attendance short cycle assessments and individual student work in content area this is presented which we have these next week and you're more than welcome to attend to all Markham Academy staff board members and family members I hope I have answered your questions and painted a picture of our wonderful school thank you for your time today okay thank you so much for that any discussion

[01:09:00]
go ahead Colorado okay so I know doctor Escobedo you said just to increase the cap from 200 to 250 but then from what I heard that's not going to really help cuz a lot of this is about you know there is a 30 students that are on a waiting list so it's not 200 students and so it's not going to really help with funding which is a lot of what I just heard was important that you're losing a lot of money because of the small school size funding going away so how are these 50 students how is it going to help and that make go to let me go to you and not to doctors go I'm sorry so ideally it is 431 for several reasons right now it would just right now we have the Esther funding which is really assisting the school in supplementing

[01:10:00]
Whataburger teacher and come increases that have come up everything else the small school size adjustment I'm not sure if you're aware when they faced it out over 4 years this beginning of this last fiscal year was the last year of the phase out so when we've done like analytical like designs on what it needs to look like in order for a school to break even with the overhead cost the Staffing keeping the mission and vision with the small classroom sizes we would break even at around 400 additionally right now we have a really great relationship with Brasa development out in Arizona and they have really supported us they've given us the funding or yeah they've given us the loan for the current facility and land that we're in and they're really looking forward to supporting us in our growth with the master plan and work working with an architect to develop on the vacant land so again ideally to present the

[01:11:00]
the projections of financials it would be at 400 that we would like to go over the next three years but right now I understand at 4:50 we would get sorry 2:50 we would have enough to help cover us in a full-time evening program but ideally again we would like to be at the 40430 president Montoya board members also with the increase in the evening program that would bring in additional money to help for the next few years as well because enrollment increase the enrollment is decreasing but yet you think that you can increase yours and so I just I'm wondering how you think that can really happen when we're not seeing that

[01:12:00]
that is a very valid point and since the pandemic I know during the you know we're still independent but since we went online and many schools lost students we actually maintained in the year after we came back that is when aren't enrollment just truly went up and I truthfully think we offer Credit Recovery now flexible scheduling high school students that were behind you know we know they left high school we didn't know where they went a lot of them are coming back now and looking for other options because they are behind and that is okay with us because we will get them graduated maybe not in four years but in six or seven we create a program that meets the need of each student and I know there are other and if you could just kind of tell me this there are other schools that

[01:13:00]
do that do what you do that have these students you know we know RFK does we know Albuquerque Talent does and Gordon bernardo's there are other schools that do the same thing so what makes you so so different and I grew up in the area like sisters went to Alamosa and so that I mean I know where you are it's my old neighborhood so I don't know if we're all so different you know we are charter schools are all very unique each charter school has their own mission but in the end I think we collaborate with all of those charter schools that you just mentioned because sometimes the students are schools not the best place for a student so I'll call over to RFK or I'll call over to Gordon Bernal hey can we take the student and family to go meet with you so it's all about collaboration building relationships to see where that student will best be successful I think that's what makes us unique

[01:14:00]
cuz we're not about hey we want 900 students because we're all about the money and this and that we want students to make and families to make the choice that is best for them and sometimes it's not our school and that is okay and then I mean bottom line is you you heard we are here to improve student outcomes that's what that's where we're headed that's what we expect and so when we're you know we're looking at you know your proficiency levels you know when you have almost 92% that aren't proficient in ela and 100 not in math and I know you mentioned the 20% as well but that is still pretty abysmal I mean and I think our kids deserve and they can I grew up in that area I know what they can do and they are capable no matter where they've come from it's a matter of all the adults really believing that and having that kind of

[01:15:00]
and so I think that somehow and I know you're going to be leaving and coming in is getting that mindset that your Educators can go I know these kids can do better than this they can I know I know I know I know they can and I believe that and I think you all just need to believe that but to you know to say we want to put more kids in there right now to some of that changes its you know I hesitate because of that and I'm always hopeful you know I'm always hopeful but you I'm sure are as concerned about the children and those academic outcomes as well just have a quick question because you had mentioned you know this the Myriad of schools and you know you're in my district so we've got RFK we've got marker Mijo

[01:16:00]
kids that are really you know struggling as well and you know also with APS we have school on Wheels so I know that there's all of that coordination has there ever been any thought to you all that are doing this you know Gordon Bernal you guys have this Niche because it is an important part I mean I think there are definitely students that for whatever reason have dropped out and need to drop back in and dropping in is not easy because sometimes it does require a lot emotionally and it does require the right setting to do that and sometimes our schools are good for it and sometimes they're not I get that part and what we definitely want to see is students recovered credits and we want to see them graduate and we want them to to do that I have had a chance to sit in on the portfolio presentation and I know you all are doing a lot

[01:17:00]
when it comes to that career Readiness career exploration so there's a lot but have you guys considered as a network of Charters to create a network so that it's that 400 cap could be met that way instead of this in these each individual schools because what's happening is you guys are just competing against each other and it's hard for us as authorizers because we're you know it becomes this competitive piece so I'm just putting that out there because it the pie isn't getting bigger and I think the student population is going to always I think that student population is always going to be there I mean I think it's just reflective and I think RFK has a special Niche I've been to your graduation it's beautiful it's wonderful I love seeing you know the students feeling really proud of the fact that they've been able to accomplish it whether it was in for five or six years so I'm just curious have you all

[01:18:00]
I never thought of something like that we have not because I mean it is I mean it's like the district is having to right size you all are having to right size and it pains me that you have to change your mission around a small group only so that you could chase a different Avenue and so that part's really painful to hear because I think you'll lose you'll lose that niche of what you have to and so that that part is really it's a little scary from that perspective but I I know I'm just throwing something out there but I was just wondering about that any other comments go ahead or remember Peter said so on the one hand I have great respect for Mr Moore will be in good hands with him but I also share some real concerns because when I look at

[01:19:00]
6-year graduation rates our schools across the board have very comfortable 6-year graduation rates for year and 5 year I know your students come in and I appreciate the fact that you do focus on the population of students that's your make up your mission but so do we and it becomes harder and harder for us to fulfill those needs and when I look at schools like school on Wheels and Freedom High and the other alternative were able to offer a real array of possibilities for students but it gets harder and harder as we compete for students and the whole point of Charters when

[01:20:00]
the the charter the ability to do that it's with the understanding that you can provide something that other schools can't and so I I really have issues with with the desire to grow for a lot of the same reasons the board member president voting to increase your population during your presentation you misspoke but you made the comment that you said every student must apply for higher ed and I would hope that you're giving other

[01:21:00]
Avenues if they choose to look at trade schools and other opportunities you know for the future that's not one path absolutely yes that was a quick answer yes okay thank you it's a post-secondary yeah I'll look for a post-secondary credentials any other comments go ahead remember Jackson so what you're asking us tonight is is a 50 enrollment okay so that's really the issue that's on the table for us right now and I'm hoping that you've heard a lot of feedback I guess I should both of you that you heard a lot of feedback as we continue through this process it's it's interesting because my thought was when you said you wanted to increase to 438 I think was the the magic number my first thought was shoot that means that APS is really feeling all of our kids

[01:22:00]
if if that many kids have to go get credit recovery and then that means that we aren't doing our job so it's almost I understand where the number came from find fiscally financially and yet what a what a disservice to our kids if an additional $238 kids are failing out of need that recovery from APS it sounds like what you're doing is offering a fantastic service for those that need it and I I appreciated your presentation but I'm hesitant about the 438 number but that's not the question that's on the table right now the question that's on the table right now is an enrollment up to 50 it sounds like you have people on the waiting list right

[01:23:00]
now that can get that can fill that it sounds like you have a need for an evening school that this can be filled I think that there are a lot of questions that need to be answered before we address the 438 but I think I would be comfortable right now with an increase of 50 to kind of cover what you need right now but it's I think there's going to need to be some more conversation before we before we get further down that road I'll just voice I have the same feelings that have been articulated already what and I also understand that not all charter schools are equal you're dealing with a hard population what did catch my attention was your evening School

[01:24:00]
and I'll just leave it at that that that I also really really like President Yolanda Montoya Cordova's suggestion that their needs you need to explore partnership with some of these other schools but I that evening school May giveaway no secrets and I think there's a way to motivate them by way of the trades

[01:25:00]
I need to learn their math skills right and in a very and applied manner Academy to add the 50 second okay so we have clarification have more kids going into school that's failing them Danielle Gonzales yes Barbara Peterson know this will help you

[01:26:00]
it's our next item for discussion is a presentation of the Albuquerque Public Schools strategic plan and superintendent Elder has the floor and excited to hear this are you going to go down there is that what you doing and I think we have some guests with you tonight it's good to see you so thank you just give me one minute period

[01:27:00]
I am not lost it and I have lost it okay well that's okay I don't start so I do have a team of people with president and members of the board were happy to show you our initial run at the Strategic plan and and get us to where I think we're going to have a much better understanding of what's going to happen over the next five years and so I have brought some people to support and have been supportive of the work and I'd really like to thank our compatriots from iTunes and I'm going to let them introduce himself so I don't mess up any names and I believe you're going to start hi there my name is Camilla Lopez I'm a chief schools officer attitude education partners and I've been supporting superintendent Elder and his wonderful team many of whom are here today to support the wonderful children about cookie I'm falling New Mexico from town today was much easier than it can be nice to see you all

[01:28:00]
good evening everyone Chief strategy officer with a tune and have been working to support superintendent Elder and the team in this process and excited to share it with you this evening and good to see you again we're off to a good start here so I do believe that what we're going to do tonight and then I will cover the Strategic plan priorities initiatives and sequence as well as the clothes in the next steps and then we'll take questions I think you can like all the way through that would be great thank you so

[01:29:00]
we as a superintendent Elder said have had the great pleasure of supporting the aps cabinet in the development of the Strategic plan presented tonight they have been very thoughtful and adamant throughout the process about how do we make sure our work Works in tandem with the work you all been doing around your board goals and guardrails and through that have developed this sort of way of trying to explain all the pieces of the puzzle together that I think superintendent and Elder shared with you previously but just to recognize that the plan that you and I'm just going to share about our process to create it is the work that hopefully will lead to the board goals over the five years and that very much driven by the directions of your guard rails and then understanding how far progress is being made through the interim goals and guardrails are wrong with other measures that will help track implementation as things go along the way this was a four phases

[01:30:00]
best that we initiated with you all are partnership with APS but then I'm working in partnership with the cabinet over four phases the first deciding again which we presented to you previously when we came on the organizational diagnostic but just to raise again the stage around understanding the rules of all the stakeholders the second phase was when we did a lot of analysis of data classroom visits and engagement with stakeholders through focus groups and interviews and meetings with different councils the largest phase was the strategic planning phase where we spent several months working with The Advisory Group and I'll share more details on along with the rest of the community really supporting the cabinet as many of them here to Think Through what would be the best plan to achieve the goals you all outlined and then through that work also there's been a lot of details for plans to around who will work and what that will look like over time

[01:31:00]
and then phase 4 is is where we sit now as the as the we've supported the cabinet and start anything through what resources are needed to support the implementation of the plan along with how do you communicate it publicly and also how do they make sure that they're tracking progress along with your interim goals and guard rails and any other measures to help track impact overtime next slide through this process we did have the great Fortune Camilla and I to engage alongside the cabinet with many stakeholders first through the Advisory Group this was not a process that was billed sort of behind doors without input and just want to reiterate that we met with The Advisory Group that was a mixed group of stakeholders several times we also engaged with focus groups at two times and then planning process for to understand strengths and challenges then in reaction to the emerging ideas from the cabinet in terms of student groups family groups and teachers and school leaders we also had the

[01:32:00]
I need a games directly with the student advisory Council the Martinez Yazi Council the tribal council the teachers union the principles of Representative group along with other organized District staff groups to make sure that what the plans were being sort of developed what could be responded to and to understand the level of resonance or questions or what other information should be included along with also a set of interviews next slide a lot of that stakeholder thank you a lot of that feedback just to read it remind you all again as one of the anchors to help the cabinet think about the Strategic plan was that organizational diagnostic which we presented to you the last time I was here and then that as a reminder that included a significant performance data analysis along with classroom visits to schools across the district and Analysis of those constituent perspectives where we ident

[01:33:00]
the reflection process and next the advisory committee just to let you all last time we met with you is sort of just beginning and so we met with this group four times over the planning process fundamentally to get their insights and reactions to the plans that were merging through the considerations with the steering committee and you can see here just a sample of the objectives that occurred at each meeting where there was opportunities where we brought documents for reaction created opportunities for discussion when back came back and back and forth all the time trying to document what we heard from those conversations what actions the cabinet chose to take in reaction to those and what were the proposed changes along the way and we recently just closed that meeting about a week or so ago or two weeks ago now and it was an excellent group to get to

[01:34:00]
thank you all for your recommendations to for participants in that forum and lastly just to one more slide around process it may be clear but I think it's important to note that as ideas came out of the steering committee that were informed really not just from the work of the the organizational diagnostic but we also reflected on with the cabinet and all they brought to the table what they heard through all your listings in the fall and the board survey results which we helped sort of review and analyze to to check how is that aligning with what you're hearing from the focus groups that we engage in so all of that great work really did start off a reflection cycle that led to coming up with ideas bringing it to stakeholders more reflection and ideally a continuous cycle and which way the deliverables and plans are starting to map out that the cabin is already really thought about how to continue to do that in the Years forward to that it's an ongoing process

[01:35:00]
best to build respond with the community and think through the best way to move forward as things will come up and things adapt as the plan goes so this cycle was key to the design process and I believe that it's very much a core of what the cabinet wants to take forward and superintendent Elder goes through some of the plan this living breathing document it was such a pleasure for Dina and I to partner with superintendent Elder and his team again most of them are here this evening it's not always an easy thing to look at feedback from many constituents and to be able to ask yourself in the room the hard questions and to consider some of the things that folks are saying and the way that they wrestled with those questions and made some hard decisions and have to continue to wrestle as the

[01:36:00]
gratitude to all of them no all right thank you very much so thank you I wanted to open this section again with this slide it's really to reiterate how my team is spent time working in response to the board's Vision through the development of the Strategic plan we do see that the Strategic plan is the vehicle to highlight what essential areas Administration in partnership with schools will focus significant energy on over the next five years and while the plan does not reflect all the amazing work or district office and schools are working in tandem to accomplish it does elevate where are attention must be placed to make meaningful progress towards your goals so this is how we sort of laid out I showed that to you a couple weeks ago next slide

[01:37:00]
based on the process that Dina highlighted the first step the administration took and response to the board's goals and Community feedback was to land on a set of four strategic priorities and we've talked about these every time I come forward but you know clear expectations focuses on the work we and Leadership must do to articulate the clear Direction and set of expectations for our school communities priority to riggers instruction focuses on providing better more comprehensive support to school leaders and Educators so that students have access to high-quality instructions specifically in literacy Ela in math 3 engage students leans into reflecting and building better systems at the Central School in classroom level to support engage students that they are eager to attend school and Thrive there and then priority for lastly is responsive and coordinated systems to take a hard look at our central office processes and will require us to build new systems

[01:38:00]
you're more responsive to needs a family in schools next slide this is a again something I've shown you before I think it captures the idea that the initiatives within the Strategic plan are designed to drive impact towards the Bulls goals while adhering to the guard rails so each of the four priorities along with their initiatives which I'll discuss more deeply in a moment We Believe will drive impact toward the board goals especially as we as an Administration team adhere to the guard rails you have set forth two of the priorities clear expectations and responsive systems We Believe will lay a foundation of a healthy district and support the success of the plan overall well rigorous instruction and engage students will have a direct impact on the board goals over the course of the five year plan now share the initiatives we have identified reach the priorities so if you will

[01:39:00]
so Priority One clear expectations and I'm not going to read this to you and we did send it yesterday and there's two reasons I'm not going to read it to you one is the incredibly boring and two they made the type so small for me if I wanted to read it I couldn't so I had to blow up my notes so clear expectations we have five initiatives all right the first will focus on communicating the board goals and strategic plan and meaningful ways throughout the entirety of the aps Community the second will rely on leveraging the feedback we gathered through the board survey and Community listening sessions on our vision for students to ensure we have high expectations for all staff and students through our foundational documents and have Clarity of what we hope our students are able to do upon graduation the third will be to implement a robust system to track progress and hold us accountable to doing the work of the Strategic plan I really am excited

[01:40:00]
so all this great visioning by the board and planning in fact gets tracked and monitored over the next five years 1.4 will be led by Dr Segura and will focus on clarifying expectations and management for our principals given the pivotal role they play between central office and our District's classrooms and lastly 1.5 focuses on determining in partnership with partnership with stakeholders what decisions will be made centrally versus at the school level and insurance throughout the decision-making process and we have decided to focus our primary energy on the following Levels by providing on the use of instructional materials

[01:41:00]
concept and similar improving literacy and language instruction across all grade levels as well all six and total of these initiatives will focus on partnering with school staff to develop a vision for what excellent instruction and support looks like creating tools and resources and then rolling them out district-wide in tandem with ongoing support coaching and collaboration are intent is to better address the needs of all students do this work but especially or Martinez Yazzie students as identified in the board goals additionally we need to rethink our Central support and school-based delivery of services to special education students and bring greater consistency to grading expectations across the school system so that expectations are equally rigorous for student mastery of content across core subject area for engaged student priority we have identified a set of initiatives designed to

[01:42:00]
improved School in classroom cultures that they're vibrant and enriching embed social emotional learning tools and content into the student experience more effectively reduce chronic absenteeism more effectively address discipline challenges through more effective use of restorative practices increased student voice and ensure students know where to access Mental Health Resources and expand our support there where possible the next slide and lastly we have a set of initiatives for responsive and coordinated systems that we will lead to work on rethinking and improving our central office Communications and collaboration structures so schools receive clear and consistent information and get the same answer and

[01:43:00]
it was Ruckus Applause if I can say so there is intent looking at making big improvements and how we engage family so that authentically meets their needs especially related to language access not just from central office but at the school level as well as you know we're designing a new student based budgeting system along with an enterprise resource management system so we can deploy resources to schools in more efficient and effective ways listening to the needs of our community on campus safety and generating Solutions and finally improving the Technology support to schools and no we can't do this all at once you've got a few clicks here except holders to consider the right sequence for when we tackle each initiative from our teams in Central Schools in our classrooms Real Change is Going

[01:44:00]
take more planning testing and then launching District wide over the 5 years we also have to be mindful as we go how much we are expecting from our principals and teachers in particular it's a lot and I continue to remind the principles we don't expect them to have everything prepared by the end of next year and you'll see the sequencing here in a minute currently we have created a sequence for all the initiatives across the four priorities some probably will say we're moving too slow some may say too fast but I do know is that we have very carefully thought it through and we'll spend the bulk of the coming year doing additional engagement and planning with our stakeholders many working groups to design and build improvements we want to last not just rush something out that people don't support but I'm excited that we have a process to continuous plan and reflect on our progress and make

[01:45:00]
across initiatives as needed all right so let's look at this and again I won't read this to you you got a chance to look at it but here you can see the sequence for Clear expectations there we plan to do work through this summer and in the early fall on most of the initiatives given their focus on expectation setting at a district level the next slide is the sequencing for rigorous instruction really calls for thorough math and the coming year with improved supports and expectations rolled out in advance for 2425 next slide literacy and language support we move a bit faster in grades 9 through 12 as the district has already been working with stakeholders

[01:46:00]
next slide we hope to make thoughtful moves and modifications for restorative practice sooner as we had some groundwork there already which we plan to spend more time in the coming school year on improving expectations and support around school culture SEL and reducing absenteeism the absenteeism in the near term one of the things that you'll hear us talk a lot about is that SEL is not confined to the counseling office it's not a plug-in lesson done for 10 minutes a day it is something that has to be embedded and I think a number of our teachers as they become more comfortable with some of the techniques in the box and the language will really start to adopt that into their teaching the next slide lastly internally at central office we've already begun somewhere in terms of revamping our budgeting and our resources on campus safety and we want to make sure we make meaningful improvements in other areas

[01:47:00]
play the start of 2425 school year she leads us to next steps and that's a double click their cell oops period we have the resources

[01:48:00]
in terms of Staffing materials and finances to support high-quality implementation moving forward and the except obviously is beginning to implement the initiatives by face so with that that is the 10,000 ft overview for the board obviously there's a lot of elements in terms of just real basic work steps that we are working on in terms of our teams and that our initiative leads are continuing to develop but that is the plan over the next five years and it gives you a sense of how we're going to try to get to your goals at established in December okay thank you thank you for that and I appreciate you sending the military's on this is a discussion item and so I'll just open it up to the board in terms of anyone

[01:49:00]
anybody have any comments go ahead board member Gonzalez thank you so I just wanted to start by expressing appreciation to you superintendent Elder and the cabinet and the team from a tune but also the whole Community who participated in part of this and all of this rather I know it was a large Endeavor huge Endeavor and that we're really just on the front end so with that just wanted to say appreciation Kudos I know this wasn't easy but I have a lot of optimism and excitement for where we're heading and in particular just your acknowledgment of the relationship between this broader strategic plan and the vision and values of the community which articulated in our goals and guardrails so just tremendous appreciation and excitement and optimism and I hope you feel good about it too how about a quick sort of clarifying question maybe it's clarifying maybe it's a little bit more complex I didn't see I saw

[01:50:00]
prioritization and strategies to engage with families and I didn't necessarily see or maybe I missed it and started the quick overview and the tiny font strategies or focus prioritization of engaging with sort of broader community and I asked that particularly in the context of sort of community schools and how we as a system think about our role vis-a-vis the community lots of conversation as to whether a community owns the schools or the schools own the community and how we really engaged to make sure that each School in represents the vision and values of that local community so just wanted to get a sense of sort of the role of community schools in particular and the role of Engagement with Community engagement with the city engagement with the county and other partners and the last piece of that is just sort of drafting on the other conversation that we had earlier this evening around Charters and a lot of that convers

[01:51:00]
rather than community and the acknowledgment that that we as a community share these students and I think it requires a pretty clear theory of action for what that looks like in terms of how we collectively serve those students and make sure that we're meeting all needs whether their students attending APS traditional district schools or Charter Schools so I think like I said maybe it's clarifying maybe it's a deeper question but just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the relationship between the system that is APS and the broader Community but particularly Community Schools so what I would say to that board member of us is that we are in the process initially of just simply developing a communication plan just to present this right and it's got to look different than our traditional manner of doing aboard presentation put in on the web Senate a few slides out to people it's a multi-month process

[01:52:00]
I would say that part of your question would be answered in some of the details that are not provided in this more high-level presentation the and there is a sort of a difference with the community schools and a traditional school because the community school has some advantages in terms of working with families and knowing who are the key players in a community we all know that they're mavens in any organization and if you can get to the maven your story gets out and I think the community school coordinators in the community schools have the ability to make that connection for us and so we need to make sure we target those schools I think clearly we can even use the coordinators as we bring them in and help them to understand the plan with the principals traditional schools like I said I think that we're going to have one thing that came back from our principles is until they get

[01:53:00]
really good grip on this they don't want me to just hand them the PowerPoint and say go talk to your community so we're going to have to try to figure out District resources that can support the principles as they do that that may mean having schools join you know so we don't just have one school at a time because try to do 143 of these might be overwhelming but it is part of that planning process so I I do think that even after we get past the initial communication we're going to have to and this is part I think of the systems development and trying to improve communication between the district and the schools as we do begin to look at interim goals that date is collected it's going to align real well with what the associates and we were looking at

[01:54:00]
data they can continue to work directly with the schools and say Here's what your data shows this is what the board's going to see how do you answer it you know so that we're not just there's got to be communication coming up just as much as it is communication coming down so that's an element of it I guess I appreciate that I think it was maybe more of a philosophical question how we're going to communicate the Strategic plan but through this process what change if any is there in thinking about the relationship between our schools and our communities and sort of potential movement to make every school similar to a community school model more engaged with the community is more engaging of families and partners of the pillars of Community Schools so I would if my opinion and this is now we're I think the Community Schools do a great job

[01:55:00]
what they do I think the non-community schools are given short Thrift in that I think they are also Community Schools without the same resources that the community schools have unless there is a significant uptick in funding for that I don't know that we're going to be able to make everybody a traditional community school with all the sports but I do believe that our schools in many ways are already providing some of the services that Community Schools offer that's rare that a school doesn't do some sort of food drive or some sort of oatmeal drive or something to involve the community it's gotten trickier in terms of some of the things we used to do like having fairs and festivals and opening the doors to the community because there's a school safety aspect of it and so I think what I would be looking at philosophically at the high school level we used to have a lot of connections

[01:56:00]
businesses and I could see schools beginning to take the concept of maybe the PTA could be expanded to include a community element and I do think there's some ways we could work around that and at least open it but it will require some training of the principles one thing we know is a community schools are different than traditional schools and the way we train our principles has to be different so it's going to require some work in terms of getting that leadership up to a place where they can do the same type of work and are comfortable inviting community members and identifying the right community members you need people that are going to come in and listen and they may disagree but at least be supportive of change and try to work out Solutions so I like the concept I don't think it's just flashed out but philosophically I see where that can grow very neatly in this

[01:57:00]
thank you I would add that I think as part of community schools in just the framework itself utilizing the pillars of Community Schools as a Central Foundation is the enabling condition that you'll see here that would establish the condition to be able to reach the goals that are in the Strategic plan so you like the framework of Community Schools as a whole and looking at the pillars of Community Schools would help in several of these items to be able to leverage the idea of community schools in moving forward to reach the goals additionally in the responsive and coordinated systems I think that we probably could word it better to make sure that that implies that we're meeting the needs of the community and that it's a interactive relationship between the district and the community to make sure we're working together to meet the needs

[01:58:00]
so in partnership with school leaders I think it's also in looking at how we partner with the community to make sure that the student needs of the community as a whole is matching how we are responding and coordinating systems because when our systems aren't clear to the community then it's hard for them to know how they can either help us or how they can get support from us so making that a foundation as far as the establishing what the framework is and how we are setting expectations is a priority enabled in order to make sure that the community knows how to access or to partner with us and I can tell you now so I just been informed that if you look at 4. 2 4 5

[01:59:00]
role of twice in Charters and how we think about growth and are not growth or did that come up is that fall under one of these priorities or initiatives so bored present board member Gonzalez we had a long talk with and with the cabinet and with the tuned over where we would put that work and they recognize that it's a lot of heavy lift that we're looking at and how we repurpose and we look at things at the what we did was we embedded it into 4.3 because it was looking at how we are financially viable and how we're adopting the needs its so it's built in myself and Miss albertaco are working on it within 4.3 but we've it's interesting you bring it up because we've toy right you used to be at an initiative and then we moved it into another one and it came out so that's that work of adapting schools

[02:00:00]
school choice has been incorporated into the action steps of 4.3 thank you I really appreciate the connection of the community schools and one of the things that's exciting is that everyone is growing everyone's driving to move forward and one of the ways that reflected in the community school work is that it's expanded from four pillars to 6 key practices and I think that when we look at it it's real clear how that Community Schools aren't meant to be you know just the support of engaging community and community in the broadest sense including staff

[02:01:00]
open students including families including the surrounding community and so I think that I think that there's the potential of really making a very Dynamic and meaningful relationship in that work if we really look at it with that lens and I know we've talked about doing a little special session for Community School update and I hope that that can happen because I think there's expertise in the hands of ABC that can really benefit us and that we need to really share with them they're just a couple of things that you know I have been I keep saying at this point in some way shape or form and so there's a part of me that looks

[02:02:00]
at this initiative and goes been there done that and I can guarantee that they're going to be lots and lots and lots of stuff people who look at it and go been there done that whether it's specific practice or commitment or goal setting and I've already heard from people that they're feeling like they're going backwards to the worst of No Child Left Behind with this on simply test score without looking at the underlying practice that goes along with it and I think there's a real name is have been for years and years and I think that with the girls and Guardians and with the Strategic plan there's the potential of making something more meaningful but there's also the potential of it not

[02:03:00]
being more meaningful depending on how it's implemented you know rigor rigor mortis stiffness it's the same root word and so when I I am real concerned about looking at things like if I can find the rigorous instructions culturally assessment guidance professional development systems that can be implemented very very badly because what pacing guide say is that regardless of who your students

[02:04:00]
and I'm not talking about lowering expectations I'm saying I'm talking about what real teaching and learning is and having that relationship of knowing who your students are and what they needed a given point in time to make curriculum reflective of who they are that's engaging in student-centered I mean there's nothing in this as I read it that has any implication of being student-centered that I'm sorry but I'm going to have to just go yes I love what you're saying just pacing guys does not mean good teaching it really doesn't and you we know that I mean I do I'm a strong advocate of standards and I'm a strong advocate of of teachers having the time and the collaborative support of really grappling with what that means for their students but I

[02:05:00]
I'm real concerned that if we talked about culturally relevant curriculum and then don't talk about student-centered curricula and ways of you know we've launched into grading for equity and there's an overlay of what teaching and learning looks like and what assessment looks like and I am somewhat disappointed that there's not more reflection of that in here and it is a learning process I will share some optimism that we can move in that direction but I think we need to be very conscious of that the on the surface right now it doesn't reflect that and so I think we need to be careful that we make this that we set our goals to be the richness of our students

[02:06:00]
it's not the goal of matching some curricula that says here's the grade level we are committed to grade level instruction and here's how you're going to pace yourself to get that done is we have been there done that and it doesn't make the students really where they are and what they need and that is not to lower expectations just a quick response that it came out very clearly from the teacher groups and not always is no such thing as 100% right but there are a large number of teachers who said we really need some support for new here we're not really sure what we're trying to do a little confused I used to have patience you say been there done that yet because sometimes things were working and then we kind of stepped away from one of the biggest problems in APS I think go to last 20 plus years I've been around 30 years of the initiative to get something going and then we see the next you know squirrel and we Chase it and and we get

[02:07:00]
none of these elements by themselves will solve our problem it has to be part of a bigger system so you know changing the school start times it's going to help but it's not going to solve the problem and it's going to make things hard on some people right having a pacing guide you're a veteran teacher you may not need that but you're in your first three years you may really appreciate having something to give you a sense of how to get through it and as you evolve as a teacher if we are continually professionally develop you and to support you you may stop leaning on that as much but we just need some basic elements and so some of this plan really does reflect some basic elements I you know I know some teachers out there that are like I told you I've been to every school in that I found somebody who's a Superstars too much right but remember

[02:08:00]
appreciate having some of these tools available and then have somebody who can explain how you can supplement and make it better so cultural responsive teaching is not going to happen overnight it's got to be something we train and talk about what new materials in get materials and cultural responsive sometimes we talk about the good old days forget that sometimes they work good not always sometimes we did have good old days and so maybe some of those elements will work if it's done properly I understand I have some real issues with it it's like it's just a retreat of reading first there's virtually nothing in it that hasn't been there phonics is if we hadn't been teaching phonics it's it's the

[02:09:00]
and we let them talk to each other and and do that level of collaboration all of those tools are helpful but that's the part that we don't always do well the implementation has got to mean teachers being able to talk to each other about their teaching and how their students are learning and respect them for the knowledge that they bring to the table and I don't think I don't think Scott we disagree with each other elements that I won't work all by itself it's it any element by itself is got to be part of the other elements and it's still always comes back to can you build a relationship with the kid can you create a safe classroom or the child really wants to learn

[02:10:00]
and and respect you and part of what the kids were saying is they felt that they weren't being challenged they want to be challenged more and that's that idea of how do we establish high expectations and then give the teachers the tools to make sure the kids can reach those expectations and sometimes it's making sure those teachers have the basics that they need in that challenge just being able to think about real stuff it's being it's having content that's right that's why teachers are allowed to supplement and bring in real stop finally there's not a single person in this District apartment so I apologize

[02:11:00]
well I am I thought I was going to have to pull up my inner cheerleader but thankfully showed up to be the cheerleader for the Strategic plan Scott I appreciate your comments on the comments that you just made cuz we need to remember based on the organizational diagnostic that only 30% of our kids are actually doing great level work like this is a document that is going to be a game changer and I love what you said about sometimes a good old days are the good old days like maybe there are some things that we used to do that actually worked and I'm thrilled that and I'm not crying just have peanut butter

[02:12:00]
I'm so excited to be sitting here to have a strategic plan and thank you for for doing the work I love the entire cabinet is sitting here right that is a show of strength this is the cabinet is sitting here with the superintendent to say we support this and this is this is different this isn't we've been here we've done that I've gone back to look this is new this is great this is going to set our kids on a path of success that they deserve I I read this I thought it was fantastic I I I'm sure that there are nuances that

[02:13:00]
I just wanted to thank thank you thank you for putting in the work cabinet thank you for putting in the work superintendent Elder thank you for putting in the work I know that this was a lot this is going to be a game-changer this needs to be celebrated this needs to be implemented as soon as we can we go back to you my my Sparkle fingers and I'm so excited for this thank you and this is going to be all right go down to the end of the desk board member Romero I don't want to repeat what's already been said but obviously we're ready you know to move the move forward and be able to do what we need to do and just again ditto on the hard

[02:14:00]
behind us and everybody all had to collaborate with and try to in my opinion not do what's always been done you know really try your best to switch it up and do something what's best for the district so you guys know this I'm ready so you want to move up some of the timelines like you guys know I'm like let's go yeah yeah sorry I respect that I mean you know how you know Barbara and I think in a lot of what she said I just agree with I I don't think that I know it's important I would you know look at it a little bit again maybe some things need to be taken out maybe some things needed to need to be to be out of I just don't want

[02:15:00]
you know cuz it's the same thing that I would have pointed out about pacing guides I just don't want that to become a crutch to some of our teachers which I think that it has been and then it's like this learned helplessness they don't know what to do without it and that's not what we want the best teaching doesn't come from I just saw when things just didn't started not going well and this when we started focusing on everybody's going to be on the same page in the same book on the same and that was not good teaching that's not just be real I want to that is not the intent there's no scripted curriculum coming that says on day one day they want to teach just shows how to get through the school year with a set of

[02:16:00]
and and I mean I saw the word consistency in there which I understand is important but I guess it depends on maybe how you Define consistency also right so this is is this really the first because you know me and you know spelling errors and grammatical errors and this is not the night to do it but there's going to be somebody's going to like edit this right cuz there was a lot of stuff in there that needed to kind of be erected so I'm sure that will get done I'm sure Courtney did too so some things were hard a little hard for me to understand because there were words and I didn't know exactly what what you all meant the I mean I'm hoping that we're just really

[02:17:00]
play focusing on you know what division is for APS you know what what are mission is what are values are what are beliefs are you know what what are inspiration is and that were really focusing on our kids that that's what we really see here and so in the rigorous instruction I really want to see that that when I read it that's just what I just want to see this is just all about kids and I do understand that the kids did say they want to be challenged and that they felt that they weren't so I understand why you know we're putting what you needed to put into the rigorous instruction and I'm not opposed to that it's just maybe some of the wording make it happen or and then the other thing is just if you could kind of go over for me on

[02:18:00]
creating consistency and Grading expectations across the district can you like explain to me what that means I mean is that changing adult Behavior Behavior because some teachers depending where they teach might feel that they have to lower their expectations which is not we want to get away from that obviously I would say that and I'm Joyce would come forward it would probably help but what we have seen is that expectations oftentimes are different and sometimes there's a reason for that you know perhaps a child was out sick for two weeks and so something had to be modified right but we want to make sure that what kids are learning in one area of town is the same material at least the same content and have to be taught the same way

[02:19:00]
the same content and that they're gauged pretty much the same that there is an equal expectations you say you don't want lower expectations that means you have to grade with the set of expectations that may be higher or lower that has been used in other places so if you want to add to that so first that I could address the scope and sequence because I know that that's that's scary for a lot of people and I'm sorry for president I look at the the development of scope and sequence is an opportunity to engage teachers this is not going to be work that's done and isolation at the district level this is going to be work that that is going to be dependent on teachers who are in the classroom to develop it organically and uniquely with the instructional materials that we've adopted and this will provide

[02:20:00]
1380 Express to have great conversations around the rigor of a standard and how to keep a standard at grade level but still Provide support for students who have unique needs and aren't able to access it with just layer one instruction and might need some interventions or differentiations so I think it's the the process will be as beneficial as the product so as far as our grading project again the focus will be on that opportunity to engage teachers in what students should know and be able to do and have those collaborative conversations about backwards planning understanding the standard what does that look like if a student was proficient or mastered the standard what would the what would they be able to do and so in the work backwards to

[02:21:00]
what activities could be available in a line to that and then how will we communicate to students in a rubric on where they are in attainment of that standard so what does Mastery look like and so again I think this grading project is another opportunity to engage teachers in Rich conversations around with students should be able to do and I just say having been a teacher Mastery often looks different from what child to another child though even though they're in the same classroom they may be learning the same you know same standard it just it looks different and I would trust the teachers are going to know what that looks like so that's just on the side there but oh nevermind we have teachers across the entire district and so what will be really exciting is that those

[02:22:00]
pictures from different zones in different schools will bring those perspectives together so that it's not one assessment it could be differentiation content product and process right and so I I think I agree with you 100% it's it's not a multiple choice test that that will determine Mastery it might be a product it might be an essay it might be an explanation or a presentation might be a conversation with your teacher then you know they get a like you just you know they get it observation and talking tells you a lot about what what your kids know but I have heard like what's superintendent Elder alluded to I just talked to a couple of parents a couple of weeks ago who grandmother was it was a teacher but they moved to the child out of

[02:23:00]
their neighborhood into a school because it was a Bilingual School and they said that the expectations were way way lower and they expected it to be the same they would be learning the same thing that they were learning at their neighborhood school and so they loved the fact that they're in a Bilingual School but the fact is that they're probably going to move them back to the neighborhood school and lose that so I think this would probably help to keep them because they want that bilingual experience and then they want that culture that they're getting out the school so I think this will be very helpful and hopefully keep some of those you know students were their parents really do want them to be but they feel they're not getting the same exact teaching as they were at their neighborhood school so I'm hoping this will that's a lot to ask for I know in a document you know it's

[02:24:00]
but thank you for your hard work and whoever wants the edits I'll be happy to sit with you I didn't take this opportunity to apologize for my appearance but put in a plug for an Amazing Outdoor Learning team today at Lowe's with amazing third graders from Dennis Chavez and Sr Marvin and it was an amazing experience if you can get out there or up to send the amounts if you haven't the kids were just delightful and engaged all day it was May 30th the next time to figure out so I'm packed and I have to say yes I so appreciate the amount of time and effort that

[02:25:00]
sign into the document and it will mean nothing if the implementation doesn't happen properly and so I'm going to I'm going to go back to 1990 when well 86 when I joined APS thank you thank you to the culturally relevant a part of me sit back and controls the

[02:26:00]
because I've been around since 1986 I have two granddaughters in school and I have yet to hear them talk about a culturally relevant novel I asked what black literature have you read To Kill a Mockingbird that is not that is not an African-American perspective so we can talk ideas we can talk you know a strategic plan but if we're not implementing yeah The House on Mango Street

[02:27:00]
I'm sure there are new but yeah I'm going to hold to you know Toni Morrison or Leslie Marmon Silko who attended Highland High School and I was called on the carpet for trying to teach Leslie Marmon Silko ceremony because it confronted some some long-held mythologies and and it turned on students so you know I asked my my granddaughter and she's attending a good school but we fail not just our minority children but we also fail our Anglo kids because they don't get the exposure to ideas

[02:28:00]
represented by culturally relevant literature and so I'm sorry but there is a part of me that is you know if you're not willing to introduce that kind of material you don't have rigorous Curriculum by my standards or by I would argue by anyone's standards and I'm a former English teacher I understand about rigor but it means nothing if you don't expose kids to a world of ideas different from what they are accustomed to and you're not going to recruit I'd like to know how many teachers we have in the district and where are they

[02:29:00]
because when we're not at when we are absent then we feed the impression that we're not capable oh you know Mexicans are not they can't teach a p or where are the black teachers who teach AP so that's what I'm all this is wonderful these are great ideas it means to me NADA NADA because it's it's 2023 and we're stuck we are stuck our curriculum shows that and are minority Staffing so let's let's

[02:30:00]
the leadership in the room and I I think it's really important and it goes with without it's important to stress and and so superintendent Elder I just want to stress my gratitude for you as a leader because the fact that your cabinet is here with you demonstrates that we are all so building

[02:31:00]
a capable group of people and that it speaks to your leadership around the importance of this task and what you've done I know that we've put the community through its Paces we've put the district through its Paces with everything that we've done around boards and guard rails and also with the Strategic plan but none of that could get done in a vacuum if we didn't have a strong leader who said we're going to get it done and the fact that the cabinet is sitting here with you makes me you know speaks volumes two to what you've done to to make sure that that happens and I really appreciate that I also want to say that I really appreciate the terms because words matter in the Strategic plan and the fact that there's you know lots of of words that are leading towards a culture within the District of

[02:32:00]
engagement of partnership accountability rigor those are all words that are mentioned inside that plan and words really matter and I think you guys did a really good job of being very strategic around the kind of language that we use to because the next steps really are about letting and leading with that with the communities so that we're also expressing that and they will be able to see that we did pay attention to the values that they held right around engagement and partnership and the things that we're talking about so I have lots of confidence in the team as we're moving forward and then to miss worldly in terms of talking about what Mastery looks like it just reminded me of I have a 7 daughter who was not happy with a score she got

[02:33:00]
on a piece of paper and what I really enjoyed about the conversation I had with her is she said I need to go talk to my teacher so I can ask my teacher what would it look like if I was actually able to do this paper well and she did and I think that's what we want right that's what students should be able to know and be able to do too is to have that confidence to be able to say okay I might have gotten to see on this but I'm going to go get an A and what is it going to take for me to do that and she really and and this is just a testament I think also to the school also to her parents I'll say that too because my stepson really pushes her really hard but that's what I want for every student to be able to do too right is to be able to say that they know what that standard is going to look like they know where they could fit on that because when it be awesome if every student could just say I'm not settled with this great I'm going to

[02:34:00]
how I can get to Mastery and how I could change that grade or how I could get a better outcome for that and so if we can do that and create that opportunity for all our students I think that's ultimately what we want students should be able to to do that and feel confident and not feel like they're being you know looked less than because they want to do that so I just really appreciate the whole grading piece and where we're going with that and how we do it at work you know if we're not doing our job well we go when we asked our manager how could Mastery look like how could I do this better and so that's a great soft skill for a kiddos and I really appreciate it I don't have anything else to add I just really appreciate all the work and I you know any of our advisory committee members are out there some of the committee members that I've run into were really appreciative of the process so some of the ones that I spoke to were like wow it was rigorous

[02:35:00]
lots of hard thinking lots of good questions and so I want to say you know a tune thank you for pushing us and through that process because I think that was really I was a good part of the design so thank you so much all right so this was just a discussion item this is exciting I know we have lots of next steps lots of activities to come up with this and communities got a lot to absorb we've got strategic plans goals guard rails and a budget coming up so all kinds of things that are going to be coming out when things yes can we get a copy of that first set of slides that you presented because we only have the high level of what Scott presented so I think it would just be great for us to be able to have the Continuum of of the whole thing thank you okay so thank you so much
