[00:01:00]
I need to adopt the July 26th 2023 audit committee meeting agenda and approved the June 27th 2023 audit committee committee meeting minutes all second this is Barbara okay if we can have a roll call Renee Papa yes Sarah Brownstein yes period external audit for fiscal year ending June 30th 2023 so Mr Turnbull I think you have the floor is Sheila on there she is okay I will turn it over to you madam Madam chairman

[00:02:00]
for fiscal year ending June 30th 2023 in the process of closing our end so I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Sheila Adams to give you the status on thank you very much we have started our planning process at this point and have started to look at some of the control documentation for the district along with some of the state compliance items that we have to get through on the other side and so we have also started to look at the federal compliance on it which is the federal award pieces and which programs we will be adding in the current year and so that is in process and then

[00:03:00]
the books and records as Mark identified have been closed and we have some time in the schedule now in September to come back and complete the rest of the audit process for the district we are also in the process of working through the component unit audits all of the entrance conferences have been completed for the foundations and most of the charter schools we have about a handful of charter schools that will still need to have an entrance conference at this point and then we have some of the component audit starting on Monday and so we'll have each of those components on its scheduled we have 32 in total with the foundation that will get through over the next eight weeks at it okay

[00:04:00]
any questions about those 32 that she just talked about just kidding any questions from anybody in person here okay anybody online okay we're good awesome okay our next item for discussion is presentation on aps's internal controls and so I don't know Miss Papa are you going to leave that okay so much Madam chair board members you have a presentation in your packet I'm not sure if it's able to meet up on the screens I'll go ahead and get started so we want to talk to you about the internal controls at 8:00 p.m. and on the first slide introduction we wanted you to know that it's not just best practices but it is

[00:05:00]
and we make sure that we take it very seriously and you can see some of the resources for internal controls and if you go to the next one there's three types of controls designated to risk to reduce the risk of Broadway and abuse the first one is preventive and then detective and then corrective so the way I like to explain it is kind of like when you go to the dentist so if you go there's preventive controls right like you know that kind of stuff and then you have detective which is when they take like X-rays and that kind of stuff and then corrected is the most expensive right because you might need braces or I don't know yes yes so you always want to be heavy on the preventive and then you want to make sure you have detect

[00:06:00]
that helps see where maybe some of the preventive controls didn't do what you thought they were going to do and then of course corrective are the most expensive so those are the three we're going to talk to you about and I'm going to turn it over to Amanda our district controller and she's going to give you an overview thank you these are just the general categories of each of the types that Miss out the doctor covered and and some examples so examples of preventive would be segregation of Duties checks and balances levels of approvals verifications asset custodianship and training and stuff awareness examples of detective include audits reconciliations financial reporting

[00:07:00]
physical inventories financial statements of variance reports and whistleblower reports and examples of corrective these results from if the detective controls discover anything on the first step there would be a root cause analysis and Then followed up with such as disciplinary actions new or updated policies and processes staff training and corrective action plans are next slide just some general examples of preventive controls additional examples on the first really good preventive control you can always have is pre-employment screening so that makes sure that we get qualified people working for us including background checks fingerprinting and reference checks additionally we have

[00:08:00]
word policies procedural directives user guides standard operating procedures and other examples training Finance staff we have Finance staff training of our staff we train our requesters requisition requesters and administrators who approve those requisitions another preventive control is that we control access to who has access to our financial reporting system or Erp there are some additional preventive controlled listed of course these examples they're not all inclusive they are just Illustrated so the next slides we have kind of by Department within Finance with some of our specific controls are for example in the budget Department we as you know how we have board approval of budget transfers that's one we have permissions and user roles within our obs

[00:09:00]
Ed financial reporting system we monitor class size per statute compliance to the right there we have procurement some examples there we've instituted sort of a policy of no soul Source procurements those tend to be hard to monitor so just as a general rule you kind of adopted that kind of environment we assigned by a roles by thresholds so Junior buyer District buyers senior buyer and another example you're familiar with is board approval of purchases over 250,000 on the next slide there's some payroll controls preventive controls segregation of Duties so payroll employees cannot set up or set the pay rate for our employees that comes from HR from another example would be we verify

[00:10:00]
Trinity on 100% of change request to our employee direct deposit bank accounts are we verify those all requested changes moving over to accounts payable we have P card limits purchase limit single purchase limit and monthly aggregate so those are monitored we have dual signature on checks over 50,000 so every Friday Masala gets a stack of all of our disbursements over 50 and she scrutinizes those and and in addition to the printed signature she provides a second what signature on those okay so on the next slide Grant Management they approve Grant requisitions we have here the Grant Management technicians verify cost accounts justifications must be attached and quotes and they verify those against the allowability on every single Grant in general ledger we

[00:11:00]
change funds they're in sealed packets they are prepared and initialed so verified by separate employees that's the same with our cash receiving and our deposit prep and we and general ledger maintain the loss in account structure so that's how we classify our expenditures and our budget and all of our financial information last under prevented we have Capital fiscal Services there again there's another segregation of Duties so request to dispose of an asset it comes from the school or the department they have control of the asset and then we do the actual disposal as you know those go come to you to the board that's another item their approvals also disposals all so Capital fiscal manages their own requisition approval for Capital funds so that's another level there

[00:12:00]
moving on to detective controls is really are designed to see and make sure that the preventive controls are working these are just the double-checks again and in general to cover some general examples we have 100% approval on requisitions up to seven levels of approvers so we have our side administrator we have additional checks in Grant Management if Grant funds are included or Capital fiscal we also have a finance level approval on the next item you're familiar with it's it's actually next on the agenda whistleblower hotline so we'll review those statistics on next the previous item on the agenda was our external audit or annual external audit of financial statements again another item on our agenda today is activity fun audits Joyce Ramirez will be

[00:13:00]
speaking on those and another example there is physical inventory counts no we do those for Capital assets and we also maintain physical inventory counts of Our Food Services Commodities and of our warehouse and amino supplies so to move on to some Department specific examples in payroll we maintain Benchmark so we monitor consistency of the number of checks from pay period we have triple segregation on manual check issuance so one of our payroll staff will prepare a manual check the manager approves and the director signs on those moving on to next slide Capital fiscal services

[00:14:00]
we have a 100% physical inventory of fixed assets annually to visit every school and Department again we use benchmarks so the schools and departments receive an inventory of their assets annually they can check up and monitor on those finally a fun analysis for each Capital fund performance in budget we practice position control over the FTE reconciliation between budget and actual on the next slide Grant Management timesheet processing payroll those are double verified another example is the rfr's so those requests for reimbursement Billings the great management staff stays involved on discussions between ped and the program staff to make sure that those are all in order next slide and general ledger let's see

[00:15:00]
bank accounts daily we prepare a cash flow sheet daily it's email to directors and our CFO just to monitor our cash balances jees or journal entries so those are prepared by staff reviewed by the jail supervisor and then signed off on by the controller or the executive director and accounts payable we have 100% audit on our travel reimbursements and 100% audit on our P card transactions including the reconciliation and I will let Mark speak to our corrective controls as mess up the most expensive as far as possible consequences of these controls not working

[00:16:00]
to start we do we do with a root cause analysis and part of that is to research not a trail basically go from beginning to end of what happened and look at the whole chain of events and then depending on how we look at that then take care of action by updating any processes or procedures additional training or maybe we need to take away access to action relates to our findings so

[00:17:00]
that's why we do the corrective action plans that's why the Auditors expect when they want to know what we're going to do about our findings so we provide that every year at the end of the day at this committee so again we in order to put ourselves in this position controls and and consistently monitor with these controls so I just purpose of this presentation about protecting the district

[00:18:00]
assets and make sure you're doing so with that so we stand for questions okay I will start here so does anybody have any questions and at the same time have we run into issues where we haven't been able to obtain period

[00:19:00]
so if someone needs a program or a service or a good will start to see if there's a contract already so we'll see do they have a state contract do they have a Cooperative contract do they have a GSA contract perhaps there's a contract we can piggyback off of and most of the time 90% of the time we find something if it does if we cannot find anything then we'll have to go out for our feet and when we go out for our pee we have to look for a similar items not identical twin but something that's similar and then it'll go through the evaluation process and again we can really successful so a couple years ago we used to have like 67 we cut it down to about 7:00 and then we got it down to like zero and then

[00:20:00]
we had one and then last year we had zero and so far we have zero so I don't know if you have anything to add It's just sometimes you know it is we have certain when we go out to bed or RFP the antennas to try and maximize competition as much as possible so we exhaust all kinds of different and you know looking to different school districts nationally again looking at the scope to make sure it's opening up and not proprietary you know for the intent to get the best product or Services according to I appreciate that absolutely the only thing I can think of is in case of cases of artwork I think that's the one the one issue that came up with the need to go through the RFP in Social to avoid

[00:21:00]
Full Source could have been a barrier and being able to finish a project and I think the artwork has an exemption is that correct yes there is an extension in the procurement code for artwork period and then my only other question because you all know the how I don't I in no way shape or form know any of the how to do this and I appreciate the real really thorough report is there anything that you see in terms of board policy that we should be considering because all of the house is in your lap and it's just a matter for us to make sure that we've got policies in place to give you the direction or Clarity that you all need I think one of the exercises we're going through right now is looking at all our policies so I think you know like Mark had mentioned it's a good habit to look at

[00:22:00]
director of your standard operating procedures for your department and your board policies at least once a year because if the Law changes we need to update them so I think if we find anything that that could help us there is a barrier it should be addressed at that time but whenever you you know develop a policy or procedure it shouldn't just be put on the Shelf you really have to dust it off every year and look at it because things do change thank you thank you my confidence in your department increases every single time you make a presentation and as well for all of you sitting there I really appreciate what you've done and the only thing that I would ask is that we potentially flag this this presentation for our incoming board members as part of their training because I think it's very

[00:23:00]
I think I would have liked to have seen this a year ago so let's flag this I think it was very good and I appreciate appreciate the thoroughness of your department and it's it's on display every time you present so thank you thank you okay does anybody online have any questions do you have any questions with you so I think the only member Peterson got mine About Soul source so that's good the question that a couple of questions that I have on when privileges or access is lost is that difficult for that to happen like how many chances does somebody get before they lose access or they lose some of those privileges is that like delineated

[00:24:00]
one of the places that we have that is in the p-card and we actually have different violations and we kind of do like a three strikes you're out so we definitely give the opportunity for people to come in we sit with them we go over the policy we always offer help and then if for some chance they they violated again they won't bring in the associate or with whoever's responsible and again you know kind of walk through the process try to see where there's either not Clarity or lack of understanding and then if they do it again and then basically they're going to lose their privileges but I can report that in my time I don't believe that I've even seen one because once we kind of explained to them and and they kind of

[00:25:00]
understand the internal controls people a lot of time it's just that they didn't know but everything is not it's not ambiguous then so it's pretty clear what they need to do okay and then another question that I had is cuz I know Capital fiscal Services I mean that's big very important along with everything else but are you all fully staffed in that department do you know I might not be a question for you and we also are the senior director is not been replaced yet so you're doing everything well I'm having help from the stuff there a lot of help period

[00:26:00]
okay so hopefully is that just and this might go to Scott I don't know is that just because people is at the pay like it usually is that the pay is just not but they can get out in the private sector maybe I don't know well I haven't talked to anybody who hasn't replied but I think that could be a part of it I think it's a pretty difficult job I mean it's a huge job in APS and I don't know I don't really have we did make some adjustments to pay recently that we had this 6% raise we made some internal adjustments based on some work we've been doing with human resources so that that should have helped I mean you guys are in the business of this you probably know better than I do probably rent better ideas so we've been looking at the job descriptions and we want to make sure that the roles responsibilities and duties match the

[00:27:00]
the position so that's something that we've been working with with Mark and and again looking holistically at the department and the finance department to make the best decisions we can so that's been part of it but it's definitely something that we do need and we definitely are going to be moving on ya for down a capital account and then it seems important but I didn't report to you we just did our capital and in the past that used to take all the way to after Labor Day and one time all the way to October they actually did it and one and a half days working with our business systems they have used technology and they have been able to cut it down and we've been gone from some of the people that said we used to have to wait till after so that they did

[00:28:00]
and so I think let me see what other question I have I just don't want to miss it so I know that Mr Turnbull you had talked about root cause analysis that you you know that you use that so that's corrective so what would trigger that is whatever happened in the detective section is that what triggers a root cause analysis okay and does that happen does that happen often that you have to really go down to the root cause you would want to if you if you if you are detecting a issue that your control is not working or working as it should you have to usually look at the hole that one situation to make sure you're

[00:29:00]
interpreting it correctly I think one of the times that we definitely do it is if we can find it so we send out of finding that perhaps one of the internal controls or process or something wasn't working then we do go back and look and see okay what what went wrong are we not training right or is our is there any more clarity do we need more training so that's one of the big places that we see those corrective perhaps when we do 100% And on travel if we see something there then again we look into what happened how come they might not understand the policy so those are usually the times we see it when you have to really get down to the nitty-gritty and then the last thing I know I had mentioned this

[00:30:00]
and if it's something that you can update us later on is when it comes to and we haven't heard about this for a while it's just monitoring payroll over payments I know sometimes people are overpaid and then trying to get that money back is sometimes difficult once they already have it if we could kind of get updated maybe about how the process for recouping those payments and you know kind of maybe the data on the last several years about how much that has been and how much we've been to able to recoup but that's something that we can do it oh later time I think that's something that would be important to to know how that's how that's going because it's been a little while period I think that's it unless anybody else has anything we will go on thank you all so

[00:31:00]
our next item for discussion is consideration or acceptance of the ethical Advocate statistics for March 1st 2023 through June 30th so miss Riser good afternoon Madam chair members of the committee and superintendent Elder today for March 1st through June 30th 2023 the report starts on page 23 of your electronic documents as you can see we have received 32 whistleblower complaints during the March 1st of June 30th time frame the reports in your packet provided break down of the data by several different categories the types and numbers of complaints typical to the previous report time frames when looking at all of the reports for the quarter five of the reports had multiple duplicates if we took out those duplicates for this period there would be a total of 24 different

[00:32:00]
and with that I sent her questions you have any questions here have any questions did you say this is for April to June yes April 1st through June 30th 2022 to 23 January tomorrow okay and you said that there were everything's kind of seemed April 1st of June

[00:33:00]
apparently just okay April period April 1st through June 30th June of 2023 okay all right and you said that the nothing really stood out to you everything kind of seems status quo I did kind of highlights for 2022 to 2023 that were what currently at 110 complaints overall is that the clothes out for the entire year it would be a close out at the end of June okay for next year and it is a little high but one of the things that I really noticed this year is that when we do get a complaint there will be three of the same complaints for of the same place which is why I gave you the data the removing the duplicates would put us at 204 and that's something that's a little bit different for this school year compared to the last okay okay okay

[00:34:00]
so you're not necessarily seen a huge increase in complaint you're seeing duplicative when I was looking at District level on the complaints by location and it had 17 but then when I was looking at not confirmed there was 10 and 3 and 2 and then there was one open and so then that was only 16 unless I'm missing something somewhere and I'm adding more which page I'm sorry on page 23 of the digital copy so just under complaints by location and if you go to district and it says total

[00:35:00]
17 I missed one because when you look at the next page it is at 17 and sorry I missed one somewhere in one of the areas it's probably an open complaint okay okay just wanted to make sure about that and then a question I'm sure I've asked before is when we're looking at many of the complaints is there at the district level do you have a kind of try to dig down and try to figure out why that is I mean we have so many elementary schools and if there's only nine but yet at the district level we have the majority have you ever dug deep into why I will tell you for this period I know it takes people

[00:36:00]
power to whether they're confirmed or they're not confirmed and you're using a lot of your you know time for things that aren't confirmed which is good because people are being listened to and I know that that's part of the reason that it's easier for them to make a complaint but I just kind of go how do we figure out how to not have to use so much people power for all those not confirmed ones and I mean I don't remember what they are you know these other years 2018 up until this school year but I remember mostly they aren't confirmed every year right typically yes well I think you're doing a great job at people feel listen to and I think that's important and you know I know you are using your time on things that aren't but it's fine period

[00:37:00]
Sarah Brownstein yeah the Elder yes Danielle Gonzales yes let me Jackson yes Robert Peterson yes Heather Smith yes thank you thank you to convene an executive session is authorized by the public meetings act section 1015 Dash 1822 to discuss limited personal matters in connection with activities by the public radio
