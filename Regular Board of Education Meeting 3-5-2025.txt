good evening president Gonzales board members and Deputy superintendent I guess we are ready to count you in the Stream is running already so I think we're ready to go ahead I'm sorry already great thank you welcome to the Board of Education meeting that we use closed captioning on the YouTube live stream so please speak as clearly as possible now I ask that you stand if able and join me and saying the Pledge of Allegiance in English and Spanish

[00:07:00]

[00:08:00]
March 5th 2025 Board of Education meeting agenda I'd like to remind board members that per the aps Board of Education in Spanish we can ask it an item be removed from the consent agenda before the meeting agenda is posted but not during the meeting do we have a motion and a second I move that we adopt the March 5th 2025

[00:09:00]
for March 5th 2025 okay sorry madam president I would like to move to amend the agenda to remove approval of the minutes of the February 5th 2025 Board of Education meeting thank you so we have a motion to consider adoption of the March 5th 2025 Board of Education meeting agenda with removal of an agenda item 3.1 approval of

[00:10:00]
February 5th 2025 minutes is there a second this is Boardman Rivera ya so the reason that I was wanting to remove it is that the the February 5th 2025 meeting minutes are about 22 pages long and we just received them and so I I am just speak to myself haven't had time to fully review them so I would just like to move them to the next meeting just so that there's a chance to fully review them thank you I know I have also had not had a chance I heard from a couple board members that they didn't have a chance to fully review those materials before the meeting other question or discussion and we'll take a roll call so a point of clarification

[00:11:00]
is that is it possible to remove an item from yes this is not a consent agenda item so this is okay to remove Dominguez yes yes yes yes yes yes we will move on to agenda item 3.1 which is to consider approval of the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on February 19th 2025 is there a motion and a second president I will move to approve the minutes from the Board of Education meeting on February 19th 2025 this is number Jackson any second can we have a roll call vote please

[00:12:00]
vice president Jackson will you please share the instructions for a public forum I will so first of all Welcome to our public forum guests when you signed up to speak you were asked to review the rules and expectations which our presiding officer will enforce the New Mexico open meetings act requires that our agenda specify in advance the items that will be discussed and voted on during the meeting therefore public forum is not a dialogue among speakers and board members but rather a chance to hear from our community we will call participants to speak in the order they signed up whether in person or virtual those here with us tonight will be asked to come to the microphone at the back of the room when their name is called online guests will stay in a virtual rating waiting room until it is their turn to speak we have

[00:13:00]
set aside 45 minutes for public forum tonight we have how many speakers 18 tonight we have 18 speakers which means each of you will have 2 minutes to speak and that is also now I will turn it over to Mr Gonzalez thank you so I want to make sure the first speaker was Daniel to and I want to make sure if he came in we didn't miss him I don't see him or her next speaker is Dr Christine Miller and she'll be followed by Ron mirror you have two minutes once again thank you members of the board as you know I'm Chris Muir and I recently retired from APS as executive director for the student Family Support Division I'm here again to talk to you about the health education

[00:14:00]
the move of the graduation requirement to 8th grade there were over 2,000 comments in the aps graduation requirements survey all wanting to have the health education requirement to remain in the high school even though they may have added to that survey and said I agree you're strongly agree their common said but keep it in the high school and have health at in middle school also so they wanted the course to be offered twice some of the comments that came out were health education needs to be taken in high school leave the seventh grade health and put the grad requirement in high school and not Middle School the standards are not age appropriate for Middle School there is not good this is not a good idea health is too important to just fluff it off to make room for more electives yes I think they need to help him both middle and high school one concern is that Middle School

[00:15:00]
students might lack the maturity to fully understand and handle complex Health topics my concern is that in middle school life perspective is very different than High School mindset earning the credit in Middle School will not provide the same impact as his health is learned in high school as you recall there were many things that I talked about in the past the standards are not the same in middle school as they are in high school for example inappropriate touching Middle School versus date rape in high school they required to describe to explain and evaluate and apply give examples versus role playing those are all the kinds of things and the risk behaviors are very different so again I am asking you to bring the health education graduation requirement back for a vote which means one of you has to put it on the agenda please do that

[00:16:00]
vote to move it back the requirement to 9th grade instead of 8th grade followed by Alicia Lopez western music period

[00:17:00]
deeply flawed evidence that APS panel misinformed you about parental support for the idea and the Stark difference between 8 and 9/8 education standards considering all the evidence that supports keeping Health in 9th grade it is obvious that this topic should be brought up for another vote now that you are aware of the overwhelming evidence that moving Health to 8th grade was a bad idea it comes down to understand how important health education curriculum is essential topics like suicide mental emotional health Team pregnancy drug use sexual violence these need to be taught in 9th grade I sincerely hope all of you at the aps Board of Education understand you are here for the students not the superintendent your decision should be made for the greater good of students and District decisions like moving

[00:18:00]
play 38 health education should be made with accurate reliable valid information I look forward to the board meeting soon that revisits revisits the issue of moving 9th grade health education and truthful evidence-based discussions of the merits of keeping 9th grade health in high schools in APS thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Alicia Lopez Lopez and I'm a special education teacher at High School in an ATM Federal locations to schools historically Albuquerque High School has received Title 1 funding and based on npd's guidance we

[00:19:00]
play qualify for in a multitude of ways however we have lots of funding due to aps's new fixed allocations in the 60% threshold as a result we are losing half a million dollars and four teacher ftes in an administrator to make matters worse the district's new enrollment projection will lead to the loss of six additional teachers that are school and two secretarial positions we are in the verge of losing 10 teachers altogether and in response to the district is offering us one transformational coach to support her teachers unless that coach can magically transformed into teachers I don't see how this will help us the board has the district with insurance that students who fall under Yazzie Martinez would be supported and served appropriately this new budget doesn't fully recognize the needs of those students APS has a large population of Migrant students whose families are weary of applying for public assistance but based on income alone with like qualify for Title One however APS system for determining School poverty solely relies on who receives public

[00:20:00]
assistant this once again overlooks the students who fall under Yazi Martinez yesterday in Albuquerque Journal superintendent Blakey alluded to the changes of these structures by saying they are actually asking if they're actually benefiting students or simply are kick or non-functional I asked the question how does cutting funding and teacher positions benefit students increase achievement it is essential for our district to recognize the pressures we are facing with changes to inclusion HB 171 attacks on migrant students and ongoing dismantling a public education department these issues have cost for a student staff administrators and teachers in this budget only adds to the chaos and disruption period many of us will not be able to take advantage of that forgiveness because our school is no longer considered Title One I urged The District in the board to reconsider the operational locations and return to allocating Title 1 funds on 50%

[00:21:00]
cold and our feet are School patterns thank you thank you our next speaker is Janet Sayers you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking good evening Madam president members of the board and APS staff and yes I'm here once again just to say I'm proud to be part of the Del Norte High School class of 66 celebrating the 60th anniversary of Deli opening in 1964 and we will have the honor of being the last class to graduate from tingly on May 23rd excuse me don't nobody will be the last High School of the group to graduate and my group is we've been invited so I'm going to try to track down lots of Rusty knights from the class of 66 to be part of that I did

[00:22:00]
I want to just mentioned Community engagement I have the opportunity the last few weeks to see what brings parents grandparents Aunts Uncles nieces nephews and assorted people out and we don't talk very much about Athletics and some of these board meetings but I tell you people turn out to watch their kids be in sports even if they're just sitting on the bench and so I had the opportunity to be at Del Norte senior night for girls and boys basketball for an alumni game baseball and then last night Cleveland

[00:23:00]
the Del Norte choir same thing that the Performing Arts Center of almost 300 was almost full of people coming out to see their kids they don't always come to the town halls but and just in conclusion thank you to board member Benavides and Jackson for being part of the local government Coordinating Committee and I watched you all one night till about 11:00 or talking about the opioid money thank you it's very important to be talking with our your fellow local government of the city thank you thank you babe I can hear you okay thank you do you remember something

[00:24:00]
immigrant communities in the South Valley I am deeply concerned about a new question in the online registration process that asked for the student was born in the US or not when I saw this I felt deeply disappointed I tell my students that we are in New Mexico I stayed at values and supports immigrants put encounter in this question made me feel conflicted about that message family should feel safe and rolling their children in schools without fear or hesitation asking if a student was born in the US or not racist serious concerns for me special because the question must be answered in order to complete the only registration according to the policies and procedures posted on the aps website it is clearly stated that and I quote APS does not collect nor keep records of any students in immigration status however asking for a student was born directly contradicts this statement

[00:25:00]
Search the word to clarify the reason for the exchange and ensure that APS remains committed to protecting all students rights regardless of their place of birth and if possible I request that these change be removed if removal is not an option I urge the board to make to make it to not make it required or provide an option to decline answering the question thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Courtney fish Hagar sorry fish Gallagher Courtney fish Gallagher my mistake you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening my name is Courtney fish Gallagher I'm an Albuquerque High teacher but I'm also a mother of five kids who are either students in the district or will be once they're big enough I'm here to express my deep concern about the decision to raise the funding threshold on Title 1 funds from 50% to 60%

[00:26:00]
particularly my concerns are about the lack of transparency for how these funds will be distributed the absence of a rationale for why the change was made and the lack of detail about the initiatives that will benefit from this change smaller class sizes better staff classrooms more opportunities for connection between students and teachers or what improve student outcomes our community has repeatedly identified increasing Staffing and reducing class size as their top priorities my oldest children attend a school that will be eliminating for Teacher positions due to the loss of their Title 1 funding and to be clear this is a this is a school where the majority of students above 50% of my children's peers are living in poverty for contacts with that looks like giving standard class sizes that's 120 students at any given period who are going to be forced into other classes the threshold changes going to cost teachers their jobs teachers who are desperately needed by their students the data linking student outcomes to class size has not changed the economic future

[00:27:00]
pictures of the children in our district has not changed I'm concerned Why their funding has changed I heard you just forwarded to reconsider the threshold change and keep those funds in the school that where they are needed barring that provide the community with a more thorough accounting of the rationale behind this change thank you so much thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Renee Pacheco and you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking all right good evening I am a teacher at Calvary Christian Academy I recently heard a study that was due at done at Pew Research Center it's a place of psychologists and they conducted a study in 2023 saying the effects of diversity equity and inclusion Dei the trainings are

[00:28:00]
psychologically powerful even though they were limited on what curriculum they could research their findings report that their trainings are producing hatred among people these teachers are these teachings are said to combat racism bias attitude and discrimination but it said people are being taught how to create these racial and gender problems such teachings are rooted in the Communist belief system it is increasing racial resentment creating backlash and hatred among the different classes of people we are spending eight billion dollars on teaching people how to hate one another d e i is teaching us how to have hostility be discriminative love and tolerance among other

[00:29:00]
Howard in the complete opposite so I asked you to stop those practices and stopped demanding that those trainings of teachers that want to have a a more kind and prosperous classroom thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Maria Hamilton you have two minutes period pediatrician 10 years of my Pediatrics practice have been at Community Health Care with primarily immigrant families as a parent and as a community professional Advocate I am dismayed and shocked that APS has chosen to include

[00:30:00]
2025 2026 registration form there is no educational reason of school system needs this information if knowledge of country of birth is necessary for demographic research or funding purposes an optional questionnaire not tied to the registration process by and anonymized could be considered including a question regarding a student's country of birth and registration will almost certainly a decrease enrollment in be create additional unnecessary fear and students and families given the many recent drastic and unprecedented changes to federal policy the family educational rights and Privacy Act does not feel like an adequate guarantee that students country of origin or immigration status will be protected Decades of research on Child and Adolescent development indicates the lifelong effects of adverse childhood experiences and traumatic events events such as deportation

[00:31:00]
detention and family separation or the threat thereof during childhood are causally linked to dozens of physical and mental health problems this question has no place in the aps registration process and must be removed or made optional thank you very much for considering and for your time thank you our next speaker is Charlotte Joseph also on Zoom you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening good evening Madam chair and board members thank you for your time this evening I learned this week is has already been mentioned about this question on parent view that require a question that was a student born in the United States and the required answer of yes or no must be given in order to proceed I'm here to request that this question from the registration process this question is discriminatory and direct violation of federal law that all children regardless of immigration status have a right to public education it's also violation of APs Pollock

[00:32:00]
students immigration status this question will lead to some children who are not born in the United States being afraid to enroll in school and thus will deprive these students of their Federal right to an education and not receiving an education will be detrimental to the students their families are schools already struggling with law enforcement and our community and I asked that APS explain why and how this question was added to the registration process without any transparency to the community that APS is legal team fight against peed or any other entity requesting that this be added and and continue to be part of the registration process and that APS immediately removed the question I'm so where the change of the title and requirements of resulted in schools like my child's elementary school elementary and Albuquerque High losing one funding in numerous teachers next year this is obviously concerning the demographics and number of students have not dramatically changed at those schools and I asked

[00:33:00]
this decision be Revisited and while I'm here also want to voice my support for all the transgender students attending APS and I employ the district to protect their privacy and mental health and continue to support the transgender students even when APS policies might be challenged thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in the room Christina Williams followed by I believe in shedwool you have to I'm sorry you have two minutes my name is Christina Williams and I am a cross cat special education teacher at Alameda Elementary and I am deeply invested in our APS Community as a former Alameda student a Taylor Middle School student and a graduate from Valley High School this place is home so I am also a member of our Outdoor Learning teacher advocacy group we are working to incorporate play Space outdoor

[00:34:00]
outdoor education is a powerful tool that enhances our student development and are Rio Grande Valley offers a rich unlimited opportunities for learning in nature schools like Los Padilla's Alvarado Polk Middle School are already embracing this approach and at Alameda our youngest students are already participating in Forest Fridays going to the Bosque to dig in the dirt and explore and learn and be in the sunshine and at the same time our upper grades on campus or applying mathematical skills problem solving and teamwork to design build and maintain our Gardens and our budding outdoor classrooms and this spring will be creating a Heritage Garden exploring indigenous cultivation methods that can connect our students directly to the land and their Heritage many in our community have deep ties to this land and our School site as you know sits on land it is essential for us to provide all students but a indigenous students with this listing approach to education that is rooted in direct

[00:35:00]
experiences with nature charter schools and private schools are already offering this approach we are losing students because of this and our families are asking for the same opportunities for their students research shows that Outdoor Learning improves attendance academic performance and well-being and children with exceptionalities the kiddos I work with they Thrive when they're allowed to explore build create write dance draw play and connect in natural spaces period so I do invite our board to check out these opportunities and what's already happening in our schools and I'm going to invite our board to join us at Alameda roll up your get your shovels and roll up your sleeves and join us on Saturday March 29th while we are building our Rock Labyrinth and Community Box Gardens thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is

[00:36:00]
followed by Mary Walker Herrera you have 2 minutes once you begin to speak I was told that the budget will be discussed tonight according to my district meeting which I went to on Monday APS is data-driven that usually means an emphasis on test scores in my Social Circle and here's some data that they share with me about how they think that they should be spent honestly number one better food give me on information a lot of people don't like it and if you don't eat your head is going to hurt and you won't be able to learn spend the money on better food so that we would always eat good food every day so we will be full of energy to learn and better food for a full stomachs all right so that's one thing I don't know what the budget can do with that but the other

[00:37:00]
the thing is they really have this Middle School platform that they're working with amplify they don't like it it's all computer-based it's all clacking away on their Chromebooks amplifies boring and it doesn't really teach me amplify helps teachers be lazy I just click random answers until I get it right no money on amplify like if covid taught us anything it's at the kids do not love being on their Chromebooks and don't really Excel so dovetailing with that they did ask for more teachers teaching in front of the classroom higher quality instruction these are kids and they get the connection of being Homo sapiens and that we are like all designed to do interpersonal we're not designed to work through a screen and more recess more outside activities hello that

[00:49:00]
learn about the environment how it works and if we don't preserve it for future Generations I'm having the best year of my career at Harrison this year and a big part of that is because I get to share this really beautiful space with my students and they get to experience it in a way that from what I've heard from them is life-changing and so I'd like to continue doing that I'd like for the district to embrace Outdoor Learning and to make sure that all of our students have regular consistent opportunities to learn in the outdoors for them and their education thank you thank you sir and board members that completes public forum public forum guests the next item on our agenda is to consider approval of the consent agenda is there a motion in a

[00:50:00]

[00:51:00]
New Mexico school boards Association 2025 excellence in student Achievement Award to be presented to Jaime Ramos thank you to have a second thank you and any discussion Madam president may give the reasons why thank you okay so the New Mexico School boards Association Excellence for student Achievement award program seeks to promote the enhancement of student achievement and to focus local school boards on efforts to improve student achievement the recipient can be an individual or group that played an important role in improving student achievement at the district level the executive committee of the Board of Education met and after looking through an exhaustive list of candidates unanimously chose Jaime Ramos as the nominee for the award just a note that the list of candidates

[00:52:00]
was what we used was the teacher and the employees of the month for the year of 2024 Community partner coordinator Jaime Ramos is the champion for students experiencing homelessness ensuring that their educational rights are protected and their immediate needs are addressed Miss Ramos ensures that Community Partners understand the mckinney-vento homeless assistance act and she works collaborative collaboratively to provide the necessary referrals so students can access their education and reach their academic potential her exceptional perseverance and data-driven approach set her apart while her extensive knowledge of students and family needs reflect her attention to detail and deep care for the students she serves so that sums it up thank you and thank you too for your work on behalf of our

[00:53:00]
we do have a motion and a second is there any additional question or discussion all right can we have a roll call vote please of revisions to board policy fee naming renaming and dedication of facilities this was from the February 3rd 2023 policy committee meeting and I wanted to acknowledge that I did ask that we pull it off of consent so that we can have a conversation because we received a memo from the Council of great City schools on February 28th in our inbox and that memo from Ashley in coaching related specifically to this vote and so I just wanted to share that coaching out with the

[00:54:00]
where did in the public because it's short it says there are two common challenges that we see most frequently with boards getting involved in facility naming number one conflicts of interest regarding names and number two these processes take up disproportionate board time that could be focused otherwise on student learning I generally see boards that want to be student outcomes focused go one of two ways one completely delegate this responsibility to the administration who then must develop and run the community process for renaming and make the final decision or two almost completely delegate this responsibility to the administration who then after the community process for renaming brings the final item to the board for an upper down vote as the final step in the process in both cases the board avoids spending an excess of time on the process the board largely needs to make the decision about how focused it wants to be on student

[00:55:00]
if that's the highest and most vital priority go with option 1 if not go with option to so I see this as an opportunity for us to make a decision and also a very clear statement about how focused this board wants to be on student learning and felt it was worth us having a conversation on that so I will turn it over to our presenters for this agenda item who are the members of the ad hoc policy diet committee board members Courtney Jackson and Heather benavidez actually I'm sorry can I ask for the motion in the second to consider this app I moved to approve the revisions to the board policy f e naming and dedication of facilities and I will second this is board member benefits thank you in the first motion was from member

[00:56:00]
so just a kind of a brief history I think on how this policy and this discussion has developed in 2024 last year the first set of policy and add hot policy diet committee was put together that needed to review all of the policies that were current policies of the board at that time yeah in 2024 at that time this particular policy was deemed as was it 233 sorry 223 so it was a it was a previous board members they decided that this particular policy fell from Lee with

[00:57:00]
in the realm of an administrative decision and so this policy was deemed administrative and was sent to Administration over the course of review the administration sent this policy back to the board so there seems to be a little bit of ping-ponging that is happening with this policy so this policy was then placed again on the new policy diet at hot Committee of which board member benavidez and I are responsible and through discussion brought this policy to the policy committee for review that was on February 3rd so the policy committee discussed it there was some pretty in-depth discussion between the policy committee members as well as the superintendent as to why what her reasoning was is to why she

[00:58:00]
the this particular policy passed out of policy Committee in order to come to the full board so that the full board could have a chance to weigh in on this particular policy so I think that's the history do you have anything that you'd like to add I don't have anything to add about the history of the work but I do have a few questions because I'm in favor of it so if you mind if we will go ahead and start with questions with you so I understand it doesn't necessarily kind of aligned with that but I want to ask the veteran board members how many times has this this particular task come before the board have you all been

[00:59:00]
overall I believe it was easy however it was extensive because there was a lot of background information as to why and we had

[01:00:00]
and the families were here yes yes yes yes yes yes and we have the reception and there was a lot tied to the choice so we made it I remember now established it I don't I don't think we would for example I would foresee the reception happening well before coming into the board in our current

[01:01:00]
our commitment to student outcomes I would see us getting all that information ahead of time right because we go through materials first and so I don't I just don't see a spending an inordinate or excessive amount of time on this kind of thing I will also point out that and only because this is kind of brewing in my district and it came up during the December 18th or 19th meeting desire to change the names on certain schools because they don't honor

[01:02:00]
potentially coming before us and and that's going to be a community concern I don't again I think we've adopted a very solid approach to to our time on the dice being committed to student outcomes so I just don't see this becoming an issue in the future but I do want us to be to honor our constituents did you have other questions or comments should be an administrative task Duty do they have a plan in place to do this work and

[01:03:00]
but if they have a plan in place and want to take it on so there's already a pretty comprehensive procedural directive on naming policies which is and renamed sorry naming facilities and renaming which is tied to the so the full process is already in place and Mr doctor mister you could be a doctor tonight doctor Hawkins is not over here is our chief upper I can't remember your something Deputy superintendent for our operations is not into that affect we do know that we are at least opening one new school which will be going through that process that's what we're currently calling the international school and member Dominguez is correct that there are several schools for any of us could argue their names or rather inappropriate so I will keep moving down the line if you're done

[01:04:00]
thank you so just just to follow up on that the if you're curious the administrative procedures PF 10 so if you want to or anybody out there wants to look it up it's PF 10 so I think where I fall on this and and I think I brought this up in the policy committee meeting as well is that I feel the need to stay within my boundaries that I had set previously on another issue that was brought before the board where I had to make a statement that I thought very strongly that if we're going to be if we're going to I'm not being very eloquent if we're going to do sosg then we need to do Sophie and the

[01:05:00]
was in relation to the acknowledgment of tribal lands that I felt that if we were taking all of this stuff off of the agenda so that we could focus on student outcomes Focus governance then we needed to stick with student outcomes Focus governance so this I think is kind of a similar argument that we need to focus on this and I mean I think we even have something in one of the books that we read that our job is not to our job is not to name schools our job is not to decide if the senses are painted red our job is to make sure that the goals and the guardrails are being met so so I understand what was in our in our training documents or our memo and I would be comfortable going with option one thank you

[01:06:00]
who are there additional questions or discussion I have one OK Google

[01:07:00]
and I want to go back again to the system that we have in place I think we have a system that would really diminish and I trust this board to make sure that we do not have an excessive amount of time spent because we get here before board meetings so I'm confident that we would handle tackle this appropriately thank you remember my next question is how does the superintendent feel about the speaker

[01:08:00]
I know in discussions that I've had not speaking for Dr Blakey but you know thinking about naming of facilities and with my experience at it it has been all it has been a process that we've used for a board to you know it kind of the values of the board right who are Community Representatives again not not playing one way or the other but I know that's kind of been the base of our discussion that we've had so great thank you so

[01:09:00]
one of the things that are one of the the topics that comes up continuously when I interact with members of the community in fact this happened at my town hall on Monday night is they asked questions about things that they think that we do decisions that we get to make processes procedures you know especially in regards to the question on the registration form that was a big topic and they don't understand what our role is and they don't understand and how it really focuses our work and I wouldn't expect people to understand that unless they watch our meetings religiously and read the governance manual and really try to understand it so I think that we walk a fine line is community or elected people in our community with providing information but not overstepping what we know our boundaries are and

[01:10:00]
but I think that it's another area where we're going to have to explain to the community and it's difficult they are the people who elected us they want our input they want us to answer the questions they want us to be accountable and this is going to be another area where we have to kind of throw our hands up and say that's not our responsibility anymore and it's difficult it's hard to answer those questions I find that it's not only a respect and that

[01:11:00]
acknowledging a name that if the community it's like birthing it's a name that you give birth to something and within my own culture the naming of anything is a respect and a due diligence for that particular whether you want to call a child item building that it represents something in that community that also just brings straight and kids recognize when a name is because all of these things that bring belonging it brings an awareness that there's a respect and I think we need times even us as a board we have this final acknowledgment in receiving and acknowledging that we share with that Community what that school is and what it represents and I do know that valuing that

[01:12:00]
also shares the the respect that we as a board represent in serving our community so my my thing is that yes it may take time but I also feel that in due diligence to our community for us to acknowledge belonging and those specifics of coming together and serving the community we give that respect that's all I need to say thank you for that and I would just say I agree 100% with you around the importance of a name and about the importance of allowing Community to express that value which is exactly why I don't think it's our role to be involved in the process at all and one of the things that is in the revised policy is actually the primary revision to the policy is that this process will align with the boards primary mission of improving

[01:13:00]
is it is true that our primary mission is a school board is to improve student outcomes and it is true that the way that we do that is by representing the communities vision and values and that's where it stops because the way that we per sosg represent the communities vision and values is through the goals and the guardrails that is where we represent the vision and values not through any other decisions and not through administrative work so it is not for us to be naming buildings that is not how values are represented and so I just wanted to be clear that that's just a misreading of us so ifg I also I hear an argument made about how much time it would take for me it's not an issue of time it's about communicating our commitment to student outcomes first and foremost but that is what this board is about I also though would want to

[01:14:00]
courageous just to play out a scenario in which we would ever vote down a name I agree that Kit Carson and on YouTube and Coronado and many others were bad people to whom we should not name our schools after however if the administration were to bring forth a proposal that said we're going to change these names who are we to have to vote Yes or no it's to the community of the community is making a recommendation to us to the superintendent then that's what needs to hold we don't I don't think we have standing to vote no against that and I mean I don't think that we have standing to vote Yes also it's again it's the community and it's the process it's already written out here in the procedural directive that is hat that is owned by the community and owned by the superintendent so with that since we've all had an opportunity to express our positions and ask

[01:15:00]
and we have the motion and the second we'll go ahead and just move to a vote on this one and then we'll proceed with the agenda so Dr Albright can we have a roll call please clarify for me please the vote Yes I'm still talking

[01:16:00]
no so this one does not carry and we will move on to our next agenda item which is to consider approval of fiscal year 2600 calendar are presenters are renette Apodaca or Chief Financial Officer in Rosalinda Montoya the executive director of budget and strategic planning you have before thank you year 2026 budget calendar for school board approval while the District administration has always had an internal budget Callender it is strong governmental practice for the school board to approve of a calendar that provides a clear road map to final budget approval as such the budget calendar was discussed

[01:17:00]
can you tell at the February 26th finance committee meeting with dates that insured we submitted a board approved APS budget by April 15th fortunately since the finance committee meeting we have obtained an extension approval from ped with a new deadline for Budget submission of May 19th the calendar presented tonight takes into account the extension given to APS at search the administration seeks your approval of this item regarding the FY 26 budget calendar thank you for that presentation do we have a motion in a second thank you any additional discussion questions

[01:18:00]
items and specifically our next item is a discussion of May 2025 General obligation to acknowledge that we have had the materials shared with us in advance we've had an opportunity to review the PowerPoint and an opportunity to ask questions and so thank you to whomever provided excellent answers to our questions and so we don't need a presentation but we are creating space here for any additional follow-up questions however if there's anything Technical and tactical that we can keep out of the meeting we would encourage board members to do that do so

[01:19:00]
but with that I will open the floor to additional questions or discussion I just love how far we've come on this presentation yeah yes all right now I'd like to thank you for your willingness to be here and we will move on to the next discussion items our next item 7.2 is also discussion only fiscal year 2026 budget presentation similarly we have the opportunity to review the presentation in the materials in advance and so we can have follow-up questions or strategic or board level questions and as a reminder they should be questions that will inform our

[01:20:00]
strategic decision making on Final approval of the budget so these are not questions to soothe our curiosity and these are not questions to appease our constituents there are questions to gather additional information that we need to make our decisions I also just want to say that this week's at a glance will include examples of additional strategic budget-related and finance related questions so we will provide additional questions acknowledging that we will have additional presentations on the budget and the agenda I'm sorry the budget presentation for this week was also pretty straightforward and so with that I could do you have any statement or should I just open to additional questions I just have a brief statement
