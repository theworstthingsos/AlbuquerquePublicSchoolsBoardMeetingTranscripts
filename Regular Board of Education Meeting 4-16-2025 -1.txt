[00:06:00]
you ignore the fact that the skills taught 9th grade health education classes are essential to navigate high school and help prevent risky behaviors you say student outcomes are important but you stick you stick with the removal of 9th grade health education where the skills taught life-changing student outcomes you ignore the fact that gold number four is in the health education standards and benchmarks do you ignore the fact that students beginning 9th grade need to learn the skills from 9th grade health standards and benchmarks please repeat it into 9th grade thank you sir thank you mister Tony Watkins followed by Mr Daniela sure you have one minute I'm here

[00:07:00]
Express grave concern about aps's relationship with the Council of great City Schools the family engagement policy has been archived we understand this is a part of the policy diet to put responsibilities into the hands of the administration on mattress the council great City Schools declare are not in the board's purview the policy needs to apply to board members to indeed elements of the policy are exactly would have been sacrificed by the board of entering into a contract with a council of great City Schools coaches and adopting somg coaches intervene during board meetings to guide the direction of the conversation emails to board members are screened by APS staff messages during public comment or summarized by the board president in a way that sensors the content of what people say and prevents us from hearing from other board members APS likely gets a monetary bonus in his contract with the council if the board voted unanimously in addition to be an equitable the process is that efficient the results of the time you study presented on April 22nd we feel that

[00:08:00]
we have the contract with GPS has with cancel great City schools at the board vote on it with discussion prior to vote on the budget we need to talk you've been over here one minute please finish the response to these questions but April 21st and can be reached at Family Center for education at gmail.com thank you sir our next speaker is Daniel to foyer followed by a Janet Harmon Harmon sure you have one minute when you begin speaking good evening my name is Adam here to ask you guys terminate the contract with Kelly Services several incidents have been reported from substitute teachers and have gone on investigated due to the fact that APS says his responsibility and Kelly Services responsibility last week a substitute was fired for sitting there watching students fight after reporting that two days before that those students were going to bring guns to school and nothing was done I have reported it as EA sitting at her desk sleeping with a pill bottle

[00:09:00]
on the floor nothing done several incidents have been reported to you guys and yet you guys are sitting there not doing nothing Kelly Services is not doing nothing it needs to stop APS needs to take the responsibility for substitute teachers and get rid of Kelly Services because so many substitute teachers are being fired so many students child abuse is happening and yet you guys are just ignoring everything that has been reported to you guys please open your eyes thank you thanks for next speaker is Harmon and you'll have one minute once you begin speaking thank you hi good evening this is my first time speaking publicly at a board meeting so thank you for the opportunity my name is Janet Harmon I have two sons who graduated from APS since the covid pandemic my family says educational Journey included eight of the schools in the system I am alarmed at the amount of money that I understand

[00:10:00]
to be affiliated with the Council of great City schools and the lack of transparency and communication with the public around this increasing student outcome will not happen through more testing and collection of data and through advice from out-of-state coaches it's our tax dollars you need to be listening to us our children and their teachers keep this money in the district it'd be much better spent making up for the title one cuts that are imminent it would be much better spin on ensuring that our schools are safe nurturing culturally inclusive environments where kids want to go that's what we elected you to do we didn't let you to be data wants to learn during the covid shut down academic achievement is mostly reflected by students mental physical social and cultural Health not a multiple choice test thank you man our next speaker is on zooboo

[00:11:00]
are you there yes one minute once you begin speaking thank you both speaking on behalf of students and families connected with the New Mexico Asian Family Center we appreciate the community engagement calendars on the agenda tonight we are deeply concerned about this process and recent changes that restrict Community Access to board members archiving policy KB or 14 year old Community created Family engagement policy and folding it into a limited parents rights and responsibilities direct email access to board members and filtering messages that don't reach board members creates additional barriers to an already complex system especially for families who speak languages other than English or Spanish the recent decision limiting communication or decisions only the board president further silence was Community Voices leaving our families and feeling and supported additionally we are concerned about the contract with the Council of the

[00:12:00]
City Schools well some guidance has been helpful to Educators recent policy changes to board operations specifically lab cultural responsibilities the 20,000 discount conditional and unanimous board vote risks pressuring members of empowering them to represent their Community freely this is not representative like School Board I need to stop you there you go over your 1 minute go ahead and finish that last sentence for public discussion on this contract before any vote on the budget thank you speaker I wanted to express my appreciation and thanks for Mr Mark Garcia for reaching out to me this week There's a couple of things that I wanted to say in order to move Health head back to

[00:13:00]
do the high school the board will need to bring back the discretionary units for vote and remove the 5 electron from the 1.5 elective offerings and make it clear to the superintendent that the reason you are doing it is so Health that can be moved back to 9th grade this is still the best move for the students of Albuquerque Public Schools I'm imploring you to stop waiting and bring the health at graduation requirement back to 9th grade second if you and APS are not willing to bring back healthy to 9th grade Mr Garcia inform me that APS is set up a committee to help roll out the healthy graduation requirement in 8th grade I discussed with him that I am willing to serve as a voluntary consultant on that committee I can provide expert insight to this group all the voting to eliminate the 0.58 is the best option I am willing to help to be part of the solution and make it work for our students thank you thank you period

[00:14:00]
hi thank you so much I just want to make sure you have one minute once you begin speaking thank you thank you my kids attend school in District 3 and I was looking forward to the recent round of in-person town hall meetings with my school board representative the aps website and answering the upcoming budget talks said these meetings would help gauges communities priorities and inform budget and inform the the budget discussion I wanted to express my concerns about the aps's student focused outcomes governance model any and what I see is anti-democratic policies within that model including a policy decision that doesn't allow board members to discuss the opinions with media after a vote unfortunately I couldn't discuss those concerns with the town hall because my districts in person meeting was held with little notice on February 4th and only included 45 students and The Other Board District board members held in person meetings and included parents who could speak and have discussions so it appears as their comments were collected and helped with

[00:15:00]
inform the aps budget priorities I'm concerned that our board president and the policies put forward by the Council of the great City schools are discouraging and disenfranchising to members of the public thank you thank you Miss Ross our next speaker is Megan long she is also on Zoom Megan are you there oops making one second we have a technical difficulty we need to resolve this one second chance

[00:16:00]
I'm speaking today on agenda item 5.1 the s o f g self-evaluation that board members are performing the cell phone evaluation is modeled after a corporate structure that is ultimately a waste of time why are we allowing the Council of great City Schools to infiltrate our board with their guidance and coaching when their influence has led to the disengagement of the community and is anti-democratic we did not vote these coaches on to the board we as your constituents are not in support of any continued guidance or coaching from cgcs the board has become increasingly inaccessible to the very people they serve there have been multiple attempts to send her and silence board members under a person of policies and an overall lack of trust in unity as of a constituent of District 3 no longer have any confidence in the president and her ear is held by cgcs and she's behold

[00:17:00]
and not her constituents thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is in person Miss Janet Sayers and you'll have one minute once you begin speaking of substance into this whole Community engagement but it was a nice opportunity I was able to meet some folks then last week on Friday and Saturday I happened to be at the

[00:18:00]
facial building but the fabulous Metro art which is still open until Wednesday every day and and connected with some families who were there with their kids and they were so proud you know looking at what the that was on Saturday but I want to say something something's wrong with the heating cooling of the middle of the middle of the big part was like 85° and the perimeter was like freezing cold so I and that was twice that was both Friday and Saturday and I know the great computer in the sky I'm sorry it's over a woman can you please wrap up quickly in one sentence I'm hoping that that can be adjusted better thank you ma'am our next speaker is on zoom and

[00:19:00]
I want to go with is it Aaron Aaron Dimas I want to see a full copy of the upcoming renewal contract with the Council of the great City schools in addition there needs to be time for Community groups to review the contract and a full throated discussion on the dice before renewing the contract as a citizen looking in cgcs does not encourage Community centered education board members are elected officials meant over the aps Administration and represented the concerns and interests of their constituents under the guidance of the cgcs ability is severely limited in both of those areas considering the fact that the aps board adopted

[00:20:00]
student outcomes focused governance model in 2022 and our students continue to score among the lowest in the nation maybe it's time for a change thank you thank you ma'am okay it looks like our next speaker is on zoom and that is going to be Marco Valdez on 7th grade and I'm here to talk about our school out of school we have a farm we usually go out on it but what really is that we don't really get as much as outdoor Landing as we'd like and usually whenever we get elderly it's only for a couple minutes

[00:21:00]
the only class we really do it in is environmental sustainability which is basically all about outdoor landing and I just really want to emphasize how none of our other classes really take us out and I feel like that should be a problem because we should learn how to interact with their environment thank you thank you sir okay our next speaker is Stefan Cordova are you there

[00:22:00]
okay I'll try to move on to the next one we have a few Zoom people that aren't so we're going to go ahead and go to Katharine Mitchell you have one minute Alvarado Elementary in the North Valley I'm a member of The Outdoor Learning teacher Advisory Group and I appreciate the opportunity to speak in front of you this evening in 2024 award for exceptional student gross making us the only School in APS history to receive this National recognition this year the New Mexico ped also awarded us the bilingual Multicultural education recognition award for 2025 he's incredible

[00:23:00]
achievements are reflection of our schoolwide commitment to equity Innovation and Student Success one of the most impactful elements of our journey has been Outdoor Learning integrating Outdoor Learning into our curriculum has provided students with meaningful Hands-On experiences that support academic growth Foster language development and cultivate a deeper connection with our community and the environment we're proud of the work we're doing and even more proud of our students for rising to meet every challenge this evening I ask for your continued support of Outdoor Learning within APS while also looking for ways to expand these opportunities to students throughout our district thank you thank you I'm going to try our Zoom attendees Estefan Cordova and Travis McKenzie are you there I am here at 7:30 oh great well I'm very proud teacher at Polk

[00:24:00]
call school I want to shout out Marco Valdez who just spoke but we are here in support of Outdoor Learning we have a farm on our campus and we're a part of the aps Outdoor Learning teacher advocacy group and we would just like to see more Outdoor Learning Incorporated across our district we'd like to show support for our Outdoor Learning School Gardens Seymour grade level field trips I think it's happening at the elementary level but we'd like to see that into the middle school level and really see the district Embrace Outdoor Learning as one of the main components to what we do I think it's a strength at APS has and something that we like a lot of support in we really appreciate all the teachers that advocate for Outdoor Learning and we want to see it happen more at the district level and more support across all schools and just a

[00:25:00]
I stand in solidarity with everything that's been said about the council for great City schools and hope that the board can incorporate Community voice into this process and that we don't renew the contract thank you very much thank you and our next speaker is going to be Eric Kaiser hold on one second please okay are you there hi yes I'm here you have one minute won't you begin speaking thank you good evening for president and I have a third grade kid in APS schools first of all I do want to recognize the efforts that went into developing the goals and guardrails with a lot of community input I think as you can see from the comments tonight we have a really passionate Community here in APS that really cares about our students and their life skills but I'm here tonight because I am concerned about the sizeable influence of the Sox coaches and some

[00:26:00]
changes with regards to board policies and the government manual that maybe are done in the name of efficiency but have placed a lot of limits on topics that can be covered the way that the board interacts with constituents and so I just want to say that our board is made up of locally elected representatives and that these are the people who should be making decisions in partnership with the community that has elected them if the sfg coaching stands in the way of the school board's ability to make decisions I would urge you to discontinue it starting with eliminating budget items that fund sfg coaching because that money belongs here in our classrooms not in the pockets of Consultants thank you thank you okay our next speaker is in person let me check in and so I can get a step on the stove on are you there okay we're going to go in person brand

[00:27:00]
Ami Ami you have one minute once you begin speaking with you I am from the Pueblo of Laguna and I bought a home in Albuquerque in 2021 my daughter's been a student at APS for a number of years she's a transfer currently into Albuquerque High to week or two weeks ago she was jumped at school the administration didn't seem to get to her home without any kind of understanding of what would happen next they didn't even contact me they had her call from the school because her phone had been stolen period And basically just made sure she had a ride so I sent an email followed up they called me eventually later on that evening but didn't give me any kind of confidence that this is something that they were going to deal with

[00:28:00]
actually I was told that she was being suspended because the video they saw she was fighting back and so it is now in her record that she is under the videos that I was able to obtain she was not the offender she was the one being attacked and by two individuals at that and so I want a better understanding of why the policies don't actually support the victims in this manner when our children continue to be attacked by individuals why is there still this this leeway or making sense that it doesn't make sense that the victim is also to blame and then suspended because she says what I would like to see is stronger policies that support our victims in and help them attain better understanding for going forward with those that have been the cause for the issue thank you okay step on are you there I know we've been working with you how about

[00:29:00]
I want to talk about the learning as I am a student from Pokemon go to school and I want to talk about why it's important because it's help educate the student about gardening about composting it's also helping the students stay safe or healthy from the vitamin D from the Sun Also if the student knows how to properly use a garden and they do make a garden money on the supermarket fruits and vegetables as supermarkets have chemicals on them and that the reason why I have to learn is so important for our school because it's helping our school get fresh fruits and vegetables in Northridge to fertilizer and then be made for fruits and vegetables if we start composting will be able to make more fruits and vegetables without wasting any food or something important and mental health as we

[00:30:00]
have to dig a trench or even maybe plant some seeds as we are getting energy from the activities sometimes we even get prizes like last week we got M&Ms or we can sometimes take home vegetables or fruits which is way better than staying at the classroom and staring at a screen which is unhealthy which can hurt our eyes and are back from lean over thank you Mr Cordova okay our next speaker is Lauren Lauren are you there how about now I can hear you now good evening thank you for the opportunity to speak I'm here to speak to agenda items five and seven point two and I will say that I enjoy reading student Behavior doesn't change until adult Behavior changes that's nicely posted on the diets

[00:31:00]
because sometimes I think that maybe some of the behavior I see behind the diet does not reflect that motto I'm here primarily tonight to talk about student outcomes Focus governance and also the self-evaluation that's upcoming I appreciate that the student outcomes focused governance has provided some needed structure but I'm very concerned about the role of the council for greater City schools and determining the direction of our board I'd like to please ask you to consider not renewing your contract with cgcs we support the goals and guardrails as articulated by a PS and the board reach through the cgcs framework and the coaching process but it is extremely lacking in its follow through and execution by the board through the relationships with its constituents specifically where the court where the where the correlated guardrails are concerned there are too many contradictions in board Behavior between what they're saying and the guardrails and girls and they're not reflected in board behaviors such as the board Dynamics in public the boards characterization of public comment in her summaries of the ends of the meeting which seemed

[00:32:00]
Community engagement policy with no notice or input from stakeholders so thank you very much for your time and your attention and very grateful for the opportunity to speak thank you our next speaker is Sally Sally Ricky sorry silly so are you there can you hear me yes yeah hi I speak to you as a statue I have concern about the contract with the Council of great City Schools as a taxpayer I hope to see many staying in our community and schools with locally employed individuals not going to a corporation with Consultants furthermore the student outcomes Focus government seems to place deck

[00:33:00]
on a narrow scope of school measures and it doesn't seem to align with the goals and guardrails that were thoughtfully developed with Community engagement the Council of great City schools and their student outcomes governments is causing separation between the board members and their constituents which contradicts the purpose of the publicly elected school board members I would like to see more focus on school safety culturally welcome schools small class sizes healthy school lunches Transportation efforts toward gender and racial equity and so many other things that are not technically falling under student outcomes focused governance thanks thank you our next speaker is in the room drillaud followed by Mary Mary

[00:34:00]
good evening not a presidential school board members and superintendent this is part 2 from last meeting do you remember your oath of office section 22 - 5 - 4 or the public school code a local school board shall have the following powers or duties point a subject to the rules of the department to develop educational policy for the school district shouldn't you develop educational policies not sexual policies are protecting children from indoctrination with gender etiology should we must return to common sense of biology reality according to Federal Department of Education School the field to comply could consistent with applicable law facial investigation and moral Authority parents are the primary Protectors of their children period

[00:35:00]
write this and I quote as any mother would be I have been appalled to learn how schools are written in the hiding information about the mental and physical health of their students from parents end quote and no government agent as a taxpayer including the local schools should be keeping secrets from us about our child or children that will hinder our fundamental rights but just now please wrap up in a very quick short sentence thank you sir next speaker is Mary Mary the definition

[00:36:00]
reverses their gender transition and that may be through a surgery or through hormone blocking the author is anonymous the title is used when changes stopped feeling knew I started to miss when I was a kid and the pain is still despite what the doctors did they said that I see if I'm just selfish bitter and sad that I was angry or sometimes it's not easy to be so complacent the rejection of me it's hard to feel so helpless we're just following it doesn't matter if the news is on your side if you've got statistics if you think you have nothing to hide where all still out here

[00:37:00]
followed by Brian Rice you have one minute to the Federal grant of $422,031 from the US Department of Health and Human Services behavioral

[00:38:00]
Health grocery seeds tax executive order was issued and signed on January 28th 2025 buy our current president protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation these services that are offered by this by these clinics are gender from care and what's offered in a very well I want to know that what you're doing what you're doing is it protecting our kids when our parents are not able to know what their students are getting the ones that are 14 years and older do not require parental permission to obtain these services and these

[00:39:00]
do not have to disclose to parents which thank you ma'am Ryan rice you'll have one minute once you begin speaking thank you very much I come as a parent in regards to a fate violation I brought this to the attention of administrator Mackie at the school he has rebuffed me and gaslighting me so I'm bringing it to your attention my daughter has an IEP which states to help her understand what the assignments are or what the marriage was seven lines for a 2008 final project assignment the Fate violation is the assignment was created by Pierce and peers alone and to my understanding students are not trained to assess other students I showed this to Mr Mackey I put it where it said literally down here at the bottom at the second part 18 students by 14 points for 2522 possible points those were awarded

[00:40:00]
my daughter's school for her peers 14 poyntz so 18 students in the class 14 points 250 this was here assessed and that is not appropriate if we want student outcomes to change the perhaps we need to stop doing the lemons dance with the administrators and change them thank you thank you sir board member that completes public forum for this evening thank you to our public forum guests the next agenda item is agenda item 4.1 to consider adoption of the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance South evaluation for year 3/42 and before we begin our self-evaluation discussion I'd like to take a quick moment to introduce our staff and our board members who are our new sosg coach single Revolution

[00:41:00]
Central is on zoom and we received an email earlier this afternoon introducing sandal he's a former School Board member and was the vice president of the board in Chicago public schools and is a fully certified sosg coach I'd like to give sandal an opportunity just to come off camera real quick and just say hi everyone thank you to everyone else's and excited to have the opportunity to work with the Albuquerque Public Schools governance team and your continued progress towards being more focused on your governance and improving outcomes for your students that is the purpose of public schools and I think it's extremely important members on compensated and often thankless work important

[00:42:00]
quest to represent the division and values of the community and to stay focused on governing in a way that helps students achieve the Futures to which they are entitled I look forward to working with you and talking with each of you soon and joining you for future meetings as well thank you thank you and send it will be staying online for the self-evaluation discussion so if we have any questions about the sfg framework and need to phone a friend we have online to support us in that way as we all know student outcomes focused governance is a framework that is designed to drive the board's ability to function most effectively to deliver on our Collective promise to improve student outcomes this is the process is about what we're about to go through is the process for calibration and recalibration against the so if she rubric that allows us to align and realign our governing

[00:43:00]
behaviors with those most effective in creating the context for improving student outcomes and we're no longer we know their most effective because of the research base and the extensive research that has been done on this rubric board members have been asked to individually complete the self evaluation form for our actions from the last quarter the majority of us have done this all six of us completed it not necessarily by the deadline but I was able to incorporate all of the scores and submitted our individual results to to inform tonight's discussion and so since I received all of the scores as of yesterday I used today to conduct my analysis so I'm handing out right now so you can see the score so board members can see the scores that were provided by your peer board members before we begin does anyone have any questions

[00:44:00]
what about the processes of Sophie self-evaluation I will share our Collective scores for each competency and then I'll pause for questions or comments before proceeding at the end of the review will have a brief conversation about what we feel is possible by the end of our next quarter so we did receive scores from 6 board members and the total of those scores ranges from 30 to 63 so we have a range of 33 points in our evaluation across each competency there was not one where all six of us agreed so we'll go through and we'll discuss all six competencies and so what we have in front of us board members is each member score you have a column that indicates the consensus so that is the score that was most common or the most across all of the board member scores and then a final column that's calibrated and final so this is the

[00:45:00]
who are based off of a conversation with both of our sfg coaches this morning I'm going line by line through the Sox framework and each of our scores and so I can explain where there are differences and how we landed where we did but at the end of the day it'll be the six of us that are agreeing on the score that we settle on for this quarter and that we accept so for vision and goals individually board members rated us as having achieved what we ended up with as a consensus of a 35 if you're looking at the document there was a range here previously last quarter we had a 35 a couple of word members had us ranked at a 25 which had which would be that we would have lost a couple of points on the Mastery and those were to that was all related to the specific component around the process that we used to Garner feedback and whether that process led to community ownership of the goals and so there was some conversation around

[00:46:00]
how do we know if there's Community ownership that's a subjective rather but the reason that we rewarded ourselves 35 last time and why we should stay at 35 this time is because of the process of the process is the thing that we can measure the process was designed to be inclusive to include staff Educators students families and to get to that ownership so we all can make a case that we're not at ownership I'm sure I could walk out the door and ask somebody if they know about our goals and guardrails and they probably don't and they probably don't know them but the what what is being measured here is the process and So based on the conversation with our coaches the final recommendation is 35 points for vision and values and so I will open it up if anyone wants to share any evidence as to why you think we should have a different score

[00:47:00]
I I was one of the one of the board members who listed 25 points and potentially less than that though I opted for grace and the reason for Grace is because I am the Genesis of change and I have not broached this topic on the Dias prior to today and so I'll have my say and then I hope things will change to to help us move upward in those points we need to revisit the parameters that dictate when we are allowed and in quotation marks to ask for a root cause analysis so for example currently the root cause analysis sorry I remember doing is can you make sure that we're speaking

[00:48:00]
do you see the vision in goals and the rubric itself well I take it with the rubric itself what I'm suggesting is that which is fine but we do have to make sure that we're sticking to the agenda items and so I just want to make sure that we're not string from the self-evaluation this has to do with our self-evaluation I think I find it static I think it's time to rethink what we are measuring there has been let me get to that point and you mentioned it we've lost the community sense of ownership of the goals feedback from parents for example question best practices what best practices say about so much screen time as part of class time in the name of accomplishing goals one and two and that feedback tells me

[00:49:00]
but they don't fully understand the our process another topic is that we as a board have not been clear about the distinction between bored articulated goals and the superintendents control of interim goals and the interims are what we are measuring and that confusion has created a sense that we are report we have a reporting system that the community cannot follow or access and so while the rubric says okay you get 35% because you have these goals and guard rails there's a disconnect and it's time to take ownership of this rubric so that the vision aligns with our mission to inform the public

[00:50:00]
convert process thank you thank you is there any evidence as to whether the board to indicate that the board has not used a process that included students parents staff and community members to allow them to express their goals so I hear that you have issues with the process the framework itself and concerns about that but is there evidence that the board did not use a process so we don't earn that 35 and I know remember Jackson has your hands as well well yeah I am I had my hands because you actually just addressed the reason that I did 25 originally is that I probably could not walk out the door and say to anybody out there with the four goals are but we did go through a very robust process and in fact it was actually stated a few times in public forum that there was a robust process that we went through two established the goals

[00:51:00]
I feel confident that the process was done so I am putting my number back to 35 just for my mom so we are recommendation is 35305

[00:52:00]
of the community community was involved but often times I feel that we are not including the voice of the community in every moment of whatever action we take or whatever we do when it comes to that voice of community and so that was one reason for grade in it the way I did it and that was 25 to 35 there are some issues when it comes to how we not only here and listen to the community but the other thing is do we actually as a board take that conversation and effectively as a board hear out what's going on with the community and make some decisions because I repeatedly hear Community concerns but I don't see us taking

[00:53:00]
and I feel that the community when these concerns are brought up yes it seems like we're not hearing them and that we're just passing it by but I often feel yes when we're evaluating ourselves I think it's very apparent that we are lacking to really hear what's going on and then we want to grade ourselves as a board and we want to high score but I feel we're leaving out the voice of those who do really matter and that's my reason for 25 thank you so much for how we can improve Community engagement and how there's more that we can do to ensure that there's Community ownership over our goals which I agree with the rubric asks if there was a process used in 2022 that included students parents and community members and our coach

[00:54:00]
so we are we okay with 35 or do we want to move to 2512 the majority is okay with 35 okay so we'll put I'll keep 35 there and we will move to values and guardrails so individually board members rated us as having achieved a 10 and this is where the consensus the number that occurred the most was a 10 and the calibration was a 10 however we ranged from 5:00 to 15 and so if we're starting at 10:00 with our marker does anyone have any evidence for why we should not be attend that they would like to present not yes remember to make

[00:55:00]
again I find the rubric is not an alignment with we need to be we need to modify it to to fit the moment we've gone beyond I feel like it's a give me grade at this point we we've gone beyond yes we did a good job of listening to the community initially we came up with the goals and the guard rails but it's time to move forward and incorporate modify what the community is what is so and I hear you and I agree with you and we do have Community engagement later on our agenda on 6.2 but in terms of evidence to counter the score of 10 on values and guardrails do you have evidence and again this is related to

[00:56:00]
whether the superintendent has provided interim guardrail ending points that all interim guardrails pertain to outputs or outcomes that the board included students parents staff and community members in the guardrail development process the board has considered an adopted a theory of action all board guard rails last from 3 to 5 years and the guard rails interim guardrails and theories of action will challenge the organization annuity to bring and since you brought up I would argue that we have not done a good job of communicating those interims in fact it's been a point of contention among the community they don't understand they feel like we're we keep moving the goalposts we're changing rules and so that compels me to give us a five until we can modify things to fairly evaluate

[00:57:00]
where we stand with our community which I hear you but communicating guardrails is not on the rubric and so if there's evidence well I hear you that you believe it should be and we'll know that in the minutes are there others who had evidence or that we should not be a 10 or would suggest otherwise if not we can accept the 10 and move forward monitoring an accountability individual board members rated us as having achieved also although on this one we arranged from 0 to 10 and so what the 10 for monitoring and accountability includes is that we invest no less than 10% of our board authorized time monitoring our goals and yellow goals and guardrails monitoring calendar so we've marked off

[00:58:00]
those things we had a couple of zeros but in the conversation with our coach coaches the coaches agreed that we are at the approaching student outcomes column which is that 10 points so is there anyone who has evidence that we're not at the 10 and you would like to share I'm going to make a pitch again for free I'd like to see included meaningful Community engagement that leads the challenges the board toward continuous Improvement and yes I did receive a what I also had in my evaluation was that per the rubric to reach devoting 10% of our board meetings time on Pro

[00:59:00]
monitoring but coach pause reached out and clarified that through some new calculation and have yet to talk to her about it we came to 27% and until I know why I can't call him the time music with both of our coaches and there's a couple of things which I can just say quickly one was related to how the finance and audit committees were counted so there was an error there with those being counted and then the second was as it related to the community engagement hours and so bored services stopped at Manassas of the community engagement events that took place over this quarter and made an estimate of the amount of hours that would be so

[01:00:00]
the oriented in those and so those were then integrated and so with those two changes that shifted the numbers to 2737 26 277 so for the last quarter or time use was 27 percent based on the final review and so that has us at the 10 and I'll provide Grace and say 5:00 OK Google back up to 10 cuz with the presentation from last time we had 10% but with the evaluation from our coaches I'm with moving back

[01:01:00]
and I do have the documentation of that from the conversation that I had with the two coaches this morning so it's in the table and the time you monitoring but I'll share it in the weekly email so everyone can see that as well so we're we're good with 10 for monitoring and accountability okay for mostly mostly for communication and collaboration perhaps there was the most consensus here with the score of the one and this is for Unity and Trust so most of us rated one the most common number was a one and in the calibration conversation with our coaches we determined that it was sorry that it is a one that puts us in the approaching student outcomes category and I'll just say that we were very close to meeting student outcomes Focus which is the Five Points however we did have a couple of meetings that lasted more than three hours but other than that we're doing

[01:02:00]
student outcomes focused and so is everyone good with the one so the next one is continuous Improvement unity and Trust individually the range on this was from one to three the most common ranking was a one and the calibrated score was a one so for Unity and trust that would also put us in approaching student outcomes focusing student comes Focus that's the orange peaches yellowish column is there anyone who has evidence for why we would not be a one the process that we took

[01:03:00]
who is the annual governance manual review was worrisome I think it it showed in a very real way that we can't get past a 43 split on the board I mean some of our suggestions were completely shuttered out and so I think there is room for improvement husband and their response was there's not actually any research that suggests that split boards can't be functional

[01:04:00]
and in fact having multiple different perspectives is actually healthy in discourse but the research does however suggests that the indicators in the framework are actually correlated with effective and functional boards so we can have that conversation with our coaches and overview of the research should folks desire is there anyone else who would like to make the case that we do not deserve one or provide evidence okay so then we will move on to continuous Improvement so individually board members rated us as having achieved this is similar to Unity and Trust we range from 0 to 1 the most common ranking was a one and the calibrated number with our coaches is puts us in the approaching student outcomes Focus category there were questions about

[01:05:00]
how are tracking our use of time and if we're tracking the estimated annual cost of Staff time and so we are doing both of those things board Services has been working on tracking the annual cost of Staff time and shared a report with me the superintendent and the chief of staff yesterday and we're getting feedback on that from the council and we'll share that feedback back however we are doing the annual staff time counting and I can share that email with folks if you want to see that number but does anyone have evidence to suggest that we are not the one Madam president I did not I'm not going to suggest evidence that we're not at a one I agree with that but I just wanted to thank you for providing the information about the annual cost of Staff time because I did not check that box particularly because I didn't think that we had that information and so that would be helpful to see so thank you yeah we've it's collected quarterly and we've shared it quarterly

[01:06:00]
it's just another example of us trying to figure out exactly how to count it cuz it's really complex and we're working on it thank you and board Services is working on it and all APS staff is super amazing and we love you for supporting our board and Counting how much time you're spending supporting us thank you okay so with that then we'll do we have a one for continuous Improvement and so are total then for this quarter is a 58 and then now we need to set our goal for the next quarter I did have this conversation with our coaches as well but based on where we were lacking points I did mention the board meetings being over 3 hours if we can get those under three hours we gained those points there and there's one other one where we learn a lot of points but I can't find it in my notes but based on the recommendations from our coaches

[01:07:00]
would be at a 72 next quarter with some minor tweaks that would make a big difference so the recommended goal for next quarter is a 72 however I would like to open it up to the board and hear from Members what you believe is possible for the next self evaluation in the next quarter so who would like to share their thoughts on that I have yours I think did you project the three hours or under the three hours that'll give us four points and then I think a big chunk of the 10 would settle do you remember what was the other point where

[01:08:00]
is monitored at least four times per year and I believe you all are improving your new monitoring calendar your May 7th meeting or your schedule too yes thank you for that that's actually written on the top of my notes so that was where we didn't earn the points was because we're not monitoring every goal at least four times a year we are proving a new progress monitoring calendar potentially that's on the agenda on May 7th which would adjust that I'm so that way thank you for that I didn't need to phone a friend so we would earn those points and that would put us to 72 potentially does anyone have any other recommendations or feedback on how what you would recommend for the goal for next quarter

[01:09:00]
I just wanted to congratulate us for being able to check off attendance at all regularly scheduled board meetings with over 80% during the previous 3-month period when I analyze that I didn't think we were going to be able to meet that and we did so that's fantastic and I'm really glad we did so good participation yes we did discuss that in our calibration conversation so I could provide more context on why we made it so understand that we can move up and continuous Improvement after we do our training of community members on sfg so that it is in the community engagement calendar potentially set for July and that in continuous Improvement is the second indicator the board has hosted in board members have

[01:10:00]
so that would put us potentially to 75 as a goal for the next quarter do people feel okay with that let's do it all right okay 75 so at this time I will Entertain Entertain a motion in consideration of our quarterly self-evaluation and the motion picture of evaluation score of 58 points on the student outcomes focused governance self evaluation instruments is their emotion and a second I move that we I'm sorry I did not write that down so I moved that we accept oh thank you

[01:11:00]
I move that we accept the aps Board of Education student outcomes focused governance self-evaluation for year 3/4 to in the amount of 58 points is board member Benavides my apologies that's okay thank you for that we do that every single time so it's in my script and no one else has it we have emotion is there a second I'll second thank you is there any discussion all right Dr Albright can we have a roll call vote please I will go with the consensus with the understanding that next time I expect revisions in our next item is to cons

[01:12:00]
your approval of the consent agenda so at this point I need a motion and a second to approve items 5.1 through 5.3 I moved to prove consent agenda items 6.1 through 6.3 and I will second this is board member benavidez thank you we have emotion and a second to approve the consent agenda which is item 6.1 through 6.3 can we have a roll call vote please order I do believe it's 5.1 6.166

[01:13:00]
so the script that Dr Albright and I have I think is numbered incorrectly but the actual board agenda online has the consent agenda is 666.1 and 6.1 through 63 okay so we will vote on that and Miss Jackson motion videos in the next item on our agenda is agenda item 7.1 budget presentation on operational funds and federal state programs are presenters for this item are not apologize Chief Financial Officer Rosalinda Montoya executive director of budget and strategic planning doctor Antonio Gonzalez Deputy superintendent of leadership and learning and Dr Melanie executive director of federal and state programs are superintendent will

[01:14:00]
introduce this agenda items I'll turn it over to you Dr Blakey thank you madam president members of the board tonight's presentation is the final in a series of budget updates that we have shared with the board in the public over the past few months throughout the process we have welcomed questions and work to answer them as transparently as possible we have included all of the Q&A documents with each agenda as part of public record we've also played paid close attention to a question we hear often from board members which is what are you doing differently and I think that is a fair question and one that we have taken seriously and I hope that you see it as you review the information earlier presentations have highlighted some of the changes that we have made and you'll hear more of that tonight in your packet you saw a slide titled what we heard and what we've done and that reflects the work that we've done to change things including the establishment of the new federal and state programs office

[01:15:00]
this office was created to break down silos and ensure that Federal and State dollars are being used effectively and not duplicated across the district and aligned with what students need the most we have also tied our budgeting process to a performance framework that means that schools that are seeing strong outcomes get the autonomy to keep doing what is working well those that need more support or receiving more support with specific allocations and most importantly we are aligning the budget to our goals as you have seen in what you've reviewed you will continue seeing during our monitoring sessions we've come a long way in a year but this is just the beginning and we still face challenges like our declining enrollment a trend that we're seeing across the country but we also have momentum and I hope that you see that without the team and I are prepared to answer any questions that you may have over the presentation thank you

[01:16:00]
we're open for questions thank you board members are there any questions remember Jackson thank you I'm really excited because I've actually been waiting a year to ask this question almost a year so May 1st last year I we were discussing the budget and the question that I asked was well the statement I made was that I had been sitting in this chair for 3 years and I continue to hear that you guys were looking at programs you were looking at redundancies you were looking at efficiency and that you were working on it and that programs that potentially weren't bringing forth the benefit for our students that they should be that you would you were looking at it and at 7:04 p.m. and I know this because I

[01:17:00]
turn it back to review the the meeting at 7:04 p.m. I said so Dr Blakey can you assure me that when we discussed this budget in a year you will assure me that the redundancies and the inefficiencies have been looked at and addressed and you said yes so here we are almost a year later and my question is what evidence do you have with strategies have you undertaken some of them are listed in your budget presentation but what proof do you have that you have addressed and you have made the assurance that I asked a year ago as it relates to our budget especially given the fact that we have a larger budget now with fewer students and we need to make sure that those redundancies are taken care of so that as much funding as possible

[01:18:00]
get directly into the classroom for our students thank you board president and board member Jax and I think one of the first things is just looking I would guess that on May 1st there was a different Dynamic from just the presenters at the table so the first thing was really linking the academic side and the budget office together to build the budget and the team has worked really hard and you see that tonight that they're even sitting together not that they didn't like each other before but there's nothing together because we really wanted to make sure that the budget shows the priorities and are values and so the teams have come together to really work on that and I think Dr Gonzalez and Dr Blake can really speak to what we've done in looking particularly at duplication of that a lot of the work and the discernment of the work throughout the

[01:19:00]
I think there's several things that I like to point to at the macro level and then defer to Dr Blakey for some Dr Blair for some more specific examples one is the district reorganization to align to the Strategic plan so specific example of being the establishment of the federal and state programs office was put into place to really look at return on investment but a term that we like to use more so these days as we turn on learning is what we're doing really yielding a return on learning and we have several examples where we have really look at looked at that critically weave to reduce and eliminating duplication of efforts with the reorganization of our district to really look at our federal funds in a district lens not a departmental lens in other words

[01:20:00]
we get our Title One money and we establish a Title 1 Department we get our title to money and we establish a title to Department title 3 title for Medicaid and so on but really looking at our federal funds as a whole to achieve a district set of goals and that is something that we could not have told you a year ago that is the case now looking at these Monies to really capitalize on a district initiative a district strategic plan and a district approach on how we are really moving to work forward we're not shy away from program evaluation in fact there's a guest in our audience this evening that's helping us do this as we look strategically at program evaluation what materials are we using what programs are we evaluating are we being honest with ourselves on the return on learning and if there are programs that we have been using that are not yielding success in terms of student

[01:21:00]
we need to be bold and we need to be able to say that we are going to strategically abandoned some of those initiatives that work has already yielded 2 million in Project abandonment in terms of the work that we're doing along those lines and there's other programs that we're looking at in terms of return on learning there's another piece that I think is important to recognize and that is we are no longer purchasing materials that are not highly instructional materials that they need to be able to fit that definition in terms of what we are doing but it's not stopping there because I think that quite frankly is just the first half step it's really taking that change in adult behavior and supporting the Magic in the classroom which is high quality instruction with support that

[01:22:00]
are practitioners are teachers are educators are able to use those materials in a meaningful way in the classroom so member Jackson I think the Bold work the hard work around strategic abandonment project alignment of resources the emphasis on return on learning and the elimination of duplication of efforts is the work that defines our Approach at this time and I would like to ask Dr Blair to give us maybe some more specific examples good evening period

[01:23:00]
great here's some extra money but what do we do with that and how does it melt or weld I should say with our our plan one of the things I did initially is I asked a lot of questions I'm a program person I'm a former principal and former principal supervisor so when Dr Gonzalez said you're going to do this now I looked at it from the program side because that's where I am familiar with doing this work and I said why are we spending x amount of money on this thing what's the purpose what's the data I asked a lot of questions so we brought in departments every quarter and ask them those questions you asked for this amount of money you received this amount of money what are you doing with it are you doing professional development great but what comes after that professional development how do we know that that changed anything in the classroom or with a resource counselors or nurses so on and so forth similar like we do in schools with 90 Day plans which is what I was familiar with we're doing a similar process with departments where we're asking them to identify their primary

[01:24:00]
what is going to change for students and then what do you need on the resource side to get that to happen and then we want you to provide the data so that process is significantly different and I can tell you that a lot of questions have been asked and people are doing a lot of self-reflection on what is it they're spending the dollars on another thing that we did is with the exception of Grant Administration all Title One allocation is going directly to schools so we are no longer pulling anything from the top every penny is going to schools and that is a significant change the other thing I don't want to get to the weeds but the other thing is really looking at strategic abandonment so not only what are we doing but what is the outcome we want to have and even if it's not a duplication if there isn't an outcome that we don't want that is also on the table for strategic abandonment so those are kind of three big examples of how we're doing things differently

[01:25:00]
okay thank you I'm sorry my daughter just texted me so I got distracted for a second that's what yes I am thrilled that a year later you are able to give me answers to a very specific question and I wrote down the two million dollars in abandonment and the high quality instructional materials and the fact that all Title One many is now going directly to our students and I think that's the biggest issue is it's the Strategic abandonment the look at inefficiencies is done in an effort to make sure that as much gets in front of our kids as possible to drive student outcomes right it's not just about placing money in front of them or please in materials in front of them it's how are those materials being used so that

[01:26:00]
I'm sure I will have a follow-up question as we discussed but for right now I really appreciate the work that you've put in over the year and answer to that question thank you so I'll just add in response and follow up I did have a follow-up question to one of the pre submitted questions which is not necessarily budget related but it is more academic related and so Dr consulate I think you answered it I do have a little bit further of a follow-up follow-up so the question was question number 20 on high quality instructional materials what percentage of instructional materials have been aligned so we know now that we're no longer allowed to purchase not aligned instructional materials which is like amazing you don't want me to sing but I would sing fantastic super cool great excellent the rest of the question was what are the projected academic outcomes and cost-savings resulting from the discontinuation of not aligned materials so I know

[01:27:00]
you cannot directly calculate projected academic outcomes based on discontinuing non-aligned materials and so my question is so you can answer it now or you can hold it to guardrail 3 monitoring but it really is around this question of discontinuing non-aligned material so we're no longer purchasing non-aligned materials however I do hear a lot from parents and community members and school leaders about not allowed materials still being present in our classrooms and still being used and so Dr Blakey I'll just is that something you want to hold for girl three monitoring or is yes for president you will see that in real 3 okay and so in that particularly is connected to the performance framework as well awesome okay thank you for that and so that was just a follow-up to the follow-up to the question here are there any other board questions on the budget

[01:28:00]
I'd like to follow up to number Dominguez Jackson's point and yes I love the strategy that has been implemented and the addition of Dr Blair however I need to ask and I just wrote this down there is a difference between a distinction between high quality instructional material and high quality instruction that is informed by community and this is critical in terms of our community school alignment we have 60 schools 61 Community Schools and and I've been

[01:29:00]
in conversation with people that are part of the collaborative the partnership that were part of and what really came home for me especially at the National School Board Association conference was the importance of culturally relevant material and I have to say I am not impressed with amplifies focus on excerpts I'm an English teacher you have to read and this is something that I noticed in my final year of teaching in Texas Johnson City Texas in preparation for the star test I never got a chance to teach a full novel they were always excerpts and that really bothered me had I stayed longer that would have been the first thing I would

[01:30:00]
change and so while I appreciate that we are focusing on high-quality instructional materials I want to equally focus on high quality instruction grounded in the needs of our culturally rich and vibrant communities because when we're focused so hard on literacy and numeracy and achievement that is a deficit Focus for so many of our kids and this is the feedback I'm getting from parents and parents with kids who have a higher functioning level so where is that where is the cultural relevance happening

[01:31:00]
those the professional development and the instruction that takes place there

[01:32:00]
there there is there is quite a bit of resources that go into that that department so there's part of the answer to your question as long as we funding chapter books and novels so I just want to interject here that we all have opinions about what should be funded and we delegate the decisions on what should be funded particularly in terms of literacy instruction to the superintendent and her team and so we need to make sure that we're keeping our questions at the board level on budget and so Dr Gonzales if you can respond specifically as it relates to what we're funding in terms of strategy and acknowledge that guardrail 3 does states that the superintendent will not allow curriculum that is not culturally linguistic culturally in linguistically responsive so it is a guardrail and we'll monitor her that particular Point around if there's CLR instruction in the garden real conversation but will keep this to the budget and funding of cultural linguistically responsive instructions about Dominguez

[01:33:00]
members of the board superintendent Dr Blakey I can assure you that that is indeed a value that we share in terms of the funding that is going out and I'll give you a few examples the action taken just a moment ago by the board to approve the bilingual Multicultural application on the part of Albuquerque Public Schools to the state within it in beds funds for culturally and linguistically relevant materials as well as professional development as well as community outreach to be able to support school and teachers on the ground to be able to do the work that you're losing to I can also tell you that there's just a couple of weeks away from several examples that we have in terms of Summer opportunities for our teachers to engage in the professional development of the use of these materials aimed at

[01:34:00]
play the instruction within the classroom so there are countless I'm pleased to share opportunities where budgets being used to be able to achieve that it so I know we're going to cover interims guardrail 3 later but I just want to know that there's nothing in our guard rails to ensure or it's not it's not specifically but thank you for your answer and thank you for the work behind all this other questions from the board yes I remember don't worry too but the past two days I was attending the special educational and I'm sure you're aware of our modified program

[01:35:00]
turn the graduation requirements that is will soon be exiting out and I noticed and the reason for that was the increase of CTE funding I don't know if it's enough time to State whether you know what's going to happen how is the funding going to take on this Avenue of getting rid of the career graduation diploma or the modified and during the workshop and PD answered it was because of the increase of our CTE funding that that was taken away so I don't know what the plan is for APS to take that on and how are we going to inform parents and families because I know is it with this freshman class we're doing that yes and and what does that look like

[01:36:00]
what president board members superintendent Blakey one of our goals with CTE is definitely in breeding of funds so we've been looking at our funds for operational for consumable supplies we've been looking at our instructional materials funds also are SB 9 Capital funds and of course are CTE state and federal funds and by being able to braid all those we feel like we are going to be able to support those programs so I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Dr Blanchett talk about some of the state and federal funds and the programs of study Madam president number to Murray to superintendent March updated the programs of study for the course sequencing so one of the things we're doing currently with the federal and state

[01:37:00]
is making sure that all of our high schools have a program of study with the three-course sequence and remember that the programs of study aligned to Highway jobs as well as in demand professions so we're making sure that and especially now with the course changes that the courses that were offering at each high school for that program of study aligned so students finish with a completed course with the certification with dual credit or making sure that we're setting them up in their course sequence starting next school year that everything is tied up and that the funding aligns directly to those programs of study so those students do finish ready for the career of questions so do you expect the transition plants to look a little more different or how do you record a study or how do we think how are we going to implement that we're parents can understand that this is the Avenue and this is what we're pursuing for these four students and career Readiness they're just as a point of sorry

[01:38:00]
we can refer that one to after the meeting as well thank you other budget questions thank you so much thank you all for being here this evening and for providing such a wonderful comprehensive report that I think is is easy for everybody who's reading it to understand and also thank you for answering our questions because I know I submitted quite a few on this topic and also thank you for establishing the federal and state program office I think that's fantastic and it's very helpful so my question is in reference to question 21 and I'll go ahead and read it read the response and then my follow up just so that anybody watching can have some contacts so contract duplication elimination how many external contracts have been discontinued due to duplication of services and what is the total anticipated savings or reallocation amount to be reported and the 25/26 adopted by budget and so the answer is three external

[01:39:00]
tracks have been discontinued that add up to approximately 1.5 million dollars and so you know that's great we want to save money where we can but for the people watching at home and for the constituents I speak to and almost everybody I come into contact with APS has a 2 billion dollar budget and obviously that's a very very very very very small percentage and so can you provide some additional information and if you can't now that's okay but out of so you just continue three external contracts out of how many and what is their Collective total don't think we have that information off the top of her head but we could get that to you there's also a board president and board member of benavidez those are the programmatic contracts in his doctor said we can continue to look at it I think the other important thing is that there's also been consolidation of departments so there's money that has been

[01:40:00]
also captured just in duplication of literal positions that were doing the same thing in multiple departments and as Dr Gonzales mentioned we had you know a lot of these funds were were running divisions outside other divisions and so there wasn't a coordinated effort so there's a lot of we had duplication of positions to so there's money that's also captured through some of that wonderful thank you great thank you before we Circle background I'm sorry I had my question which is what budgeting strategies are you using to ensure that the funds are targeted effectively to our Martinez population students I can start with that and then the team can also answer so

[01:41:00]
board president and members of the board what are the main things we have done is really looked at how everything we're doing is aligned to achieving the goals and so a lot of the questions you have also could be seen as far as how do we know this is working I think one of you had mentioned that earlier it's through the monitoring of the goals right so because we're putting all these things in place to make sure that we are setting structures up in order to meet the needs of the goals so one of the big things that we did was in the performance framework and that is particularly looking at how we are supporting schools that need more support in meeting the Yazi Martinez ruling that we have and so we're really looking at how are we looking at each of these individual programs each of these individual positions how are they aligned to our goal and how are they

[01:42:00]
aligned to schools that are having more difficulty in making changes their so that's kind of like the broad level of how we've looked at it and then within the budget of the More granule Level you'll see where there's like line items specifically and I don't know if you all want to speak to to that particularly like with special education you'll see it with our community school coordinators or transformational coaches in the equity Department you'll see where there's specific programs or initiatives that are being funded more strategically Dr Gonzalez presidential

[01:43:00]
and that is not a one-time thing as it previously was support example schools were often working on the budget drink budget season well the budget we know is a living breathing resource and Alignment is ongoing and it's not isolated to one time in the year so for example schools and principals next month in May after principal meeting will be doing an exercise of further Deep dive into their budget in alignment to their 90-day plan and that may mean that they adjust some of their expenditures that may mean they realize things but that is a direct example of how we are continuing to have the 90-day plan the continuous Improvement mechanism and the resource the budget in alignment on an ongoing basis so that it isn't isolated to a single point in time

[01:44:00]
and that we just wait until a year from now to see if it worked or not in specific support of the goals which are built around are you guys in Martinez students and I think coupled with that doctor Gonzalez has been working with the assistant superintendents on a principal scorecard so the principals all with their supervisors are able to look at and expected to look at their data and it's a segregated fashion regularly I even know from going to school visits the principal's often pull out their scorecard to show what the date is showing of where they are doing well and where they're struggling with populations of students likewise then the principal scorecard allows the assistant superintendent to work with the principal on how is your budget just as the district at this macro level we're looking at it the assistant superintendents are able to work with the principals as a micro level of how are you

[01:45:00]
in your budget to worry the data on your scorecard is showing that you need to make advances thank you for that that's really awesome and I think underscore some of the earlier points that you shared in response to member Jackson's question around forging more coherence by connecting 90 Day plans to principal about evaluations principal score cards to the budget to the goals in the guardrails which is great I do have a follow-up which is related specifically to one of the points that you made Dr Blakey around how we could see these more targeted efforts for Martinez students show up in the different budget areas so you mentioned special education budget and there was also a question number 9 related to special education so the question is essentially what measurable improvements and student outcomes are Service delivery are expected as a result of increased funding for special education and I want

[01:46:00]
to take that information or that question and parent with what was shared in the Indian policy and procedures meeting the IPP meeting that was this week so in that APS staff presented data on Native American students as is common and one of the things that was shared is when it comes to Native Native American enrollment in APS that included that 34% of native students receive special education services so 34% of native students the average is around 15% of students identified for special education so there's a lot more native students are being identified for special education so that's just the second thing I want to let sit the third thing the other day the other piece of data that was shared in the IPP is only 2% of native students participate in gifted so this is far below the average for gifted participation for Native students as well so if Yazi Martinez targets native student specifically we are

[01:47:00]
increase in funding for students with disabilities and Native students are potentially still over identified for special education and under identified for gifted how does how do we make all of that make sense what strategies are being used to address identification strategies specifically when it comes to how will this budget relate to strategies to improve teacher training on identification for Native students and special education and potentially for gifted it was looking at Miss compost to see if she wanted to come and answer the question I know Miss risers on two but I think that this question is compost has a lot of background knowledge what we're putting into place which I appreciate and you're more than welcome to come up I do want to make sure that we are from my reminders to everyone else staying to the budget part of the conversation so if they're budget changes that Miss compost can speak to as it relates to over identification of native students and special education welcome Miss compost doctor

[01:48:00]
thank you thank you for president members of the board Dr Blakey so to be a little brief on this and actually that is fine so as of January Indian education as well as Language and Cultural Equity of course as well as our Equity office and then you can Opportunity Services came under kind of the equity umbrella so this is one of the things like doctor play he was mentioning is how are we changing our Dynamic and looking at our departments that were not being silent so one of the things in general just in this is a budget piece is so each of these departments have their own budget but now that they're under Equity were able to look at all of these budgets and how are we able to leverage those badges as a hole so Equity Indiana education we are doing very

[01:49:00]
things that we the forests are examples some of these statistics that we know are not good statistics for our Native American students those are African-American students and other students where can we move and utilize different funding sources or different staff that we can utilize these things in a much better place I'm also working with Dr Blair on all of our federal funding for all of these departments and again how are we leveraging these things so next year we are looking at and this is part of what doctor play is doing as well with our federal funding how are we using our federal funding better to be able to look at it again how can we go and be able to address a lot of these things much more strategically and directly on there so that is part of our idea for school year 2526 and I think additionally it's hard because I was trying to answer it as a budget question and not everything needs money attached to it so some of

[01:50:00]
the statistics that you brought up about Native Americans it's not necessarily a budget question but a lot of work that Miss Jet and missile Dean are doing on mlss and set is connected to how we are working on the over identification of students but it's not necessarily a budget question so that's why it was kind of hard to answer it specific to the budget because not everything we need to do differently involves money I appreciate and so that's why I tied it to the question nine in particular so if there's an increase in funding for special education and then there's a challenge that we're aware of particularly as it relates to Native students and special education how does that drive so I appreciate the response particularly related to braiding and leveraging those funds across those different divisions and what this could look like going forward Dr Gonzalez you want to add a monetary

[01:51:00]
or budget implication related to targeted support for the new eligibilities around gifted education for example leadership as an example there are different ways now students are potentially able to qualify for gifted education so as we look at this for all students but specifically to your point our Native American students there are several examples as we've seen over the last several weeks just within the last several weeks in regards to bilingual season there are potentially several examples there where students would qualify for gifted education based on some of the new eligibilities afforded to all students under gifted in in New Mexico which is awesome I know don't worry has a follow-up I just

[01:52:00]
clothes that line of question from from me with some of his compost you mentioned how Multicultural education Indian education and well actually the microphone is going to go to miss play but doctor play are all under you and then special education is not though right that's separate and so that seems that something that Dr Lee would be working on to ensure that the idea and special education funds are also coordinated with his shop so can you just speak to that like what that looks like and how you're making sure that those special education funds are targeted Martinez students Madam president members of the board superintendent Blakey at this time I do not see Ida funds I will say that we at 8:00 p.m. is participating in the unified application meaning that for titles 1 234 and Ida we all submitted one application so there is more coherence than there's ever been but it's not quite as coherent as you're making it out okay but we'll get

[01:53:00]
we will special education is under the chief academic officer because we feel like it's very needed to be aligned to the goals as students are in go one with special education services and in the past when we had special education as a department on the side it implied that special education is a place that students go not a service of the organization regardless of where it says it's just wanting to make sure that the funding streams are coordinated and what I'm hearing from Miss compost is that's a priority and something they're working on so that's awesome and then remember you had to follow up yes and I'm only saying this because of my own son and the ability to not he's twice exceptional so I wanted to know when we do see these high numbers within Native American students have we also looked at the testing for some of these

[01:54:00]
we're going to be twice exceptional tie in both the gifted and the special ed area the board member to marito members of the board doctorate we are working and so that's part of the Desiree is then how are we is from at the academic side as well as equity and other pieces how are we collaborating and talking about these things in a day-to-day matter so again we're not we're not connecting those another piece of that and for our statistics from Native Americans to African-Americans is also part of our Equal Opportunity Services Department is under

[01:55:00]
so we are also monitoring many of those things particularly again special ed disability is part of a civil rights so we are looking at those statistics that way and looking at again what are those disproportionate numbers and through that office as well how are we identifying and we can look and then I know this is a budget discussion but as Dr Blake he was mentioning these go ahead and then also looking at the cultural pieces of that again many times you know my son's kind of the same thing he qualified for services but he also had some exceptional pieces but as a native student from a cultural perspective are we acknowledging those things are understanding those things so intense again going back to be looking at how are we actually looking at cultural relevancy professional development making sure we're not looking at biases that

[01:56:00]
over identifying or under identifying and how can we support our schools with that thank you so we will move now to additional board member questions thank you Miss compost are there other questions member Jackson maybe appears to possibly have a question Madam president so my question is in relation to the state Equalization guarantee it is on page 11 of our packet but it kind of Dives down a little bit further so the legislature just voted to increase the second to increase the unit value in the said for the secondary factor which means that we will get more money for students in grades 6 through 12 so my question is where is that funding going and second to that will schools have will schools have

[01:57:00]
will it be site funded and will schools have the ability to kind of make the decisions on where that funding goes out of school level thank you so board member Jackson for president members of the boards were in Tennessee I wanted to bring your attention to slide 7 so if you look at flight 7 it's titled budget positives not first little green block to the left you can see right here when the bill was first introduced at 6:00 separate from 7:30 to 12:00 so just wanted to bring to your attention that this is combined now that the governor has signed it and it is 6:30 with a factor of 1.30

[01:58:00]
that is going to change because as you can see we put subject to change cuz of this documents put together before the governor signed it so you will see the change in this and you will see final numbers in May as far as these factors they are above the line so those factors are a part of the the funds that are flexible so you can see inside I'm sorry 10:00 or we talked about what is new what is continued what is increasing and what is different in the in the new ones is the Academy of Albuquerque and then you can see the Middle School interdisciplinary team meeting and also opening of 9th grade adding 6th grade

[01:59:00]
8th grade adding another 8th grade to Jonathan and aligning the CTE programs a lot of that secondary funding will be used for those specific programs and I don't know if Dr Gonzalez so the money that from the secondary Factor it all goes into the big pots so the love of the line is all so it's not specific that that means that each school that is in the secondary Factor will get this amount it goes into the big pot that thing that gets distributed to all the schools so as a follow-up then so I guess what is the benefit of putting it into a big pot for the entire District instead of Distributing it to the individual schools to allow

[02:00:00]
them to determine the the the the the the the the light level funding board president and member of Jackson members of the board we always prefer to have money above the line that isn't as restricted because when you put it below the line and there's more restrictions on the schools then you can't do as much with everyone else so meaning that when we're able to find some of these Middle School initiatives or put it into the pot to be able to expand the kids schools it gives more flexibility as a district holistically because we don't the Staffing formula formula that we use in order to staff middle school high school and Elementary have always had to kind of borrow money from It's Always In the big pot so if it were to be piecemealed as far as Elementary can only use from below the line and for this amount and middle school can only use this High School can only use this

[02:01:00]
the budget team go crazy because that would mean we can't find anything because we wouldn't have enough to move around to be able to have the flexibility that we're able to kind of put funds into a big pot that allows us to be more flexible with her friends but then allows the schools as an instructional Council to be more flexible with what they have but we don't have the amount of money that would that we have always been basically caring for a thing for a term we've been carrying the Middle School in the funding from being able to pull money from the elementary or the high school because of the way that were funded so anything below the line restricts us to be able to fund schools at schools on the budget

[02:02:00]
anticipated with the enhanced support for Career and Technical education and what is the timeline for reporting results

[02:03:00]
Twisted percentage increases but first I'd like to know what are the wrong numbers behind those percentage increases and how will your strategy the answer that you provided how these address are most disengaged population and in particular r e l l students who are I think more vulnerable than ever increase in CTE concentrator enrollment by the end of school year 26 but 10% of what do they look like

[02:04:00]
and how are we funding I think again making sure we're focused on the budget part of the question so how are we funding the increase in enrollment on CTE that were protecting to have well yes but we I think we need to know numbers in terms for the purpose of knowing are we growing programs what are we funding Madam president I don't have numbers for you but I can't answer part of the question in order to be aligned with Perkins funding we at APS for every program of study that were funding have to offer a 3/4 sequence we have to do that we're not doing a great job of that right now moving into next year the funding is completely 100% aligned to programs of study that have the three course sequence in Edition Perkins lost that we have to emphasize special populations so students

[02:05:00]
sequence we are providing opportunity for students to attain certifications increase in certifications increase in workplace learning opportunities and increase in completion of April dual credit courses so that's the second part and then I think we can work on getting you the answer to the first part okay thank you dot well I do have a follow-up that's related to funding and board member Jackson's question about above the line and a big pot concept so we know that the governor signed the law saying that we are required to give everybody all staff a 4% increase

[02:06:00]
versus an average of 4% so how is this going to impact your plans and what what what what what's the plan for president and member Dominguez and I can have missed a speak more specifically to it but that is kind of what the question is with above the line versus below the line and a secondary Factor you have to remember that more than the well I guess the majority of our funding I was going to say more than the majority but that's not really saying the same thing the majority of our funding goes to Personnel a middle school teacher and an elementary school teacher in a high school teacher all make the same salary we don't distinguish that if you teach Middle School you get paid different than if you teach elementary school so because of that that's why that secondary factor and it being above the

[02:07:00]
is really important because if more than you know if 90% of your budget goes to personnel and you have to pay all of the teachers the 4% and all employees of 4% then we need the bucket to be as broad as possible to be able to because that bucket is used for employees so that secondary Factor going up is what helps us to be able to fund the 4% raise for all employees Miss Albedo do you want to speak more specifically to how that is yes thank you you can see we have the resources and then the expenditures call that goes

[02:08:00]
go to the schools and goes out to the Departments we anticipate that 4% so we put it in ahead of time so as you see these expenditures for schools and departments we have put that 4% into their as we're building our budget so you were anticipating a required across the board 4% we were listening to the committee meeting and listening to the album thank you any other questions under academic strategy plan

[02:09:00]
with behaviors being an issue District y k through 12 just wanted to know more about the behavior is that district-wide what is that number look like that we're going to be using funding for presidential superintendent Blakey this is part of the the response that all schools receive federal funds so to your question specifically Behavior directors this is at all elementary schools right now there's an enrollment requirements for elementary schools to receive above a part-time behavior and moving into next year all elementary schools regardless of enrollment will receive a 1.0 behavior that is shown to be successful in elementary schools at curbing student behavior and I want to point out doctor's being humble about that decision but I like vividly remember that it was at one of the budget Town Halls that you will hosted when we heard from

[02:10:00]
play constituents that they really wanted more support for behavior and behavior and she was there thinking like wait I think we can make this work so from that taking the input from the public sometimes we don't see what happens in those meetings but that was a very tangible her being there and hearing that thinking I can go back and figure out how we can make that work if we didn't have that office established it would have been in a silo where the person might not have even heard that that was a need or how to leverage the funds but the response for behaviors specifically one for every Elementary School is from listening to the community and being flexible with the funds that we get and being responsive will it fix everything certainly not will it fix something and help start to put some systems in place where it's not based on enrollment yeah it will be very helpful to our elementary school

[02:11:00]
that's really exciting to hear so thank you for sharing that and thank you Dr Boyle for the work and maybe perhaps Noah can include that in the journal about how good we are at listening to our community and responding to directly meet their needs by making sure there's a behavior redirector in every Elementary School maybe I have my Albuquerque Journal sitting right here she does are there other questions related to the budget yes ok Google so this is a follow-up to questions one and two it's actually more to how much money is considered discretionary

[02:12:00]
or what let me just ask a question well how much money is discretionary I didn't get that dollar amount and I'd like to know how much of money is considered discretionary how much was considered discretionary for 24/25 and how much is your prediction for 2526 discretionary to the full budget I think the question was about below the line I think yes yes because you were asking discretionary yes

[02:13:00]
and and yes how much like raw numbers and then what percentage of the budget is that and I think you listed how those funds are primarily allocated what programs were funded so I put the estimated 985

[02:14:00]
initiatives that we have to apply for to get the money below the line so it's not like when we get the funding from PD that's why the sdg is so important because that's above the line below the line funding isn't actually all just given to us many of them

[02:15:00]
very specific initiatives below the line that the district has to apply for to be able to receive those funds and I think so it's correct to say structure literacy early literacy Community Schools implementation is there was a whole listing I will make sure to provide you the percentage of operational categorical it comes on pulled back to The Grand Tour so it is not okay so it is

[02:16:00]
what's the term you used it is categorical they're essentially state grants that you for initiatives and so yes what what what what was that amount in 2425 and then what is the predicted amount that you apply for for below the line funding I will be able to provide you the number for 2625 so what programs are funded by these

[02:17:00]
categorical monies if any are at greatest risk of being cut if any I know that we were doing and I asked the question because we were doing reviews of what was working what was not what were we going to jettison etcetera so are you talking about below the line funding yes the categorical funds right now there's we have not received any confirmation if there's any funds of being in danger of not being renewed or allocated as long as we follow the Grant application guidelines so as far as state funding is concerned as long as we apply and meet the requirements we have not received

[02:18:00]
communication that we wouldn't be funded great so I think when you were asking endangered being cut your suggesting in danger of being cut by this Administration as part of the ROI work or are you suggesting being cut by the statement well yes all of that I mean things in there's so much in flux right now it's hard to in so many buckets for clarification the state below the line funding are all initiatives that were funded out of house bill to just recently so those aren't anything that was cut and I don't know any of the top of my head that were funded last year below the line that are not funded this year below the line I haven't heard of anything that we that came our way that we were concerned about that wasn't so anything that is below the line for State funding

[02:19:00]
it has been signed by the governor and is in the budget for next year so there isn't anything that's like iffy for any of the state funds that have been approved by the legislature and signed by the governor anything that would have been vetoed the time has passed and things have been signed so those funds are secure okay it's and it's hard to gather all this from the language right because the answer was highly Technical and assumes that we know something that so I just a reminder that this goes out to the public and they don't know how to make sense of this the answers so just it's helpful when we get these details for the constituents that we serve

[02:20:00]
but I would encourage you to do a historical deep dot particularly Elementary Schools they're not facing any kind of cuts in programs

[02:21:00]
Behavior Behavior read directional list all elementary schools regardless of size will receive a behavior redirector the schools their budgets that they received prior to this so they received their budgets in March I believe those are based on enrollment so it's hard to say if schools lose anything in Personnel it's because they lost students in our schools are funded by how many students they have so for example if they have if a school have an assistant principal this year but then they lost enrollment and they went under the number of students that a School receives in the system principal then they would have lost an assistant principal so that's why when we talked about you know small schools being expensive it's

[02:22:00]
cuz we tried to limit as much as that as we can but if they do fall under the threshold of funding then schools do that's when you'll see schools that have half a librarian or half a nurse or have an assistant principal or no assistant principal if any schools fall under that population then they do lose those but that's basically on school size not on budget it's not a budget cut because of funding it's a budget cut because of students additional questions yes what services do you have a listing of those positions that have been cut due to lower enrollment

[02:23:00]
Madam president member Dominguez members of the board of superintendent Dr Blakey we do have a bunch of formula which has a student enrollment correlation to the FTE that is allocated for assistant principal librarian number of teachers and so on Down the Line we do have that yes so if a school lawsuits in their budget and then when they got their budget for next year they have 21 because they lost students so they don't they're the formula doesn't justify that they need the two additional teachers and so the team works on all of those adjustments and likewise on the flip side of schools are up and enrollment then those schools receive additional ft in addition to that is

[02:24:00]
what team is working really Cincinnati on a weekly basis to look at student registration student enrollment and to ensure that we are in compliance that is an ongoing thing well into the fall because we have to be in compliance with a statue in our collective bargaining agreement to make sure that we are providing each School the number of teachers that they need to serve their student population and that's all going okay and there's just some confusion I think is what I'm gathering about the why and I think the other

[02:25:00]
so yes I just wrote the public needs more Guidance with regard to this link that you provided on Staffing School budgeting and if there's anything that I need more information on this again I'd like to thank you for your very thorough presentation for all of the presentations you've provided on the website as well I do want to underscore appreciation for the

[02:26:00]
is that you've made to the budget process as a result of questions from the board as a result of alignment test of FG as a result of feedback from the community that's super awesome and I hope the community hears that and recognizes that I also just want to acknowledge your work to on spending down our federal funds to the penny there has been a lot of coverage in the media around some crisis related to Sr funds and how they're being spent down and it's just really fantastic to be able to be in a place where we can say our district did what we were supposed to because we have professionals on the team who know what they're doing so just want to express appreciation to the full Finance team and to you Dr Blakey for making sure that happens to 27 cents I don't know if there's like some competition for who did it best I think we would win the other thing I want to acknowledge is that in the process of going through student outcomes Focus governance of hiring a new superintendent

[02:27:00]
and of trying to realign our budget to the goals in the guardrails we've had consistent conversations around how much time it would take how difficult it would be and conversations around some of the trade-off decisions that would have to be made Dr Blakey has previewed these trade-off decisions in a variety of different forms part of that has been related to the right-sizing initiatives part of it has been related to the performance framework and so important to acknowledge that when we are trying to be Equitable when we're trying to reach our goals and guardrails there are trade-offs and so funding is moved from one to another one school to another one group of students to another and that is not great for those who are losing out so to speak of the funds and I just want to express appreciation again until you Dr Blakey for having previewed that having previews could anticipate some feedback on that around how people feel to lose funds particularly as it relates

[02:28:00]
and these are difficult decisions that need to be made but appreciate the work that you're all doing and then the last thing I'll say on the budget is this is our second to final presentation on the budget we've had them in every meeting and thank you for presenting to us the calendar for the budget adoption which we've been sticking to which is great as well so our final budget presentation will be during the May 7th meeting when we will also approve the budget will have those materials in advance we are expected to review those materials in advance to submit our questions in advance and to review the answers in advance that is our role as board members to make sure that we are doing that and fulfilling our duty to make sure we're coming prepared to have conversation around at the budget and able to come into this conversation approving it so that final presentation is not a presentation where we're asking technical questions in the weeds because we have lots of opportunities

[02:29:00]
music across all of the different program areas to ask those questions previously we've also shared sample budget questions from a couple of different sources from Edwards there was one other one and the Council of great City Schools ERS that are related specifically to the board rule which do underscore that our role is not to develop the budget so our role is not to determine what the budget should include based on what we think our priorities are even what we think the communities priorities are because we delegate that authority to the district our role is to approve the budget to ensure that it's aligned to our goals and guardrails and that it's following all legal requirements so making sure we're staying in our lane on the budget but again thank you to our presenters for that and we will move on to the next agenda item under discussion items which is agenda item 6.2 this is a presentation of the Board of Education Community engagement calendar right now this is presentation and

[02:30:00]
discussion so that board members can provide additional feedback to the committee on this calendar on our community engagement we will come except and make revisions to the community engagement calendar and turn that back around so we can vote to accept the community engagement calendar in the May 7th meeting one of the things that our board has done is to make it clearer and easier for board members and the public we've put our progress monitoring calendar and our community engagement calendar in one single document so on May 7th we will be approving the progress monitoring calendar as one vote and the community engagement calendar as another vote but they're the same document so just want to make sure that we're clear about those distinctions and the opportunity to provide feedback on the community engagement in particular because we own that and so on our materials that were shared in advance we have an opportunity to ask questions until go ahead and turn it over to our presenter who is the chair of our ad hoc committee on community engagement

[02:31:00]
thank you madam president so we all have in front of us the proposed to your monitoring calendar and just as a little bit of background the proposed to your monitoring calendar is was discussed in the community ad hoc sorry Community engagement ad hoc committee and we collectively gave our input and this is what you are seeing in front of you we it's essentially is a document that is a little bit slightly adjusted but it's based on what has worked as we have gone through the first two years segment of the community engagement calendar so one adjustment that I know that we're going to need to make right off the bat is that according to our implementation calendar we do need to add into our community engagement calendar

[02:32:00]
a community s o f g training in July so that is something that we can have discussion about in particular I just wanted to take a few minutes to address some of the questions that were sent in regarding the calendar I'm going to like sorry I don't mean to be all that girl there I'm going to address the answers based on my perception of how I would answer these questions and then I am not a committee of one I do have other committee members who participate so I will answer them how I see it and then I'll open it up to my fellow Committee Member to to address anything that would like to address and then we can open it up to the full board for discussion if that works for everyone okay so the first thing that I just really wanted

[02:33:00]
what's a point out is that on February 28th the community engagement ad hoc committee did present a review both at the board training as well as again Linked In the out of glance where I think some of these questions could have been answered so I do want to direct board members back to that document if there are questions about the community Engagement review the first question that came in and it this is Under The Heading of regarding board members schedules and personal time how will the new 2 year calendar account for individual board members for professional personal and family obligations over such an extended period my answer the two-year calendar was designed specifically to support long-term planning for both board members and more importantly the community a structured predictable and board approved calendar has improved planning and participation by establishing a framework of broad

[02:34:00]
expectations for example indicating that the state of the district will take place in August without locking in specific dates very far in advance this approach allows for flexibility as the exact dates are determined closer to each event to better accommodate individual schedules and maximize participation the next question will there be built in mechanisms or checkpoints allowing board members to reassess and adjust their participation commitments as personal schedules evolved over the two years board members regularly assess and adjust their participation based on evolving personal and professional schedules this happens on an ongoing basis as we plan for board meetings committee work Community engagement events superintendent meetings and more while each board member determines their own level of participation we should hold ourselves to high expectations as we are accountable to our

[02:35:00]
constituents flexibility is built into our structure but so is a shared commitment to serving our students parents teachers staff and Community with consistency and dedication next question is there a plan to rotate or evenly distribute engagements to avoid overburdening certain members more than others each board member is responsible for managing their own level of participation there is no formal distribution mechanism for events or engagements board members are welcome to attend any of the events they are available for and choose to participate in all right under the next theme so to speak regarding the division of work among members first question how will responsibilities for Community engagement events be shared across board members to ensure equity in workload and visibility across districts Community engagement events

[02:36:00]
consistently shared with the full board through multiple channels including the out of glance newsletter announcements during board meetings discussions at board and committee meetings and direct emails from board Services oftentimes using all of these methods to ensure communication just as an example regarding the regional Town Halls save the date was first included in the February 21st at a glance and repeated the following week specific dates and locations were provided in the March 7th at a glance a request for board member participation was shared in the March 14th attic lands the events slide deck was also shared on March 14th with an invitation for suggestions and edits aside from the ad hoc committee members only one additional board member provided input RSVP updates were included in the March 21st at a glance along with a second reminder to confirm attendance with board services and promotional materials including social media

[02:37:00]
play graphics and an article were also included to support the events visibility ultimately all board members are given equal opportunity to participate in engagement events but participation remains a personal responsibility visibility and Equity across the across the districts are best when all members actively respond and engage next question will members have the option to designate alternates or shared duties for high demand events when scheduling conflicts arise board members routinely shared duties for Community engagement events which is why attendance requests are sent out well in advance this allows board services and members to coordinate who will be present ensure balanced participation and identify events as needed however there is no formal process for designating alternates either a board member is able to attend or they are not

[02:38:00]
each member is individually responsible for their own level of commitment and contribution next question has the ad hoc committee considered formal guidelines or expectations to support Fair participation and avoid burnout formal guidelines and expectations are already outlined in our board guard rails specifically border real one state board members will not act on assumptions about each other's intentions and will accept responsibility for their own actions and behaviors each board member is responsible for managing their own level of commitment and contribution ultimately we are accountable to the community we serve as such there is no current need to establish additional formal guidelines outside of what is already included in our government's manual and the third thing regarding calendar flexibility and responsiveness first question what level of flexibility is billed into the calendar to accommodate unforeseen events emergent issues in the community or

[02:39:00]
board representation as noted previously the calendar is set broadly over a 2-year period to support planning and transparency events are scheduled or scheduled closer to their actual dates specifically to allow for flexibility and to accommodate emergent issues or evolving Community needs as effectively as possible next question how frequently will the calendar be reviewed or updated to remain responsive to district and Community needs the calendar is aligned with the implementation and monitoring calendars and is established in Broad terms for a two-year period however it can be updated when warranted as evidenced by the recent adjustments to the budget meetings schedule third question last question are there contingency plans for rescheduling or reassigning events if a board member is unable to attend due to illness emergency or other commitments

[02:40:00]
Community engagement events are designed for full board participation but it is understood that individual board members May occasionally be unable to attend due to illness work obligations travel or personal emergencies these events are not rescheduled based on individual availability they proceed as planned with the participation of the members who are able to be there ultimately these are events are designed for the communities benefit participation and engagement and not for the convenience of board members so those are the questions that came in and I will pause real quick and I will turn to my Committee Member and see if you have any additions or differences anything to say thank you chair and vice president Jackson I don't have anything to add because I think you did an incredible job of answering those questions which I think are very good questions and I think that they are questions that while we might not have asked ourselves I know the community is curious

[02:41:00]
out and I know that board members are curious about how these events that we attend that we love that we love attending can coincide with scheduling conflicts and things that come up and you know these things have come up in board participation in general so I think that it's good to know that there are contingency plans for when we can't be there that the duties are shared across board members that there is visibility that's equal among members and that we ultimately have a personal responsibility to meet these demands and we are accountable to our constituents and we need to make sure that we can be available and honestly in my opinion we should enjoy doing this so great job answering the questions and that is all I have to contribute thank you okay so with that Madam president and that is kind of the long opener to the discussion on the two year monitoring

[02:42:00]
great thank you to chair Jackson and Committee Member Benavides here I'm not sure you're the vice chair now you're welcome you thought you could get out of doing more work are there any additional questions and feedback on the community engagement calendar and as a reminder this is our Board calendar so we own this so we are determining we are the ones who could make the decisions obviously within limits but other questions related to the calendar or suggestions feedback that could be integrated before we approve it in a couple weeks I have a question I don't remember where can we find the the questions and the answers that you just read the question

[02:43:00]
so the questions were emails and the answers were are in my personal Google drive right now so I will share those with Dr Albright for distribution great thank you I'll do it right now so I just want to acknowledge that we made this discussion so that we could have opportunity to provide feedback prior to May 7th and so in line with that I do I guess I have a question and maybe feedback I see that we are keeping the Board District open houses and one of the things in your committee analysis of what worked and what lessons we learned from previous Community engagement there were a lot of lessons learned about the Board District open houses and one of the takeaways for me was staff time

[02:44:00]
these in particular took a lot of Staff time because staff were helping to identify schools * 7 so schools in each district time coordinating with the principles coordinating with the activities directors or the staff so a lot more staff time cuz it was seven events in a course of a couple of months and there were other takeaways and Lessons Learned also but I guess I kind of anticipated that maybe we would accept that as like it didn't work because it just took too much time and wasn't maybe worth the return but it's still on here is propose something that we want to do so I'm clear curious for the Committees take on why you decided to keep that and then I'll just bored conversation on is there something different we could or should try Okay so so the Board District open houses were they remained on their because they are there was a feeling amongst the committee that it gave the opportunity for

[02:45:00]
maybe more direct engagement with our district with our Board District level constituents now that being said they're also was robust conversation within the committee about what if we if we move forward with these what needs to be tweaked about that not the very least that there needs to be maybe some guardrails around what will actually be discussed when we go out for these town halls and and even specifically like a slide deck that like a skeleton slide deck that is shared with all board members to to really focus in on what it is that the what the intention is of going out to the I want to say titer but like smaller smaller groups so if this is something that we decide to do I think that we need to come to cons

[02:46:00]
this is to what those discussions are I will take ownership and say I thought that I thought it was clear that the discussion was board role versus superintendent role that we were going to our constituents to start the initial training on sosg and I I don't think that I portrayed that message as accurately or as robustly as I could have because we had a variety of conversations that happens so if we move forward with the town halls I mean I'll speak personally I loved it I loved being able to have conversations directly with my constituents but we absolutely need to make sure that the yes discussions are more targeted so I think there was agreement on the discussion I can my concern is Staff time that was one of the biggest concerns that surface of staff is helping to play seven events I want to clarify to

[02:47:00]
community did it literally and and that's one reason why I'm disagreeing with the staff time because there's some of us who didn't even require that I didn't use staff time until they came at the end for sign up that was it but the other thing that was really lacking was the true one how are we going to run this how we were going to make these meetings happen I didn't even know there was a food budget so that's the point your questions around what you did not know where what staff provided and so if we're providing food if we're doing sign ups if we're doing District social media if we're doing Courtney and the location if it's not tied to a pre-existing event and we're doing something separate that's all

[02:48:00]
stop time and so we can get into the weeds around again like each individual event but my my concern that I'm serving for the committee and for us is the staff time of ordering food doing fine and doing all of that times 7 and so I think just also the total number of community engagement and Outreach events I just want to maybe provoke a conversation on quantity versus quality so did we achieve more quality engagement by adding seven events or not I love my amazing feedback thought it was great but looking across the seven and the number of people that we reached I'm not sure that adding 7 events led to increase Community engagement so that's the conversation I want us to have is what is quality engagement look like considering that we are investing staff time in it so that's a question

[02:49:00]
looking for the board not necessarily for the committee cuz I'm totally fine with keeping the regional I mean yeah not Regional District town I guess I'm not fine I'll just say that I'm not fine and I agree remember doing this I agree with you you're concerned but as during a conversation that I had and I think it was Illuminating it was it was a great conversation and it was around this notion of Chief of Staff came to an understanding that there was concerned about a second Community engagement and that was what I was using the term the town hall engagement and we said well what if you I told her I don't need staff at this at any of these but

[02:50:00]
she suggested what if you call it an Outreach so if that relieves staff then I'm happy to if to change it to a staff or excuse me an Outreach that is a conversation we can have about what we as individuals do to Foster engagement within our communities well I just want to respond to there is a very distinct definition of what community engagement entails that was part of our training in February or January and in particular with moving from the sfg stage 3 to stage 4 it was exactly what we should be talking to our community about so we've moved from stage one and two which was getting feedback on what the goals stage one sharing how we're doing on the goals

[02:51:00]
moving into Stage 4 getting ready to reset the goals so there is a clear framework that we have that we've strayed from and so the training that we had was that we need to get back on to that framer so if we're going to use the term Community engagement and do board approved Community engagement events that are aligned to the definition of community engagement that's what I'm just making sure that we align Staffing so all of us are entitled and able to still do events in our communities we still have to be mindful about being in schools because there are separate rules and Norms around how and when we're in schools so I just want to draw that distinction between engagement Outreach and then whatever else we do is individual members okay I guess I'm suggesting that we can I mean we are 700 smart women I think we can find a way to modify

[02:52:00]
rules or procedures in such a way that I like the seven seven different town halls but I agree that that we don't necessarily need to depend on staff know my question is does a town hall mean that were in the schools or are we outside the school because this time around we were in the school so town hall is not used with the two terms that we have with with what we're doing here is community engagement which I'm looking for the documents which is an event that the district hosts where we bring people in community outreach is events where we go out

[02:53:00]
as two board members so we know what is that where did that come from but I think it's just it was like a default term that was used I think probably because it is easy for the community to understand that we're having a town hall versus the community's understanding that we're having an engagement event so it was just it's just a default term that was used it's it's not a but we did treated as an engagement yes okay so question where where are listening sessions I think part of what is what number is something that we can do as board members and describe so I'm just saying that just wondering

[02:54:00]
and you said there was two definitions where are listening sessions so the two when I see the two definitions I mean the two things that were on our calendar that we will agree to do as a board so we can do listening sessions those aren't part of what the full board is doing as a community engagement so we did share as I mentioned the community engagement coaching guidance that as I said describe specifically what we're doing and what and how so if we follow that that's kind of that's what I'm trying to get to is a relates to specifically the calendar that we're working not in prison yes remember Jackie okay so I think the the thing that I will add regarding as specifically the district open houses

[02:55:00]
Town Halls the district level engagement events I think that the quality of those can be improved if there are better parameters around parameters and expectations about what discussions we what two-way communication and two-way discussions we will be having when we go to the district level now whether those you know occur in a school or they occur at neighborhood association or I mean I think maybe that's the point which was also part of the review of the community of the committee is that we don't always have to go to a school and in fact we shouldn't always be going to schools we should be broader broadening our community outreach and and it may be at the district level engagement events happen at your neighborhood association and maybe that that is a parameter

[02:56:00]
that way it falls to me as a board member to reach out to my neighborhood association and engage continue in those engagement so I think that's I think that these didn't go as expected because to to my discredit I didn't lay out the parameters as clearly as I should have which is fine and I appreciate your owning that and acknowledging that and I still am concerned about staff time and District staff time board services but also school stuff so I won't be that dead horse but I will just say it five more times I'm just kidding so that was the main concern that I had and then just in terms of like the number of community engagement events per year I was trying to count up

[02:57:00]
and I think I ended up with 13 if we're doing 7 District plus the state of the district plus the budget Town Halls plus the regional town halls in the year are you going to August to August what's the number for so whether we do 13 or 10 or 2 or 50 just making sure that they're meeting our community engagement goals and resetting on what those are so you acknowledge that you'll be clear on what are the goals so my primary feedback is quality over quantity and I will open it up to other questions or feedback for the committee to consider as they continue to edit the calendar so when do we intend to vote on this May 7th

[02:58:00]
thank you so I think clarifying for starters clarifying the vocabulary use would be helpful we did just do a whole training on Town Halls on community engagement okay but but we also have the term town halls and so I'm just asking that yes we work on community engagement and community outreach and those are the two categories that work in my head and then we're doing we've introduced some new Concepts and so I just think it's important to clarify that what they are

[02:59:00]
so that also has to extend that clarification is part of our responsibility to the community because if we're confused then they most certainly will be and I would also just put this out there that I think it's important to give an update on the difference between goals and guard rails and there is a distinction dictates the interims and the interns are what we evaluate

[03:00:00]
so we're selling merchandise that I think we lose sight that our community is not immersed in this and so we need to be careful about how deliberate we are about teaching these Concepts Thank you period

[03:01:00]
there are certain topics and some of these meetings but my concern is especially when you hear public comment and you hear the community when are we going to address their issues because if we're going to have set dialogue and meetings or a set dialogue and presentation when are we going to address the issues that are coming from the community

[03:02:00]
I know we're trying to we have guidance reference point but I'm I'm concerned if we want Community to attend when are we going to truly address their issues if we're going to preset a topic choose what we want to be said how are we going to train on if she when are we going to get to the topic of the community so the way that this was answered in our community engagement training is that we do community engagement around the board work so that is the goal and guardrails that does not mean that is the only Community engagement that the district does the district and the superintendent in particular and also School leaders do their own engagement and so that's where they are dealing with the

[03:03:00]
Moore school-based problem-solving issues which are not board issues so to speak a lot of what we're hearing in public comment and the training in January the rationale for February 28th the rationale for sticking to the goals and guardrails is because that's how we communicate to the community with the how we've heard their vision and values and how we're sticking to it and we're not moving based on a whim or something else that's just coming up as a board so that doesn't mean that we can't be responsive to issues that are by the community it just means that the work that we're doing in line with our students focused governance is it really is community engagement that is focused on the board work which is the coldest and guardrails so unless someone comes off camera I'm going to assume

[03:04:00]
I need another opinion is that and that's why the community is seeing Council directing board and that we're not addressing the issues of the community so there's that representation that we have to try and erase if we're going to continue with the with s o f t or the council so did come off camera or on camera to be able to try to respond to that and I would just acknowledge that public comment is one glimpse of what the public is feeling and so there are there's a whole bunch of other things and I think the district the superintendent could speak to that as well but I will turn it over to Central Hospital on listening to the

[03:05:00]
navigate to 2 way communication around the communities vision and the communities values no I from what I understood in this discussion just now is certainly led by the community it doesn't feel like it's prescriptive what the community is going to speak about there may be issues that community members writes about the purview of this district and and in my experience and certainly consistent with the government

[03:06:00]
because they are the most informed and the most expert in addressing those issues which certainly I'm just getting to know you all you may have individual expertise there that is not the responsibility you shoulder as members of the responsibility is to represent the mission and values of the community to deal with every issue in the district whether thank you I think also isn't it full sentences in ad hoc committee for how we would work with and respond to committee to community and so part of that charge was

[03:07:00]
is to try to be figure out that question of how we could be more responsive and so I think if that's still a question that we have that is something that we could still still explore and so if anyone has questions for how we can do that definitely put them out there or email them to the chair of the ad hoc of the committee Community engagement ad hoc committee and we can integrate those if for example there's a certain issue that seems to be bubbling up and it's related to school lunches and how the chicken nuggets are always not thought out for example and that continues to Bubble Up and Bubble Up and Bubble Up it may be that the board decides that there is something that should be done and so we can have a conversation about that but again this is our work so if there are suggestions of things that we can or should do differently let's get those suggestions in so we can add them to the calendar

[03:08:00]
are there other suggestions questions concerns about the progress monitoring calendar as proposed I'm sorry Community engagement calendar as proposed thank you I do agree with you about the quality versus quantity piece because I think right now that as you look at the numbers there is a lot of work and there's also not I know we're concerned with staff work but I also know it's a lot of work for bored so I think we really need to figure that out all right so for the May 7th board meeting those materials are going to be shared with the board on April 24th and so for our committee to have revisions to board services so that they can share them with us that will be due

[03:09:00]
April 21st Madam president so just to clarify we we have our we have our meeting tomorrow so yay that works out well and I just want to make sure that I have captured some of the feedback that has come so that when we have our discussion tomorrow and if I miss anything let me know the quality over quantity that we need to look at a glossary or tightened up terminology make sure we have defined a clarification on the purpose also though a focus on moving from stage 3 to stage 4 and that if there are any specific topics that board members feel need to be discussed to email the committee topics or formats or ideas

[03:10:00]
and then I think also just to acknowledge that you practice your comments with the fact that we're adding a community engagement event in July yes I did and so just that contributes to the quantity okay so thank you to the committee for your work on that for your ongoing work and for your future work to present the revisions to this community engagement calendar prior to the May 7th meeting so with that we will move on to agenda item 8 which is the president's report so we'll start a public forum although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue we do on each speaker to know that you were heard and that we're working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that were addressed tonight were regarding health education the budget Community engagement policies the board representative contact I think that's how we contact board how the public contacts board member

[03:11:00]
Town Hall meetings deaf and hard-of-hearing open house do not come Focus governance Outdoor Learning sfg coaching bullying and suspension protocols and Children's Health and well-being I also want to acknowledge that during our last meeting or April 2nd meeting there was some language used during public comment that I certainly found inappropriate and to be in violation of our guidelines for speaker etiquette as the presiding officer I could have intervened and I chose not to and I just want to acknowledge that the reason I chose not to is because I felt that's what they were seeking and they wanted to cause more of a scene and so I thought the Judgment decision that I made in that moment was to not intervene and to just let them continue but I do want to acknowledge that neither I nor APS nor I know my fellow board members condone that type of language and condone that type of language in public settings and so just wanted to take technology that was not okay but

[03:12:00]
are you allowed to continue just for the sake of that moment that we were in one other thing to share is we have an addition to our APS board family as of today yay so baby Sanchez born today 6 lb 10 oz to board member asparagus so big congratulations to member astorga for that sticking it out past the due date that's always tough our upcoming meetings we do have next week on Tuesday April 22nd there's an audit meeting at 5 p.m. on Wednesday April 23rd there's a finance meeting at 8 a.m. we do have our next board meeting on May 7th and during that meeting the final budget will be presented for approval and this budget is due to the public education department on May 19th in addition on that May 7th meeting board member benavidez will facilitate our discussion on our progress monitoring on goal for skills habits and mindsets for life and that concludes
