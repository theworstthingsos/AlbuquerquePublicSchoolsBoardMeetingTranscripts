[00:15:00]
Tony Watkins and so go ahead and good evening school board members my name is tomorrow and last month we raised awareness over $125 sexually explicit materials within the aps Library we give you each guide for that I received an email saying that your standards Empower students to communicate a positive view of themselves however these standards allow a Game of Thrones a graphic novel which depicts sex and sexual nudity between adults to be in schools like Washington Middle School I think any reasonable adult would see that is a pretty low standard if you can provide safe locks on computers or students can't access porn surely you can provide

[00:16:00]
did the same practical cents in the library's according to the teens of pornography report 52 of teens who consumed porn said they'd seen porn depicting what appears to be raped choking or someone in pain the guide we gave you last month with those books had just that by advocating for these materials it is allowing children to learn unhealthy unrealistic views on sex and tolerance of her discrimination violence and racism not to mention the same content is what feels the demand for sex trafficking children come to school to learn to reason and to grow not to be introduced to risky pornographic materials thank you thank you our next speaker is Tony Watkins followed by Melissa Sanchez Mr Watkins you have one minute when she begins speaking I'm a part of the education we are concerned that the board did not vote on the current contract with great City Schools we understand it is the administration's discretion to enter into a contract of the size but it's perplexing in this board has not on the contract

[00:17:00]
secondly the 40 family engagement policy has not been archived as we were told it has been taken down from the aps website as part of the Council of great City Schools policy diet 3rd we've been witnessing mistreatment on the board when it is determined that a board member says something that is not fall in line with the Council of great City Schools student outcomes Focus governance model this is a violation of the play policy the calls for safety environments the policy should be brought back and should apply to everybody finally we strongly believe that repurposing of Taft middle school should not include adopting the name Court NATO transferred me responsibility from the board to the superintendent for naming schools is another part of the policy diet the jury is not out on whether or not it was a good man he killed and tortured many people on the very land with a school is now it's offensive team after him we call for the board to vote against renew his contract with the Council of great City Schools thank you sir the next speaker is Melissa Sanchez followed by Antonio

[00:18:00]

[00:20:00]
play thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Melanie Miss kids tell us you have one minute once you begin speaking distinguish Dr Blakey and good APS board when is Buenas Tardes soy la principal Passion of The Wallace where we approached special education as something that belongs to the entire school not just to a single room or a few teachers are ambitious special ed team works both by pulling students out when needed and pushing into classrooms but what's really powerful is how they also support kids who aren't labeled as having special needs just students who are struggling that's where the line start to blur but in the best way it becomes less about who's in special ed and more about the needs of the students in that moment

[00:21:00]
that kind of environment Foster's dignity and compassion for all students we also have an Innovative counselor who pushes into every classroom leading lessons in a round inclusion and belonging at a reinforces the message that every student is valued seen in love it's not perfect but we're building a culture every child no matter what they're carrying feels like they matter and our goal for data around special ed from the students shows it thank you thank you our next speaker is going to be on zoom and it is looks like one moment we're going to go with Francesca Bueller are you there we can see you but we can't hear you yes I'm here okay you have one minute once you begin speaking okay thank you my name is Francesca blower and I was

[00:22:00]
student a teacher and a parent in APS tonight I would like to talk about how APS is being negatively portrayed in the media to our community under the guise of student outcomes focused governance the s o f g model is now being implemented by our board and is fueled by standardized test scores the scores come from test created and marketed by for-profit Publishers have never shown to be an indicator of student learning are given to a few selected grades once a year and most tragically ignore the Brilliance of our students teachers and communities the Harmon publishing and promoting these misleading biased on Research scores and labeling it as a student outcomes is that it completely ignoring programs that are in a PS we are ignoring the student outcomes that school Gardens

[00:23:00]
are rich music and art programs Community mentorship do a language programs ethnic studies Mr Speaker period lens of a standardized test score it is impossible to see the inspiration and deep learning that is happening in our schools thank you ma'am our next speaker is Carrie Healy also ones who can you hear me we can you have one minute and national average and it all started with our staff mindset

[00:24:00]
to contribute to the student and Community needs remodel for our students self-regulation and coping skills when times arise where we are frustrated ourselves we use them as teachable moments we model our coping skills and discuss their students how we persevere regulatory emotions and advocate for ourselves if needed we provide direct instructions in these areas with the use of the zones of Regulation prioritize developing relationships with their students period thank you our next speaker is in the

[00:25:00]
Arturo Quintana you have one minute do you not have common sense do you like discernment or do you just don't care on which things should and shouldn't be acceptable for the children APS this isn't about silencing however the approach and stands I'm taking on is self of evidence that is what should and shouldn't be appropriate in the schools if a book like Lucky by Alice sebold should be in Jackson Middle School and other high schools then I challenge you to add this book inside your own household for your children to have easy access to quote kick me and I called into a ball I want you a job he held his dick in his hand and never done it before I said I'm a virgin put it in your mouth and you before him can I put my ball back on I want my clothes put it in your mouth and suck he said

[00:26:00]
like a straw I said yeah like a straw and quote if you think I'm crazy for saying this congratulations you're using logic and common sense of why this is wrong and outrageous to be in a place of learning thank you thank you our next speaker is on zoom and it is Sally's Dickey for Dickey you there sorry I probably butchered that you have one minute once you begin speaking to you as a former public school teacher and APS parent of three children when I moved to Albuquerque from the East Coast everyone told me that the public schools here weren't worth my time and I should look into Charter and public schools are private school sorry I saw an extreme lack of trust in APS in the community despite that we chose to send our kids to our neighborhood public school because I believe in quality education for all not just those who have the privilege to shop for school and I want to be a true stakeholder in the public education system now I'm concerned about the decision to base all decisions on student outcome measures

[00:27:00]
for our students at APS and it worries me I believe these measures test scores do not reflect the things that make our community great and that data like test scores isn't really what will convince parents to trust APS so many things that are aligned with the values of this community are not considered student outcomes like school safety culturally welcoming schools small class sizes inclusivity mental health relationships healthy school lunches Transportation gender and racial Equity Outdoor Learning Time Council of great City schools and their student outcomes Focus governance framework is causing separation between the board members and their Community which is not productive toward rebuilding trust in the community thank you for your time thank you our next speaker is in person Janet Harman followed by human being a minute once you begin speaking I'm sorry once you begin speaking you one minute good evening I thank you for the opportunity for the letting the community speak

[00:28:00]
I hope you listen to us I'm the mother of two APS grads at the last board meeting I witnessed how Council for great City Schools all ready negatively affects our school district after 45 minutes of meaningful testimony from teachers students and parents many of whom shared a glimpse into the daily dysfunction of APs life you the board proceeded to spend valuable time on cgcs generated self-evaluation one of the council's coaches I believe he's with us tonight was zoomed in to guide you on how to fill out their evaluation to the tune of $150 an hour talk about a waste of time and money any of us on this side of the how do you say that can tell you that the board leadership is out of touch did you even hear the desperation in the voices from this community

[00:29:00]
the guidance that comes from the council great City Schools is irrelevant to our community I'm sure someone's making money off of it and benefiting but it's not Albuquerque students to me and I'll make sure you get them thank you ma'am okay Mr Emmanuel director of Community Elementary in discussion related to community engagement but we stopped and not aware of any reason conversation with the president using organization in this manner with that meaningful engagement is talking

[00:30:00]
and inappropriate and it does not serve our families and students the organization needs to stop and instead ongoing an intentional engagement with API and age and other by Park family and student must be conducted if you want to authentically support our community second as part of our non-partisan Civic engagement work we encourage our family to attend the meeting and engage with IPS board member we all know it has direct and crucial impact on our everyday life we are really alarmed by the changes being made from speaking freely about the voice on YouTube and this season like many other we believe that the board member should have direct communication with family and student to hear and understand they need and wants to be the necessary trust to serve them thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom that is going to be Hannah can I see you there I can't hear you there we go

[00:31:00]
you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening my name is Hannah Montana Elementary School at Bellaire we leave with belonging from the moment a child walks through our doors they're part of our school especially our mckinney-vento students we built a culture where every student is greeted by name each morning and every classroom Fosters connection regardless of a student's background or housing status our staff uses consistent SEL language aligned with Panorama and supported through monthly mindset themes these lessons happen schoolwide each Wednesday and they're reinforced throughout the week we are all languages even when we don't speak them and we give students Voice through our principal advisory Council our approach is about a program it's about building a community that welcomes and lifts every child every day we saw a 17-point rise in her self-regulation among our McKinney even though students on her Panorama survey I'm proud of our work and I'm looking forward to the future thank you for your time

[00:32:00]
thank you ma'am our next speaker is also on Zoom Charlotte Joseph you also have one minute once you begin speaking good evening thank you for your time I am a parent of two APS students and I want to start by thanking you for your work you've done to set up the goals and guardrails for APS on our students however I want to express my concern about the methods being implemented to meet those mobile goals I feel the great City Schools sosg models not tailored to help our unique students Thrive and learn as has been previously set out by prior speakers additionally I'm concerned about the boards anti-democratic direction that it's concentrating power with the board president and curtailing communication between board and the community and principals we can see so important members are being coached in real time during meetings we have voted on board members to represent the community and instead some board members are answering to the council and said of community I have concerns about policies being shown including the family engagement policy

[00:33:00]
that was adopted by the board after hundreds of community members and organizations advocated for it and it's no longer available in the aps website and closing I feel the council great City Schools sosg model is not a good fit for APS and I asked that the contract with them not be renewed and that there be no money out a lot of it or this contract in the budget next year and I asked that the model we use to improve our students educational experience and outcomes be tailored for our community thank you our next speaker is in person Miss Janet Sayers old by Matthew Malden good evening Madam president

[00:34:00]
start talking up there that that little thing is blocking their faces at least we can't see the people on Zoom it has that thing across them anyway Community engagement just a couple thoughts I encourage board members I know you have busy lives you have families you have many of you are you work for a living still but I would just suggest go to some of these fabulous events that that you all are having so last two weeks ago I got to go to the Metro Art Award thing talk to parents grandparents I got some of the kids that one thing to autograph the book you would have thought you know anyway so that's an idea for Community engagement the other last night I attended the the orchestra concert same thing mom's dad's Aunts Uncles grandparents

[00:35:00]
you don't have to come for the whole time maybe just come at the beginning say hello but putting a name and a face a lot of people do not know who board members are anyway thank you for your time your service and tomorrow morning 8:00 we're having breakfast treats at Del Norte High School you're very welcome to come and get a cup of coffee and stuff thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Matthew Malden followed by David hams you have a woman that want to begin speaking this is your final meeting of the year and after everything that's been exposed these meetings everything you've seen and heard especially from tomorrow and my friend Arturo here I'm not sure whether to speak to you as Leaders or survivors of your own conscience listen I've spoken to teachers I've heard their testimonies and you should be ashamed of what's been done under your watch teachers keeping secret files on student struggling with confusion and from parents children come from school dress one way and being allowed to change into other clothing that affirms a false gender and then changing back to their parents

[00:36:00]
the dark teachers who know this is wrong but stay silent because they're afraid of teachers unions listen I was here a few weeks ago and there was a lot about after being these gender-confused children because of fear of suicide but a recent study from the University of Texas reveals that the exact opposite is true look it up and so while it's just been going on New Mexico is dead last in everything so I've got a question for you please raise your hand for everybody to see do you believe that parents not the government are primary moral and emotional authority of a child's life do you believe that school should always inform parents when their child is experiencing confusion or distress related to gender identity or mental health do you believe that sexually explicit content should be completely removed from school library from their family is also a betrayal of trust and a violation of parental rights you not raise your hands

[00:37:00]
followed by Gabe Gomez Matthew you have one minute once you begin my mistake hi my name is David Ames I'm here to speak in full support of the student outcomes Focus graduation rates are improving and there is a reason for that there's a reason that reading Proficiency in multiple languages in our most vulnerable population is increasing there's a reason that math proficiencies are increasing and it's no small part to the goals and guard rails that are the backbone of sfg for the first time ever the sofa model has engaged the community by reporting real-time monitoring of reading and math goals that's right the board is communicating directly to parents about how their kids are doing and reading and math real time that's real Community engagement I absolutely prefer board that stays focused on what the majority of your community

[00:38:00]
is asked you to stay focused on and that is the education of students as a parent I very much encourage this board to renew the contract with the Council of great City Schools this collaboration is provided huge benefits for students and to our city as a whole thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Gabe Gomez after Gabe will have Dominica Chavez so you have one minute once you begin speaking good evening president goes and board members my name is Gabe Gomez and I'm here tonight as an APS parent and Community member to express my strong support for students focused governance we all know that changes hard it requires us to challenge his habits rethink how we do business and sometimes faced criticism but what will you have creative outcomes that support students unconditionally is the kind of leadership that meets the moment you've chosen to focus on what matters most making sure every child no matter what their zip code their background or their circumstances has

[00:39:00]
call opportunity to succeed you said clear goals you prioritize academic progress and you sent a message that resonates with families like mine are kids come first as a parent I've noticed the impact expectations become more meaningful when there's clarity about what we're all working toward whether in the classroom at home or in board meetings responsibility is shared and the path forward become something we build together not something we get our students deserve a board that is focused disciplined and outcomes driven you are showing us what that looks like and I'm grateful for it please say the course or students are counting on your leadership thank you thank you sir our speakers at followed by Edwin Herring of once you begin speaking good evening Madam president and board members my name is Dominique a Travis and I serve as the advocacy manager at New Mexico kids can we are proud to support your strategic plan and

[00:40:00]
student outcomes Focus governance were APS leads others follow and your leadership has already inspired districts across New Mexico to adopt their own strategic plans and set clear academic goals focused on Student Success we know it's not easy to evaluate your progress and even harder to do it publicly but that's exactly what this board is doing by focusing on student outcomes you are acknowledging hard truths and doing something about it you've said measurable goals and put a plan in place to move forward that is courageous and exactly what our students need change is hard with change comes resistance but our students deserve progress they deserve an education that for the future thank you thank you our next speaker is Edwin Herring followed by Megan Long Beach

[00:41:00]
good afternoon I'm honored to speak on behalf of the special education program at Lou Wallace Elementary School our students and Educators have been doing incredible work at Lew Wallace special education students are embraced as classmates and Friends inclusion is part of a school culture and Educators have worked hard to create opportunities for all students to learn and grow together as a result student morale within the program has improved significantly this is a direct reflection of the phenomenal Educators who go above and beyond every day however Louis Special Education across the district is in dire need of more human capital we need more teachers EA's and Specialists to meet the increasing demands placed on staff and students just as importantly we need more time to carry out the essential planning coordination and support tasks that makes Student Success possible Louise is a shining example of what is possible through Innovation commitment and compassion but

[00:42:00]
should not take extraordinary effort to go above and beyond the Call of Duty for a special education programs to succeed or educators are doing exceptional work but they need and deserve more support especially in the form of dedicated people to share the work thank you thank you sir our next speaker is Megan long followed by Lee Ross concerts in the state of public education nationality I am for the board and administration to reconsider entering another agreement with them I want to clarify this is not a criticism of student outcomes instead

[00:43:00]
it is a criticism of the implementation of this governance on our school board and the district as a whole the changes implemented by the school president by the board president under the instruction of these coaches are anti-democratic I also want to clarify that this is not a criticism of the teachers and staff at our school as the mother of two native children in APS I'm incredibly grateful for the teachers that interact with on campus the front office admin the janitorial and cafeteria staff and their principal Michael is with those removed from the classroom in a nice office or behind a dice who make the decisions that affect them and their classmates the most we need to keep out the we need to keep out of state Consultants out of the boardroom and instead focus on local resources that can offer culturally competent coaching especially following the latest case thank you man our speakers Lee Ross followed by Yvonne Salazar

[00:44:00]
1 minute once you begin speaking is the mic okay okay give me board members I want to talk about something was said at the last board meeting and I actually emailed the board president about this but she responded to I'm grateful for that but she said that we know that this rubric that you were using was most effective because the research because of the research base and extensive research that have been done on this rubric so what I wanted to clarify in that statement I don't think it was research that was done on the rubric it was research done to make through a break and that we don't really know that this is the best rubric we don't know that this is the best I mean there's no way to know that this is the best thing we can do but I feel like we should have him dial up and that we shouldn't be saying we know anything really about this because there's no research on it this is really the students how come Focus government and healthy you guys reconsider approving contract with the Council of the great City schools and thank you very much

[00:45:00]
thank you sir for your next speaker is Yvonne Salazar City this year at our school with the majority of our students are represented under the Aussie and Martinez subgroups we knew we had to build from within we kicked off the year with staff PD that focus on routines to create learning environments for students know they belong know they're capable and have the tools to keep going even when learning gets tough go for posters were created in English and Spanish and are posted in every classroom and throughout our campus our counselor SEL schools in every classroom and supported students again when they took the Panama offering reassurance and reinforcing understanding students earned Awards not just for academics but for showing perseverance and social awareness are Campus White shout out system lifted both students and adults these daily reinforcements

[00:46:00]

[00:47:00]
significant gains in actual student performance in actual growth in kids and I think that's so important and so I appreciate that the board even though it's it's not easy is pushing forward and trying for change because we need change we need in a state where we are 50th out of 50 and we have been in that realm for a long time we need to do something differently and appreciate that we have guidance from people like the council Great Schools to help us learn from Best Practices elsewhere and Implement those here in a way that makes sense for New Mexico which is very much what I think the board is is trying to do so thank you thank you sir okay our next speaker is in person Renee Pacheco okay we're going to go next with AJ Woods

violent content increases aggression and normalizes violence according to the Journal of adolescent Health the NIH and the American Psychological Association drug and alcohol seemed content correlates with early experimentation long-term substance abuse and failing grades citing the NIH and Gemma Pediatrics graphic violence and Gore content leads to PTSD like symptoms increased aggression and disruptive development that's according to the National Institute of Justice suicide themed content is linked to higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior among youth that's according to the NIH Jama Pediatrics in the turtle of pediatric psychology these are not anecdotes these are published peer-reviewed studies from Top medical and scientific institutions I urged to please create a Content review policy remove harmful materials in these categories and let's get back to focusing on student outcomes thank you thank you I don't expect speaker is Casey Peterson

[00:51:00]
first I want to thank you for supporting the student outcomes Focus model I think it's absurd that somebody won't be supporting the merit-based outcomes and it's obviously having some effect so that's a positive thing and I want to speak about these inappropriate books a little more last time I spoke I came here and we highlighted that you know extremely inappropriate book where you know you had a very graphic scene of an infant being fingered and raped and very graphic detail as if it was a smart novel and now this just another book I want to highlight and this one's in specifically Volcano Vista High and some other high schools but it's a choke does the name of the book joke by Chuck and it says you know it talks about beastiality and all sorts of other things but it says for Saturday and goes on and on and it talks about all sorts of

[00:52:00]
and again just we need to start with some very basic standard just saying like Okay this is clearly past the line like this is clearly absurd so I appreciate your time thank you sir all right next speaker is also on Zoom Nina simbana me know you there yes ma'am you have one minute after watching several board meetings from an outside Playbook with an agenda that does not serve our APS students upon hearing about the council I decided to learn more about what they stand for and why they have interest in our district to my surprise of communities

[00:53:00]
making a stand against the council's undemocratic methods and rejecting their agenda the controversy around their work is well documented by board members and communities across this country as a district we are in a position to unite against Bad actors who are trying to influence our board Administration and families alike the education of our students is uniquely New Mexican no outside contractor can understand what it is to be a student or a guardian here we have our own expert to believe in putting children before profits we have our own practitioners who genuinely believe in lifting up the public school system and understand the privatizing education is detrimental to our children and society as a whole APS belongs to the children and rather than treat families as quote on quote customers we should be treating be treated as partners let's unite as a community and say no to outside private interests and know to the Insiders who support them thank you thank you our next speaker is in person Alfonso Otero followed by Diana borella

[00:54:00]

[00:57:00]
my name is Gwendolyn young I'm a grandmother of two children and APS my concerns about the books that are in the libraries are not about the lgbtq or Identity or race or religion or class are concerns about insurance that you are providing age appropriate materials to the children in our schools a study of boys and girls ages 14 to 19 found that reading pornographic comics and magazines significantly increase the likelihood of having sexually harassed appear or having Force someone to have sex a comprehensive review study found that children who had been exposed to such media and higher rates of being victims or perpetrators of sexual violence I am working to help parents learn about these books that are in their schools I'm a

[01:00:00]
officer and Kenneth Salazar associate superintendent for school climate and support Dr Blakey will begin this presentation but I'm going to turn it over to board member Benavides to facilitate this portion of the agenda thank you madam president and thank you all for being here this evening tonight we will be monitoring in her own goals for 0.1 and 4.2 measuring skills habits and mindsets for life before we begin we need to confirm that our monitoring report is complete I believe that all of the criteria for an effective report have been met but I will open the floor for anyone else who thinks we may be missing one of the elements do any of my fellow board members have evidence that suggests otherwise either here or on Zoom wonderful since everyone agrees that the required elements are present we will open the floor for our monitoring conversation as a reminder we have asked questions that are technical or tactical in nature before tonight's meeting those

[01:01:00]
materials for the public to see and enjoy each board member is expected to ask a question during the meeting to help us understand how the administration's actions aligned to the board's goals and guardrails these questions must be smart meaning they must be strategic measure focused ask oriented results driven and time bound so let's get started Dr Blakey thank you I'm bored president of the board and we are excited tonight to talk about goal for and I think as one of the principal's mentioned we often talked about before being the foundation for the other goals so we appreciate the attention that we have been able to give to this particular goal in the work of Miss and Dr what did I just was going to call you Sandoval that was our Dr Salazar has been doing to really focus in on our schools and go for and the

[01:02:00]
okay and I have a question if you don't mind me starting is that okay with you madam president is relevant to interval 4.2 and the results say just for context for people watching and following along we have three aspects of goal for that are on track self-efficacy perseverance and social awareness and one aspect that is off track and this is self-regulation and so this is for students in 6th through 12th grade and so the question I'm going to ask is relevant to the question that was submitted ahead of time how was the root cause for underperformance and self-regulation emotional and academic support systems identified and verified and this was question five and so it says the group calls but it was identified through student survey dad and opened in responses showing struggles with stress focus and emotional management these issues were most pronounced among students experiencing

[01:03:00]
Etc and so my question is what specific self-regulation strategies and supports will be implemented for students with limited adult connections by Fall 2025 and how their effectiveness be measured through survey data and student support team referrals good evening I'm just excited to be able to speak to you again on behalf of go forward and so looking at the root cause and what are the self-regulation specific strategies that we're looking for next year as we have we have a lot of it and initiatives in our 4.2 which is secondary plan for next year a lot of these are building upon each other and so I can take a I'll talk about a couple of them and I'm

[01:04:00]
what's the temperature we might have some questions about in the future the first one I'm going to talk about is our restorative approaches initiative that we have coming with us this will be right now we have currently 8 school that are attending a 4-day intensive training with restorative approaches this is really looking at building a culture of Care on your campus and thinking of restorative approaches as being more proactive than reactive and next year we're looking to do the same with two more coats give us a total of 24 schools in 2526 that have gone through this intensive training well we are looking for with this particular initiative is building capacity amongst the district creating 24 models in the district Elementary K-8 middle schools high schools that can be leveraging as bright spots in the district for other schools other administrators other teachers to go to to Really look at what are the systems that they have in place what were some of the barriers that they had

[01:05:00]
implementation and we're going to use those cords as learning opportunities and build that capacity so that is one and approach and secondary that we're looking for specifically as well for secondary we're looking at how do we approach our advisory models and build that the purpose of our go back to our purpose for advisory which is truly building relationships with staff and also their peers and how do we really build and Foster that relationships so we're really looking at reimagining advisory resources from the district for schools to be able to choose from those advisory resources would be offered by grade level by 6212 they would also have choices so not just a cookie cutter hear your advisory choices for next year it would be Choice offerings for 6th grade built on South regulation and also really looking at how do we build a relationship with a month staff and their peers

[01:06:00]
another approach that we're looking at which I'm also really excited about is our counseling comprehensive programs really looking at that as are at our district I'll talk a little just about that we using the ask a model which is the association for counseling we are looking at those model Frameworks in our district and working with our amazing counselors and really looking at building these comprehensive counseling programs that are centered around mindset standards that are part of the counseling and they really aligned what we're doing with our skills habits and sets in the district and so really looking at what are our comprehensive counseling models that we are striving for and right now we have two current schools that are actually around the public schools are really looking to see how can we increase that number to have

[01:07:00]
if there's any questions about that one but those are kind of like the examples that we have that are more of really looking at systemic change and looking at systems and structures at schools to build in and help identify what we can do to build a more comprehensive approach to self-regulation specifically in secondary and so those are kind of the going back to that that's those are what we're looking at as far as when we look at the root cause those with some of the systems and then also those are some of the dishes that we have for a secondary self regulation wonderful thank you doctor salary and thank you so much information but specific to students with limited connections is there any additional information you can provide for that group I know all of that applies but how do you drill down to to reach those students yes so I am going to

[01:08:00]
give out a shout out to Roosevelt Middle School I recently attended their last week just to go see what they're doing their goal for data is off the roof with a secondary in middle school and so I wanted to learn from you know what are you doing as far as Administration and teachers and a lot of it is built on relationships and really looking at that one-to-one connection with their students and it was amazing the structures that they have in place there that we can really look as a bright spot in the district to leverage they know their students not by name but their situation and being able to really understand and have that true unique relationship that I think could be really beneficial as far as those kinds of strategies as far as where is the sense of belonging of kids in our district data we have roughly less than 40% of her kids saying that they feel connected to an adult on campus and so that's something even though sensible belonging is not necessarily a goal for aspect

[01:09:00]
we truly do believe that sense of belonging is still a critical component in building your school's culture and so that is something that as a as an indicator we're working with schools and see how do we truly go back to build that relationship with their with your students and have that one-to-one connection and our advisory programs is a revamping of the imaginary of those resources will hopefully help and not only hope is not a strategy we're really going to really look to make sure that there is that one-to-one connection who is that adult campus thank you so much people who have questions asked them I have two questions I thought okay so my first one is relating to interim goals for 0.1 and 4.2 I am curious to know how you are intentionally using student voice

[01:10:00]
and what was really beneficial about digging into deep with those responses is actually connecting a student voice to a quantitative number and so being able to actually hear the stories of our students in that in those open responses there was good there was bad and there was ugly and so we as a district really need to look and see how do we leverage student voice in our initiatives that were doing in our schools and so one of those strategies that were looking at is utilizing within our skills have

[01:11:00]
can do rather than waiting on these bi-monthly survey administrations they can do weekly monthly check-ins through that skills habits and mindsets platform and even have the specific survey question that they they receive or create specific questions for their schools it could be multiple choice or it could also be open response so one of the initiatives that we're having in our data is any schools that are off track in any of these indicators to utilize that check-in process and will train the staff to be able to do that and really rather than waiting on these buy annual surveys more frequent check-ins with our kids and even in our I believe it was the 4.2 supplementary report you're asking for this there's a saying I wish teachers would Chicken on me more I wish counselors would check on me more

[01:12:00]
they're wanting that frequent check-in process and so that opportunity gives our students an opportunity to give their voice a little bit more another exciting aspect to collect student voice that we are looking to enhance even further is our principal advisory councils this year our principal advisory council is the stories that we hear from the principals and being able to even attend some of these principal advisory councils in person to listen to the kiddos is phenomenal and a lot of the principles contribute to the success of not just Gulfport Elementary student voice in the budgeting process and so we really were really impressed with the advocacy of the students

[01:13:00]
our students building the competence of South Africa and also a social awareness and advocacy of their student peers a lot of the decisions they are making at one of the schools they were saying I know I don't need this but I know that my friends need this and so they were talking about it and so it is just amazing and and what's beautiful about this too is it's not just our secondary students voices that because they're a lot older there's some Elementary that have hinders and first graders in there and they will tell you truthfully what's going on in their schools and so those have been some of the amazing things so what we're going to do this year we gave schools a monthly script with questions that they would be able to do and turn it up on that now what we're going to do is be a little bit more intentional with our monthly advisory Council lesson plans I guess you could say be a little bit more potential with

[01:14:00]
now do we leverage student voice for transformation and not just for a check in really build in our leaders and our campuses and we've seen I mean the one of the student Champions today for the advisory Council she was recruited by the students because of her structures for collecting voice and advocacy for kids and so I I foresee that the school advisory Council in itself is going to be an amazing structure that we will continue to build upon to incorporate student boys not only in our district initiatives but site-specific initiatives I have another question but I'm going to hold that but because if it's all right I can do a follow-up to that one question so you've been mentioning a lot of like resources that you're going to be giving to like the principal advisory Council and she's a schools and stuff like that so my question is around like

[01:15:00]
guardrail 5 where we are incorporating staff ways are you incorporating specifically like interim Cardwell 5.2 says the percentage of teaching staff who report that the district provides adequate School resources will increase from X to Y so how are you ensuring that the resources that you are utilizing have Incorporated that stuff voice president and one of the strategies that you will see is the web the middle school where we belong project and I say this with all the affection I can it's hard to get a group of middle school principals excited about anything as a whole was inspiring to see a group of middle school principals come back before last

[01:16:00]
I believe they went to Arizona betrayed a week-long training on the where we belong on project with train the trainer train the trainer tangible next steps on how they can take this to their middle school and engage in transformation it kind of gets to what member benavidez was alluding to a little bit ago in the individual adult to student relationship and really facilitating a transformation to culture in the Middle School level we were able to fund and send all of these middle school principals to this training with that very guardrail in mind because we knew that these people were having to come back and they were going to have to implement something that is not a change in approach but it's a it's a specificity for that and we wanted

[01:17:00]
enable and give the principles the tools that they could then give to the teachers so that we could realize something and allow it to grow roots so I think that's a really good example and it was really inspiring as I mentioned to see these middle school principals come back and talk among themselves and it's kind of like really jovial or excited principles talking in the corner of the principal meeting today about the potential for this work at the middle school level as we can see in a room guard rail interim goal 4.2 some attention he needs to be given to our secondary schools and that's calling out to us in the area of self-regulation and this specific wraparound resource and funding to go for Transforming Our middle schools is an example to your point remember Jackson some of what to really Target the guardrail with it we go to the schools instructional Council

[01:18:00]
to decide if it's something that they want to use as research so Dr Salazar for example can have all these resources that can go to the instructional Council and then the Buy in kind of comes with whether the instructional Council wants to use this resource this resource so that it's the school has a say but we're able to provide the resources that could happen with the web program that was an example of we had middle schools be able to bring it to their instructional councils if they want to do it we had a lot that wanted to that we didn't know if we could afford it so we were able to expand the budget to allow for all middle schools to do it but the connection between the resources and the input from staff really happens at the instructional level okay thank you I appreciate one more Medicals that are being we are

[01:19:00]
qualitative data prior to developing these so for example The Advisory imagining The Advisory advisory resources we sent survey surveys to principles teachers and students to collect what do they and what how would they reimagine advisory and their lessons that are part of that so that's just an example of one another one is with the pre-k through 3rd grade scope and sequence that is also being looked at as with teachers and getting their voice to any and that's why a lot of the rollouts are happening next year is a lot of it we're collecting voice prior to make sure that it's ready to roll it out for implementation I was going to ask you a question but I think I'm going to defer to anybody on

[01:20:00]
educational

[01:21:00]
high school students with disabilities ensuring their perspectives are equally recognized and informs future decision-making are you referring to the special education intensive support adaptation yes yes yes I'm sorry I just wanted to know more about as a moving forward high school students with disabilities just how are you going to take

[01:22:00]
this initiative actually was fostered or realized by our fall progress monitoring conversation that we had and with specialty the call to action from board member Dominguez in saying that we really need to look at who is taking these surveys so I do appreciate that after that meeting we had we had a conversation about needs students that are in District programs so like our students with it in IGS and SES those those District programs and he actually met with the vendor of the

[01:23:00]
what happens in mindsets platform to really look at what how do we add accommodations and modifications to the survey for those really unique needs which I believe is about 1 percent of our student population in APS and what we did was we the vendor said we don't have anything like that which for us was an unacceptable answer and so we said we have to do something and so meeting with the amazing special education department and brainstorming ideas on how we can truly include those voices because we want to make sure all voices are included in our surveys and so we ended up developing our own unique way of collecting the data using those survey responses and so what we did was we were able to work with our Elementary first and 5th and develop a

[01:24:00]
unique way of supporting the teachers and supporting the students to be able to take the survey and if you look at our supplemental data on our supplemental report for 4.1 in their I included the feedback survey because we we had those students take the survey and I also wanted to include the teacher feedback because we also surveyed the teachers after to see how we can enhance this process before we start rolling it out to secondary so you'll be able to see the positive feedback from the teachers about this process and then also areas of growth from the teachers and so that was a response that we really wanted to see his how did this how do we make this process better and also use this feedback work with the vendor to to make sure that these accommodation modifications are part of

[01:25:00]
the platform rather than us uploading these surveys so what we did was we uploaded the surveys into the platform and the vendor entered them into the system so we are working with the vendor to really make sure that next year there are these accommodations and modifications based on our process that we developed in Albuquerque Public Schools and so using the feedback from the teachers and so this is where we're looking at now next year all not only just Elementary Middle School in high school but making sure all those kids have access to it and the reason why we have a couple middle schools involved is because I had a few principles reach out and say how do I collect this voice and I said well we're doing this in elementary so if you want to try and say yes let's do it because it's the same it's the same questions except for a couple few questions in the survey that are the same for secondary and so that is that is how we are going to leverage this next year is making sure

[01:26:00]
all students have access to this and working with the vendor to make sure that it's in the platform so it's not another thing that teachers have to do which which was this process based on the feedback that we're really looking to make sure that this is accessible next year thank you thank you thank you so much I have a question if I may first of all I this is very exciting to read this progress monitoring report because I could just see the wheels turning expanding and really taking to Heart what we heard tonight that we're not getting anywhere unless Gulf War comes first and so I so appreciate so appreciate the work that you've done on this and

[01:27:00]
so just know that as I have to bring up this question while our Native Americans are demonstrating a high level of self-regulation given the recent high level of software regulation as reported here in the answer to number 112 we have received I have received an alarming amount of reports from Native American parents from a few during public forum and then I heard more at the recent Monday night banquet celebration of graduating seniors

[01:28:00]
there's a rise in reports on bullying among our Native Americans and so while they are doing great and self-regulation that number all of a sudden became to me in light of these reports I looked at it differently they're working really hard to hold it together so my question is what strategies can the district use to address the concern and I realized that will require a deep dive because I have no idea whether it's in the secondary or in the primary level but I think I'll keep the question what strategies

[01:29:00]
members of the board I would think that that would be measured more in the belonging the Doctor's house or talked about so if we look at these as the data measuring the skills were looking at we don't see that come up because the we don't see a gap in in that area but if we're talking about bullying usually that comes up in a sense of belonging which we're not measuring as part of the goal but it's a measure and that's I think why doctors are pointed that out too is we look at the sense of belonging as like an underlying measure like a secondary measure to make sure that students feel a sense of belonging to them come to the realization and all of these other skills so I think working more on schools looking at

[01:30:00]
principal Advisory Group that each school has and really listening to the voice of the students because the students have really been able to open up to the principals in that group and find a trusting Place were they able to also come up with Solutions I think the other part from middle school particularly is where we overall see a larger number of students that don't feel a sense of belonging or bullying we are implementing that where everyone belongs because it's really how we at least start at the full picture of a strategy of how we're going to create spaces for students as they enter sixth grade to feel that sense of belonging to be connected to an 8th grade Mentor so that they have somebody that they're attached to and so that's like the larger strategy and then within that we can measure the sense of belonging and the schools are able we don't report out the sense of belonging but the schools

[01:31:00]
able to see that and I thank you for that answer I just felt it necessary to bring this up and I know it requires a targeted approach somehow and and just really thank you

[01:32:00]
yes I do have a question thank you it's it's good to see all of you and hear your voice is so my question is in both 4.1 and 4.2 there is a common theme or root cause surrounding building student and teacher relationships and how it will enhance School climate which will in turn boost how students feel about their skills have his and mindsets so in 4.1 planned action there is a mention about schools attending a two-day training in February that focused on concepts of school climate relationships with adults and a sense of belonging so can you expand on how the strategy is learned in this training will be implemented in the classroom in order to Target the need for building student teacher relationships Oregon I would say that relationships on the are the on-ramp of learning and every child

[01:33:00]
and it and and building relationships also doesn't happen by chance it's very intentional and so what the the training that is is happening through is restorative approaches and the first two days is all about building relationships and specific strategies to the relationships knowing the student by the name knowing the students circumstances leveraging a lot of data points that we have as a district to be able to also see what are some other side of the story to be able to build those relationships and so those are those are the strategies and one of the strategies that they utilize as well as how to build circles and utilize circles effectively in that restaurant training good evening I just wanted to add a nuisance is really important sharp approach to

[01:34:00]
restorative approaches and that is a restorative approaches is a proactive way of building our school climate I think often times when we think about restorative approaches restorative justice we're thinking about what happens after a student makes a mistake and that is indeed part of it but we're looking at it is a much more of a let's build relationships Let's Help the adults know how to build those relationships with students and that way we're creating environments where it's safe to take risks it's safe to make a mistake you're okay we're still with you but then we can actually restore after the fact is if you don't create that sort of stability in the environment is actually really hard to do the rest of work after the fact so the training and I appreciate Dr Salazar's examples really building on for example circles have a really well known strategy but how does that build relationships between kids and adults

[01:35:00]
it's a really critical aspect of establishing School climate I appreciate your answers and the intentionality behind it and just a follow-up I know that we are working like with the teachers to build that but there is also a need from students to understand how to build relationships with the adults in their classroom so is there any work with students that you were doing thank you board member one of the things that I would like to look at it specifically with middle school is the web program where they're actually here as students working with students so for example we have 8th grade students that would be mentoring 6th grade students and we are excited to see what the training suffice from the Arizona training that all the middle school principals and a team of teachers went to as well and so that is an example of how students would be building

[01:36:00]
the capacity amongst each others in relationships building I can't get one more quick example we've been talking about particularly among our elementary developing their peer mediation skills so when there is conflict on the playground in the classroom that the students are trained to not necessarily react to one another but be in a more self-regulated space and mediate the conflict on their own great thank you I think it's it's super important and I appreciate that you will give us some of those quotes as well as part of the report because it's good to see what students are saying directly and how the strategies and the programs that you're using is directly tied to what students are saying and you know part of that is saying I want my teachers to care more or ask me more questions about how I'm doing and seeing that put an action is exactly what we want so thank you

[01:37:00]
board member Astoria members of the board to further that with the strategy doctor Salazar did present this information to our senior leadership team to review so I think it's really important to note that these reports don't just stop here but we actually were using those open-ended response as a leadership team so that as all elements in the district or working on strategies for next year they're able to use the same information and the open-ended responses that he went over with us really helped the leadership team hear the student voice and how they're making decisions for next year so I think it's important to know how student voice is really working through the whole districts great thank you member do you have anything else no that's it thank you

[01:38:00]
so I was folding laundry this past week and I had an opportunity to listen to a podcast which the aps team prepared about goal for and yes there are many times that my children walk in the room and they're like what are you listening to but I appreciate that because that podcast was well produced very comprehensive very entertaining even and didn't answer all of the questions I think that I could have possibly have however I will ask when anyway which is I think sometimes there can be an either real or perceived off between things that get measured with standardized measures such as these goals these girls have a Minds on our students Focus schools overall and other things that don't get measured and standardized ways like access to Community Gardens

[01:39:00]
like Fine Arts like ethnic studies and we've talked about this before on the board in terms of how do we make sure that that trade-off is not happening and so my questions my question to you cuz I do feel like your answer to that question in the past has been great my question is what strategies are in place to make sure that that trade-off is not happening at the classroom level that there is not a trade-off of things that kids really love and enjoy for the focus on measurements I can start the microphone I think that the important thing to know is that as you know these data that we look at is really like the high level of what you're seeing when the schools look at these data they're able to really

[01:40:00]
look at how all of the different aspects of their school are promoting this sense I think we heard a principal tonight from Eugene Field talk about that a little bit and how they're looking at what does contribute to the success of their school how do we see adding for example art and music into our elementary schools how do we see that as a reflection of seeing this increase of perseverance you know so we're really looking at the schools really can dig in to see like what is that they're doing we've seen schools that have genius hour for example the students will have higher scores on certain elements of the skills habits and mindsets because we're not correlating a directly like does this make you feel this way because it's underneath and so looking at this is a very high level then the schools are able to look underneath and say are we giving access to our students will see a lot of that in the open and

[01:41:00]
open response to as far as what students are saying is making them feel connected would you all like to add as you fight over the microphone not a president of the board Dr Blakey I would say first of all that I didn't realize that the podcast made it live but that's a big deal and I'm glad that it made prime time I'm glad you enjoyed it I also would say that I think one of the perhaps unintended consequences of the work of progress monitoring is the renewed and profound use of data and multiple pieces of data one of which I would like to lift up and celebrate in direct response to your question is student voice in their course requests so we have a common card that is Baseline for every one of our high schools for example we've talked about this in the past where we now are being

[01:42:00]
able to more on intentionally look at the notion of equity throughout our district to really harness their voice their desires to ensure relevance in their high school education for example to make sure that we are offering the courses that they are interested in be it fine arts robotics stem what have you and if for whatever reason at a given school that is not being offered the onus is on us to change our adult Behavior to strike the connection for that student so I think that is a very concrete example of how we at the secondary high school level specifically are connecting with the relevancy of student desire in their education the other piece that I would like to bring up at the elementary school level as an example in Dr Blake alluded to it is the genius hour work we're really looking at a 6 week cycle

[01:43:00]
example of school looking and measuring and I'm asking what are you interested in building a kite and flying it what is the science behind that really looking to see what are how do I build a robot and make it function and what is the science behind that how do I quilt how do I write poetry these are all different aspects of adult to Student Connection I think one of the things that's inspiring about the genius our work that really has taken off I would say in large measure since its infancy is a student realizing what is Gonzalez is interested in and she brings that to her at genius our that's a profound Connection in terms of an enhancement to the curriculum president when I would just add to that is that

[01:44:00]
Workshop today actually we told principles to make sure that they look at the data in multiple ways and see what overarching data that you can have that's quantitative so looking at our goal one goal to go 3 go for which is pretty much all quantitative data to be able to give yourself some patterns and a point Direction then look at student group data within those groups to be able to give you a little bit more focused Direction and then look at the open responses and student feedback student voice to be able to understand the experiences in mindsets of students staff Community to inform and shape next steps and include that into the United States so those are those are actually when you thinking about your data question we actually we told the principals think about that and make sure not that doesn't get lost at the left out

[01:45:00]
I think I just really appreciate elevating all these strategies that are happening data genius hour you know all the initiatives that we want to put in place but one thing that my team I think it's really sick of hearing from me is the word coherence we're always looking about it's not this thing and then this thing and then this thing but rather it's a whole strategy and we're always looking for entry points into one another strategies and I appreciate and I think you see in the progress monitoring the work that's being done between go one and go for for example so it's not that we're just only doing reading at this time and now we're only looking at schools in mindsets but really helping everybody are

[01:46:00]
practitioners our community members our principles understand like you find the on-ramp and the student voice has been I think probably the greatest asset that we've been able to bring to that on ramp in terms of whether it's offering more courses to students based on their interests or you know elevating you get to pick your Genius hour everything is still happening at the same time and so just thinking about it as one big picture we may progress Monitor and small bits and so it feels like maybe it's just this but it's not it is a really large scale initiative where everybody is coming together to support one another to build students and all of the girls so my second question

[01:47:00]
can you tell me a little bit more about how your approach of comprehensive counseling is going to lead to increased student outcomes and specifically I'm thinking of something that was in the data that you gave to us that really stood out to me and it was you just brought it up Miss jet the connection versus compliance what are we doing to ensure that the counseling that are students are receiving to improve student outcomes is not just to check the box that is actually making a connection to drive a better outcome for Gulf War

[01:48:00]
thank you board member Jackson we recently had our end of the year counselor meeting we're all counselors are there an amazing amazing things that happened in this District as far as the amazing collaboration between the administrators and the counselors we sent a team of counselors and administrators to a conference and all of them came back on what they're going to do next year and a lot of that was about instilling systems and structures to be more aligned towards what truly is a comprehensive counseling model and so one of the things that we're looking at is how do we incorporate that into all our schools where it's counseling is consistent across the district the expectations are consistent but to also give the schools of a model to strive for which is the

[01:49:00]
what's the model which is being wrapped ready what that means is that you are able to have evidence that your counseling programs have led to measurable positive student outcomes that is ramp ready right now we have two in our district out of 146 schools our goal and what we're looking at as far as our district is support those schools that are willing and we had a lot of schools that shared to all counselors that they want to be ramp ready and get ready for that and work as a team to get there cuz it's a very rigorous application and process and we want to see if we can get 20 20/27 that we're going to be putting and we believe that we can do that because we have a lot of counselors that are pretty much already there but with now with some support and leverage of resources to make sure that their model aligns to the standards for counseling and then also making sure that they follow

[01:50:00]
ask a model requirements to be able to do that and so that is what the companies of counseling more is how do your how does your counseling give evidence to increase student outcomes and can I just clarify is that just for I do know when one of the ramp ready schools is and is that just for elementary schools or is that going to be a cross the K-12 Spectrum cable okay thank you and this is with regard to 4. 1 2

[01:51:00]
restorative approaches section how you talk about building the the framework and aligning practices but I guess that's my question how are you building the framework and to what are you aligning the rest of approaches practice that I wasn't clear about that so we currently have in our negotiated agreement about restorative practices and it's actually outdated it was supposed to be completed and so we are resurfacing in collaboration with multiple stakeholders so there we have a district which consists of

[01:52:00]
teachers principals District Personnel to really look at what we have done in the past what we did last year with our with our trainings and what how do we align that to the skills habits and mindsets of our goals of our goal for and so that task force has been meeting throughout the year and actually those out the task force is how we came up with the eight school that are the early adopters is either they were a principal in the task force or a teacher part of the task force be able to really look at how do we look at implementation our most our latest meeting that we had we met as a team to really look at benchmarks of implementation Florida so that's where a lot of the work is occurring and we will continue that work period so what data

[01:53:00]
just looked at the pilot schools for the initial cohort and how does it aligned to the overall strategy but that's kind of a technical embedded with this task force was really looked at we wanted for that so we were working with our collaboration with our teacher Union to really see how we can be a part of this so that the teacher you actually selected for teachers and we were responsible for principals and so when we were working with the assistance and so that's how those schools were selected there either selected by the teacher by the principal and then next year the courts will be will be looking at the performance framework and other indicators for those cohorts we have him yet

[01:54:00]
so my question is essentially what more do we need to know about public family and Community understanding or not of goal for so specifically as we speak about skills habits and mindsets I asked about at the district level at the school level and so this is what more do we need to know about what the community understands or doesn't understand or believe parents in particular about this goal of this work these strategies for president Gonzalez that's a great question and the first thing I thought was I think it would be wise of us to bring this work to Our advice so I have a parent advisory Council the principles all have advisory councils so I really don't think that we know what they need but we need to ask them and so I think

[01:55:00]
it's a great topic to start with our parent advisory Council as far as what do they understand about it and how can we connect it more so I think that that's a great question and it gives us in going into the next year now how do we get a lot of input from our students in the principal advisory Council they like to give once the principal started like talking to them and then following up with what they said they were like oh wait we can ask for something else and we and so that's been great but I think with our parent advisory Council that's a great conversation to have to start with them is their understanding a bit and how we can connect it to them president president which I really appreciate because this is a place where I think we can get stronger is the standards baseball

[01:56:00]
working together but in that development of a of a revised standard space progress report that truly reflects our priority standards and academics we also added skills habits and mindsets indicators and so beginning next year as we do parent-teacher conferences as we're using that report we will be engaging more and more with families regarding skills habits in mindsets Madam president for families and wishing all schools to have that representation that would be another Avenue

[01:57:00]
on the representation for their icy do we have any final questions but okay programs the report notes efforts to expand Partnerships with Community agencies to enhance wrap around support which agencies are currently involved in this work and how are they selected or evaluated for impact I would say that our program has been highlighted by the state as very exceptional and and so much so that they have encouraged us to share what we are doing in our programming

[01:58:00]
I would say that there are multiple agencies City County a lot of so it would be hard to narrow and say something say something without leaving some out but there's a lot of collaboration I had the pleasure I was kind of a I was hoping you know it's 200 I have to sit with Crystal Wilson wow our house so yeah and so but but the question remains and maybe we don't know at this point but how are they selected or evaluated for impact thank you for remembering this I think most of that work is happening to our community school coordinators and councils we have done a lot of work around asset mapping School Community to see what is available for families particularly in the community so it's

[01:59:00]
and so you know going through that strategy of asset mapping what is here and who are the partners who are wanting to come into the school in order to really make that difference creating an environment where it's it's okay for somebody to make a mistake or to feel comfortable and I think really what you're referring to that I don't think anybody's said the word is psychological safety and it's something that I know we are trying to facilitate in the work

[02:00:00]
here in the board we are trying to make it a safe environment for people to inquire about things make mistakes be curious and know that the people that they're surrounded with are going to help them in that endeavor and we're going to help each other and so I think that that is so important and thank you so much for your efforts to do that for our students because if they don't feel safe like a logically and physically we can't do anything else for them so thank you for this productive conversation now we must vote on whether or not we will accept this monitoring report as a point of clarity we are voting to accept this report as a formal acknowledgment that we had a satisfactory conversation with the superintendent and have a deeper understanding of how the current reality for students lined up with our vision for them in order to accept we must answer yes to the following three questions does the reality of this report meet our vision of the goal is their growth toward the vision is there a strategy and plans sufficient to cause growth toward the division if the answer to all three is yes

[02:01:00]
and the superintendent is performing yes yes okay at this point to accept this for facilitating that progress monitoring session and I will entertain a motion to accept the report I move we accept the progress monitoring reports for interim goals 4.1 and 4.2 skills habits and mindset for Life success this is number Texas and again thank you for all the work important work that you are schools and teachers are

[02:02:00]
6.2 which is to consider approval of revised progress monitoring calendar and are presenter for this is superintendent Blakey thank you president Gonzalez members of the board tonight you're being asked to adopt the revised progress monitoring calendar the outlines one each goal interim goal and guardrail will be monitored through 2028 the update calendar insurance at least four times annually with no more than two goals scheduled per month these adjustments are meant to support consistent Focus conversations about student progress and to align monitoring with the availability of meaningful data and we asked for your approval on the calendar great thank you are there any questions about the monitoring calendar I do have a question

[02:03:00]
I'm looking for it and maybe it's just I'll just read it's an observation but also a request and I would ask that the there's a reference to upcoming to how we make adjustments to the calendar

[02:04:00]
3300 qualitative concerns first explaining interim goals and guardrails more effectively to our community feedback so that we can get feedback regarding the implementation of those interims and a special focus on Pueblo public Just for future reference as if there's a need when there's a need to make adjustments thank you for that it's just a point of a clarification are you speaking to the progress monitoring calendar 6.2 or to the to your board of ed

[02:05:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:06:00]
yes yes yes so the motion carries and we have a new progress monitoring calendar thank you to the superintendent for your work on that and your team as well we will move on to agenda items 7 which is to considerable of the consent agenda this is approval for items 7.1 through 7.14 can we have a motion and a second I move we proved the consent agenda items for items 7.1 through 7477.14 this is number benavidez thank you we have a motion and a second can we have a roll call vote please

[02:07:00]
yes now let's start again yes yes so that motion carries as well we will move on to agenda item 8 which is our action items for this we will consider approval of the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 2026 including our Charter School budgets and granting approval for board member signatures on all necessary documents Dr Blakey will begin this presentation for us but we also have joining us at our Chief Financial Officer Rosalinda Montoya executive director of budget and strategic planning Dr anthonia Gonzalez who is the Deputy of leadership and learning and Miss Melanie play who's in charge of federal state and District budget stuff members of the board tonight the board of education is asked to approve the Albuquerque Public Schools budget for the fiscal year

[02:08:00]
convert 2026 at its core this budget is about one thing and that is our students it reflects months of thoughtful planning meaningful communication and collaboration with school leaders staff and students all with the shared goal of better serving the young people entrusted to us the proposed budget aligns with the board's goals and guardrails and is built to support Student Success amid declining enrollment changes to State funding formula and the expiration of our essays it invests in the services that matter most to students and families including academic supports the insurance and access to grade level learning in every classroom the budgets are focused on social and emotional well-being of our students and it allegedly allocate resources more equitably providing increased support to schools with greater needs while offering more flexibility a schools that are demonstrating strong outcomes in addition the budget includes

[02:09:00]
20 million investment from The District's fund balance to support the transition to a modern enterprise resource planning system a move that will help improve efficiency and transparency across the organization this is a student-centered budget that keeps her Focus where it belongs on creating the learning environments opportunities and support for every child need to thrive and with that I stand with I stand for questions with Chief finance officer and the rest of the budget team thank you Doctor Blakey and thank you to the full budget team and all of APs leadership for the work that you've done over the past several months to adapt to our new budget policy which required monthly presentation starting in January and a whole lot of other stuff required from you as well so thank you for that I speaking for myself do you think the process has been very clear and coherent and very helpful to have those updates all along the way you've been going through the budget development process

[02:10:00]
so hopefully we're all clear on the budget but I will open it up to questions from members of the board and I will start from my left but remember absolutely I will move to my right now to make sure that as we are moving through this budget process in which we are realigning to focusing on student outcomes I was able to look at some like suggested questions if things that we really need to be making sure that we're looking out for his budget is presented and as I was going down the list you guys have answered a lot of the

[02:11:00]
I think that's something to be commended just you know I think the first one that said is there are strategic clarity about what new strategies are being added will you answer that question last time so I don't want to ask a question just for the sake of ask that you have given us data you've given us examples you've given us you've answered every question that I have had so that's a long way of me saying I will absolutely prove this budget because I think that again we as a board have asked you to align to out to do not comes and you have done that and thank you for your patience tonight you guys have been wonderful we really appreciate you hard work and putting this together and for the multiple presentations that you give us and the community and all that works so thank you

[02:12:00]
thank you for that remember to make it and I asked this question in part because I think the public needs to know just how hard it's been because there are lots of Rumblings schools have reached out ptas have reached out you know they've lost money and these are the challenges of being focused on our goals right having a budget aligned with our goals and so where and how does the budget prioritize improving the quality of instruction in the areas of our goals especially for goals won in the areas that feel free to address as well

[02:13:00]
president Gonzalez and board member Dominguez members of the board I think we've tried to give you enough information and as the schools have done their budgets to really align the work of the goals to the budget so everything that they are doing should have a blue line to which goal they're working on some examples of that could be with schools are struggling having a transformational coach or community school coordinator looking at how we are working on go for by providing Behavior elementary schools really looking at if something is not aligned specifically to a goal is it something that we necessarily need and so I as the schools have been working on their budgets I think they're at a really good place right now to be able to see

[02:14:00]
they have an influx of enrollment that they would get more FTE which we've been adjusting along the way and I really have to give credit to our budget team primarily for getting this work done at the same time as schools were planning and I think it's one of the first times I've seen that really work in conjunction think this might be the earliest we've ever submitted a budget to the public education department which is why Miss Montoya probably really exhausted right now because it I mean if you think about it the legislative session just ended the governor signed the bill less than a month ago so we've been pretty proactive and how we've been working with the schools so there wasn't really a set time to be able to say this is specifically for gold one because throughout the year we've been working with schools on aligning their resources to impact their goals and so

[02:15:00]
there's not really like a exactly this is going to measure goal one but really looking strategically as how we are aligning our resources via instructional materials FTE other resources that will specifically be aligned to the goals even in the as you see through the finance committee if they if schools are putting in requisitions to goals everybody has it on their mind as far as how is what you're spending a line to goals Dr Gonzalez and the assistant superintendents have sat down with principles when they do have budgets that might be less than they had before to really talk through how is the salon to your goals and when you have to make a cut how is it a launch your goals so that happens at a very like deep level with the assistant superintendents and the school principal as they are working through their budgets do anything to

[02:16:00]
which is something that usually happens in

[02:17:00]
call to be able to adjust FTE that we need to provide to a school now while they're scheduling and so I've been really impressed with the team you see in front of you being able to collaborate because they all work on different floors and different areas but to be able to really put it all together in the schools are able to get adjustments because of that transfer process so all of these little pieces strategically have been put together so the budget didn't become a one-time thing this year so I heard you moved a process from the fall to now we moved to the transfer process to be much more robust and we eliminated the step of bureaucratic step in it so the schools are able to well they make their schedules now be able to see how

[02:18:00]
how many students they really are going to have for the fall typically we make the adjustments to student enrollment in the fall but because we're able to look at the student transfers right now that we're able to balance a lot of the class sizes now in the spring instead of waiting to do it while students are in classes in the fall but we know that okay so that's a great segue into a second another question we know that in the fall and it may change but we know that in the fall numbers just those were the heaviest moments the first six weeks there's lots of movement we get new enrollment and so how are we set up to deal with that because of our enrollment and this process were able

[02:19:00]
to really get a handle of that ahead of time so the numbers we have are more realistic now of course there will always be people you know moving in and out but you know the budget that we have right now is based on last year's enrollment and so as we get new adjustments a lot of schools if they benefit on until the end of the year if they are adjusted because they were based on that they're based on this year's enrollment now the flip side and what we're hoping for is we get more students if we go up in enrollment in the fall then we do have to adjust the budget as students come in if we go down then we see that hit at this time next year and is it flexibility for that in your system for compliance thank you

[02:20:00]
I think you remember Dominguez for those questions I just had one question I have too many papers out here which is related to Roi measures and so we've talked a lot over the process of developing the budget how you think about return on investment my question is really as we move from development to approval of budget into budget management where does ROI come in and how are you thinking about that in the context of budget management and what the finance committee in particular ought to be keeping an eye out for Madam president thank you for that questions a couple of things we are working with schools on the school side through the 90-day plan today at the principal meeting there was two hours and hour and a half that was very connected to the 90-day plan and the school budget one of the things that's being done differently and Dr Blakey alluded to a little bit was the budget as a working

[02:21:00]
so although we're submitting it we're signing it we're saying this is what it looks like it evolves constantly and those of you who follow finance committee understand the transfers and how things work we are tightening up when we are asking for additional FTE when we're moving up to you or when we're asking for money to be transferred a lot of times on the budget side the compliance side it's very easy to say I want to move 5000 from professional development to supplies that's what is allowable in the grant or on the compliance however it does change the program side of things and so we're looking at not just the compliance side but the program side every time schools are departments are trying to move money and or if they're moving or adding which is happening now schools submitted their budgets in March they're saying okay I understand the promising practices I want to move from adene to a Student Success systems coordinator and so we want to align everything to the budget so it's consistent through the 90 day plans

[02:22:00]
your budget transfers were asking schools and departments to provide justifications and Alignment as they go while encouraging them to make those adjustments because schools are evolving enrollment involved and we want them to have the flexibility in the autonomy to do so in addition to that Madam president a superintendent leaky members of the board I would say that the return of learning work that is begun and I was shared in some detail last meeting is set to continue and be enhanced in the coming year in regards to program and materials intervention material specifically we have a slate of programs and to be looked at and plan to really look at these and to really test the return on learning that we've come to really familiarize ourselves with as we move into next school year so the

[02:23:00]
idea is that we are really keeping what we can support at the district level as comprehensive but as narrow as possible so that we are able to really support our diverse needs at the ground level and if we are spending on a resource that the return on investment is low because of utilization participation whatever the case may be we need to ask the tough questions why why not and so on so that we are able to be wise with limited resources that we do have in place thank you and I guess my question is maybe like five levels more tactical than that so if you're doing work on returning and we are really looking at the 90-day plans and schools and apartments are making their justifications when transfer request come to the finance committee

[02:24:00]
what processes procedures are in place for the board to know that that return on investment return on learning analysis has been a part of what's being presented as we think about the transfers I think that's through the approval process so before it so we have program approval so it will go to either Miss jet Dr Blair Dr Gonzalez for program approval and so when it goes to them they're able to see is this a program that we're currently looking at the probe that's not there have been instances this year where we have had budget come through for materials that we have found would not be a return on investment and those go back as so by the time it gets to you it has been approved by the program side and by the finance side to make sure that it's a program that has been evaluated for and then the there are programs that

[02:25:00]
would be told that we aren't going to prove it at this time because this program is under evaluation and if I may add Madam president members of the board superintendent leaky through quarterly meetings with departments we are asking that exact question what is the return on learning what is the impact on student outcomes they're asked to bring the data with them as well as to speak to how this is changing that outcome and what the return on learning is so when they present the budget now they've done that and then we're asking that question and it should align and if it doesn't that would raise the Red Flags Okay thank you for that that's super helpful so we know by the time it gets to finance committee approval you have that conversation that was really what I was trying to get to in terms of how Roi is integrated into management not just development are there any other questions from the board on the budget right then I will go ahead and entertain

[02:26:00]
I moved to approve the proposed Albuquerque Public Schools budget for fiscal year 2026 including Charter Schools budgets and granting approval for board member signatures on all necessary documents this is member Jackson a second this is board member Dominguez thank you we have emotion and a second can we have a roll call vote please yes and I just want to Echo the appreciation for the finance team with the round of applause for all of the work that you have put into this relate that to out City Center thank you all right with that we will move on

[02:27:00]
what's your agenda item number 9 which is the president's report and so we'll start with public forum and acknowledge again that public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue but we do want each speaker to know that they were heard and they were working with the administration on resolutions some of the issues that we heard tonight were related to skills habits and mindsets related to explicit material and APS libraries special education best practices student outcomes focused governance the budget engagement with families and students Staffing at our schools and Panorama results specifically for mckinney-vento students we want to thank our public speakers for that and know that the administration takes the those concerns anything that has been made seriously I want to also acknowledge that it is to the season it's graduation time so graduation celebrations are already in full swing which is kind of hard to believe but last week we celebrated our first graduation with the accomplishments of the college and career high school graduates

[02:28:00]
next week we will have the aps Magnet School students they will be have their opportunity to shine followed by the traditional High School graduations on the week of May 19th so I hope that everyone every member of the board and the staff can take the time to celebrate and applaud all of the hard work and dedication of our students parents teachers and staff who have all play in community members who have all played such a vital role in this journey I know I speak for myself and for my fellow board members when I say we are really excited to join in the festivities it's one of the most fun parts of being a board member and being able to celebrate these remarkable students as they embark on all of their exciting New Adventures I'm really excited about graduation I do want to acknowledge we do have a couple of existing ad hoc committees and so as a reminder at hot committees are not standing committees are committees that have been charged with a specific task or deadlines that they have to meet

[02:29:00]
so we have two at heart committees who are currently active I want to just provide an update on both of them one is the community engagement at Hawk Community engagement and Outreach ad hoc committee as we all know we approved a new community engagement calendar tonight that calendar is pretty comprehensive spans over two years integrated the feedback that the board provided so thank you for providing all that feedback but also integrated a couple some new stuff new strategies including a community training on effective governance and so this community engagement ad hoc committee will continue to work to establish the framework for a community training on effective governance which according to the calendar we just approved we'll need to be completed by the end of July which is kind of crazy because it's already met so got to get working on that the other is we do have an ad hoc committee on student voice and I just wanted to share that when members

[02:30:00]
