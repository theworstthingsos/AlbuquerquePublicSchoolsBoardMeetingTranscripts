[00:32:00]
a little just a little history to it since it's so new so I guess I'll be getting history just as you know APS has about 14000 employees including teachers principals counselors nurses it text bus drivers educational assistance custodians cafeteria workers secretaries coaches and many many more some of them are here in Orange vests teachers are normally things and recognized monthly through our Pepsi teacher of the month and so a few months ago APS launched a very unique way to think other kinds of employees here in APS and our new recognition program is the employee recognition of the month employees are chosen for the recognition through a nomination process anyone public within the district can nominate an employee who's been employed by Albuquerque Public Schools for 6 months or longer a committee

[00:33:00]
which is made up of several different employee groups and unions review the nominations and score the employees based on several several criteria including going above and beyond to make a difference in their role excelling as a team player carrying out each day with a positive and welcoming attitude demonstrating Innovation leadership or passion for their job and enthusiastically supporting the mission of APs for employees are chosen each month as employees of the month each employee will be celebrated on a billboard across the city honored at a board meeting like this evening

[00:34:00]
that's our very first four employees of the month for January and I would like to introduce to you Joseph Cordova the activities director at West Mesa High School Chuck Cogburn the leadership instruction instructor at Wilson Middle School Sky Holly a redirector at Sombra Del Monte Elementary School and Jennifer Newman Specialists of board Services office I would like to ask all the family and friends of Mr Coburg

[00:35:00]
up and please be recognized by our leadership superintendent reading and our board of directors

[00:36:00]
I'm sorry I forgot to mention that there is a plaque that is on the wall it's now has been if you ever come from this side of the building there's a plaque that will have an ongoing list so we talked about when you have your reunion tour you can come see your name

[00:37:00]
associate superintendent of zone for Troy Hughes superintendent Radio tonight I have the honor of introducing a unique achievement for an APS high school before I go into it I'd like to invite up Georgia and assistant principal Lee Arnett so these are the three people that had a instrumental part of this overall operation that you're going to hear about and what they've been able to bring to the Cleveland High School was not only recently named a unified Champions schools Banner school by the Special Olympics of New Mexico but also as one of the top 30 on ESPN in regards of that little was also giving the

[00:38:00]
honor for the strides the students staff teachers have made in the area of disability awareness inclusion and acceptance in the united unified Champion Banner schools students with and without disabilities are paired together to practice sports build friendships and work on relationships and communication skills these experiences promote a climate where students with disabilities feel welcome and are routinely included and Phil part of all the activities opportunities and functions a unified school is a prestigious honor and speaks volumes about the teachers students coaches and other staff at La quavo and the work that they are doing there are several staff members

[00:39:00]
level three people if you would please stand so we can recognize you for all your hard work and thank you all very much on a side note these are products of APs parents and I've had the joy of working with them as well and they're absolutely fantastic families that care and put forth a lot so thank you for everything that you guys do to help with the experiences of students and their communities if everybody could please give a round of applause for these wonderful people

[00:40:00]
hey Google

[00:41:00]
our next recognition will be introduced by the executive director of board Services Miss Brenda Yeager yes good evening Dr Piercy members of the board and superintendent Reedy tonight we are recognizing to additional people Dr Hugh Prather and Megan Buchanan for project that the board and superintendent worked on at the last board retreat and it's been awhile since that last board retreat so let me remind you what the work was that you worked on so Dr Prather LED you through an exercise that helped you explore in a firm board Norms so each of you and the superintendent identified your individual top two or three priorities for improving communication with each other and the superintendent Norm such as do your homework for board member board meetings exercise patience when you don't understand respect other perspectives and this is what your work look like

[00:42:00]
board member Patterson suggested that these board Norms somehow be captured in a mural or some sort of artistic renderings so that each board member sees the norms and is reminded of them as you walk down the hall to enter the boardroom so that request probably would have sent me into a panic because any kind of artwork would be stick figures from me but I know that we had a brand new or almost brand new employee at the time and she had only been with us a few weeks at that point and I know that she enjoyed artistic creativity and she participated participated in art shows around the city even though I

[00:43:00]
I hadn't seen any of her artwork at this time but I knew she had she had that bent so Dr Prather and I met with Megan to talk about the project and we didn't provide much direction we gave her this beautiful sticky piece and we told her that we wanted to tie all of these priorities back to the heart of the work which is students that should be the basic of what she was doing and then I think I threw in at the end and by the way as long as we're doing this it should have some kind of a shelf life it shouldn't die with this particular board it should last on the future boards if we can possibly do that so this is what I would like our Vanna White's tonight

[00:44:00]
so you see that she turned this page of wonderful stickies that you had over here into five pictures that will be hung in the hallway as you walk into the ball into the boardroom the focus of each art piece is students as you can see and if you when you go up after the meeting and look closely those little buttons they are on those are your bored norms and they are stuck there with velcro so if in sometime in the future a future board wants to change your board Norms we can we can do that so I would like Dr Prather and Megan Buchanan to come to the podium please and would you recognize them as they come forward

[00:45:00]
so and I do believe we have friends and family too of the folks if you would stand up we know this takes a we know this takes a family so thank you very much so a doctor is a former APS employee but he probably in his recent work has probably touched I would say every of each of the 89 school districts across the state and so when he certainly has worked with this board and prior boards everything from rolls of bored to communication with superintendent and just to variety of topics and so we want to thank him for the work that he has done with you all over the years and has only been in the board services and she hates us by the way she's only

[00:46:00]
who's been in the board Services office since July but she truly understands that the bottom line of our work is the education of our students and you can clearly see that so we're very pleased that she's sharing her talents and skills with us so please thank these two for this project skip

[00:47:00]

[00:49:00]
thank you for being here the board of education has established rules for expected civil behavior during the meeting and public forum upon signing into speak tonight you received a signature form and copy of the procedural directive which outline those rules for expected Behavior the presiding officer will enforce these rules as appropriate throughout the meeting public forum is an opportunity for the Board of Education to hear your comments

[00:50:00]
it's not a dialogue with the board members tonight there are five speakers so to accommodate each speaker each speaker will have 2 minutes for comments within the 45 minute public forum the time remaining to speak will appear on the screen in front of you at the end of the given time please complete your sentence quickly so that other speakers will have a chance to speak and you may not yield your and use time to another speaker you're always welcome to submit additional comments to the board and writing if you are unable to convey your message or you're not able to speak with him the 45-minute public forum so the Board of Education encourages you to stay for the entirety of the meeting so you may listen to the board member comments before we adjourn only at this time may your concerns be addressed at the discretion of each board member so our first speaker is Brian trumpco

[00:51:00]
good evening board members and administration pleased to be here tonight first off let me start by saying the Carpenters Union is here to support the bond issue we're very excited to see construction and high-quality buildings being built for our students it makes a better education when they can see that their respected enough that we give them a quality place to go to school building is not always cheaper is not always the best way to build many times on paper it may look like that the quality is better and people respect that there must much less likely to do damage to something that impressive the Carpenters would like to ask that when we build our buildings not only do we build better buildings and good quality we would like to see the opportunity to double the value of our tax dollars and by doing that and the way we can do that

[00:52:00]
we're going to improve and use our tax dollars in a way that you can present it bipartisan before the public and say hey this is a good thing we can build a great building and we also can train our next generation of workers just like APS wants each student to be trained well and and walk out with a good education we need an opportunity for our apprentices and our young construction workers to also be trained well to do that we have to have jobs apprenticeship is 4 weeks a year in classroom and 48 weeks a year on the job site and in many cases are contractors have not been able to successfully bid APS work because of some of the procurement rules we would like to see some changes made that are very simple have contractors that sell perform 15% of the work themselves have some skin in the game we like to see music extra points for

[00:53:00]
contractors that use certified Journeymen journeyman certificates would their workers this building is this room you're standing in this is a beautiful room but I know for a fact this was built by certified as because I was one of the superintendents on the project and the skill shines and it's still shines and it's been here for several years require a general contractor who hire subcontractors that follow the same rules many times the subcontractors are more the problem and if we can make sure that we have that that would be greatly appreciated you have a copy of the paper please read it and call me if you have any questions

[00:54:00]
happy New Year New Year same problems systemic racism in this district has gone out of control from recent situations at Cibola High School for those of you who don't know it's the board of education's responsibility for policies and procedures responsibility or whoever has her position to supervise the principals she seems to be making apologies for the Board of Education

[00:55:00]
I have been going up and talking to Board of Education since I was 15 years old I'm a graduate of your system I am an employee of your system I'm not saying to get rid of racism that's impossible but what I'm saying is for my white leaders to get in front of a camera and apologized for their policies and procedures that aren't being followed by their principles by their staff and it's the students who suffer particularly the Native American students and black students there is no excuses I'm tired of seeing my

[00:56:00]
for attendance apologize for the Board of Education when it's not her job I'm glad you're feeling better period

[00:57:00]

[00:59:00]
local 1319 you guys heard my brother talk about some of the procurement issues that we have and I'll serve you guys I've met several of you guys throughout various with opportunities that we had and if you guys just get what your schools and ask them about what the Carpenters are about we are about investing in our community we are trying to be a part of the solution not the problem we'll be here speaking about the procurement issues that we have it's we have a lot of great contractors that work in Los Alamos labs Sandia National Labs Kurt and Air Force Base and some of the procurement some of the things in your procurement is not allowing these guys to bid on these projects because they haven't done a school in the past three years these are great contractors if they're able to build on their National Laboratories why can't they build our schools you know we as Representatives visit the job site and we're constantly seeing subcontractors from out of state and it's not just they were paying for the school projects and we're not allowed to work on these projects you know we're very upset I'll give you guys an example of what happened with the art project 18 million dollars of our tax money and the guys doing the concrete work out there from El Paso Texas

[01:00:00]

[01:01:00]
Berlin Coker hi my name is made at our last meeting that you understand that this reaction is part of the problem as well last meeting one of the approvals for the

[01:02:00]
cast calendar and one of the demands from the community was to put the Pueblo feast days on the calendar this simple request wasn't even given so much as I mentioned during that portion of the meeting and it causes great concern because it shows to me that there is a lack of agency within the school board that not one of you had written down any of the demands or have you even listen as it seems cuz this is such a simple request as well they're also was a concern for me personally about the scrutiny given to one of the charter schools over IEPs the IEP fulfillment from my experience or more often than not fraudulent in either expectations or executions and it's an issue in most public schools at least from the people that I've talked to with IEPs and me personally as well as my special needs a little brother and one last thing is that there needs to be again a meeting between the school board and the indigenous community and actual

[01:03:00]
dialogue that can be held to express problems or Express Solutions you know both as a learning experience for you guys as well as need to use community on what steps we all can take to help start solving these problems that faces our children but other than that that's sort of is what my goal is going to be here and I will be here at just about every meeting until I start seeing change so stupid thank you for your input that concludes the public forum thank you we're going to the superintendent report thank you president Trump's recently Albuquerque is APS and APS is Albuquerque and I want to highlight a few experiences that reflect how this plays out in the daily experience of our students staff and community

[01:04:00]
for instance we've been reaching out to federal employees who have been furloughed by the recent government Showdown not Showdown shut down I guess it is a showdown by the recent government shutdown who have children in APS we've reached out to them these families can apply for free or reduced lunch meals with an online application that is available both in English and Spanish that walks through the process just one application is needed per family even when children attend different APS schools and of course all students who attend any of the more than 888 qualify for the community eligibility provision can get

[01:05:00]
breakfast and lunch free we want to make sure that everyone understands that this is our way of of making sure that the supports that are offered to our students are well known by the community for the second year APS high school students have received free tablets and high-speed internet through the Sprint's 1 million project I was at one of the giveaways and I let me tell you it was a celebration to end all celebrations more than 1,400 tablets were distributed to students from Early College Academy Freedom Highland High School Rio Grande High School and Native American Community Academy Charter School the 1 million project is the largest corporate initiative in US history to bridge the digital divide and help close the soap called

[01:06:00]
gap for students lacking home internet access it has the results have been very very impressive and I cannot think Sprint enough for their Innovative approach to helping and supporting our students I'm thankful for the partnership of APs with the foundation and with Sprint to help students thrive in school and in life to the idea that APS is Albuquerque in Albuquerque is APS is also reflected in the upcoming special election if you are registered to vote you should have received or will very soon receive a special election mail-in ballot from the Bernalillo County Clerk please remember the funds we are asking for can only be used for capital projects can only be used for refurbishing and for buildings and for upkeep

[01:07:00]
they can never ever be used for operational expenses like salaries I want to make sure there's a lot of confusion with our community as far as well maybe this money instead of being used for whatever purposes we've outlined should go to teacher salaries that would be wonderful but the fact is that by law that is not the way that this works the community decides the upkeep or or the refurbishing of the buildings the community owns the buildings salaries and all operational costs come from the state the state really and truly is not into building or keeping up schools so I think we need to be very very clear on that that difference no matter how you vote I asked please vote because this is a democracy and

[01:08:00]
your voice matters we've worked very hard to make sure that we have the information and the data that you need in order to make an informed decision and all we ask is that you take advantage of your rights and and make sure that your voice is heard if if you have any questions please go to our APS website where all the data and factual information about this special election is available another way that APS is Albuquerque is reflected in our day-to-day experiences it's found in the work that we were doing with Native American communities we have met and are in contact with many of our partners including the Council of great City Schools Western educational Equity Assistance Center

[01:09:00]
Southern Poverty Law Center teaching tolerance the UNM Native American faculty and Harvard were developing cultural competency training for APS administrators teachers school board members and staff with these Partners specifically New Mexico the New Mexico p e d Indian education Bureau where are in conversation with the Indian Pueblo Cultural Arts Center and Dr cajeta from unmute

[01:10:00]

[01:11:00]
2019 at Paradise Hills Community Center from 5:00 until 7:00 p.m. and specifically at Cibola the ethnic studies teachers are also conducting interviews to assess the current School climate and a group of 15 student representatives are working with the Civilized safety coordinator to plan a safe Team all school assembly on February the 5th I'm very proud of the work that we are doing to strengthen our relationships with Native American community and all minority groups this has been very hard work and it cannot be instantaneously clicked on and off we are committed to this and we will continue to work with our communities to ensure that our children feel safe that they are respected and that they feel that the school is

[01:13:00]
members of the board and also the superintendent and Leadership and community members and audience I'm here tonight to request approval of the Indian policies and procedures that is done annually just right before the middle of the impact aid application every year each year the Albuquerque Public School District application to the US Department of Education the annual application requires an updated Indian policies and procedures at the same time on January 31st 2019 the IPP was revised and renewed on June 25th 2018 for alignment to the every student succeeds Act of 2015 and the required federal guidelines in 2018

[01:14:00]
only change to the IPP that you are proving is that our membership the independent committee membership has changed and there were some typos and errors on the document they were minor so those have been corrected the committee reviewed and approved the Indian policies and procedures during a schedule meeting on December 13th 2018 the

[01:15:00]
education to Albuquerque Public Schools recognizes the importance of Native American students maintaining their traditions and values while obtaining educational skills to enable them to be responsible and productive students and members of society the Board of Education desires to ensure educational opportunities for all students including Native American students the Board of Education shall Foster cooperation and maintain an open line of communication with tribal governments whose jurisdictional boundaries include areas within the Albuquerque Public Schools boundaries to verify in accordance with state and federal law which these tribes agree with APS Indian education policies and procedures the superintendent and draft appropriate procedural directives to implement this policy

[01:16:00]
compliance with state and federal Indian education laws and that's what the the board of education's policy says in ih9 and IPP at Tess to that there is an established IPP as required and section 704 of the impact 8 law for children who reside on Indian lands and that the IPP has been shared with the tribes and parents of children residing on eligible Indian lands another method of information dissemination is through a written executive summary after each tribal leaders Summit this is disseminated to leaders and parents of Native American children attending district schools the IPP has six policies there are five procedures also attached to

[01:17:00]
each policy and policy one it says APS will disseminate relevant application evaluations program plans and information related to the local education agencies education program and activities with sufficient advance notice to allow tribes and parents of Native American children the opportunity to review and make recommendations that's policy one and with that is procedure one and there's some procedures outlined in the IPP some of the procedures are rather long and some of them are a little bit shorter so if you look at policy won their talks about the meetings that will occur let me just go just kind of jump around there and procedure one that the independent committee they meet monthly to review programs also they we have a

[01:18:00]
play hearing on each of the applications that goes the objectives before the other applications are submitted the Indian education committee meet quarterly the other thing is that there is a public hearing on title title 7 in in policies and procedure which is what we're doing when the application is reviewed this evening after I'm done here there is a tribal leader consultation meeting that is done one in the fall there's another one in the spring of each year where tribal leaders and parents and Community leaders come to APS into this room where there is dialogue and communication that goes on around education after they see data the IPP is disseminated to every tribal

[01:19:00]
community that is impacted by the impact aid application some of the areas that are impacted or Acoma cochiti Isleta Jemez Laguna Sandia San Felipe Santa Ana Santa Domingo or Kia and the 2008 Kansas City to Navajo region all those communities are within a 50-mile radius of 8:00 p.m. and so those students that live in those boundaries are included in the impact 8 application each year policy 2 the Albuquerque Public School District will provide an opportunity for the tribal leaders and parents of Native American children to provide their views on the district's educational program and activities including recommendations on the needs of their children and on how the district may help those children realize that the benefits of the educational

[01:20:00]
programs and activities and then there's procedures of how those will happen following policy number two policy 3 the Albuquerque Public School District will annually assess the extent to which Native American children participate on an equal basis with non-native Americans in the district's education programs and activities APS will actively consult with and regularly involve the IPC as well as interested tribal officials and parents of Native American students who attend APS in the planning and development of educational programs assist with title 7s which is now in the title 7 application will be available for review by the IPC and other interested members of the Native American community at least 10 days prior to the public meeting generally that is

[01:21:00]
call in January before the middle of the application discussion of equal participation of Native American students will generally be held in January at an APS Board of Education meeting the IPC and interested parents of Native American students who attend APS and tribal officials will review assessment data to develop or modify educational programs or services so as to follow participation of Native American students on an equal basis these findings and recommendations will be presented to the Board of Education in March or as required by federal guidelines policy for the APS school districts of Mississippi or input described in this document policy 5 the APS school district will respond at least in writing to comments and recommendations

[01:22:00]
made by tribes are parents of Native American children and disseminate the responses to the tribal education Department's tribal officials and parents of Native American children prior to the submission of the IPP by the Lea and normally we do that every year through the test report which we bring to the board at the board meetings which is the tribal education status report which is required at the end of every year at the end of July where we review all data and assessments policy six the APS school district will annually provide a copy of the current Indian policies and procedures to the 23 New Mexico

[01:23:00]
I'm saying that I want to thank APS I want to thank the superintendent and the board for the changes that are happening these are positive changes I see that it will have positive impacts it will be our curriculum that is utilized by all students and APS will be impacted in a positive way there will be an open Forum I believe there may be three or four open forums this spring and I'm very grateful that Native American parents and Community leaders will have an opportunity to express their opinions suggestions at this open Forum so I see positive things happening their students high school students in various high schools are having

[01:24:00]
groups and they are responding to having dialogue and discussion about what they've experienced what they would like to see in their education if there will be any changes and we are transcribing those so we have teachers and we have one counselor that are going out and having a student focus group discussions there's going to be professional development that is coming for all of us for all central office leadership principles teachers everybody will receive professional development around cultural sensitivity and relevancy so there is open communication I see that so I see positive things happening so I want to thank all of you for your help for your support and all of this I want to thank God tomorrow for making

[01:25:00]
the buy annual tribal official meetings happen we've been struggling with it to making that happen every fall Every Spring but when she came on board she made that happen and the support there so I want to thank her for that that is it I'm open for questions we have a retreat every June and the committee that's when they schedule their meetings and so we are either at a high school this month we will be at Jimmy Carter Middle School and we've been as far away as is

[01:26:00]
is always positive and so when we meet when parents come to these meetings many of that voice their their their frustrations their issues there's also a parents who come who expresses positivity of what's happening there was one meeting that we have

[01:27:00]
add a month ago where there was one parent at up on the hill Tierra Antigua Elementary School where we were meeting and she stayed at that she's new to Albuquerque schools and she has seen and Improvement academically with her children and she really really thinks that the instruction that her kids are receiving at their particular schools are really helping her children versus some of the schools that they were attending before coming to Albuquerque so she like that but there was also another parent who expressed concerns about the hi teacher people race shows that she seen in that particular School Tiara Antigua so there's pros and cons but basically there's

[01:28:00]
who's the rich discussions and so it's both thank you that's very helpful in the students who attend Albuquerque Public Schools and there are some tribes from Canada

[01:29:00]
play some songs from Alaska and other parts of of the nation and so what we do is that we we take the test report every year which is the tribal education status report which also follows the Indian Education Act there are 12 components in the in Education Act and that addresses all those components in that report we share that by sending copies heart copies of these to the to the president or the governor's or the leadership Administration offices of each tribe representative so there are 123 copies that go out that we mail out the other way that we also with a cover letter and the other way that we communicate with

[01:30:00]
each of these tribal administration offices is through our website we have it on our website and not too long ago a few years ago we had a visit from Canada a group came down from Canada because they had seen our website and they wanted to hear more about how their kids were doing what kind of services we were giving the in fact they wanted to have more conversation so it's very much

[01:31:00]
participating in that program to give a more thorough perspective I think that in my in my years here in APS I've done Native American calling maybe four times and talked about the various programs available to the Native American students in Albuquerque and I don't mind doing it again and addressing that with some of my parent committee members I guess my my concerns to address these concerns take them seriously and move forward thank you thank you thank you thank you

[01:32:00]
is there an alarm on is definitely leading Us in the right direction and I appreciate that is there anything that you feel like we can do as a board in terms of prioritizing supporting resources just to support you help this whole process become as dynamic as it can possibly be is there something more that you need that we need to attend to you know I was prepared for something else but not that but I was prepared last month and I gave out copies I believe to all the board members of that document that we have written up and my parents committee members did do a open Forum during the I believe that December board meeting and in their there are five goals outline that

[01:33:00]
that we need support for for Indian education in APS and I disseminated that to all the board members and to tribal leaders I don't remember from the top of my head so I can't make that up but you have those but I can make it available to you again thank you very much messenger we sent a message out to all Native American parents who have children enrolled in APS about that meeting and we will be doing a reminder next Wednesday the evening before the the

[01:34:00]
put the open Forum the we do we do that from our office and there is a gentleman from Laguna by the name of Stan holder who will be the facilitator in addition to yourself what other APS Administration is there with you to listen and hear concerns I believe that the what was your question again Administration is there with you I believe that so and and the superintendent I just volunteered some

[01:35:00]
how do you reach parents who don't have phone contact information how do you reach those parents who really should be there how do you reach those parents for some of your meetings and I don't know I can check on it if we're still doing that but we make these announcements available in as Flyers to the independent committee we also have some staff members who go to like First Nations or they go to the hospital where like the gathering places

[01:36:00]
we will post our Flyers their wonderful thank you I wanted to hear that thank you brother you know I just wanted to say I know that the policies that are before us is just like the first step right because it's just really policies it's really the proof is in the pudding it's really about what we do with them and how we actually follow up on delivering them I mean as I was reading them I was having some you know I was trying to Envision like who's reading these policies and how these policies are shared and so so some of my cuz I know that you're so sharing these with like the tribal communities and all the parents and students have you ever had feedback in terms of the complexity of these that is it really is it is it very family friendly

[01:37:00]
do we have any concerns about that at all I have not really gotten any feedback usually with with with with with with the people that get these copies the only time that you will get feedback is if they see something something in there that's that they may have an issue or a concern about but if you don't get feedback then that means that's that's good because I was reading through them they were like a lot of things that I think are just like assumptions you know about we all make and I was I was wondering how consensus is brought you know with the tribal leaders in the communities around you know topics such as equal basis I was like what's equal basis mean to I have some other ones that I've I've got in here or or just the the strategies that we use to

[01:38:00]
to really sort of keep track of where we are and I'm assuming there's a whole ton of work behind this besides these policies I mean the policies are just really this that template that gives us some guidance of where we're going to go so during your meetings is there is there opportunities to sort of start to think about we're setting goals and mission and vision our goals and this were going to go and we're sort of benchmarking ourselves and we're looking at those throughout time is is there a resource to do that with the committee meetings that you're doing with the committee meetings in fact for our meeting this month the vice chair of the committee wanted to look at the goals and objectives of the committee again because they felt like there was not enough dialogue that happened too much ago when this came up so they want to go back and work on it some more and just dedicate like maybe a half a day to

[01:39:00]
to really have that discussion and so but in June when we have our Retreat is when we do when we go through each of our documents including the IPP word by word line by line and so they all have an input on that and I guess it's just getting back to that same question that everyone is going you know in terms of being resource appropriately as a as a department I mean you're a person right and you've got you've got all these responsibilities to do all of this is that adequate thank you thank you for everything you do you do a fabulous job I know

[01:40:00]
at least our high schools were they are they going to be invited to this forum in a couple of weeks I think it's very important that they are they're the ones that are impacting the children at our schools this one is going to be a little bit more Centric so the principal will be there and also our Equity director Tanya Campos will be there as well but we will extend the invitation to to our principals but this is the first of two or three more that we're going to have so okay I just think it's important that the administration is there there there there every day with our our students I think it's really it's important to me anyhow and then the other question I know that we're the IPP was was revised and I think we approve that at the June 25th

[01:41:00]
align with Essa so this incident at Cibola happened after this time so do you see anything that might be lacking and the IPP that maybe we didn't think about before the incident at Cibola I think that the at any time I think that the incident at Sevilla aligns with what is happening in our nation there's a lot of hatred and bigotry just across the nation and what happened at Cibola I believe is a part of that is a symptom of what everybody's been exposed to on the TV on the news on the radio but as far as the IPP goes I believe

[01:42:00]
play that it is a working document it is always being revised strengthened as as each need arises as changes are being made so we still have a ways to go for example in curriculum there's been an accurate information oftentimes in the textbooks that we have adopted over the years misinformation about Native American people are always and he came back and I said what did you think about that book and he said well he talks about the Zuni people from the Pueblo Zoo and he said and describe the Zuni people this book describe the Zuni people as being short and happy

[01:43:00]
so I would always tease him about that so there is an accurate information like that sometimes in in some of the textbook that is that are adopted but now with the with the change with the beginnings of what happened at Cibola I believe that there is more input of work that was done by Native American people who have developed the curriculum like such as the one from the New Mexico ped Indian education department it has gone through the review and scrutiny of tribal leaders tribal people and it was written by Native American professors so so the the information is correct now so I think we're on the right track the beginning of the right track and so I'm very hopeful

[01:44:00]
what you all are doing I think again a lot of the things that I've heard are definitely addressing the concerns that we've heard in our forums and so forth even tonight we talked about the calendar we talked about having the forums here in the future and having multiple ones that's what we're doing and we are responding to that in other words that's that's what our job is and I think in fact we're making progress in there doesn't mean we're we're complete obviously you know we are going to work on that that's what I think we're doing so thank you very very much for getting the January 24th for him set up I think that's that's a good start for us to start just saying all this is a one-time thing I think it's it's an ongoing Journey that we have to keep working on this and understanding what it is and it's not just in one school you know

[01:45:00]
cuz all of them have certain kinds of concerns so I think that's what we're doing and so I appreciate that very much so thank you we have a need to approve this so I'll entertain a motion for approval favorite movie

[01:46:00]
building on their presentation I'm going to expand a little bit on what title 8 does for a district the title 8 impacted application brings the income to Albuquerque Public Schools in three areas federal government connected students Federal Credit Union students with special needs and Native American students on tribal land this application for federal standards to be renewed every year with clear deadlines and that is why we're bringing it to you right now and as of the last year we moved to an electronic data get Gathering process which has increased our word by 120,000 and I would like to express my thanks to the amazing staff that is putting together the surveys and Gathering data you might remember

[01:47:00]
this is the consideration for approval to file the 1819 application for the title 8 impact 8 and it will be the initial application based on ready to meet the January 31st deadline at the federal level it will undergo several changes if additional students will be identified under it and the final version of it will be ready as of June 2019

[01:48:00]
sing kind of complicated when I was looking at the numbers like Sandia National Labs was a group of students that are impacted by federal aid I just didn't understand that some of the designations Mister chairman of the board basically the numbers that you're looking at are any student that is federally connected we earn money based on those so if that student is federally connected because their parent works at Sandia Labs we earn money for that if they are on tribal Land We earn money for that basically it's anybody who doesn't pay federal taxes this is kind of a way for us to recoup a little bit of what they don't have to pay in that helped a little bit Yeah so there's only 3755 students so that's all there are no OK Google

[01:49:00]
toward the back the current year 595 there's a total of 595

[01:50:00]
we have a way of seeking out the people who may not realize the importance of checking that box board member Peterson we we identify the parents that would qualify and as of this year as I mentioned we moved to an electronic data Gathering and we made it part of their parent view and it is not a mandatory they need to address in no way but it resulted in a more accurate data Gathering so the parents once they log in they have the chance of addressing and self-identifying themselves as part of this process thank you Google

[01:51:00]
9 the item C is has been removed so we'll go on to the vote for the item consent item 7.8 Dot 3 and remember that we had a little discussion about the fact that we that we couldn't figure the numbers out exactly and so they have provided for us you have it in the middle and coming up with actually the final number that we were moving so hopefully that will satisfy the least so if you have anything else to add on that Jason

[01:52:00]
I just wanted to point out one thing the the amount of the insulation of the of the the annual smartnet licensing support for the remaining use of the 8360 firewall which is the one we currently have today is the amount of $242,000 we that will be prorated once we get the new equipment in place so we're asking for permission to spend that the wind anticipate spending way less than that your haircut so

[01:53:00]
what I wanted to show I had a piece of the 96 strand fiber that were bringing into the building however it is it is glass it's like fiberglass and it will absolutely it'll it'll get on your fingers and it will not feel good but this is an example of our schools these fiber walls will absolutely be transmitting the data through those little

[01:54:00]
yeah

[01:55:00]
1230 square miles I believe is our square mileage Scott might be able to crack me on that but I believe we are putting down $230 me of new fiber so when we're talking about our laterals connecting to all of our schools that's that's that's that's quite a bit of a place for small businesses and so forth actually take advantage of as well so this is part of our partnership

[01:56:00]
and this is a very important thing some things that probably people don't really understand quite that is available and and certainly we need to publicize that whatever when we upgraded in 2015 we upgraded our Network somewhat the best we could at the time with the resources that we had in order to do that they had to bring in new fiber all the way down from Las Cruces all the way up to Corridor so many times whenever we ask for services it requires them to upgrade their infrastructure which of course now makes it available for everybody else so thank you very much OK Google

[01:57:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[01:58:00]
also to I know there's not very many of you left my dad was a member of the Carpenters Union so I don't know more brilliant man with then then my father was a beautiful workmanship a lot of the stuff he did still stands today I mean that's what you do you build something that's going to stand for decades and decades you use your hands with wood and brick and mortar and you build buildings that we go to shopping that we go to buy food in that are kids go to play in and I just want to commend you for that and one of the things I know that that you all had mentioned is and I agree you don't have to have built a school to be able to know how to build a good building so I want you to know that I totally and completely agree with that

[01:59:00]
and I think that's something that I am all for for changing I I think that isn't isn't a hard change my dad did a lot of work on the base and he could build anything and I'm sure you all have the same kind of talent that my father did and thank you for sharing that with our with our children with our city with our state thank you from the bottom of my heart thank you but remember Peterson we have much to pursue thank you for lunch room who are outside of the most common religious practices

[02:00:00]
something about the calendar I think one of the things that's really important is along with having feast days listed to have whether it's Muslim Jewish Buddhist we have an incredibly diverse student population and I think it's important to have it in the calendar so that children don't have to explain why they've been absent and to make sure that it snow in these are these don't count they don't count as excused absences no absence at all and I think it's really important for school staffs and teachers to recognize the importance of that and so if they're on the calendar to make it that much easier for students to come back after school without having to explain something that they shouldn't have to explain so that's that might be a good Improvement for the calendar

[02:01:00]
I have been out in the community talking a lot about the bond issue and I have found that there's a lot of Confusion And it concerns me and so I think what you said about first off explaining the difference between how we fun schools and how many doesn't crisscross in every direction that some money can only go one way and so I think the more information we give to help people understand and then the other thing is and I was looking at some of the information we've already put out and maybe need to clarify and supplement to be really clear about question number one is no change in our program question mark

[02:02:00]
what's the number two is a $1 increase to the to the rate and when I looked some just saying it really simply first off explaining the difference between operational and in capital money but then being really clear question number two and the reason is because we have more demands and we have got to meet those demands we have an obligation to keep our students safe we have an obligation to make sure that they live in those seven hours 6 hours and three we have incredible building demands we have

[02:03:00]
drinking Brown water out of water fountains in buildings that are 70 years old and need to be renovated we can make a good case I think we just need to make sure that we're staying at every opportunity I had I had someone come up to me today Commissioners heart sevens had us casino and then as soon as they as soon as it got distilled down to what those three issues were they said but I think we need to work really hard in the next month all of us to make sure it's simple straightforward and then finally when it comes to operational money I cannot tell you how thrilled I was to be

[02:04:00]
I got to go to Santa Fe yesterday I hadn't planned to him last minute I ended up going up there and to listen to everyone from the speaker to the president pro tem to the governor lead on the importance of education and what it means and that for the first time in many years The Guiding opening statement was not New Mexico is open for business it was we are here to build our community and we need to do that starting with education and it was exciting and inspirational and I'm hopeful and finally along that note because we're here for the community I want to thank the Carpenters who came and put this together because we've been talking about this a lot we've been talking about

[02:05:00]
how do we help students move into actual work what does it mean for building this connections with the trades and more than that that it's an empty promise if we do the pre-apprenticeship work with them and then don't say their jobs where you are respected where you are paid for that skilled labor in the school and Artistry that you have so the pre-apprenticeship is part but the jobs with an investment in the community is has to be part of that and so I just want to thank you all for coming tonight and this will help with what are we going to put into practice in policy so thank you

[02:06:00]
play also and I appreciate the Carpenters it's very helpful to get this template to tell us where we have to look in terms of our policies and my hope is it will be able to follow through and there will be pushback I'm curious about the climate discussion and

folks in places like Mississippi and other places where ordinary people who initially with the Civil Rights Movement National Convention in 1966

[02:10:00]
hey Google

[02:11:00]
extend my appreciation to Mr Verlander for being here he has been coming to our meetings and paying close attention and I I appreciate the you know that that willingness to come in and and listen and sit through our meetings because they are very long but it's very helpful since all of this has been happening to I know that I've made I made a commitment to myself that I was going to immerse myself and some of our history and our by reading more history books I remember reading them when I was in college but it's kind of a time of renewal so I've had a chance to read and thanks to board member Garcia gives me a wonderful reading list of items that help me to catch up but it's been I agree there's there's a tremendous history and there's a tremendous Legacy that really should inform us a whole lot more in our state on the things that we we could be doing and we we should be celebrating and you know since I've been on the board for

[02:12:00]
you're just a little over a year one of the things that I've always said I've always felt that the Legacy oh sorry David that a legacy for us would be the fact that we do have such richness in terms of the children that we serve on the languages that we listen to all the days you know that the opportunities that we have just to celebrate such a wide diversity so I've made that commitment is kind of like my New Year's resolution on top of everything else that seems to be going crazy in my life I also want to acknowledge the the Carpenters Union thank you so much I know how much you do on the behalf of just the young people and that we are training up and bringing up through the system that we see that all the time through Workforce Solutions and we truly appreciate that step in one of the things that I would love to see as we grow and we you know we get into pre-apprenticeship so we we

[02:13:00]
what more apprenticeships I saw this great example on a news article recently where a school was celebrating Signing Day like you do for signing into a sport or to a school but it was a signing day for those students that were signing in to get into a registered apprenticeship and it was you know it was that the photos are great I'll share the story I'll send it off to you guys you can see it but it's just another way I think to promote the importance of these trades and the significance of that because it is not it's not a simple task the the amount of stem I just want to I want to reiterate that the science technology the math everything that's involved to be in a registered apprenticeship is just as high if not higher and we need to celebrate that so when we have a student that's making that commitment I would love to see a signing day at a school to celebrate that and in terms of the election wow it's really been

[02:14:00]
I think a good lesson for us because we're sort of everybody's eyes and ears on us because there's nothing else to compete with us right so it's been a real big lesson in the community around Civics I think everybody's taking that deep dive and trying to understand what's the bond what's the levy I know I have and so you know I think it was a huge risk obviously because there wasn't going to be anything else but it's also been a good rest I think there's been an opportunity in that because it really has been an opportunity to create awareness about how we raise our money and what that means for our projects and so at the same time you know well I'm trying to feel a lot of questions because it's not simple people are confused but I really have applauded and you know taking time to express my gratitude to those that are really taking that deep dive and trying to understand it including students I've had some students who are taking a deep dive trying to understand what that all means and what it means for their school and you know it's it's it's it's

[02:15:00]
you've been a good opportunity but I agree with Barbara too it's you know just trying to make break it down into that Simplicity but also just you know trying to understand the complexity of it so I'm grateful for us yay APS again for being a leader out in the front and willing to take that risk because I don't know what the outcome is going to be but I'm really proud of us for putting a civics lesson out there and for giving people an opportunity to have a voice and so however they vote I agree with you superintendent reading however they vote at least I feel like we've done a really good job of creating greater awareness around the the significance of our bonds and levies so thank you thank you

[02:16:00]
so that's a great thing that was really superb and superintendent really I want to thank you for your report it was you know it gives us it gives us information and this is the information the community has been asking for and I want to thank you and your staff for the work that you're doing for the training that you're going to offer and for the focus groups and all the work that you're doing wonderful and thank you so much for that for stopping up and really doing the work and thank you to the staff to your staff that takes a tremendous amount of energy and time and we appreciate what you're doing thank you so much for addressing the district and thank you I want to thank you for that I thank you for staying and listening to her comments I mean it's not often that we get people to say thank you

[02:17:00]
but you know I honor your work and I am happy to support you just like you're supporting us and whatever it is that we need to do I'm here in support of what we need to do for you as well thank you and that's I don't want to repeat what has been said so I will just stop here thank you thanks I wanted to thank you for hanging out with me at El Dorado this weekend we we really got to watch to Civic engagement and enjoyed hanging out with the kids and thanks for joining me this last 50 steps I appreciate that was just to the car so I truly think El Dorado Arkansas

[02:18:00]
thank you for that but yeah I definitely feel like the misinformation is out there on purpose we all know why and we are working double duty and we're committed to working double duty on that so

[02:19:00]
thank you for that and thanks for all of you are doing right now on that so I'm also encouraged by the many efforts and Partnerships I heard about tonight A lot of that came out of the superintendent's report and a lot of that came from our community members so thank you for that I love that the Carpenters are in the house tonight we appreciate your support we have it on record to that you committed to helping out on the bond election so thank you for that but when I'm most appreciative is the dialogue that we've had that you've had with myself over the last couple of years and that you've had with the board this whole time not just the dialogue with the advisement that you are always willing to give us and we really appreciate that and we too as a board or also committed to investing in our communities so we have that same critical mission that you do as well so we look forward to working with you on this Betty valuation this and seeing how we

[02:20:00]
can work together together to do a better investment in our community so thank you for that I really appreciate it and I especially appreciate superintendent reading tonight tonight so give me the updates specifically around cultural competency training the anti oppression training the indigenous curriculum and the Partnerships in our Native American Community a concern that we've had and we love hearing about the the Partnerships and what your staff has in play and and we look forward to participating in that as well so thank you for that and and thanks again for all of our community comments tonight and thanks for always being here to support us thank you you've taken most of my comments thank you

[02:21:00]
and thank you for your support I think your request is certainly reasonable and you know I've had a mantra about having a real CTE master plan and what we're trying to do there and not just for students who may think that they want to just go into the trade or whatever I'm talking about all my students who need experience a learning and so there's a there's a larger picture here in terms of the strategy what we really need to have and not to take away from somebody who wants to be a carpenter whatever that's great you know but I think you know I wish I had a little bit more capability you know you know why my Carpenter is pretty weak and for somebody

[02:22:00]
for their part of the community I'm going to go to La cave and and and and it's important for those kids you know and they're doing it voluntarily by the way I don't want anybody telling me that hey we're forcing these kids to go do something that's nonsense these people are all doing this voluntary you guys are doing this voluntary you know we didn't go and beat you guys do that you know that's not what we did you guys are doing this and it's for a good reason

[02:23:00]
communication capability a real strategy and how do we really get the message out I know we talked about that as a board a lot and I'll talk to Monica a little bit and there's a piece of that that's coming pretty quick but you know this whole idea how do we really make sure that the message is really has gotten out how do we work with the media how do we work with our our communities how do we work with our public so that they know what really the situation is and they can go to some place and don't really know that just just as a point Barbara can we have something nice and simple as here's what one two and three is it's right on our website you can go there and you can say

[02:24:00]
quick question to me there's a question three means it's $1 here and so forth and then it gets through a whole set of information about here's what's going to be done for question one and here's what's going to be done for question two it's pretty simple but you got to go to the website to get there right so how do we make sure that everybody knows that first of all and get that information I would want one other thing on that website though and that's because you know actually I get a lot of questions from analytic folks and I'm kind of analy and and I asked this question myself and that is I've got a tax bill and I went back and looked at all 16 years and my tax bills and my taxes part of it says its 10:46

[02:25:00]
and you need to hang out with her yeah so now I'm confused why is it very little bit see so that was a question for me then I looked it on my my my question just like normal normal Community member does right and I says how do I add these things out and get 10.4 73 right I can't get there from what's on those ballot questions because we're not allowed to put that information on the ballot questions

[02:26:00]
I didn't have any clue about that but there are four areas there if you take that Mill Levy for each of us for is it adds up to 1 0. 4 7 3

[02:27:00]
the yield control thank you you have control that's something that the state does kind of based on kind of what things get sold and what things get bought and what properties and so forth and it varies just a little bit so that's why when I looked at my 16 years it wasn't 10.473 every year okay that's useful information first analytic folks who want to know why that doesn't isn't the same right and we're not changing that guys we're not manipulating anything here that's not what we do okay so those are important just some people not to everybody I mean with Barbara to see those tables

[02:28:00]
add operational thing is which is something the state gives every single every single District that gives them this operational money that actually goes into the operational fund isn't that interesting that seems contradictory you know what I'm saying I always wanted to say capital is totally separate does this funny thing and put some kind of small small dogs for sale

[02:29:00]
that would be that would be useful so I'd like to see that but you know I I really I really appreciate also obviously the our wonderful art here holy Toledo you know this this is great stuff it's much better than what are bored I think that's good that I suggest one of those little things and put it on you so that you will remember during the meeting going to be focusing on you put it back yes please

[02:30:00]
it was fantastic I thought they did a great job I don't want to thank the staff so much and and our board member here she was fantastic she was absolutely fantastic she was right on point she was passionate about what it was the issue and those are the things these are the emotional things that affect people write these are the kinds of things that affect people I'm talking about the numbers all day and that's you know but but the emotional aspect of what it is we're doing is really important and I think about that so thank you very much it's great job so anyway I want to let you know my wife is doing well

[02:31:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[02:32:00]
but my oldest son had a lot to say to me cuz he thought I was was really beating up on my wife oh no no no no no no no no no no no no it's hard not to be defensive and that's almost the first thing my son said that says you know you're supposed to take care of my mom

[02:33:00]
