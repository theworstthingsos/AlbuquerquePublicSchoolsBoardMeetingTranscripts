do you feel unable to convey your message you my email board Ed at aps.edu Mr Gonzales please introduce the speakers are first speaker is Sam Colombo and it is on Zoom Samuel have two minutes once you begin speaking okay great thank you good evening to the board president and superintendent my name is 24/7 New Mexico which works to make New Mexico schools 100% nicotine and tobacco free I want to thank the board for recent updates to their District nicotine policies I was happy to see that it's great news and if in Forest well these could be a big move towards protecting student health throughout the whole District I wanted to remind the board of the type of support that we can offer if needed so 24/7 offers free elementary and middle school presentations free tobacco-free schools tool kits and tobacco free signage to any school who wants them as well as free help with policy and four

[00:07:00]
enforcement and lots more and we also just created a parent and guardian toolkit that could be super helpful for schools to provide to parents who have a kid that struggles with nicotine use or addiction I have just one note from reviewing the policies all together before this I noticed that policy add and procedures PGA 45 and PJ 48 each have slightly different information on similar topics and wanted to encourage consistency between these so it's as easy as possible for people to reference and understand one specific example in regards to discipline which is not consistent between PJ 45 and 48 488 references Progressive and supportive discipline which is in line with the pedal and then currently 45 does not supply that Progressive and supportive discipline so if supports needed with ideas for Progressive and supportive discipline we provide ideas for that and help with any step along the way so please let us know but overall this is a great Improvement and we hope to be a partner and resource with APS in

[00:08:00]
whatever ways that is needed so thank you for the updates that you have made and for your time letting me bring this to your attention and remind you of 24/7 resources thanks so much and I hope you have a good day thank you our next speaker is on Zoom Regina Dickens Regina are you there I am thank you great you have two minutes once you begin speaking just go ahead thank you thank you period we all agree parents need

[00:09:00]
parents who push for censorship often blatantly disregard the rights of parents who do not share the same values and opinions even when it doesn't impact them these parents claim that Simply Having characters and books who are lesbian gay or transgender constitutes x-rated content let's voice our support of public school librarians and libraries the Librarians are skilled experts who guide parents and children to books that reflect their interests and are developmentally appropriate take action to oppose the proposed rating system by calling your state legislators and telling them you post censorship efforts aimed at public school library's thank you thank you so much our next speaker is on Zoom Alexandria Gonzalez

[00:10:00]
are you there yes okay you have two minutes once you begin speaking good afternoon Madam chair and members of the board my name is Alexandra Gonzalez and I serve both as a full-time employee of the district as well as an athletic coach I'm also a proud parent of an IPS student I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to board member Jackson for her and wavering commitment to students and her service on this board heard you understanding of public policy and legal protection surrounding parental rights particularly with the right to access students educational records it's truly commendable and I we are fortunate to have leaders like her and to Champion for these critical issues as a parent I firmly believe that all families deserve the right to advocate for their children safety and education and after reviewing the responses from this year's election Board of Education election candidates I am heartened to hear that there is a clear connection that candidates have made between their roles as parents and their motivation

[00:11:00]
serve on the board it is evident that these personal experiences inform their advocacy advocacy and that the connection is vital as we both work to ensure that the well-being of all students as both an employee of APS and an advocate for my own child I understand the delicate balance between these dual roles and in this regard I urge the district to develop and promote transparency and Clarity between district and between the district and its employees especially those who are also serving as parents defining the roles and responsibilities and boundaries of employees who serve in both capacities is essential clear guidelines will help prevent conflicts of interest and mitigate any appearance of impropriety allowing employees to fulfill both roles with without fear of unjust consequences thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration thank you our next speaker is in the room Miss Tennessee's you'll have two minutes once you begin speaking yes good evening madam

[00:12:00]
is President and members of the board of Madame superintendent tonight I wanted to bring up an idea that's well I just wanted to bring up an idea my background is in local government I work for the City of Albuquerque for almost 30 years when I started the mayor city council form of government was in its fledgling time they were nine City councilors just like you are most of them have full-time jobs and they had no support their friends and going over material and visiting sites in their District at some point and I am double checking on this the city movie

[00:13:00]
Palisade whatever you want to call it had like two or three counselors the way it is now there's a full-time Aid to every city councilor we've got five County Commissioners same story back in the 1970s and 80s they operated they just made it work you know they have full-time jobs or whatever and then and then they read endless reams of paper they visited sites they were at meetings that would go on a long time I would like to bring up the idea that this form of service as volunteers I don't know if it's sustainable I Tried reading a lot of the materials on tonight's agenda and it's huge I would just like to plant the seed for the future

[00:14:00]
board member has a full-time staff support services and I am in board member benefits District thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is on Zoom Daniel Tafoya Daniel you there you are muted I'm

[00:15:00]
nothing is being done phone calls are not being returned and being ignored and stuff being swept into the under the rug and needs to stop we are mandated reporters and we should not have to feel scared to report that we're going to be retaliated against this has been going on for over 2 years now and nothing has been done I'm asking you guys to step it up and protect us and do something about this and I'm asking teachers he is substitute teachers if you see something don't be afraid something may happen to you you may be retaliated against but our students come first and we need to step it up and put them first and protect them which is not being done by APS thank you thank you or next speaker is in the room John Wright and they'll be followed by Joe cordio good afternoon board members and Madam chair thank you for the opportunity for letting me speak today my name is John Wright I am a retired

[00:16:00]
play APS teacher and I am now working as a contractor for the Sea of Soil and Water Conservation District and Bernalillo County in assisting the Agricultural and nutrition internship program at Rio Grande High School we've been working on that internship program for over 5 years now and we are in Jeopardy from losing funding from the Career Connect to learning Department which we have depended on as a partner for the for the duration of our own our program over those five years we have developed over 20 Community Partners that provide job sites for the students at Rio Grande High School guest speakers and we need a partnership to continue with with APS on APS meet us halfway

[00:17:00]
the community has come out to support this and a lot of different ways and we don't want to lose the support from APS career connector learning I know there's been a lot of Transitions and changes and funding with the grants and things like that but I think there's a lot of Alternatives that can be developed I think there's a lot of opportunity for students and within APS to have a real experience through these types of internship programs are internship program started out as a summer program now we've kind of graduated in a year-round we also expanded this year to Valley High School in San Diego high school so I like to ask those board members that have those schools to come visit us talk to the teachers and learn about our program thank you thank you sir our speakers

[00:18:00]
Whitaker you have two minutes once you begin speaking good evening my name is Joe cardillo and I'm a resident of APs district for I wanted to take a moment to just acknowledge how hard the last week has been for so many of our Educators our administrators and of course our young folks as we navigate more gun violence you know Across the Nation and certainly we worry about that here in New Mexico on a constant basis we're all experiencing what I would turn as collective trauma and no one is is Untouched by that whether you have to open up your social media app and see of a viral video of a murderer or you hear about it in the news or you hear about a second or third hand and I wanted to mention that I hope folks in this room all of our educators are administrators our parents and of course our students take a moment to check in with all the folks around them and I just wanted to mention a few resources certainly a lot of folks are familiar with 988

[00:19:00]
Lifeline that's a crisis line that helps people navigate moments when they're really feeling a lot of stress and a lot of trauma I also wanted to just mentioned specifically a surprisingly good addition of New Mexico Kids magazine that has a couple of Stories the current edition about cyberbullying about social media I just had to protect ourselves and each other and lastly I wanted to mention the programs of breaking the silence New Mexico I don't work for or have any association with any of these they're just really great resources that I have to appreciate breaking the silence New Mexico offers complimentary support programs workshops training for professional development for teachers and Educators as well as public forum content and workshops for parents and teachers and other kinds of organizations and breaking news code does really great work and it's all complementary so just encourage folks to slow down take a moment and make sure that you're acknowledging this Collective trauma as as we're all going

[00:20:00]
I just slowing down and taking care of each other thank you thank you sir I don't have speaker is I believe Emery Whittaker can you have two minutes once you begin to speak good evening in America have been found on Albuquerque Public School campuses as students we are forced to live with the reality that our safety is on the line every single day while APS has proposed measures like the clear bag policy these efforts only scratch the surface they don't get to the root of our problem and the truth is simple gun should not be entering our campuses in the first place Firearms are

[00:21:00]
the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States this crisis is happening right here in Albuquerque yet the perception persists that the current security practices implemented by APS are working our argument is that they are not if guns are still entering our schools in the system is failing we recognize APS as the largest school district in New Mexico that size gives this board the power and the responsibility to be leaders and addressing the gun violence epidemic in our nation but too often decision makers are too far removed from what we as students are experiencing we need transparency accountability and above all for active action instead of reaction mother reactive measures after guns are found we are asking two things first stronger advocacy for gun legislation at the state and National level aps's voice matters in silence is not neutral

[00:22:00]
it's dangerous second genuine collaboration with the community students parents and teachers have ideas that deserve to be a part of shaping real solutions it's aps's job to protect us students deserve focus on learning not survival gun violence is getting worse we act you to act visibly and urgently thank you thank you ma'am our next speaker is Dr Samuels filed by Marcy mayonnaise no problem you have 2 minutes

[00:23:00]
let's go today a young beautiful wife and two young children lost their beloved fellow American Patriot man loving husband and a father age 31 Charlotte period he was assassinated by Taylor Robinson age 2225 years prior was a trump supporter until he went to college and was indoctrinated by hateful transgender etiology false argument narratives and rhetorics that said did you notice the pattern in the Last 5 Years of seeing more chaos and violence to attack or kill it disagree with the Red Sox tonight

[00:24:00]
seven of the US Constitution in recognizing all who by coming of age or by naturalization have become citizens why because this USA has been the greatest nation in history of the world nearly 200 years past Reagan said not called if you ever forget that we are one nation under God then we will be on Nation going under I can't call so what's going to take to open our eyes to see here to open your heart just so that we including children understand the truth and come to our senses period thank you so much

[00:25:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:26:00]
repress anybody in the religion and you can't make a religion of what is going on and I have to say that this is something that has happened in APS last April or whenever you guys got sworn in I called and for Zoom as it was unable to make it and I basically was reminding you all that you were bound to this constitution of the following few days after that I received this this was from campaign of which my husband was called him a loser this is from antifa and this was also on their Twitter page with gun Chambers with the Campbell Soup

[00:27:00]
November 29th with Pastor John how much are you out here peacefully demonstrating we had antifa verbally costing us and then I also heard that one of our conservative board members chastise the Christians that were out there that is unconscionable I don't think we'll ever get to when we have that kind of viral enmity towards Republicans and Christiana are you there

[00:28:00]
I'm here can you hear me yes ma'am you have 2 minutes once you begin speaking hello and tonight I'd like to reflect on a policy committee meeting that took place last Monday excuse me there were several surprising things that happened in that meeting the first is that public comment was added to be agenda with only 72 hours notice to The Wider public this is not usual practice and I haven't run across any committee meetings in the last three years that have allowed public comment I think this is important to know because the wider public would have never expected this opportunity and not providing ample time to participate is disingenuous to the public process second I have said this before regarding tribal consultation

[00:29:00]
foremost the sport has a legal and moral responsibility to maintain a two-way government-to-government dialogue with our tribal Nations that Duty should not be offloaded onto the superintendent I ask that you respect your responsibility and act accordingly just last week board member Jackson's in which board members can participate in Indian education within the aps current offerings as directed by this Administration under Indian policies and procedures one of those ways is by participating in the Indian education Committee in the Indian parents committee according to APS policy and procedures according to APS policies and procedures the parent committee is supposed to meet monthly they do not the last meeting was held in May 3rd and there has been no communication about when the next meeting would be it did not appear on the website on social media and email until today

[00:30:00]
that will take place tomorrow for a board that likes to brag about family engagement this to me is not the way we give respect to the community this is just one very clear example of how the district does not meeting their obligations as they have been laid out in their own Indian education policies thank you thank you remember Jackson that completes public forum thank you very much and thank you to everyone who showed up for public forum tonight we appreciate you taking the time next on our agenda is student outcomes Focus governance our next item is to up is an update on language of interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 are presenters tonight are Dr Gabriella Duran Blakey superintendent Dr Randy Mahler in Deputy superintendent leadership and learning

[00:31:00]
Sherry jet Chief academic officer in Anna Chavez assistant superintendent of elementary schools thank you board member Jackson this item is to request to change the language of our interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 both of those goals originally referenced the iStation assessment tool but since that time I station and Amira have merged into one company so as a result the Ice Station assessment that we previously used for our progress monitoring of interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 is no longer available progress so progress monitoring is now under Amira as our assessment and all schools in New Mexico including our district are using Amira assessment to measure and monitor early reading skills and grades kindergarten through 3rd grade

[00:32:00]
we are requesting the interim goals 1.1 and 1.2 reflect a mirror as the new assessment tool for now the targets themselves will remain the same until we can see how this assessment is aligned thank you Dr Blakey for that update are there any questions from the board yes thank you I know it was this summer we started hearing that this was going to happen we do

[00:33:00]
this is the required assessment for the the ped and then so you know somebody in the room may know but I can find out for you but it was this Summer that we started working on it we were notified in June we have Christmas

[00:34:00]
are there what are the financial implications of the transition if any there are no financial implications good and and that includes not there will be no additional cost is there anything particularly significant or significantly different from America and iStation some differences but I will tell you we just finished the clothes on Friday and so one of the

[00:35:00]
because we need to see how this assessment compares to what was happening before and what our data as is coming in is looking like and so we do know there are some differences in terms of it is more interactive for the student it does use AI to listen to the student read and speak but as far as the implications that has and on the data that's what we're not follow up there other board members who have questions online secretary store go ahead yes this is a question that I have asked superintendent for her to just give us a better Insight since Amira does listen to students as they read one of the questions I had was does it pick up on accents

[00:36:00]
what does that kind of look like for students so if you can just give us a brief kind of description of how this is like an equitable system to be using for students yes vice president and board member astorga the assessment is Miss jet said does have ai in it so it does have the ability to listen to the students and account for any accents or any speech that the students have fake in the teachers can also listen and override any of the assessment as well do you have anything to add to that I will thank you Dr Blakey and board members Georgia I do you know that this is something that Amira has talked to us about a lot and we've asked them a lot given our student population we want to make sure that it is truly

[00:37:00]
go to reflect what are students know and are able to do and they through the AI it is able to adjust the it learns how the students speaks which is an important component of the teacher can override it in order to help the AI learn you know it's a new world thank you I just think it's important to make sure that when we are using systems like this that we're not I guess targeting students based on their accents and saying that they have lower grades even though they might be fluent in reading or speaking so just kind of being aware as our teachers are using this this program to make sure that we're not judging students based on an accent that they might have but more on their on their fluency when they're reading so thank you

[00:38:00]
[Could not understand audio]

[00:39:00]
double check in fact check I do have executive director of teaching and learning with us for elementary so we'll get some information and if we can get you that but as far as I know yes the only reason I'm asking is I was visiting an elementary school and I got to see a student interact with that particular software I did have concerns with the language because there were some words that they were not it wasn't picking up on when the student was reading and there were a couple of them that it totally missed and I was hoping that it was going to correct the student in their own language but it didn't do that so that's concerning and then when they gave him the final assessment just based on the reading that he did do I was concerned there too because it didn't give it an accurate assessment of what just occurred show

[00:40:00]
I was a little concerned about that so I'm just throwing this out there to you because the students was a little sad by what it revealed and and then after that trying to help them realize that it's only one reading and but it didn't catch numerous things that the students that have corrected and I'm concerned with language and communication and how those kids will deliver based on that software so I don't know if that's something that that you're looking at remember tomorrow thank you for that feedback it is something absolutely that we are going to keep an eye on we do want to have an assessment to accurately reflects what are students know and are able to do and I believe you know just because this is also a state initiative that will be looking throughout New Mexico for how this is accurately

[00:41:00]
my second question is just how much computer time are we looking at for students to be on this program know I'm Mr West I'm looking do you know how long the assessment is on the assessment itself and and then we also do have a component that's called The American or whatever you call your Google device or anything the more the student talks with the more information and then it's able to help tutor them in the areas where they are showing weaknesses

[00:42:00]
issues with the coding or with I'm always say this word wrong so please give me Grace phonological awareness vocabulary basically we talked about the science of reading you hear about that so it's looking for all aspects of that and that's something we didn't have with iStation so the short answer is yes it takes 20 minutes and then we do the the company has found that a student spend a minimum and not over that so really it's the ideal amount of 30 minutes a week with a tutor that it does provide it's just a support for many students across the country that pilot tell me how teachers will create the relationship with that student and how will they build up on that especially with their language and incorporating some of the skills

[00:43:00]
we would also like to highlight that Amira is one component of many within the classroom we still have and are dependent on our layer one teach with our Educators so this component is an assessment piece it's also a piece that can help provide students with extra time for oral language skills while waiting in like a small group rotation to work directly with the teacher so this is a piece that the teacher can consult but also has the ability has the preference in the time to be able to work directly with students as the number one strategy in teaching and learning all right I think we'll move back to board member Dominguez did you have more questions

[00:44:00]
vice president Jackson so for the pilot testing is there any preliminary information you can share with us about the results of that challenges and successes specifically board member benavidez board members and Dr Blakey right now we had 26 schools that were part of the pilot program that is definitely something that we can gather it is something that we did to make sure that we could Implement a fully across the district after the pilot program was finished so that is something that we can never thank you any more questions Okay so

[00:45:00]
what I heard was that Amira has 20 minutes worth of assessment time and then 30 minutes per week or 10 minutes every day of the American Tudor is that correct or are there additional minutes we present the video why the beginning of your underwear that's 20 minutes three times for the Student Center I mean difficulty or not performing on the platform measures monitor so that way they're doing that 20 minutes once a month for those students to see if there's been any changes

[00:46:00]
what is attention so that that's 20 minutes straight and then the 30-minutes a week which could be 10 minutes on Monday it could be 10 minutes on Wednesday 10 minutes on Friday you can be broken up that's just once a week so you would be looking at 30 minutes a week on that platform with one week being the 50 minutes period so the 20 minutes for the assessment and then the 30 minutes for the tutor so the tutor is based on the monthly assessment is that correct or is it outside

[00:47:00]
so it's not just showing everybody the same thing it's showing students that are ready for new content and showing them new content but then it's also able to provide areas where the student might need extra support is an extra support it's really it's meant to be a tool to assist the teacher with what they're doing it's not meant to replace for it in the way of what they're doing but I'm hearing that it's daily somehow someway is struggling and it's like some schools will do it in small group like every other day with students it's personalized who's the particular students at the most that would be used as probably 10 minutes three times a week I guess this is where I'm headed I think

[00:48:00]
to me it sounds like a lot of computer listening and computer interaction somehow some way and I just want to go back to their maybe Across the Nation in the aggregate they have gotten great improvements however what we do know for our particular group is that a gap has been created has developed between the aggregate Martinez Yazzie and are students with disabilities e l l Native Americans and black African-Americans and and so when I hear that we're using this program particularly or that we find it particularly useful in priority schools I'm eager to find out what those Pilots

[00:49:00]
are telling you what what those results are saying because I have concerns about our most vulnerable within the vulnerable groups so that's one thing the other big concern is data privacy like who owns who owns the voice all the information that AI is gathering who owns that particularly given our current circumstances and the fear in our immigrant communities

[00:50:00]
who owns what and I'm more than happy to be more than happy to provide that contract would you like to see it but it does lay out our standard language that we have in those is that we on the date of the more specifically the parenting data and they're using it on our behalf they're hosting it in their service on our behalf so that's something that because we've engaged them they're doing it on our behalf it's not like we're going to pay for it is they're not just offering a free service because they're using it for other purposes within our agreement and we do have that phone number I just have a quick question just to kind of clarify is this Dr Blakey is this assessment required by the state or was this the choice of APs know this is required this assessment is required

[00:51:00]
play by the state and so since we have to do progress monitoring as well we don't want to over test the students so we would rather use the test that we have to do anyway as what we're using to collect the information for Progress monitoring so that's since we have to we have to do this by the public education department and so that's why we're changing the interim to use a mirror because the students are already taking it point of clarification though on that on that note how many times does ped require us to assess kids I thought it was just four times a year but we are so we're required let me go up to the grades so in kindergarten first second grade we are required to assess the early

[00:52:00]
that were required to do three times a year so you're always going to have that beginning middle end of your window and then you're also going to hear with with that initiative there's always progress monitoring that occurs and that occurred with isolation as well but the idea that the students are off track you need to assess the monthly to see if they're moving in those areas that's always that's existed for 10:00 so that's that's our early reading world for Grace 3 to 8 there is a public education department it came out right after we came back from the covid shut down where we are also required to test three times a year increase in English language arts and math that is also in addition to the summit of assessment which will talk about in the future

[00:53:00]
period the New Mexico measures of Student Success and achievement and you look at me stumbled over that is the nmn SSA we required to do that once a year in grade 3 to 8 cuz that's the sum of assessment that's used for our federal funds that we received in addition to that we also have to test once in high school and not the federal government and that's where we in our state they chose the SAT so when you hear about sat additionally they've added the PSAT so that cell phone number in Albuquerque Public Schools we had been doing the PSAT because we think it's a great opportunity to speak expose the like after high school so whether they want to go to college or not we were making sure they had the opportunity to try it out early to be in the same conversation we're seeing the same mailers to the same things as Austin but we're just paying originally for those we all have our Assessment Center required for English language Learners so they're required they

[00:54:00]
2.0 so there's that and then the last test there's also the science test that's the federal required tests which is called the New Mexico assessments for sign of science Readiness and that's done once a year for grade 5 8 and 11 so that's the science part and then the last thing is there something called the dynamic learning Maps so you'll hear we talk about something like an alternative assessment so for less than 1% of our population these are students that have diagnosis of severe cognitive disabilities their respect with that one in lieu of being assessed in the internet so those students you can't we just cannot just a very very very very very very very

[00:55:00]
individualized assessment that is factored in a one-on-one setting and it's very tailored to exactly what the students on IEP and what they're learning plan looks like and then lastly is that it's all the stamp assessment and I do not know how that acronym but that is how far our bilingual educational programs schools they are BMP schools their model the ones any of our schools there in a dual language model where their their their mission is to teach both English language arts and Spanish language

[00:56:00]
but that's a lot and I'm more than happy to send you to www.aps.edu slash assessment and it's all there okay and I'm impressed that I could do that but anyways does that answer your question I have follow up okay so real quick because I think I still had the floor with your clarification so I just want to make sure that I almost called you Dr West and Mr West of knowledge is phenomenal and I always love when you come to the microphone I just want to remind the board that are discussion is on Amira in particular right now so we need to kind of keep ourselves focused on what Amira is any questions that we have about that also with a reminder that this is just a discussion we're not here to change the assessment we're not here to dictate to our administrators how do the assessment is is done is just merely asked questions on Amira as it is being

[00:57:00]
thank you I heard that if 3rd through 8th graders and possibly for also came through 2nd if these children show that they are not making gains then they have to be further they face taste testing months with paper

[00:58:00]
showed

[00:59:00]
that students with disabilities e l l Native Americans black and African-American children developed a gap and I'm really concerned about that I'm we don't talk about that enough and I think it's somewhere in in all this piloting and whatnot so that's it for clarification we haven't done the assessment we haven't reviewed the assessment results on the mirror I think this assessment results you're speaking of is from my ready from right this way the last report that we had access to

[01:00:00]
phone number Jackson we just we just lost listen to YouTube still on just give us one moment please

[01:01:00]
I have speech impediment so I was a mirror going to work with that was that the kiddo that the final it took like 10 remember Jackson we are back on streaming okay thank you so much all right let me actually get where I need to be okay so when we last spoke we were at Agenda item number 6 on the consent agenda so I would I need a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda I move that we approve the consent agenda items this is second this is board member Dominguez thank you I have

[01:02:00]
board member Dominguez may have a roll call vote please thank you very much and passes will now move to agenda item number 7 this is our action item next on the agenda is considered approval of the revised Board of Education narrative for the 2025 2026 School Improvement and transformation Grant application including the review of 54 School Improvement plans are presenters tonight are Dr Randy Miller period

[01:03:00]
for the 2526 School Improvement and transformation funds this item was pulled from the consent agenda at the request of a board member and I thought it would be helpful to provide some background on why it is in front of you again as you already approved this item APS leaders including the deputy superintendent of leadership and learning the chief academic officer the executive director of federal and state programs and the senior of charter schools authored the initial draft of the board narrative that version was approved from the board on July 16th as part of a consent agenda and was submitted to the public education department on August 1st along with the other required documents on August 4th the public education department provided feedback and they asked that the narrative include more detail on how updates to the board with specifically address schools in CSI or MRI intervention status they also asked that the school Improvement plans appear as a formal agenda

[01:04:00]
time for the Board review and approval I met with the public education secretary to ask for clarification and she did approve this item going on the internet as long as each school was listed independently with the supporting documentation the team has worked together to revise the narratives that's the revised version that is now before you for consideration of the 54 School Improvement plans included in this review 18 are for APS schools that have exited MRI or CSI status after the 2324 school year the schools improved enough that they no longer require intensive oversight but they do have carryover funds 20 schools remain in MRI or CSI status in the 2425 school year and the remaining are APS authorized charter schools and so with that we ask for your approval thank you for Blakey and before it opened it up I just would like to again remind

[01:05:00]
this agenda item is about approving changes updates to the Grand application it is not to approve individual school plans which still remain within the purview of the superintendent and in some cases the charter school governing councils so I would ask that we please again keep our questions to agenda items and within our role of oversight I do want to thank you for placing the answers to these questions are already on the diets for us so thank you for doing that and so with that I believe board member Dominguez you are the board member who pulled this from consent so I will turn to you first for any questions as they relate to the agenda item so I had several questions and then I'll list some

[01:06:00]
and I did submit these questions these five questions earlier but I'm I'm intrigued by I forgot to include one what is meant by carry over funds and what does that have to do with the designation of CSI or MRI or any other thing that yes this time last year the school year 2425 is 18 school that had that are now in carryover he wore an MRI so they were allocated funds from the now they have exited the money is still there so they can continue to sustain those efforts as long as the exhaust their funds so last to school year

[01:07:00]
so these are schools that still have access to funds correct okay so and when was the board first provided with the five questions that form part of the Grant application this was on a consent item at the July July 16th okay and and I heard that Administration authored the initial draft of that board of education narrative so I'm going to go to I believe it's question number two the question is how does the board receive updates on each on each school's Improvement plan and budget for CSI MRI designated schools and I'm assuming that MRI schools are essentially are prior

[01:08:00]
and that would include schools that exited last school year and now have carry over so but we are supposed to be receiving updates individually for each of those schools is my understanding of that question and question 5 asks for agenda items at when the plans were presented discussed and approved and all of this gets so red flags went off because I just got back from a very good counsel of urban Board of Education conference Square we were blessed with lots of great present

[01:09:00]
Tennessee Nashville but another one from Tulsa and it just impressed upon us that we are legally on the hook for our work so specific concerns related to those two questions which I just read aloud the July 16th 2025 consent agenda item did not provide the board with sufficient information about the CSI status of the 33 schools 20 traditional and 13 Charter this prevented a transparent and conversation required by the ped and I'm going to say 2225 - 425

[01:10:00]
play Ed's request for evidence of school specific updates on plans and budgets a statement about General outcomes and proposed future meetings is not sufficient by my standards for question 5 the required agendas documenting when plans were presented discussed and approved have not been provided and so again I was fortunate to attend to incredible presentations where the CFO and a board member both impressed upon us how serious and how quickly things can go badly and so I'm taking that to heart and luckily I was able to come back and delve into this

[01:11:00]
so I'm going to leave it at that I have I have some next steps that I feel necessary for my approval I think it's important to share Peds feedback in writing with the board immediately cuz I imagine what is the deadline for this but go online for these applications was August 1st and but when is PED expecting a revision as soon as we have them and they are aware I was at a visit today with the word this is on the agenda this evening so I'd like to see Peds feedback in writing immediately because of the immediate nature I'd like to amend the narrative immediately so that responses to questions to 5 accurately reflect existing practices and

[01:12:00]
statutory requirements I'd like to schedule a I want on the books a scheduled board Workshop this fall for CSI and MRI School plan review Insurance School level data and targeted strategies are presented and I think all of this is fits perfectly with next steps of where we are in our progress monitoring the very kids that I mentioned earlier are the ones we need to see we need to diminish that Gap in achievement on that may happen with America's president Jackson

[01:13:00]
a little bit clarification of what you're asking but I can kind of walk through this just with what what is being asked for the public education department I think it's important to note that and when I met with the public education department I think they have a very good understanding that we operate as a very large District compared to other districts and boards and so it is important that we stay at the high level and that we're not individually looking at each core team and if we agree or disagree with their practices of what they're using as their school core team and their instructional councils but our progress monitoring really is to look at how are we working as a district in moving forward on these goals and not as you see the 1,000 pages of individual school plans that I think gets into the weeds of the practice of the school practitioners to develop their plans for their 90 Day plans in their

[01:14:00]
so I think that we could add to number two that we do use our progress monitoring as regular updates in talking to other districts and my colleagues around the state we go over data in school board meetings to a much larger extent than other school boards and maybe we're not articulating that in our answer of how this is all connected and for number five it is that we were presenting them by giving you the information using our regular practice of giving the board all of the information ahead of time to be able to ask questions and to review those plans so I do want to move forward on it as fast as we can because the schools don't have the funds until we do and I and so that's why when we met with public education department they said we could get it on this next agenda item now instead of going to a finance committee meeting which is where it would normally be

[01:15:00]
as you know when school's utilize the funds you'll see that through the finance committee but this is the narrative for the overall report and I don't I guess the board would have to decide this evening if you're asking to change the wording we're happy to do that and approve the new wording so that we can submit this forward but whatever the pleasure of the board is to revise it right now board member Dominguez while you think on that board member of store I hear that you have your hand up I'm sorry I can't see you on the screen but I've been told you of your hand up yes thank you sorry my phone is acting weird so I went off camera but I did have a clarifying question so thank you for bringing up these concerns and I also brought another concern of mine up because the word

[01:16:00]
says that we are evaluating these schools through progress monitoring my concern is that we don't progress monitor our charter schools and our charter schools are listed on this SCSI and MRI schools so can you just give me a rundown of how we're including those in this description that you have yes board member store because this is a Federal Grant and these funds blow under title one because we're the authorizer all federal funds flow through APS to Charter Schools therefore were under one application financially speaking with these funds so with Charter Schools and we can speak to this maybe later but the Charter office does have their own way of evaluating and checking in and monitoring in addition all schools Charters non Charters do have three visits per year with the public education department as part of their oversight and

[01:17:00]
actresses that we as leadership including the charter team do attend those meetings make sure that excuse me that all of the actions in the 90-day plan are being followed up on and that they are aligned to the budget thank you just a follow-up on that because we don't see the progress monitoring for the charter schools I am so uncomfortable with this description on what it's saying because I do like how Lord remember me is brought to our attention that it does say we need to discuss these plans so I would also just want to Second her request for adding more language to the descriptions about how we plan to receive that information not only for a PS schools but also the charter schools and I understand that you will have a process on what that looks like so being able to be involved in that process has board members would would be really great so I just wanted to sack in the I guess

[01:18:00]
suggestions that board member Dominguez has thank you all thank you for remembering or board member benavidez do you have any questions feedback paper number to Marita I also along with board member Astoria and Dominguez really concerned about to say are we truly doing it is another question so I understand you wanting to pull this document forward but I would really hope that in addressing these needs that we really have to decide one is the board on board or are we just fulfilling the need so you can check the box cuz the other question here is I had a great opportunity

[01:19:00]
meet with Charter Schools this week and fully got to understand MRI and the CSI and I wish that particular conversation was open to all board members so they had the knowledge of what I got from that to our conversation and so in understanding that that's where I once I pulled up this particular piece I was concerned because the knowledge of not understanding charter schools and one just like to board member August said we don't have that information and so when are in my discussions with Joseph and how he brought that out one was yeah he was going to bring in he was going to answer things but when we were finally looking at dashboard and looking at the you know the great the graduation rate for CSS CSI schools with 66.7 which we were completely unaware of

[01:20:00]
until after the meeting and so there was simply just simple regulations and information that was exchanged that had me concerned once I saw this document because we were not given adequate information to understand especially charter schools and how that works but we're going to sit here and say that we got adequate information we're ready to support this and we're ready to do what you want us to do as a board so I know that board member Dominguez did State some things she wants done and I truly think that we need to get better at this because I would hate to tell PD that we agreed to everything and everything was right and just when it wasn't so that's my concerns thank you okay thank you for remember I just a couple points that I think need to be made is that this is

[01:21:00]
is an approval of a funding source and so this is approval for a grant application and if I understand you correctly Dr the funding to flow to the schools is dependent right now upon approval of this narrative and we are already a month and a half behind the due date is that correct okay so I think I feel like there might be a little bit of the urgency to approval of this narrative so what I would like to suggest and less drama when you're leaning forward like you have something to say okay so you can hear what I'm saying okay what I was suggesting is if there are edits that you would you remember or anybody would like to offer up let's work on that right now so that we can get this narrative to a place where we can approve it where we are still within our

[01:22:00]
Riverside role of being the board versus dictating administrative work and also remembering that we need to have trust in the local level and the schools to understand what their budget needs are that is not something that us as board members necessarily have to dictate so if we may I'm just going to take it by number and let's get this approved so that those schools can get this Monday so from what I hear unless there's any concern about moving forward with that I just want a point of clarification I am not interested in getting in the weeds I am interested in a progress monitoring effort that focuses on these MRI and CSI schools so let's be clear about

[01:23:00]
stop that I'm not trying to hijack administrative behaviors our role is high-level progress monitoring reports from the schools specifically if we're going to apply I mean I understand that you're writing this narrative but we need more time we also need to be given the consideration we have a job to do we're legally on the hook and it was never made so clear that at this last conference we got legal advice so I'm not in the future we need to there was future language here which I took issue with I don't know how we

[01:24:00]
in a bad situation we should have had a we should have had a progress monitoring session for all of the schools and how we how the district is going to be able to organize that I'll leave that those are the weeds okay thank you very much so let's go to number one from what I understand from the conversation that we've had tonight there is no concern with number one am I correct in that Draya board members are we fine with number one yes okay so let's move to number two how does the board receive updates on each school's

[01:25:00]
plan and budget for CSI MRI designated schools the Edition was in Edition a board meeting will be held once a semester part of the agenda for these meetings is to review MRI CSI plans with the board applications will be included as evidence and staff will be available available on to answer questions from the Boe members at the board meetings are there any edits discussion about number two yes I'd say how old is however we currently do not have progress monitoring that focuses entirely on MRI CSI designated schools and just put it out there positive vice president Jackson this isn't this is talking about what we plan to do to be able to do it so

[01:26:00]
play I think the suggestion from staff is saying that once a semester we will present these it's not asking what we have done previously so we're when we met with the public education department they've asked us to put in the language of what we plan to do to be able to present those so the intent of this language is to come up with a plan where if the board approves this language it means that staff wants a semester is one of our board meetings will be looking at reviewing these plans so so superintendent Blakey then I feel like that aligns with what you are asking for that you would like at least once a semester to have details discussions about MRI CSI schools in particular and my next question is is once a semester for 50 I mean do we have to do 54 schools I would suggest we would

[01:27:00]
do this for just our schools not as we would have a separate conversation about how we would do it for the charter schools so we so I think there's 3030 school so if I may I apologize for everything this does not include carryover school so this would just be currently the number down significantly well but we are on the hook for Charters so that may be a separate conversation I think is what Dr Blakey was alluding to when you asked about 54 schools on the semester yes I'm suggesting that there would be a separate meeting where we would look at the charter schools because I think the oversight with doctor would be different than us doing it in the same meaning I think the total number of MRI CSI or CSI Miami schools is 30 with 13 being charter schools and

[01:28:00]
help me with this 2020 being know not to anyway those are but we're not going to separate the MRI CSI know we would do all of the aps MRI CSI schools and then the charter authorized schools in a separate meeting okay that being said these are carryover of previous designations so in the next couple of months we're going to get new designations for schools so the schools you see on here is current MRI CSI this is it could change because those schools have fallen off and they're going to rewrite essentially the schools with the new data that comes in from the last assessment so the current CSI MRI schools this is all last year's schools okay so as long as we are very specific here that we

[01:29:00]
in the future of a board meeting will be devoted will be held once a semester for both or for each I think it's we need to be clear that there will be a board meeting for traditional schools MRI CSI schools and a separate meeting for Charters is that correct so really we're talking about two meetings in a semester I think for the purpose of this for the high level for ped if we say that it's once the semester if we divide it into two meetings I don't think it's just that each school would be reviewed once a semester I don't think we have to get as specific as the what well okay but then or Hell to account for what is in the narrative

[01:30:00]
in this number two yeah yes but in all this in this entire narrative yeah we're held to account for what we say here I am about I just want to clarify that the held to account is for the funding that goes to the individual schools it's the federal funding it's flowing through to the schools that's the the accountability behind this is the funding right but very clearly it says how does the board receive updates and ultimately we approve right so it's our approval on people come to us and assume that we know what's what's happening at you guys approved so you're responsible as it should be

[01:31:00]
I want to make that very clear here it doesn't have to go in the document but it is we cannot do this on a consent agenda again unless we have been through the full process applications will be included as evidence I think that's my biggest concern here a consent agenda item does not provide the board with sufficient information and I think that's where I felt like I was

[01:32:00]
so I don't want to be in that situation again and I don't want to put future boards in that situation again so long as we can have that agreement and we make these so can you read what we just yes yes I think if we just read what's already there in terms of what the PD is asking for because what's in here is in the future we meeting will be held for non charter schools and a separate meeting for charter schools which really for the PED purposes we don't need however we currently do not have progress monitoring that focuses entirely on raccoon

[01:33:00]
previously approved that we sent to the public education department is the part in Black so it's saying that we already do regularly review student outcome data then this is saying we will part of the agenda of these means review MRI CSI plans with the board so it is in addition to the part that has already been approved in looking at the data and if I may I think that what you're saying is being encompassed already within the red and then I think what you're also asking for that doesn't necessarily need to be in the narrative but the administration is taking notes on

[01:34:00]
sherbet is that we will have a board meeting held once a semester one for MRI CSI 14 chartres and you have notes on that and we will be looking for that and then what was what was the second thank you and thank you so much and that part of the agenda for these meetings that will be on the agenda it will not be placed on consent so if I am getting heads coming back that yes you're hearing what what the request is for us to have knowledge but that that doesn't necessarily need to adopt any language that's already within the red okay I'm getting lots of there okay my board members do we feel okay with that with the knowledge that the administration is acknowledging what the concerns are hearing will have separate meetings for Charter and for

[01:35:00]
okay I just want to make sure I have yeah I had not yes yes yes okay a board member store I'm sorry I can't see you so I don't know if you're heading or not yes I agree I also would like to see that language in the narrative just because we have asked on the diet for training before and it hasn't been completed so I do want to have that in there somewhere okay board members so I think a training on on Charter Schools is different than this review of of Grant applications which is a funding source and so I think I believe that we still need to add that language of the two separate monitoring sessions for the charter schools I would feel more comfortable with that language in there yes that's correct okay so if you have language that can you give me specific language that you would like right now it says in addition a board meeting will be

[01:36:00]
play held once a semester if there's do you have specific language you would like to add well I think just from the discussion that we've had that one board meeting a semester is not the same as having one board meeting with the aps CSI MRI schools and an additional meeting that covers Charter MRI schools okay so if I'm hearing correctly and if I can encapsulate the wording potentially would be in addition a board meeting will be held once this semester colon 14 Mi slash CSI and one for Charter Schools period okay thank you okay board members are we comfortable with that Administration are you comfortable with that as well yes okay and also just to be clear that we

[01:37:00]
we'll have full review and discussion from what I understand the vice president Jackson just for clarification for this it would be a presentation to the board it wouldn't be approval of these plans it would be a discussion and presentation of the plans right right and very much in line with progress monitoring correct I mean to to to to to align it with with what we are doing I mean because you're already you already have that information as a progress yes and no and the reason I say that is if you reviewed these plans the 90-day plans because it's a state mandate don't necessarily line up to the goals of the board so our four goals aren't some of them you'll

[01:38:00]
see them online and some of them you won't because there's different things that are required in the 90-day plan that aren't required so it's a little bit more dependent on what the school is struggling with what their root causes and it's connected to the state requirement for the 90-day plans and the goals aren't necessarily aligned do the 90-day plans address at risk kids in any way yes it seems okay so that's that's ultimately what I'm after here

[01:39:00]
okay okay so I don't believe there was any concern about number three or number four if there is no no remember I still go I don't see okay so we're going to move to number five and the the part in red that was added is the narrative and the plans were placed on a consent agenda with all supporting materials included at the September 17th 2025 Board of Education meeting attached to the agenda and the minutes from the meeting probably right off the bat I would just pull the part about it being on a consent agenda because it got pulled from Kentucky that we're having this discussion but I believe board member didn't go so you potentially have wording that you were concerned about or would like to add or your or not

[01:40:00]
well I think to begin with it it's going to start with because of this structure I guess the previous structure in in Black The Narrative and the plans were discussed during the board meeting of but I want to hear from other board members I mean how much do we what points do we want to put in here well and remember number five is just please provide the agenda for the board meeting when the plans were presented discussed and approved and that's just actually what is happening right now so it might just be a narrative of what we're doing right now but but let me ask her the board members

[01:41:00]
play Tara will remember Benavides do you have anything to add to number five numbers I'm okay as well thank you okay all right we need to like list the discussion or is the previous narrative Supply the again my understanding is that it's just about the agenda this agenda for September 17th is what they're requesting in the narrative and so we're just basically saying back to them we talked about this here's the agenda where we talked about it yo correct vice president Jackson members of the board the clarification from the public education department

[01:42:00]
if all the documentation all the plans that's why you have like a thousand pages of plans all the plans were uploaded and that we followed our regular procedures that board members have questions they could ask ahead of time we explained how that works and they said that that would be fine to meet the needs of number five the previous agenda item that you had didn't have the plans behind it okay so I believe that we have reached consensus on the diets and remotely from board members for am I correct amount assessment yes okay so then I would like to close discussion and like would like to move forward with a motion to approve the revised Board of Education narrative so I need a motion and a second please

[01:43:00]
I move that we approve the revised narrative this is board member Benavides I will second thank you I have a motion may we have a roll call vote please all right thank you good work Team all right thank you I appreciate it with that we will move to the next item on the agenda which is a number eight the president's report which I will mention to the vice president's report I will start with public forum although public forum is not an opportunity for dialogue I want each speaker to know that you were heard and that we are working with the administration

[01:44:00]
turn on resolutions some of the issues we heard tonight regarded nicotine policies of the freedom to read and an opposition to censorship parental participation in education 90-day plans retaliation concerns APS internships some an update on some excellent mental and emotional health resources great presentation from from students on students demand action on gun prevention from San Diego High School update on children's health and well-being and a mentioned about indoctrination within APS on the other just a couple things I'd like to update is do you want to send out congratulations to our board president Daniel Gonzalez who is not here with us tonight because she is in Washington DC accepting a

[01:45:00]
the award from the Congressional Hispanic caucus Institute that honors elected Hispanic leaders and she is she has won the alumni award so we are we are proud of her representing APS for us in in Washington DC I also wanted to highlight again happy Constitution Day to everyone and I hope that we can take this opportunity to reflect on that truly magnificent document that protects the rights of the American people and lays the foundation for a government of the People by the people and for the people I also want to thank the mckinney-vento program administrators and coordinators for giving board member Dominguez and I the opportunity to interact with some truly amazing kiddos last night it was really fun it was really fun we got to help them with some new shoes we got to help

[01:46:00]
with snacks and we got to help him with some play and it was really rewarding to to be with those students last night so so thank you to them for allowing us to come and and I hope that we can have that opportunity again because it was really neat to be there and then I just wanted to end with this because I feel like it has been a hefty week and we've had some pretty significant events that have occurred nationally and and I hope that we can just I think it does warrant some reflection not just from us as elected leaders but from the community that we really we really need to take the time to choose Unity over outrage respect over violence and courage over fear so thank you to all of you for being with us tonight we appreciate it I think we did some good work and with that I will move to item number 9 which is our next Board of Education meeting will be held on Wednesday October 1st 2025
