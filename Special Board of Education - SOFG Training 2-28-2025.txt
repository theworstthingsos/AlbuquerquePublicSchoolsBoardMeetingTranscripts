February 28th 2025 special Board of Education meeting

[00:01:00]
except the 2025 agenda for this special vote please for bored Community engagement events are presenter is Cindy ellisburg City Schools manager of governance services and governments thank you for having me here today I'm looking forward to this conversation before we get started I know we only have two hours so what I like to do with short amount of time is to start off with

[00:02:00]
some meeting standards just to make sure that we have have our time use effective and meaningful and that we really get through what we need to get through so you all can proceed with the work you need to do so just ask that we have time efficiency and focus that we stay on topic the topic that the agenda mentions I know I often can chase down some rabbit holes so will ask that you all don't take me down there so just stay on topic would be great we can park off topic items for future follow up being future focused and results driven is always a great thing we can use the past to inform how we move forward however don't want to spend time relocating

[00:03:00]
our dwelling there because continuous Improvement while we use the past and replaying the video to find moments to improve we do want to move forward and and do the best for the students and finally and I know it goes on said but we have it up here being respectful and collaborative in our communication with to agree with the person not disagree with the ideas not the individuals and then to contribute positively be mindful of the energy you're bringing and Josefina glad you're joining us online I know there's some positive Friday energy in the room hopefully you're feeling some of that where you're sitting as well

[00:04:00]
anyone could have questions or concerns about the standards before we proceed now let's start with the foundational question to around us why do school systems existence they don't exist to make sure that the construction to make sure that we have a balanced budget to do all of those numerous things that school districts that often need to happen and are still important but that is not the end it's not those are means to get to that end and that end is to improve student outcomes what students know and are able to do

[00:05:00]
so then we talked about my school boards except there are many means to the end there are many ideas out there about what student outcomes what it is that students know and should be able to do what the system should focus on so we were refer to the the things that was vision and then there's also a lot of ideas about how the community would like us to get there and those are the things that we refer to as the communities values but we know a school system can't be affected if they're trying to be all things to all people if they're trying to do all the things accomplished all the goals A system that tries to do everything

[00:06:00]
so there needs to be focused on prioritization and that's why the school board and why you all are sitting in the seats that you are and that focus on prioritization is really important and it's part of what this community engagement training and best practice gets added the representation of the vision and values of the community of the broader Community because that is a it's not an easy thing to do and it takes some practice in that prioritization and school boards we say exists to represent the vision and the values of the community and again will systems exist to improve student account and these are our foundational principles and your

[00:07:00]
as we go through this community listening will be to prioritize that that vision and values and Josefina please don't hesitate to chime in whenever there's something that you can't hear or need to be repeated thank you so far so good thank you so just for some common language of around Community engagement we talked about Community engagement as the two-way communication between the board and the public that occurs at a meeting posted by the board whereas community outreach is that two-way communication that happens at a meeting hosted by community members and then a couple of key definitions up there are owners and then customers so owners as the organization's more only

[00:08:00]
residents taxpayers and those are the folks that the board is better positioned to serve and your role is board members you are doing owner service and then there's customers the recipients of the organization's benefits and student staff families and that is where staff is better position to often to address the issue that come forth in that respect so I want to drive a little deeper into the distinction between owner service and customer service imagine that you go to McDonald's to buy a hamburger are you acting as a customer or an owner question mark

[00:09:00]
I'm home and decide to buy stock in the company are you a customer or an owner yeah you're showing up as an owner difference being that with customers customer behavior is transactional the transactional relationship there McDonald's your buying your burger it's focused on the media value so it's going to say my hunger and it's a shorter time arises and it's in the it's very immediate and then the owner behavior is that long-term relationship it's focused on the organization sustainability and success and then there's a longer time in a school system or anywhere really but especially in a school system can the same person show up as both

[00:10:00]
what's an owner and a customer definitely it happens often in education and it's the board's job to make that distinction and discern Discerning at the time that they are making that you're making that connection with that question so far okay Mario one parent says my child got a bad grade think they're treating them or treated unfairly I voted for you so what are you going to do about it what what type of behavior is that person is playing owner or customer service

[00:11:00]
right there they're focused on at immediate transactional value like I need something done for my student so what is what's the response when they're showing up in that way I will refer them to the administration refer them to the administration why because they handle of what happened at the school in the classroom with the teacher at the assignment we have no idea of what happened at that level of expertise and also positioning positioning to actually address the issue and then what if they go to that teacher or to that that administrator and don't get the resolution that they expected that's where it can

[00:12:00]
I think they need to continue working within the administrative Chain of Command right like if you went to the teacher you don't get the answer then you need to go to the principal and then like you don't come to the board member yeah so it's working through that through the system and it's also remembered and in a way that doesn't necessarily yield what the person wanted and that's just some degree has to be has to be okay again the system cannot be everything to everybody now that that I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of

[00:13:00]
at the highest level the point of service is where you want to point the customer service issues and generally Administration and then owner issues are for the board so scenario to do another one Community member says I'm sure you hear this all the time to be able to compete in a global economy should be Adept in multiple languages I think these are important skills owner Behavior or customer service one owner why why I guess why are you saying why are you saying question mark cuz they're representing their own

[00:14:00]
perspective not yet The Vision Values in the whole Community when it becomes broader than it becomes got it got it so right now they're they're identifying their own interests but it would need to be in a broader engagement setting for it to be a they're just saying they like tomatoes got it got it so they they are saying they like tomatoes how about you well I think once you you're trying to give a perspective of what you feel is best for your child your student it's still within the customer framework it's not a choice that that's being made for the district as a whole you're just speaking

[00:15:00]
one one point of view it's not a choice for the district what if the person doesn't have a child I still say it's customer cuz you're speaking for the students who are customers at the school okay well can I take it back no I said owner because I went straight can I take this I went straight to the value proposition that you were engaging in and so I went straight to well this person is representing like a value they're trying to bring us a value statement and in that sense we do represent

[00:16:00]
the values and so in like the the the the the the larger cents if this if he if this person was presenting on behalf of my congregation this is our value this is what we want to see then to me it starts to become part of more the owner aspect so I think it's like the question of how is how is this information presented to me as a board member is it presented as a singular conversation which could be customer is it presented as part of a larger Outreach engagement session could be of value statement yeah so so you're wondering the way in which it was presented to you whether it was a one-on-one conversation or if it was a part of a larger listening campaign on if that changes whether or not

[00:17:00]
what's the value statement or a vision statement so this person is saying students need to be able to compete in a global economy and be adopted is that a short-term or long-term outcome Vision about to do now if they said I want my I think there needs to be Chinese language course in every High School

[00:18:00]
yeah yeah so I'm thinking of it more in so what I would say in scenario to is that it's more owner Behavior because they are thinking long range long range overall and while while as the board is that where the board member or board here's that if you were to hear that in your listening session it doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to be able to to offer students multiple languages so that they're proficient in multiple languages however that is more of an owner owner statement that you prioritize and any questions on that or does that

[00:19:00]
clicking So based on their their suggestion that would require us to go change policy because then that's when it becomes owner if it's for not doing that then I would question if it would stay within the customer realm and it's directed directly to the superintendent and her team so that I think the distinction there is that the board the board is doing this listening the board is engaging the community and and the Community member if they're showing up and telling the board wherever they're showing up telling the board that they think that this would be a valuable what students knowing be able to do being ready for a global economy by being adopted multiple languages the board

[00:20:00]
that's still lies in the ownership realm with the board even though the board might not be able to prioritize that now if the superintendent when she goes out to determine how are we going to reach whatever goals you all have decided and honor whatever values and guard rails and goes on a strategic Community listening Endeavor to understand more what what the community and what stakeholders want in the how we get there then and she hears that we want multiple languages for students to in a customer service around 3:00 strategy around so when it comes to the board

[00:21:00]
but the questions are going to be different also the board is going to be seeking that owner information when you go out on these listening campaigns superintendent in the how type of information if the superintendent chooses to engage the community thank you yes in this particular case I think to bring it back to our work here in Albuquerque how would you suggest tying it I mean it's me as an opportunity to teach about our particular gold which is number three post secondary Readiness so if somebody came with the idea of having multiple languages for

[00:22:00]
being ready for a global economy that it would that would speak to your goal particularly our interim goals which we've recently I think we are I certainly have realized that we need to do a better job about informing or reporting back to the community about so in this particular case if someone raises the issue of language it's an opportunity for us to address or to teach about report back about how we have we were looking to increase the number of recipients in bilingual seals so

[00:23:00]
now I hear what you're saying so I think I think when there are education opportunities for the board to do that and I use this scenario this is kind of a generic scenario I use so the fact that it actually relates to one of your interim goals that I wasn't expecting that and probably should have but I I think that that using that as an educational opportunity I think the board being able to communicate with the community around what your goals are and how they're being measured and how that relates I think that is I think that is a point at which you could use that for an educational opportunity and then just letting them know that that is something that the board monitors as part of as part of that you do it in a public public space

[00:24:00]
and point them to the meetings and where the the past monitoring reports or whatever it is that would help educate them and what is already happening is that responsive to your question yes yes yes yes yes thank you thank you for bringing that up yeah go ahead so if we had someone say in the long term for us to be successful in a global economy we need to make America as strong as it can be and the best way to make America strong as it could be is to focus on America First and English only and so we need to get rid of all of the other languages that's still a long-term it is perspective but I think so that's kind of

[00:25:00]
I mean that is just the nature of the of the community I mean there's going to be different different ideas there's just going to be different leanings different all sorts of different opinions out there and you might hear the scenario that I brought up about yes we need to have more languages or you might hear the we need English only and

[00:26:00]
and that's that's that the board when you're listening and doing your listening based on and you're going to have it'll be very important to have questions that are open-ended but they still might yield those types of responses your job in that moment is to just take that information down and they got it so you believe that we should only have English in our schools or whatever it is neither agree or disagree but then when that all of that information comes back what the board does is there's it's not looked at in a vacuum first of all the feedback or the input that you received from your community listening will

[00:27:00]
synthesize such that common themes might come forward and then additionally you're also going to be looking at that information not on its own but along with student performance data and other information that you have as board members in order to make those priority in order to prioritize what it is that you do with it so yeah you might you might hear those things and those might still be owner issues and and in the long term this is what we want to see for students 10/20 years old and then those short-term immediate transactional I can see where those can also be the same like stop stop teaching right at the moment but again that's if it's coming as a customer

[00:28:00]
Edward Administration and is that responsive to your question what I think the the point that I think you're trying that you're trying to make and I think that Danielle is also trying to make is that there are instances where we are individuals but that when we work as a board we are one entity so even though we are all sitting here with varying views when we are acting in our when we are acting as a board those thoughts biases political leanings

[00:29:00]
whatever have to be put aside for what the collective Community is telling us and so I think what Daniel was trying to say is we as board members have to be cognizant of when we are individuals Courtney Jackson at the grocery store and when I'm a board member and how my my words and my you know what I say can be interpreted that even here's an example I'm a parent too right so when I go into my kids school I have to be very cognizant of I have my parents had on today even though everybody knows that I'm a board member right so you have to be we have to be very particular about understanding how we work collectively as a board and leave our

[00:30:00]
individual concerns out of it I think is what yeah yeah and I think that I think that your scenario of being both a parent and a board member and understanding Which hat you're wearing when you are walking into your child's school and that's important although be cognizant that you will always have your board member hat on as far as anybody else and that that it is hard to ever take off that board member hat and and being cognizant as well while we are individuals just just understanding what the what the consequence even of our individual you know whatever

[00:31:00]
where are social media posts whatever we do could have could have that could be behaviors that make it harder for our school system to be successful so could you give us an example of I mean it strikes me that are are best response but I'm trying to formulate it is to go back to what you know the goals in the guard rails that the 2000 community members so even if we're getting these questions how what kind of answer could you give that redirects that reflects the view that you know we should only be teaching we should have an English

[00:32:00]
play approach reflecting back that sentiment yes I heard you and in the you know in 5 years we're going to revisit these goals and I mean that's that's where my brain is going and in 5 years or maybe three more years we will revisit the goals in the guard rails and we look forward to you at that point so I think that noting reflecting back I hear that you are wanting no other languages taught whatever the time and and saying you know we are both hearing what they're saying and also letting them know

[00:33:00]
what it is that this information is informing and how it's being used or how it has been used is is always a good way to close that communication Loop and to be transparent about you know right now we're going out where we're informing you whatever the purpose of the community engagement is that you're doing whether it is to to reaffirm and educate about the goals and girls that you already have to hear if there's any major transition and Community Vision and values whatever it is to be transparent about how you plan to use the information whether it be will we are noting this and in three years will be revisiting it or these are this is you know input that we are continuously collecting

[00:34:00]
please continue watch us monitor the goals and guardrails that we have whatever that end is that you have for your community listening that goal that you have for your community listening being very transparent with the community up front about what you plan to do with the information and not only telling them what you plan to do with it but then going back and closing that Loop to say here's what we heard and here's what we've done or haven't done with that information is important thank you for that question oh any questions before we continue we want to wait

[00:35:00]
okay sounds good the other piece just to I want to mention is that having that distinction distinguishing between customer and owner service and behavior and the board being seated and and keeping that mindset of owner service versus customer service lens to that cycle of accountability if I as a board member decide that I'm going to do customer service then the accountability I'm I'm searching myself and or bored whether I'd be a board member or the board does it in search themselves into that customer service and then the accountability being able to hold

[00:36:00]
the superintendent accountable that that also is you risk that ability oh and I think I think this version of the cycle of accountability meeting there was a statement that I want to spend a little time with because I think this is I am I don't think I mentioned I know I didn't mention today I am a former board member and know how tricky and sticky

[00:37:00]
this can be because we are often we are very much servant minded and so it can be it can be hard the prioritization representing through prioritization can be difficult but the statement I wanted to bring up was that the board cannot act nor should they end every interest of the community but the board can and should act in the interest of the community distinction and communicate so I think that also speaks to that idea of those competing interests and conflicting interests that the board is going to need to prioritize and represent not individual interest but the interest of the Community Robert Community what does that statement mean to any of you

[00:38:00]
when you see that what does it mean to you honestly that is a statement of relief that because I think when your first elected you think I have to do everything that everybody in my community asks me to do I have to show up to everything I have to represent their interests I have to go to the superintendent with absolutely everything that I ever hear but once you become comfortable in your role as to what the board does and what's superintendent does that statement kind of gives you the authority to say you know I represent the community as a whole it doesn't mean that you are you individual that what you're bringing to me is an important but I will act as the conduit to help you get where you need to go so

[00:39:00]
yeah so you find it to be a relief that you don't that it relieves some of the stress of having to bring everything forward or be that everything for everyone and it requires me to have integrity in what my role is as a board member yeah right that's it's a requirement I have to be I have to understand what my role is and my role is a distinction well I think when I was originally elected on the board I probably thought this statement and or even running for office dot this is what our role was and or we were 100% wrong and knowing that and I'm thankful we were able to be guided on that early on really allowed us to be more precise and effective in the decisions were making and

[00:40:00]
allow us to realize that we can't be everything to everyone and it allowed our Focus to be much more precise because before it was it was wild the emails the phone calls and now I'm just like oh no you need to go I have the student center right there pulled up for you so it's a really yeah so I don't I think that that's not uncommon to come on to the board thinking this is what you are meant to do but yeah the the ability to communicate that as an end to understand it as a board member and does allow the ability to bring Focus to the work that you do need to do and I heard relief I think again yeah well I was working more hours on school board than my regular paying job and that was

[00:41:00]
expectation from the entire community of something totally different it's not just that we had an expectation it's at the expectation that the community has an expectation and indeed I think our predecessors in the seat before you would do this like just the sequencing of the training of the community is hard because I feel like if we could have found

[00:42:00]
I think that would help yes the front front loading that and now moving forward as you continue to work you know in your next steps of the work that you are doing going through that going toward that face for looking at the community engagement calendar that you've adopted the purpose for your face for engagement and really focusing in on it is a constant it is a constant cycle of educating the community because the community again the community is big and fast and when you think about the people who you know every year you're going to have more people cycling in who are interested for various reasons

[00:43:00]
since I mean that that can be the nature of Education anyway you have a whole new crew of of parents every year who might be coming on and and starting to pay attention and it's yeah the education the learning and unlearning for the community is constant so I think you have an opportunity to really lean into helping them understand as you go into these next phases what the board is and does it and and and and the community you know generally speaking it might not be coming to community members who do not like it but that's okay it's the communication

[00:44:00]
in the transparency of it and if you're consistent and and staying within your role as board members then that transparency and trust is actually built on a stronger Foundation than if you were pretending that you could do things do everything for everyone and being yes people to to those those folks and doing the what we refer to as super well and I think yes it's hard however at the end of the day what our community asked us to do was that right where the goals and what I think is going to happen and I'm I'm 99% sure what's going to happen is that they've asked us to do that so if we can stay strong in our understanding of

[00:45:00]
monitoring and and staying on that the goals are going to start we are going to start to hit the goals and yes there's going to be people that there's always going to be that 10% of people that you're just not going to make happy no matter what but once we start achieving those goals the broader Community is going it's going to click for them of oh there's been chaos for 35 years but now suddenly we're clicking towards our goals and our students are actually achieving maybe what the board is doing is better and so but the hard part is it becomes incumbent upon us as seven individuals in a massive Community to stand strong and say no this is what my job is and believe me you want me to be focused here you don't want me to seeing

[00:46:00]
at such-and-such elementary school that's not where you want my focus now I really appreciate your your comment that it is incumbent on the board to lean into and then the rest of that teaching our community and reiterating exactly what board member Jackson said anytime I clarify what are role is people appreciate it they do as long as I'm leaving with you know the goals in the guard rails I think we're running into a little bit of trouble is with the guard rails I think that surface

[00:47:00]
in a recent conversation amongst ourselves and so I'm more deliberate about that now but I think that needs some tweaking and some real conversation on this board about how to how to teach that piece of it because we've got five guard rails and I believe remind me superintendent Dr Blakey do they each have two interim I don't know period stay focused on you know what we're doing but again leaning into how

[00:48:00]
explain we don't tell I don't tell people that's not my job it's it's more like have a hand out and and this is superintendent's work this is a board work taken from our governance manual but it's again just I think people appreciate the clarification and it depends on how it's delivered but they appreciate it they appreciated I have yet to get back but yeah so that Clarity is Clarity is and and people do I think that that is something that

[00:49:00]
General community members clarification is appreciated who else what anything else about this this statement or this board and individual board members being very mindful of what their role is that's their engaging because a lot of the community engagement that you're going to be doing is bored bored bored engagement more about the components of successful board engagement but there are always going to be times where you're interacting with stakeholders as individuals and you know keeping that Clarity around

[00:50:00]
the board decisions have made it's that one voice principle the board the board speaks with one voice the message is the same once a decision is made is made and so be mindful of that is really helpful that said I do think it would help to have the board and board members of the community cuz I think we we think we all think it's not as an individual number and we also think like oh yeah for sure it's a whole board we're doing this but when you actually think about it as a member I think it is pushes us more to think about our own responsibility yeah that's a that's I appreciate that point so as board members also yeah that understanding that the board I am an individual but the board is this is the work that the

[00:51:00]
what is determined and this is the work that we are moving forward with and I and board members and that's a that one voice principal about moving forward with the decisions of the board even if I didn't agree with it that is a critical governing principle so that it also Fosters that trust among community members it because if they're still different messaging and if there's any any even if it's unintentional where I am still iterating you know I've I on the board voted against something but the majority voted differently whatever it is and and then I'm still out there relocating my own opinion even though the board is spoken that that

[00:52:00]
I've witnessed it I've been a part of that as a board member where it is not helpful and it actually while I might be making I might be the I'm using this in my own experience I'm replaying my own video I was the hero to a small group of folks and I really undermined forward progress for the entire District because I I didn't I continue to not support the voice of the board so that I'm just having a momentary in word reflection right now on a Time many years ago but that yeah so I think it's important that you do say it because it has happened as of recent you know and and for me it's important

[00:53:00]
can't that we address to not just say the right thing when we're all together but we truly do the right thing when we're operating in our communities and in meetings and personally that's where I've seen the biggest disconnect and I struggle when people say the right thing in a meeting and for the sake of getting through this training and I'll be honest it bothers me all seven of us aren't here I'll say that out for everybody because it was extremely difficult for me personally to make it to be here and I feel like this type of training is beneficial for everybody to take apart and especially because we are living community engagement as we speak this is really what we're doing and many times what is being communicated outside of that it is not cohesive to what the board has decided as a whole and I just want to be clear cuz

[00:54:00]
and I know this is our first interaction my style has always been I just kind of say truly truly how I feel and I don't want to sugarcoat things and and say oh yeah we're all on the same page when the reality is we're not and we've had this training before and to know that we're repeating it again I'm like okay guys we really need to do what we're supposed to be doing and not have our own interpretation or based on who's in front of us the what we're saying is changing so just yeah so one of the things that I mentioned it to Christy and I'll say it out loud here since this is streamed I'd imagine there will be a video what my recommendation is going to be for the board members who were not able to

[00:55:00]
is that they watch watch the video and then follow up with me and or Ashley afterwards just to make sure that everyone is that they have the same understanding that you all will come away with and and just to follow up on any any questions that they might have and weren't here today answer or to have answered or ask for things are definitely more effective when the entire governing body can be here and absent that will try to catch Folks up but it is it is critically important that and that one voice that is not one voice principal is that is what I would call a universal government governing principal

[00:56:00]
it's not unique to student outcomes Focus governance not unique to Albuquerque Public Schools it is it is a an aspect of effective governance because you all actually I would imagine there is law on the books code on the books that you operate as a body corporate or body politic and in order to do that that is the way that you know once the board the board is it's not individual board members the board has spoken and so individual board members of making statements or having conversations that conflict with the decision of the board just as is not helpful and doesn't doesn't make the

[00:57:00]
it's not an efficient body corporate action or behavior I want to go back to what you said earlier about trust because I think that's the biggest thing that helped me with this quote is coming in there was a lot of changes but I wanted to make just because I think you know what I saw that needed and being able to really look through that and understand that it's a partnership between the superintendent and the school board member was really important because you hear a lot like you can tell the superintendent what to do right but understanding that that is a person with the expertise has helped me a lot and just decision-making and what it looks like is you when we're working as a board and we're all getting the same information and being able to really dissect that in a way that it's not just for this community or not just for my schools right it's the whole District so that has been very helpful where it's not just I'm your boss or I'm the owner it's

[00:58:00]
the partnership or we have to work together to make sure that we are making those long-term goals because you are the governing team so the collaboration and the collaborative aspect is is important because as the board you are the you are the community experts and as the superintendent you are the educational expert educational and operational expert and so that collaboration informing each other and having that dialogue and whatnot is that that type of leadership stability even if there are points of disagreement maintaining some sort of stability as far as the type of interactions you have it also is a so the board is a culture setting body even more so than a policy setting body what happens in the boardroom is echoed in the classroom so how you be

[00:59:00]
with each other how you behave with your superintendent is what what you can expect to see reflected all the way throughout the organization and into the classroom so if if people are watching like I haven't I don't know what the stats are on your meetings and the the viewership but typically across the country and I would imagine it was would be fairly true here who watches your meetings what is what is the largest group fast yeah so and I think I think you wouldn't want you wouldn't want your the way you want your students treated by their teachers is is the way you all want

[01:00:00]
you want your superintendent and how you are treating each other here to be modeled you want to be like that that culture culture study model yeah to Philadelphia has implications for the superintendent and her ability to do her job and when we criticize a board Vote or the outcome of the process of the vote or the information that we received her to a vote that is criticism of this or can be perceived that I think is criticism of the district in the superintendent and and can have real implications and so I think we all need to agree that going forward we won't have situations in which

[01:01:00]
three of us go before a community group with a PowerPoint with all of our complaints about past votes like we just can't do that we do have to agree like to stick to this for the sake of our superintendent and her job so that she can get the job the goal is done yeah and what I would say what I would say to that is if this work is about being effective right on behalf of your students and and there are some behaviors that are going to help that and there are some behaviors that are going to harm that just like the guidance that we had way at the beginning what I would say is that that forward-looking and solution driven

[01:02:00]
re litigating passport decisions relocating what information you were given use that to inform you know using that to inform the future as a board is is acceptable I would say but I think I think we litigating it and especially relocating it in the public could be could be a harmful thing and and I think that there are species that you all could create not to relocate but to understand how the board is going to operate moving forward and and to ensure that you that the board is getting the information that it needs the board is because you're a body a governing body and and only the board has the authority

[01:03:00]
okay so again just to just to recap a little bit about making the distinction about not acting on every Community interest and then in turn acting in the interest of the community just remembering that the board governs it doesn't manage and it allows that allows the superintendent and staff to handle those operational issues effectively and leverage their expertise and ability to respond and then it also ensures that issues are addressed at the point of service and and where their most effectively addressed or the board is the farthest from

[01:04:00]
day-to-day operations and from that point of service and so if a if a if a Community member has to come to a board member to have something have an issue resolved that's also an access thing like if I have if I can only get my issue resolved because I have access to a board member that is not that actually breeds inequity within the system it doesn't allow the system to respond and when the when those issues are directed to the most effective place that's a critical systems feedback mechanism so when issues are resolved by board members or individually for rather than at a systems level then the opportunity for the superintendent and staff to identify root causes or make widespread systems changes that

[01:05:00]
benefit the larger the entire District are lost so it's an opportunity cost thing there too and then again the the whole support of long-term stability that that sustainability and long-term strategy and and long-term Vision can really be undermined by reactive decisions made due to short-term pressure so the one thing and we talked about clarification of that of this and so I think some of the things as you go forward with your community it is again the board's responsibility to communicate these things so setting those clear expectations publicly

[01:06:00]
explaining what the board's governance role is versus the superintendent's management role using the board policy and procedure as a guide so whatever it is you've determined as far as that point of service or chain of command and how the board members are going to respond to individual concerns or constituent concerns that are not owner issues use that as your guide that's why you have it and then engaging transparently can still actively listen but explain the governance you brought that up and then educating that regular training for the community and on the government's best practices supposed to be nice to see your hands yes something you said just prompted a question for me and I think it had to do with

[01:07:00]
play The Board gets the info it needs so that that has I think that the lack of information on something that came before the board has has made things difficult on two issues but how how do we how do you view that how do you coach on that because if the board is going to vote on on the topic and for us it's charter schools and say cuz I'm going to give you specific so we don't dance around the issue so on Charter Schools we have to vote whether to

[01:08:00]
renew or introduce a new Charter to the district and not bored information so on on that in that vein if you'll indulge me a little bit of explanation how because the community comes to us and and says what you know why did you vote this way so how does a quandary there topics that come before our board for a vote how do we Bland everything that you have laid out for us and for me it's the goals in the guard rails right

[01:09:00]
and now it's more nuanced because it's the interims so how do we blend that I mean that's what I that's what I'm trying to do with it was right sizing and you know we're consolidating schools that we have to because enrollment but there's a misunderstanding about in the community I do want to make sure that we we stay on topic for your Sunshine laws and all of that in in respect to community engagement and and deciphering

[01:10:00]
call in various decisions whether they be customer service you know making that distinction between customer service and owner service I guess my general answer is making that also making that distinction between boardwalk and superintendent work so the boards work is the goals and the guard rails and whatever is legally required of them and even when if the board is required legally to vote on these Charters then having the information necessary to make that vote is important however the that is something and please correct me anybody superintendent if I'm wrong that is that

[01:11:00]
has been delegated to the superintendent to make those recommendations around closure non closure whatever whatever that topic is so to some degree it is upholding the superintendent's recommendations based on their alignment of resources toward toward accomplishing the goals and honoring the guard rails and then also to some degree if Community needs more clarification on the why that that too is can be a point them back to the to the point of service to the administrative information and and that why this decision is being made so that's just kind of a very general not knowing but the

[01:12:00]
the goals in the guard rails being that decision-making lens that the board uses and that the superintendent helps explain decisions to the degree possible or recommendations and then what was the other question I think I've was there another question that I wanted to touch on because I heard interim about the interim guard rails and one thing that just to remind everyone else are important for the board to know and to be able to communicate and to have an understanding of and that's that those are the pieces of information that you're monitoring

[01:13:00]
whether or not the superintendent is honoring those values that are protected by the guardrails the just and it's in the student outcomes Focus governance manual that the interim guard rails belong to the superintendent and and stand as their interpretation of the guard rails so the board doesn't change those and I'm not I don't know if you were suggesting that or not but I just that just know it's reporting it is what I'm getting as a reminder that often that yeah I often like to bring up as well yes I do want to say it just for clarity clarification helpful in your response to your explanation was correct me if I'm wrong that

[01:14:00]
for us it's a question of asking if the alignment of resources is happening in a way that honors goals and guardrails in whatever decision by which the board the board questions various recommendations and decisions that can be applied to the degree possible so I have a question that just came up for me when I was speaking with the Community member and they were unaware about the interim and the specificity of how superintendent interprets what that meant so in their mind it was like well she's not doing a good job because this is the

[01:15:00]
so I think it is important for board members to be able to at least say well we have this interpretation these are the interims and this is what we're following so that those confusions don't happen as well so yeah that's just something that I feel like needs to be shared yeah and that is something that you can definitely as you are in that phase four of your community engagement is share how that is how you are how the superintendent is measuring them that that's their interpretation and that is the evidence that they're bringing to show that they are honoring or are honoring the guard rails are pretty and protecting those values so it is communicating and helping the communicating them even though you don't own them but communicating them as this is how we are checking in along the way yep and making sure that

[01:16:00]
Kohl's in guardrails aren't just in a binder somewhere Gathering dust and are pretty statements that we said we were going to say any other any questions before we continue on so in preparing for your community engagement and Outreach sessions aspects of creating a successful Community listening campaigns first they're led by board members why not staff why does it matter that their lead by board members because we're the ones that are listening actively listen

[01:17:00]
the board actively listens for the vision and values of the community anyone else why why does this matter crucial that we're getting feedback and insight from our community members and it gives us an opportunity to have those two-way conversations that we're not able to have in the boardroom yeah yeah so it actually gives board members the opportunity to have the two-way conversations staff cannot have them on their behalf of it's a different conversation of stuff is having it and it is the if you are actually going to represent the vision of values of the community you actually have to do the listening now having a representative community of owners what does this mean

[01:18:00]
and how does it happen so we just actually had a community engagement at hoc committee meeting and this was actually brought up by the superintendent and it's an excellent point and we have to make sure that when we go out to the community that we are going to the whole community that we're not just spending our time in the schools because to superintendent's point was it's not just the schools it's not just the staff it's not just the parents that are directly affiliated with the schools it's all about Albuquerque and so it's crucial that when we're doing these engagement and Outreach events that we are representative of a broad base not just not just those that are easiest to get to did I accurately

[01:19:00]
yeah so ensuring that you're getting representation at your listening sessions from the whole Community not just schools not just certain segments but representing if you're going to represent the you know this is a public school system if you're going to be able to represent you do need to have that broad broad reach and not just those that are easy to access or folks that are easy to access so how does that happen who's responsible for doing that for making sure that happens we are not the staff know you are not the staff not Christy so so if the board gets done listening and says

[01:20:00]
group XYZ wasn't included What whose responsible for the board decides who the community is the board decides who who they are out reaching and engaging and only the board can do that so be intentional be thorough do as much as you possibly can and order to ensure that you are getting some some representation from you know you're not going to get what's the population of not going to get everybody but getting that representative group yes so this is so so let me turn the

[01:21:00]
question around a little bit then what is the appropriate role of staff for Community engagement so I think I think the staff could play a supporting role in in you know if you need locations in some of that logistical stuff you're clearly going to need to if you wanted to have a meeting here you're going to need to have stuff help you organize and do all the logistical things for this I think there are some of those things that can be done by staff however whatever whatever is typical of your staff support it's the main the main piece or pieces that are the boards responsibility

[01:22:00]
play are making that decision about who it is that they're including who's being included and how they're going to reach them and then actually doing the listening and not having not advocating that responsibility to staff to go and do it on your behalf so I would just say that we do have a guardrail around use of Staff time so just being so making sure we're sticking to that too and I know Courtney has a point I just wanted to acknowledge that we're at the about 30 minutes Mark and just see how we're doing in terms of content versus time yeah so I was just going to kind of put an exclamation point on what you said the the role of the staff should really just be basically Logistics the role of the board is getting people to the events reaching out to people in your community doing the

[01:23:00]
the advertising making the calls reaching out to other people that what we are lucky to have is a diverse group of board members I can go to Janelle if I need to maybe to hear let's be blunt a different side of the political Spectrum right if I want to hear that which I probably need to hear and to Janelle's credit she's come with me right so we have to reach out to each other as well to say I'd really like to go in here so but again that is my job to do and so that's the exclamation point yeah thank you thank you for clarifying that and that you do have a guardrail on use of Staff time and that is often have the work to be done is for staff to be very minimal in the necessary logistical you know

[01:24:00]
words are hard today it's the altitude thank you thank you I'm glad I have I needed an excuse but yeah getting the rooms reserved reservations reserving the rooms that's the word I was looking for that was a hard word for me to reserve rooms or whatever it is but the the calling the reaching out all of that the board doing that work can be actually very can actually be very meaningful and and it's I think sometimes can become very appreciative of the staff and the work you know like what it takes to support a board but also I think the community on the fact that the board is actually digging in rolling up

[01:25:00]
I think that that also communicate something to your community as well this time I mean are we talking about School site staff as well because I mean if we're trying to get to in our case the first two goals require a lot of well even the first three getting to a very diverse group right and School site staff have are critical piece in that so I'm clear you're talking about wanting to make sure we're building levels staff might

[01:26:00]
come to a listening session or I'm I'm saying does Jeff when we measure staff time does that do we include site yeah I mean how I would recommend that that site leveling away from actually serving kids accomplishing goals honoring guard rails so that would be included in that stuff I think unless there is something that I'm missing here I think that working in collaboration with the superintendent around and I think my microphone keeps going out with this collaborating with

[01:27:00]
play superintendent around any site-based needs you would have if there's if you had to have a session at a school or whatever I think I think working that out in that respect would be the best bet and so and so what I'm hearing is there's an opening here for I mean the implication is that we would not want to access schools for engagement to minimize that to minimize staff time imposing on them but then it means also that if we're going to go outside of schools and what draws what draws parents what I've noticed

[01:28:00]
what draws parents is if their kids are performing if they're somehow part of the engagement otherwise we're left what I'm hearing is that we've got to explore community centers libraries as options for Community engagement I think those are things that you can explore I think my point around the I don't think that if I'm understanding your guard rail correctly around staff time it's not that you can't can't you stop time it's just to minimize use of Staff time to the degree possible and then I think anything at a building level the superintendent is your conduit toward anything that might need to happen if you were to have something at

[01:29:00]
at a school you know if you determine that you needed to have have something for example at a school in each region or whatever in order to draw the draw folks or in conjunction with something else I mean I think all of that can happen but just be mindful of your staff time use guard rail and then always your point of contact is always the superintendent as far as any other staff and that yeah and I'm guessing this is all these are all things that you'll be talking about as you move forward with next steps in community engagement is that accurate clarify okay is that helpful hostina yes great okay so then we talked about board members working in pairs why does this matter

[01:30:00]
why would we want that or why would that be the most effective way to go about it if you're by yourself you're in Bad Company by yourself you're in Bad Company and to us and you're you're not listening to what they're telling you through your your own filter you have somebody else there to also listen and comprehend and you know gather what is being said to you so you have two people there it's it's a good balance and it amplifies the two-way communication that is important and is missing when the public just shows up to our meetings yeah

[01:31:00]
you mentioned and helps to actually be able to gather more of the information and it helps to provide the balance in you know one of you might be asking the questions the other might be noting the answers it just is helps with a little bit of division of labor but also capturing the listening doing the listening at your it helps to do the listening that you're out to do the other thing and this and you to kind of brought it up when you talked about sometimes you might go to she might call you to come to her District or vice versa what we often recommend is that you do spend time in districts that are not your own in the river on Monday

[01:32:00]
who do you represent as a board just your individual District yeah so if I spend all my time in my own district do I have any idea of what you know have I spent the time to really engaged with and have have the benefit of personally hearing from the rest of the folks and the rest of the community that I'm also here to represent that is an important an important piece and while I as a board member from a district can bring concerns it is you know of constituents in my district it is much more meaningful for other board members to

[01:33:00]
it helps you can help each other stay on script and that system that systemwide Focus that was right before that that the whole idea of going into other districts that are not our own that helps helps bring it to that system wide Focus versus what's happening in our own segment of of the Electoral District I guess so what is the common script with specific questions

[01:34:00]
matter why would we want that one again okay so I think two things and I'm just going off of like what what we have done so we have absolutely always worked off of a common script with with specific questions and it helps because that makes sure that no matter where we are in the city we're asking the same questions to receive the same set of feedback and so it's it's a it's a nice way of knowing that things aren't things aren't being changed based on where you are in the city now one thing that I've noticed is so we just did a smaller event where we did District level events where there were seven of us

[01:35:00]
now to our own individual now the thought behind that was kind of you know make it your own however I think what happened with make it your own is it really became make it your own right and so the the premise behind it was we need to go out and hear from our community what be that be the vessel to receive information from our community was the premise behind it so that at each district level we could then give that information to the superintendent and to the board right to your point of I know very well what is going on in district 7 but I might not know what is going on in District 5 and so it's my responsibility to report back however if we're not all using if we're not all asking the same questions and we're not working off of a common scripts the information that's going to come back is going to be disjointed and might not

[01:36:00]
silly be the information that the superintendent needs to know does she need to Pivot does she need like it's it's not helpful to the to the superintendent for with the work that she's doing every single day it's not helpful to the board to really understand what's going on with the community as a whole yeah yeah so doing that and I I hear the intent behind it behind the make it your own and and hearing from Individual districts the intent was was a positive one for sure the impact probably less effective than what you intended but you gave it a whirl and now you are now you are continuously improving but yeah to your point when when you're not asking the same questions not giving the same information Baseline information to receive communication back then that disjointedness happens there's

[01:37:00]
not away necessarily to synthesize that information to make a meaningful next step or what needs to happen next from here because there isn't it's all over the place or they might have asked they might have answered a question in even just the you know how how a question is asked can really you might think you're asking the same question like the way different response in one and one place then another and it's so it's important to it might seem really or whatever but there's a consistency is important both for how it's received and how different segments of the

[01:38:00]
how do you feel that they have been asked to participate and what you want it to do you want everyone to have the same opportunity to participation but then also on that back end of what you're able to do with the information and how useful it is so having having like following the same script is really really helpful in that sophina Josefina so this is precisely I mean we're still in continuous Improvement mode and I think Community engagement is one area where we need to tighten up and to get really specific about the purpose I think that's the next step for for this board is getting super specific about what

[01:39:00]
what are those questions it would be helpful for all of us to have that have input first of all as to what questions we want to ask how we want to ask them what information would be helpful like we know that interims have got to be a topic for clarification when we talked about board work versus superintendent superintendent work and so yes we we need to do a better job of choreographing our community outreach or excuse me because for us Community engagement has in the past month we go out in pairs community outreach is a different protocol and I think it would be helpful to have

[01:40:00]
that in writing and I and maybe Town Halls are yet something else but but Clarity right and details yeah so are part of our continuous Improvement and I think as you worked word whatever that scripting is going to be just like in your initial going out the board's initial going out to the community that there can be support with some of that script and getting the input from all of the numbers and and I mean having that clear concise and the understanding there for all board members

[01:41:00]
and let's see and then finally the idea of frequency doing it at least twice a year you know keeping that Cadence Cadence going said that the the community can take ownership for one thing of goals and guardrails and has the opportunity to be heard and that you all have the opportunity to for that continuous communication about about goals and guard rails and about the boards work and governance work and having a mechanism for feedback is critical so that when you are collecting the feedback but also your closing that feedback loop letting the community know what you heard what you're doing with that information just that constant two-way communication feedback loop

[01:42:00]
and then the final thing on there is avoiding election Cycles as you get ready part of part of engaging with the community and doing that education piece is candidate doing candidate pre-boarding sessions candidate training sessions what we usually recommend is that anybody who's going to be on the ballot not not be present at those as board members just because that's something that I've gone through where when I've been on the ballot I was not a part of the of the community training if I wanted to be there I was a candidate not a board member but being very cognizant of that as well any questions about any other questions about these bullet

[01:43:00]
lights in front of you it's not a question but real quick in the definition of Engagement and outraged it does say that engagement and outreach are about the communities vision and values so we just have to remember it's about board work yeah that's not here like it doesn't say hear that it's about vision of values and board work and so I think that's really important too that we're not going out and doing community engagement about superintendent work right so yep that's a good point and that's something that we can add to the bullets but yes the board engagement engagement with any Community or stakeholders is about work so thank you for making that distinction and there are no other questions I know we have 10 minutes left it looks like maybe just a little over I guess did you want to speak

[01:44:00]
so what I handed out was a community engagement at hot committee review I created a like a process review for what the community engagement ad hoc committee has done and this committee has been in existence for about 2 years now and so I just kind of went back to look at what we've done what we've accomplished are we aligning with the documents from the student comes Focus governance documents been so just kind of just wanted to kind of touch on that and so just in the sense of what has worked I think what has worked really well is we have established now standardized events that have become part of the Apsos that these

[01:45:00]
things that we're going to be doing routinely so one of them for example is the superintendent's now annual state of the district address that was created by the board in conjunction with the superintendent so that we are going out and you know having those transparent conversations we've adopted and we already have a two-year Community engagement calendar one thing that's coming is that calendar is going to be ending so we need to adopt and a new year calendar moving forward that will be coming in April and I think another thing that has worked well as we've had committee membership rotation so while the chair which is me has remained constant we've had committee board members rotate through as committee members as the way to kind of continue to bring fresh perspective and I think probably one of the biggest thing that we've done is we've created committee goals

[01:46:00]
put a line with our board goals and this goes to the conversation that we've been having about really making sure that we're not engaging those people that are easiest to access that were engaging people and bringing people to these events that really we need to hear from if we're going to to make to make our goals so the committee has three goals as not as committee members like I should say that it's not the three people that sit on the committee that are responsible for this but the whole board agreed that this that the that we were going to work towards those so I think those are some things that have worked really well some of the challenges that I see just in my review is that we are still having a hard time balancing structure and board member preferences so and I'll just read it creating a process that accommodates all seven board members while maintaining

[01:47:00]
consistency has been difficult and I think I alluded to is the district Town Halls is probably the most recent example of that is that we have seven different personalities but we need to have some consistency and we've talked about this staff involvement what really is the level of Staff involvement that is required or necessary we are tracking is still a little off we have a few different tracking documents we probably need to consolidate those but there really is a question of who's responsible for tracking their involvement is it me is the chair probably not it probably should be each board member responsible for tracking their involvement and then this is what we're just talking about clarifying Community engagement versus community outreach and there is still confusion about the distinction between these two concepts even though Community engagement community outreach

[01:48:00]
are those specific definitions have been on every single document that we've sent out so it it's but they're still there still some confusion about that and then as far as next steps are concerned the training and retraining of our roles and responsibilities I'm thinking that today definitely was just another another retraining on what are our roles what are our responsibilities we need to make sure that we understand our differences between customer and owner and and you've already alluded to this but we this is on our implementation calendar that we are going to host intensive training sessions for future School Board candidates to ensure alignment with board governance policies so we have that on our calendar already as a board to do that but this process doesn't work unless those new people coming on

[01:49:00]
really like not just and I think you know I'm looking at her butt like you guys had a introduction but you didn't have a training as to what it really was and so we need intense training before you even come on to the board the we do have we're going to have two Regional Town Halls that are coming in March where we're going to do what you know use the common script with specific questions and this is where we're going to really focus on this is our opportunity not only to talk about our progress towards goals but also to use this again as an opportunity of this is what the board does this is what superintendent does I've already talked about we have we will have a two-year engagement coming to the board in April the meeting minutes whenever we've had a a meeting the agenda

[01:50:00]
this has been linked so anybody who wants to read what we've been doing it's actually been in probably the last few months worth of at a glance so that's all there but we will continue to do that and I spoke to this earlier but we do need to really work on broadening our community involvement Beyond APS staff and families and some of the ways that we've already started working on that is with Partnerships with outside organizations and I do want to take this opportunity to thank and highlight Dion's yes Janelle is is she's got her little name tag I want to thank Dion's because first of all they have made names for all of us so that when we go out to events we have we are recognized as board members they have also very generously given us a stack of Dion's gift cards that we can use at our engagement events as giveaways

[01:51:00]
very generously offered the use of their facilities so that when we want to have Community engagement events we can do it at Dion's and that is another way that we're not you know parking ourselves in schools and getting the same people were really reaching out to a brighter broader community so thankful to Diane's for doing that and I think that is a quick review of the community engagement at heart committee thank you if I could just add to finer so we had initially discussed having a conversation amongst the board around how we want to specifically implement this going forward but didn't have the time within this training so what number Jackson describes a two-year engagement will be presented to the board in April it'll be presented to the board will have opportunity for board discussion feedback input everything and then we're putting it to a vote in May so may I can't remember the dates it's like April 6th

[01:52:00]
18th April 2nd and 4th meeting and then may is the vote but those are scheduled on upcoming board agenda so there will be time for lots of input but will come in with the recommendation from the committee the other thing is that per our implementation timeline we do have a task to in panel and ad hoc committee to develop a robust process for training and onboarding new board members prior to being sworn in and so we will also empowered committee that will be different from this community engagement committee to develop that so that will be forthcoming also that happened but primarily prime before they file so that's for the committee to discuss and determine the question was before they file what we are thinking is yes because our filing deadline is so late

[01:53:00]
August 14th or something so it sounds like sounds like this community engagement ad hoc committee review and steps moving forward or there's going to be ample opportunity for board members for you all to talk about it board members to weigh in before anything moves forward and then a new ad hoc around the candidate training so it sounds like sounds like you have some definite plans for next step to move the work or word and just before we end today if you would if we can just go around and what is one Insight or take away from today's discussion that you will apply to your role as a board member

[01:54:00]
or as a superintendent we will go first I think after this training I realized that we are doing a lot of good things already and we're on track and as a board member I think my biggest thing is sticking to the script and really focusing on how we make an impact as a district to actually provide feedback that is going to benefit the superintendent sticking to the script and finding a way to elicit feedback that will actually be helpful to the superintendent thank you just go around the horn okay so maybe not necessarily about today but as a larger self-reflection on this is as the chair

[01:55:00]
sometimes I think I completely understand what is happening and I think maybe some sorry I understand what I'm trying to communicate maybe it's not being communicated or not being heard in the way that I mean it to be communicated so I am going to make sure that as we move forward with some of the events and engagements that we have that I am maybe more specific about what the intent of the committee is using some of your reflection on how your own understanding and be more precise and specific with communication to the rest of the board so that they understand the intent of the committee thanks so much and I appreciate that we did it deviate from the plant

[01:56:00]
I was stressed me out so I appreciate that all of the content is still consistent its precise and we're still on track based on what we're doing and I appreciate the reminder yeah so consistent information and we're on track good reminder to stay on track I want to thank everyone who has previously or is currently serving on the community engagement at hoc committee which is 6 member so far so thank you all because collectively we're creating this work even though there is one chair so an opportunity for everyone to engage in provide feedback so thank you all for that and I think take away or a commitment that I have is just really thinking about accountability and shared responsibility I think how we collectively make sure that we as a board and I as an individual are doing what we said we would

[01:57:00]
thank you for that Collective responsibility but as a board but as an individual I am doing what I said I will do yeah let's go to Josefina and then we'll go to Dr Blakey oh you're on mute I take away from me is first providing a community engagement feedback to the superintendent that is helpful but it occurred to me we published or at least I published my feedback from the engagement

[01:58:00]
it would be helpful to hear and this is perhaps that our monthly meeting with Dr Blakey it's helpful to to us to to know what is health what from that feedback was helpful what was not right again just to tweak the process and just some final thoughts I think all of us and I mean all of us want to do this right and so we have a guardrail it's the very first one that board members and I'm talking about board guard rails that we should not make assumptions about what we're doing or not doing and I I would ask that we

[01:59:00]
what are you doing with your community engagement and and maybe debrief be part of thinking through helping each other to Think Through what we're doing rather than assuming what we're doing so important about not making assumptions and having the conversation rather than making assumptions to understand what's happening what's actually happening and and that's not to say that there won't be corrections but giving giving one another the benefit of the doubt about how we're doing our community engagement and I think

[02:00:00]
it sounds like that for a guardrail covers this and multiple things and then I think it sounds like also the the plans going forward for that consistency so there won't it'll be less of an issue but as far as how the community engagement that Clarity and consistency that you had mentioned before Josefina so thank you I appreciate the description of the difference between the owners and the customers because what I've been worried about with some of the community engagement is that it appears that the administration the board aren't working together so the boards going out to get information and then I do listen sessions to and so if you get too much information kind of what you I like what you said at the beginning if you get too much then you actually can't do anything with just a lot of information that's

[02:01:00]
so I appreciated the distinction between the superintendent getting feedback from the customers and the board getting feedback from the owners at a higher level of what I took away when you were talking is perceiving like themes that the board gets from their Outreach sessions and not like a task list of I went to this session and here's everything that this individual you know people want and so I think if we really work to distinguish that difference of the owners and the customers and the themes that the board brings me and the to-do list that I get from my own listening session when I go to schools I think would help us be able to address a lot of issues so continuing with that we're not Gathering too much but right we are gathering is beneficial I want to play
